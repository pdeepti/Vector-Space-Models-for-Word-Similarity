program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.07.2004 fashion 's high art hits a low großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bye-bye , haute couture : models applaud at hanae mori 's last show handcrafted luxury gowns are no longer en vogue : only eight paris fashion houses are participating in the current haute couture shows as demand for the unique creations has dropped over the past few years . fashion icon yves saint laurent once described haute couture as " whispered secrets passed on from generation to generation . "
he 's since pulled out of the business of selling deluxe dresses - just like many of his colleagues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yves saint laurent 's 2002 farewell show long gone are the days , when fabulously rich ladies ordered haute couture outfits by the dozen .
the value of brands is all that 's left of the " high art of tailoring . " " fashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months , " oscar wilde , the irish dandy and writer , remarked more than a century ago .
he was talking about prêt-a-porter collections , i.e. ready-to-wear , mass-produced clothing , for which haute couture remains the trend-setter . cheap advertising as a source of income , haute couture itself has become meaningless and only accounts for about 3 percent of revenues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : versace for the masses but the luxury lines are the perfect advertising gimmick : cosmetics , perfumes and accessories are sold by evoking the image of a brand 's star creations . " producing such a collection costs less money than a global advertising campaign , " said didier grumbach , president of the french fashion association , the federation francaise de la couture .
fashion houses still invest between € 500,000 -lrb- $ 617,000 -rrb- and € 2 million to put on a 20-minute haute couture show . those that keep doing it , that is : during its heydays in the 1950s , 23 paris fashion houses presented haute couture collections - soon only seven will be left : chanel , christian dior , christian lacroix , jean-paul gaultier , louis scherrer , dominique sirop and torrente . japanese fashion designer hanae mori , 78 , the first foreigner to be admitted into french fashion 's governing body , the chambre syndicale de la haute couture , showed her last collection on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-name bridal gowns at a wedding show " haute couture no longer responds to the needs of today 's women , " emanuel ungaro said when announcing his decision to drop designing luxury dresses and devote his entire attention to prêt-a-porter collections instead . a globalized fashion world ungaro is now longer his own master , anyway : back in 1996 , the italian fashion concern salvatore ferragamo - producer of luxury shoes , bags , accessories , watches and perfumes - had already taken over the brand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jennifer lopez is n't the only who likes louis vuitton bags christian dior , christian lacroix and givenchy on the other hand all belong to the world 's largest luxury conglomerate , lvmh -lrb- louis vuitton moet hennessy -rrb- , which still sells some haute couture in select boutiques .
the company 's revenues come mainly from the sale of wine , liquor , prêt-a-porter fashion and leather goods . hermes , synonymous with high-end accessories and perfumes , holds 35 percent of shares of jean-paul gaultier .
yves saint laurent has been taken over by sanoli .
jean-louis scherrer left his company after 30 years when seibu from japan took over . versace has also dropped haute couture for a pragmatic reason : after losses in 2002 , the company simply did n't have enough money to put on a show . balmain fashion house , founded in 1914 , is bankrupt but still hopes for a revival .
givenchy has nothing to offer , because the company is still looking for a successor for its former british chief designer , julien macdonald . faking it " the dress must not hang on the body but follow its lines , " madelein vionnet , grande dame of french fashion , once said about her work .
" it must accompany its wearer and when a woman smiles , the dress must smile with her . " haute couture remains unique and any standardization is strictly taboo : it 's fashion that beautifies drooping shoulders , hides crane-like necks and creates the perfect décolleté . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hennes & mauritz store in brussels but the luxury comes at a steep price : day dresses cost about € 15,000 , an evening gown starts at € 35,000 .
is it worth that ?
even the super rich have begun to get stingy and turn to small tailors who will copy the original for a fraction of the price . fashion discounters such as zara and h & m also look at the collections for inspiration .
grumbach of the federation francaise de la couture bemoans the development - but there 's very little he can do to keep it from happening . ingun arnold -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lagerfeld at h & m : couture goes to the mall haute couture demigod karl lagerfeld has announced he 's designing a line of clothing for the swedish cut-rate retailer hennes & mauritz , h & m. the german-born designer for chanel and fendi insists he 's not just slumming .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.07.2004 germans mull fifty-hour workweek großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions are fighting to keep a weekly work time of 35 hours in a move that will surely raise the hackles of germany ’ s labor unions , two leading economic and industry figures proposed introducing a 50-hour workweek as a means to reduce the country ’ s staggering unemployment rate . the suggestion is part of a reform debate in germany on how to cut costs to make the world ’ s third largest economy more competitive in the global market . the problem is two-fold .
germany is losing jobs to lower wage countries and consumers at home , who are either unemployed because of the job-drain or worried about losing work , are n't loosening their purse strings either . the result is devastating for the german economy , which has been more or less stagnant over recent years .
exacerbating the problem are pension and health reforms introduced by the social democrat-green party government which mean less money in retirement and higher healthcare costs for patients . the upshot is that germany has found itself in a vicious circle .
if it reduces government spending , taxpayers will have fewer services or have to pay more .
but with lower wages and an uncertain future , people will not be able to pay for the essential goods and services they need . will a longer workweek save jobs ? for literally years now , the question has been : how to solve this dilemma ?
the latest remedial suggestion comes from klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research and ulrich ramm , chief economist at germany ’ s third largest bank , commerzbank . both men have proposed introducing a 50-hour workweek to prevent even more jobs being exported to low-wage countries .
ramm said he thinks germany has room for more jobs , but they have to be affordable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high wages make production in germany more expensive than in other countries .
" i can see a realistic chance for discussion and we should perhaps work a bit more because in germany we have a lack of payable labor and it 's not the lack of labor overall , " he said . in ramm ’ s view , the 50-hour workweek would not be permanent : by establishing a work-hour account of up to 50 hours for peak production periods , when production slowed , employees could work 30 hours instead for the same pay , he said . michael hüther , director of the german economic institute , agreed with ramm ’ s assessment and argued for a generally more flexible workweek .
still others , like gerhard handke , from the german wholesale and foreign trade association , think workers should also give up a week ’ s vacation per year to make germany more competitive . handke pointed to ireland , where workers have just 20 days off a year , compared to six weeks in germany .
handke reduced the situation to a simple formula : you can not remain affluent and continue working less than everybody else . an " abstruse proposal " ? meanwhile , one of germany ’ s most prominent economists , peter bofinger , a professor at the university of würzburg and a member of germany ’ s prestigious group of economic advisers , known as the “ wise men , ” is opposed to a longer workweek .
he conceded that longer hours are good for business , but warns of dangerous deflationary pressures when consumer buying power declines : " working longer means there will be less purchasing power in the hands of workers and given that we have a problem with our domestic demand this problem will be aggravated , " he said .
" as the example of the japanese economy shows , if you reduce wages in a relatively large economy in order to boost employment , you get just the opposite effect . " bofinger , at least , can be sure of support from germany ’ s labor unions .
the head of the country ’ s construction and agriculture union , klaus wiesehügel , called the 50-hour week an " abstruse proposal " that would generate more unemployment . even the chairman of germany ’ s technology giant , siemens , heinrich von pierer , said that talk of a 50-hour week was not very helpful in the current climate and would make people more insecure . gregg benzow -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : the job market limps along the long-awaited and forever promised economic revival in germany is a major topic in the nation ’ s newspapers this wednesday .

" it 's not an unusual procedure that a state wants to collect taxes , " schröder said , according to a spokesman . some foreign investors fear the arrest of the company 's former head , mikhail khodorkovsky , which caused the russian stock market to tumble , was politically motivated . on wednesday , bailiffs moved in on the yukos main offices after a midnight deadline passed for the company to pay a $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.7 billion -rrb- tax bill from 2000 .
the move is likely to force the company into bankruptcy . schröder : germans confident about russia but schröder said putin 's economic reforms had strengthened confidence among german business leaders to invest in russia .

"
he 's since pulled out of the business of selling deluxe dresses - just like many of his colleagues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yves saint laurent 's 2002 farewell show long gone are the days , when fabulously rich ladies ordered haute couture outfits by the dozen .
the value of brands is all that 's left of the " high art of tailoring . " " fashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months , " oscar wilde , the irish dandy and writer , remarked more than a century ago .
he was talking about prêt-a-porter collections , i.e. ready-to-wear , mass-produced clothing , for which haute couture remains the trend-setter . cheap advertising as a source of income , haute couture itself has become meaningless and only accounts for about 3 percent of revenues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : versace for the masses but the luxury lines are the perfect advertising gimmick : cosmetics , perfumes and accessories are sold by evoking the image of a brand 's star creations . " producing such a collection costs less money than a global advertising campaign , " said didier grumbach , president of the french fashion association , the federation francaise de la couture .
fashion houses still invest between € 500,000 -lrb- $ 617,000 -rrb- and € 2 million to put on a 20-minute haute couture show . those that keep doing it , that is : during its heydays in the 1950s , 23 paris fashion houses presented haute couture collections - soon only seven will be left : chanel , christian dior , christian lacroix , jean-paul gaultier , louis scherrer , dominique sirop and torrente . japanese fashion designer hanae mori , 78 , the first foreigner to be admitted into french fashion 's governing body , the chambre syndicale de la haute couture , showed her last collection on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-name bridal gowns at a wedding show " haute couture no longer responds to the needs of today 's women , " emanuel ungaro said when announcing his decision to drop designing luxury dresses and devote his entire attention to prêt-a-porter collections instead . a globalized fashion world ungaro is now longer his own master , anyway : back in 1996 , the italian fashion concern salvatore ferragamo - producer of luxury shoes , bags , accessories , watches and perfumes - had already taken over the brand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jennifer lopez is n't the only who likes louis vuitton bags christian dior , christian lacroix and givenchy on the other hand all belong to the world 's largest luxury conglomerate , lvmh -lrb- louis vuitton moet hennessy -rrb- , which still sells some haute couture in select boutiques .
the company 's revenues come mainly from the sale of wine , liquor , prêt-a-porter fashion and leather goods . hermes , synonymous with high-end accessories and perfumes , holds 35 percent of shares of jean-paul gaultier .
yves saint laurent has been taken over by sanoli .
jean-louis scherrer left his company after 30 years when seibu from japan took over . versace has also dropped haute couture for a pragmatic reason : after losses in 2002 , the company simply did n't have enough money to put on a show . balmain fashion house , founded in 1914 , is bankrupt but still hopes for a revival .
givenchy has nothing to offer , because the company is still looking for a successor for its former british chief designer , julien macdonald . faking it " the dress must not hang on the body but follow its lines , " madelein vionnet , grande dame of french fashion , once said about her work .
" it must accompany its wearer and when a woman smiles , the dress must smile with her . " haute couture remains unique and any standardization is strictly taboo : it 's fashion that beautifies drooping shoulders , hides crane-like necks and creates the perfect décolleté . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hennes & mauritz store in brussels but the luxury comes at a steep price : day dresses cost about € 15,000 , an evening gown starts at € 35,000 .
is it worth that ?
even the super rich have begun to get stingy and turn to small tailors who will copy the original for a fraction of the price . fashion discounters such as zara and h & m also look at the collections for inspiration .
grumbach of the federation francaise de la couture bemoans the development - but there 's very little he can do to keep it from happening . ingun arnold -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lagerfeld at h & m : couture goes to the mall haute couture demigod karl lagerfeld has announced he 's designing a line of clothing for the swedish cut-rate retailer hennes & mauritz , h & m. the german-born designer for chanel and fendi insists he 's not just slumming .

germany is losing jobs to lower wage countries and consumers at home , who are either unemployed because of the job-drain or worried about losing work , are n't loosening their purse strings either . the result is devastating for the german economy , which has been more or less stagnant over recent years .
exacerbating the problem are pension and health reforms introduced by the social democrat-green party government which mean less money in retirement and higher healthcare costs for patients . the upshot is that germany has found itself in a vicious circle .
if it reduces government spending , taxpayers will have fewer services or have to pay more .
but with lower wages and an uncertain future , people will not be able to pay for the essential goods and services they need . will a longer workweek save jobs ? for literally years now , the question has been : how to solve this dilemma ?
the latest remedial suggestion comes from klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research and ulrich ramm , chief economist at germany ’ s third largest bank , commerzbank . both men have proposed introducing a 50-hour workweek to prevent even more jobs being exported to low-wage countries .
ramm said he thinks germany has room for more jobs , but they have to be affordable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high wages make production in germany more expensive than in other countries .
" i can see a realistic chance for discussion and we should perhaps work a bit more because in germany we have a lack of payable labor and it 's not the lack of labor overall , " he said . in ramm ’ s view , the 50-hour workweek would not be permanent : by establishing a work-hour account of up to 50 hours for peak production periods , when production slowed , employees could work 30 hours instead for the same pay , he said . michael hüther , director of the german economic institute , agreed with ramm ’ s assessment and argued for a generally more flexible workweek .
still others , like gerhard handke , from the german wholesale and foreign trade association , think workers should also give up a week ’ s vacation per year to make germany more competitive . handke pointed to ireland , where workers have just 20 days off a year , compared to six weeks in germany .
handke reduced the situation to a simple formula : you can not remain affluent and continue working less than everybody else . an " abstruse proposal " ? meanwhile , one of germany ’ s most prominent economists , peter bofinger , a professor at the university of würzburg and a member of germany ’ s prestigious group of economic advisers , known as the “ wise men , ” is opposed to a longer workweek .
he conceded that longer hours are good for business , but warns of dangerous deflationary pressures when consumer buying power declines : " working longer means there will be less purchasing power in the hands of workers and given that we have a problem with our domestic demand this problem will be aggravated , " he said .
" as the example of the japanese economy shows , if you reduce wages in a relatively large economy in order to boost employment , you get just the opposite effect . " bofinger , at least , can be sure of support from germany ’ s labor unions .
the head of the country ’ s construction and agriculture union , klaus wiesehügel , called the 50-hour week an " abstruse proposal " that would generate more unemployment . even the chairman of germany ’ s technology giant , siemens , heinrich von pierer , said that talk of a 50-hour week was not very helpful in the current climate and would make people more insecure . gregg benzow -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : the job market limps along the long-awaited and forever promised economic revival in germany is a major topic in the nation ’ s newspapers this wednesday .

the court ruled that he should be moved after doctors carrying out tests on him came to the conclusion he was suffering a mental illness . mijailovic would have gone to prison for 15 years , the normal term in sweden for those sentenced to life , but now he faces being placed in a psychiatric institute for criminals .

the hugely popular minister died of her injuries a day later . while the appeals court said that 25-year-old mijailovic was a " traumatized person with significant psychiatric problems " and needed psychiatric care , it did uphold the guilty verdict for the murder of lindh .
mijailovic 's legal team had hoped to have the charge reduced to manslaughter arguing that their defendant had not intended to kill the politician . lawyers called lindh 's murder " coincidence " lawyer peter althin had told the court mijailovic had heard voices telling him to attack lindh , but that they said nothing about killing her and added that the killing was an " impulsive act " and that it was a " coincidence " mijailovic 's victim was anna lindh . however , the court took a different view , ruling : " it has been proven that mijailo mijailovic was completely indifferent as to whether anna lindh would die of her stab wounds and he therefore had intent to kill .

the court ruled that he should be moved after doctors carrying out tests on him came to the conclusion he was suffering a mental illness . mijailovic would have gone to prison for 15 years , the normal term in sweden for those sentenced to life , but now he faces being placed in a psychiatric institute for criminals .
however , there are no time limits for psychiatric patients , and some experts say he could be set free in a matter of months if deemed healthy .
initial assessment labelled killer sane bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the time of his arrest , mijailovic was assessed for psychiatric problems but the initial assessment concluded he was not mentally ill when he stabbed lindh on sept .

the hugely popular minister died of her injuries a day later . while the appeals court said that 25-year-old mijailovic was a " traumatized person with significant psychiatric problems " and needed psychiatric care , it did uphold the guilty verdict for the murder of lindh .
mijailovic 's legal team had hoped to have the charge reduced to manslaughter arguing that their defendant had not intended to kill the politician . lawyers called lindh 's murder " coincidence " lawyer peter althin had told the court mijailovic had heard voices telling him to attack lindh , but that they said nothing about killing her and added that the killing was an " impulsive act " and that it was a " coincidence " mijailovic 's victim was anna lindh . however , the court took a different view , ruling : " it has been proven that mijailo mijailovic was completely indifferent as to whether anna lindh would die of her stab wounds and he therefore had intent to kill .

"
he 's since pulled out of the business of selling deluxe dresses - just like many of his colleagues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yves saint laurent 's 2002 farewell show long gone are the days , when fabulously rich ladies ordered haute couture outfits by the dozen .
the value of brands is all that 's left of the " high art of tailoring . " " fashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months , " oscar wilde , the irish dandy and writer , remarked more than a century ago .
he was talking about prêt-a-porter collections , i.e. ready-to-wear , mass-produced clothing , for which haute couture remains the trend-setter . cheap advertising as a source of income , haute couture itself has become meaningless and only accounts for about 3 percent of revenues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : versace for the masses but the luxury lines are the perfect advertising gimmick : cosmetics , perfumes and accessories are sold by evoking the image of a brand 's star creations . " producing such a collection costs less money than a global advertising campaign , " said didier grumbach , president of the french fashion association , the federation francaise de la couture .
fashion houses still invest between € 500,000 -lrb- $ 617,000 -rrb- and € 2 million to put on a 20-minute haute couture show . those that keep doing it , that is : during its heydays in the 1950s , 23 paris fashion houses presented haute couture collections - soon only seven will be left : chanel , christian dior , christian lacroix , jean-paul gaultier , louis scherrer , dominique sirop and torrente . japanese fashion designer hanae mori , 78 , the first foreigner to be admitted into french fashion 's governing body , the chambre syndicale de la haute couture , showed her last collection on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-name bridal gowns at a wedding show " haute couture no longer responds to the needs of today 's women , " emanuel ungaro said when announcing his decision to drop designing luxury dresses and devote his entire attention to prêt-a-porter collections instead . a globalized fashion world ungaro is now longer his own master , anyway : back in 1996 , the italian fashion concern salvatore ferragamo - producer of luxury shoes , bags , accessories , watches and perfumes - had already taken over the brand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jennifer lopez is n't the only who likes louis vuitton bags christian dior , christian lacroix and givenchy on the other hand all belong to the world 's largest luxury conglomerate , lvmh -lrb- louis vuitton moet hennessy -rrb- , which still sells some haute couture in select boutiques .
the company 's revenues come mainly from the sale of wine , liquor , prêt-a-porter fashion and leather goods . hermes , synonymous with high-end accessories and perfumes , holds 35 percent of shares of jean-paul gaultier .
yves saint laurent has been taken over by sanoli .
jean-louis scherrer left his company after 30 years when seibu from japan took over . versace has also dropped haute couture for a pragmatic reason : after losses in 2002 , the company simply did n't have enough money to put on a show . balmain fashion house , founded in 1914 , is bankrupt but still hopes for a revival .
givenchy has nothing to offer , because the company is still looking for a successor for its former british chief designer , julien macdonald . faking it " the dress must not hang on the body but follow its lines , " madelein vionnet , grande dame of french fashion , once said about her work .
" it must accompany its wearer and when a woman smiles , the dress must smile with her . " haute couture remains unique and any standardization is strictly taboo : it 's fashion that beautifies drooping shoulders , hides crane-like necks and creates the perfect décolleté . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hennes & mauritz store in brussels but the luxury comes at a steep price : day dresses cost about € 15,000 , an evening gown starts at € 35,000 .
is it worth that ?
even the super rich have begun to get stingy and turn to small tailors who will copy the original for a fraction of the price . fashion discounters such as zara and h & m also look at the collections for inspiration .

" in most cases , we buy the land we build our stores on , invest in the local infrastructure , create jobs , and 90 percent of the goods we sell come from russia , " he says . for homeyer , that explains why his company is so beloved in russia .
" the moscow mayor has been particularly supportive , " he says .
for other firms hoping to break into the russian market , the metro group 's experience sounds like a dream .

if approved , the u.k. would become the biggest net contributor of eu funds . britain is preparing to face off with its eu partners over plans to bring its € 3 billion eu budget rebate to an end and make britain the largest net contributor to eu funds , relative to the size of its economy .
the european commission 's plans for the budgetary period from 2007-2013 , drawn up by german budgetary commissioner michaele schreyer , would bring to a close the rebate which has been in place since 1984 .
if it is abolished , britain will become the biggest contributor to the eu 's € 100 billion a year budget and contribute 0.51 percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , compared to 0.35 for italy and 0.31 percent for france , countries of a similar size and wealth .
the rebate was originally introduced as compensation for britain which paid much more into eu coffers than it got back , largely because it benefited less than other member states from the common agricultural policy .
prime minister margaret thatcher secured the deal with german chancellor helmut kohl and french president francois mitterrand after famously demanding : " i want my money back . "
funds for new states prompt rethink but the introduction of ten new member states in may means that new eu regional and structural funds go largely to the accession countries , narrowing the net contributions gap between britain and other veteran members .
the commission says that if things are not changed , britain would pay just 0.25 percent of its gdp to the eu between 2007 and 2013 , compared with , for example , 0.56 percent for the netherlands and 0.54 percent for germany .
" the uk is going to become the smallest net contributor to the eu budget ... as a result , the current system of a correction reserved exclusively for the uk can not continue , " schreyer told reporters .
instead , brussels proposes a " general refund mechanism , " which would share out the rebate equally between all member states whose contributions to the eu exceed 0.35 percent of their gdp . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new plans to ease burden on eu net contributors the idea was proposed at an informal meeting of finance ministers and would go some way to easing concerns of net contributors to the eu budget that they are being asked to pay too much into the union 's coffers .

if approved , the u.k. would become the biggest net contributor of eu funds . britain is preparing to face off with its eu partners over plans to bring its € 3 billion eu budget rebate to an end and make britain the largest net contributor to eu funds , relative to the size of its economy .
the european commission 's plans for the budgetary period from 2007-2013 , drawn up by german budgetary commissioner michaele schreyer , would bring to a close the rebate which has been in place since 1984 .
if it is abolished , britain will become the biggest contributor to the eu 's € 100 billion a year budget and contribute 0.51 percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , compared to 0.35 for italy and 0.31 percent for france , countries of a similar size and wealth .
the rebate was originally introduced as compensation for britain which paid much more into eu coffers than it got back , largely because it benefited less than other member states from the common agricultural policy .
prime minister margaret thatcher secured the deal with german chancellor helmut kohl and french president francois mitterrand after famously demanding : " i want my money back . "
funds for new states prompt rethink but the introduction of ten new member states in may means that new eu regional and structural funds go largely to the accession countries , narrowing the net contributions gap between britain and other veteran members .
the commission says that if things are not changed , britain would pay just 0.25 percent of its gdp to the eu between 2007 and 2013 , compared with , for example , 0.56 percent for the netherlands and 0.54 percent for germany .
" the uk is going to become the smallest net contributor to the eu budget ... as a result , the current system of a correction reserved exclusively for the uk can not continue , " schreyer told reporters .
instead , brussels proposes a " general refund mechanism , " which would share out the rebate equally between all member states whose contributions to the eu exceed 0.35 percent of their gdp . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new plans to ease burden on eu net contributors the idea was proposed at an informal meeting of finance ministers and would go some way to easing concerns of net contributors to the eu budget that they are being asked to pay too much into the union 's coffers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.07.2004 interior ministers agree on anti-terrorism database großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old world , new threats interior ministers from the german states concluded a two-day conference on internal security measures by agreeing on a federal database for terror suspects . the german ministers of the interior appeared to have put their differences aside as they concluded a conference in kiel on thursday dealing with counter-terrorism measures and the creation of a federal database for terror suspects . the ministers came to an agreement on closer cooperation between the german states on internal security matters and expressed support for federal minister of the interior otto schily 's plan of a central database where information would be pooled from all over germany . before the conference , the ministers had also agreed that they all wanted to expand the use of dna analysis from its current application in crimes such as murder and manslaughter cases and permit its use in less serious areas of investigation . ministers agree on pooled information file later schily confirmed that agreement had been met on his plan to create a central file for islamist terror suspects .
ministers from the states of hesse , lower saxony and bavaria had already signaled their support for a federal database where information on suspects from all states would be combined with national files to build a comprehensive list of suspected terrorists in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal interior minister otto schily schily -lrb- photo -rrb- added that , up until now , the transfer of information between individual departments had been unsatisfactory .
the federal interior minister told the german magazine stern that everything must be done to ensure " that really every detail goes into the central file . " for several months now , the state-level office for the protection of the constitution intelligence agencies have been sparring with berlin over proposals to abolish the state offices and consolidate them at the federal level or in a smaller grouping of regional offices . liberals protest over too much transparency the opposition free democratic party liberals , however , rejected the claim for a central database .

" it 's not an unusual procedure that a state wants to collect taxes , " schröder said , according to a spokesman . some foreign investors fear the arrest of the company 's former head , mikhail khodorkovsky , which caused the russian stock market to tumble , was politically motivated . on wednesday , bailiffs moved in on the yukos main offices after a midnight deadline passed for the company to pay a $ 3.4 billion -lrb- € 2.7 billion -rrb- tax bill from 2000 .
the move is likely to force the company into bankruptcy . schröder : germans confident about russia but schröder said putin 's economic reforms had strengthened confidence among german business leaders to invest in russia . " i think this reform activity has led to the fact that the trust in business circles in germany regarding the economic stability and the political stability in russia is quite high , " schröder said . the chancellor is travelling with the chief executive officers of several top german companies : siemens , deutsche bank , ruhrgas and lufthansa . trade between russia and germany amounted to $ 18 billion last year , according to russian news agency itar-tass . new bilateral projects announced the leaders also used the meeting to highlight a $ 3.1 billion project between russia 's state-owned gazprom concern and german energy giant e.on to build a natural gas pipeline under the baltic sea . german retailer rewe also announced a $ 500 million agreement with russia 's marta group to set up a new supermarket chain over the next three to five years , the associated press reported . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german firms head to russia accompanied by a delegation of businessmen , german chancellor gerhard schröder is visiting russia on thursday .

if approved , the u.k. would become the biggest net contributor of eu funds . britain is preparing to face off with its eu partners over plans to bring its € 3 billion eu budget rebate to an end and make britain the largest net contributor to eu funds , relative to the size of its economy .
the european commission 's plans for the budgetary period from 2007-2013 , drawn up by german budgetary commissioner michaele schreyer , would bring to a close the rebate which has been in place since 1984 .
if it is abolished , britain will become the biggest contributor to the eu 's € 100 billion a year budget and contribute 0.51 percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , compared to 0.35 for italy and 0.31 percent for france , countries of a similar size and wealth .
the rebate was originally introduced as compensation for britain which paid much more into eu coffers than it got back , largely because it benefited less than other member states from the common agricultural policy .
prime minister margaret thatcher secured the deal with german chancellor helmut kohl and french president francois mitterrand after famously demanding : " i want my money back . "
funds for new states prompt rethink but the introduction of ten new member states in may means that new eu regional and structural funds go largely to the accession countries , narrowing the net contributions gap between britain and other veteran members .
the commission says that if things are not changed , britain would pay just 0.25 percent of its gdp to the eu between 2007 and 2013 , compared with , for example , 0.56 percent for the netherlands and 0.54 percent for germany .
" the uk is going to become the smallest net contributor to the eu budget ... as a result , the current system of a correction reserved exclusively for the uk can not continue , " schreyer told reporters .

the neighbors have issues of a failing democracy and economy to resolve . officials from the european union and the ukraine are meeting on thursday in the hague to discuss the relationship between the ukraine and the recently expanded eu .
the europeans are expected to pose some serious questions about the failing standards of democracy under the government of leonid kutschma , with many eu politicians loath to see him remain in office . the ukraine is beginning to look like the eu 's problem neighbor .
the former soviet republic has been described in brussels as a nation with failing democratic standards , which are becoming very noticeable as the country prepares for a presidential election in october . president criticized for democratic failures kutschma , the current ukraine president , has been criticized for many shortcomings in the running of a free market economy and the media coverage of the suspicious murder of journalist georgiy gongadze .
senior political and security figures have been implicated in the killing and many see it as a government effort to muzzle the press . the case of the murdered journalist has become a sticking point in bilateral talks - with the ukraine telling the eu to mind its own business while the eu cites it as a clear case of democratic deficiency in the ukraine .
brussels is slowly losing its patience and is hoping the elections in october will bring about positive change . “ we expect that the new president will follow the principles of an open-market economy , " eu member of parliament elisabeth schrödter told deutsche welle .
" we expect that the decision made by the ukrainian parliament , that ukrainian legislation will be adapted to conform to eu laws , will be put into practice .
we hope for concrete strategies in this respect and not just empty words . ” ukraine wants economic acknowledgement at thursday 's summit , the ukrainian government expects europe to tackle this thorny topic and acknowledge the country as a free market economy , which would also facilitate the ukraine ’ s entry to the world trade organization .
however , eu officials say they have had trouble finding reliable negotiators on the ukrainian side and a resolution may again be impossible at this stage . brussels will be watching the presidential elections in the ukraine closely .
most believe that a full change of government and policies in the ukraine is necessary for it to soldify the footing of its relationship with the eu . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de market status to come soon for ukraine during a meeting with ukraine 's premier viktor yanukovych , prodi hinted that the eu could grant ukraine its long sought-after market status at the forthcoming eu-ukraine ministerial meeting in july .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.07.2004 germans mull fifty-hour workweek großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions are fighting to keep a weekly work time of 35 hours in a move that will surely raise the hackles of germany ’ s labor unions , two leading economic and industry figures proposed introducing a 50-hour workweek as a means to reduce the country ’ s staggering unemployment rate . the suggestion is part of a reform debate in germany on how to cut costs to make the world ’ s third largest economy more competitive in the global market . the problem is two-fold .
germany is losing jobs to lower wage countries and consumers at home , who are either unemployed because of the job-drain or worried about losing work , are n't loosening their purse strings either . the result is devastating for the german economy , which has been more or less stagnant over recent years .
exacerbating the problem are pension and health reforms introduced by the social democrat-green party government which mean less money in retirement and higher healthcare costs for patients . the upshot is that germany has found itself in a vicious circle .
if it reduces government spending , taxpayers will have fewer services or have to pay more .
but with lower wages and an uncertain future , people will not be able to pay for the essential goods and services they need . will a longer workweek save jobs ? for literally years now , the question has been : how to solve this dilemma ?
the latest remedial suggestion comes from klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research and ulrich ramm , chief economist at germany ’ s third largest bank , commerzbank . both men have proposed introducing a 50-hour workweek to prevent even more jobs being exported to low-wage countries .
ramm said he thinks germany has room for more jobs , but they have to be affordable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high wages make production in germany more expensive than in other countries .
" i can see a realistic chance for discussion and we should perhaps work a bit more because in germany we have a lack of payable labor and it 's not the lack of labor overall , " he said . in ramm ’ s view , the 50-hour workweek would not be permanent : by establishing a work-hour account of up to 50 hours for peak production periods , when production slowed , employees could work 30 hours instead for the same pay , he said . michael hüther , director of the german economic institute , agreed with ramm ’ s assessment and argued for a generally more flexible workweek .
still others , like gerhard handke , from the german wholesale and foreign trade association , think workers should also give up a week ’ s vacation per year to make germany more competitive . handke pointed to ireland , where workers have just 20 days off a year , compared to six weeks in germany .
handke reduced the situation to a simple formula : you can not remain affluent and continue working less than everybody else . an " abstruse proposal " ? meanwhile , one of germany ’ s most prominent economists , peter bofinger , a professor at the university of würzburg and a member of germany ’ s prestigious group of economic advisers , known as the “ wise men , ” is opposed to a longer workweek .
he conceded that longer hours are good for business , but warns of dangerous deflationary pressures when consumer buying power declines : " working longer means there will be less purchasing power in the hands of workers and given that we have a problem with our domestic demand this problem will be aggravated , " he said .
" as the example of the japanese economy shows , if you reduce wages in a relatively large economy in order to boost employment , you get just the opposite effect . " bofinger , at least , can be sure of support from germany ’ s labor unions .
the head of the country ’ s construction and agriculture union , klaus wiesehügel , called the 50-hour week an " abstruse proposal " that would generate more unemployment . even the chairman of germany ’ s technology giant , siemens , heinrich von pierer , said that talk of a 50-hour week was not very helpful in the current climate and would make people more insecure . gregg benzow -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : the job market limps along the long-awaited and forever promised economic revival in germany is a major topic in the nation ’ s newspapers this wednesday .

-lrb- july 7 , 2004 -rrb- experts : longer work week already reality while germans are debating whether to extend the work week to help the country 's ailing economy , some experts say many employees already spend almost 40 hours on the job each week .

the neighbors have issues of a failing democracy and economy to resolve . officials from the european union and the ukraine are meeting on thursday in the hague to discuss the relationship between the ukraine and the recently expanded eu .
the europeans are expected to pose some serious questions about the failing standards of democracy under the government of leonid kutschma , with many eu politicians loath to see him remain in office . the ukraine is beginning to look like the eu 's problem neighbor .
the former soviet republic has been described in brussels as a nation with failing democratic standards , which are becoming very noticeable as the country prepares for a presidential election in october . president criticized for democratic failures kutschma , the current ukraine president , has been criticized for many shortcomings in the running of a free market economy and the media coverage of the suspicious murder of journalist georgiy gongadze .
senior political and security figures have been implicated in the killing and many see it as a government effort to muzzle the press . the case of the murdered journalist has become a sticking point in bilateral talks - with the ukraine telling the eu to mind its own business while the eu cites it as a clear case of democratic deficiency in the ukraine .
brussels is slowly losing its patience and is hoping the elections in october will bring about positive change . “ we expect that the new president will follow the principles of an open-market economy , " eu member of parliament elisabeth schrödter told deutsche welle .
" we expect that the decision made by the ukrainian parliament , that ukrainian legislation will be adapted to conform to eu laws , will be put into practice .
we hope for concrete strategies in this respect and not just empty words . ” ukraine wants economic acknowledgement at thursday 's summit , the ukrainian government expects europe to tackle this thorny topic and acknowledge the country as a free market economy , which would also facilitate the ukraine ’ s entry to the world trade organization .
however , eu officials say they have had trouble finding reliable negotiators on the ukrainian side and a resolution may again be impossible at this stage . brussels will be watching the presidential elections in the ukraine closely .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.07.2004 german firms head to russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder comes to russia on thursday accompanied by a delegation of businessmen , german chancellor gerhard schröder is visiting russia on thursday .
the message : larger german firms are already successful there and smaller ones should follow suit . after the russian economy collapsed in 1998 , the import and export industries likewise suffered .
in the meantime , however , little evidence remains of those troubled times , and russia presents a significant opportunity for german companies - both large and small . " the russian market is growing at an annual rate of 6 to 8 percent , and that 's particularly exciting for producers of consumer products , " says manfred sapper of the berlin-based german society for east european studies -lrb- dgo -rrb- .
as a result , german-russian trade is on the rise : last year trade volume between the two countries reached a record high of € 25.5 billion -lrb- $ 30.9 billion -rrb- . this trend is mirrored in trade relations between the whole of the european union and russia - 50 percent of all imports to russia come from the eu .
the only problem , according to sapper , is the fact that there is a massive trade imbalance between the eu and russia .
only five percent of the goods imported to the eu come from russia . the metro-group on the advance the düsseldorf-based retailer metro group is one of the largest german investors in russia .
the company stocks many of the consumer products russia 's 145 million inhabitants are looking to buy , and that 's proven to be a recipe for success . hans-joachim körber , the head of metro , is a prominent member of the delegation accompanying the chancellor on his trip to russia .
" we have been successful in russia since 2001 , " says jürgen homeyer , a spokesman for the metro-group . the large german retailer has five stores in moscow and two in st. petersburg .
to hear homeyer tell it , the metro group 's experience in russia has been nothing but positive .
" after just two years , our affiliates were already in the black , " he says .
" of course , our investments totalling more than € 15 million per store have not been redeemed yet , but we are still growing . " 90 percent of products produced in russia " in the coming year , we will increase the number of metro stores to 17 , " says homeyer .
but his company is not just in it for a short-term profit , he says .
they are looking to build-up stable long-term relations .
" in most cases , we buy the land we build our stores on , invest in the local infrastructure , create jobs , and 90 percent of the goods we sell come from russia , " he says . for homeyer , that explains why his company is so beloved in russia .
" the moscow mayor has been particularly supportive , " he says .
for other firms hoping to break into the russian market , the metro group 's experience sounds like a dream .
but , warns homeyer , it 's important to spend the time researching the market . warning : get expert advice it 's not all cinderella stories , as seems to have been the case for the metro group .
the russian market does pose certain risks .
smaller firms hoping to follow-up on the success of larger forerunners should seek expert advice , say those familiar with the pitfalls . " these companies should look for advice early , so they have a realistic understanding of the conditions of the russian market , " says peter presber , an expert on russia for the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
" there are huge differences between german and russian bureaucracy and corruption remains a problem , " he says . the fate of yukos , one of russia 's largest oil producers , for example , has made some foreign investors weary . they fear the arrest of the company 's former head , mikhail khodorkovsky , which caused the russian stock market to take a tumble , was politically motivated .
on wednesday night the saga continued , and bailiffs moved in on the yukos main offices after a midnight deadline passed for the company to pay a $ 3.4 billion tax bill from 2000 .
the move is likely to force the company into bankruptcy . on the other hand , presber does credit the russians with making improvements .
" in the last five or six years , numerous new laws have been passed that have improved the situation for foreign companies , " he says .
for presber and company at the dihk , the time is right to invest in russia : " the market is growing , and german companies should grow with it .

the neighbors have issues of a failing democracy and economy to resolve . officials from the european union and the ukraine are meeting on thursday in the hague to discuss the relationship between the ukraine and the recently expanded eu .
the europeans are expected to pose some serious questions about the failing standards of democracy under the government of leonid kutschma , with many eu politicians loath to see him remain in office . the ukraine is beginning to look like the eu 's problem neighbor .
the former soviet republic has been described in brussels as a nation with failing democratic standards , which are becoming very noticeable as the country prepares for a presidential election in october . president criticized for democratic failures kutschma , the current ukraine president , has been criticized for many shortcomings in the running of a free market economy and the media coverage of the suspicious murder of journalist georgiy gongadze .
senior political and security figures have been implicated in the killing and many see it as a government effort to muzzle the press . the case of the murdered journalist has become a sticking point in bilateral talks - with the ukraine telling the eu to mind its own business while the eu cites it as a clear case of democratic deficiency in the ukraine .
brussels is slowly losing its patience and is hoping the elections in october will bring about positive change . “ we expect that the new president will follow the principles of an open-market economy , " eu member of parliament elisabeth schrödter told deutsche welle .
" we expect that the decision made by the ukrainian parliament , that ukrainian legislation will be adapted to conform to eu laws , will be put into practice .
we hope for concrete strategies in this respect and not just empty words . ” ukraine wants economic acknowledgement at thursday 's summit , the ukrainian government expects europe to tackle this thorny topic and acknowledge the country as a free market economy , which would also facilitate the ukraine ’ s entry to the world trade organization .
however , eu officials say they have had trouble finding reliable negotiators on the ukrainian side and a resolution may again be impossible at this stage . brussels will be watching the presidential elections in the ukraine closely .
most believe that a full change of government and policies in the ukraine is necessary for it to soldify the footing of its relationship with the eu . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de market status to come soon for ukraine during a meeting with ukraine 's premier viktor yanukovych , prodi hinted that the eu could grant ukraine its long sought-after market status at the forthcoming eu-ukraine ministerial meeting in july .

germany is losing jobs to lower wage countries and consumers at home , who are either unemployed because of the job-drain or worried about losing work , are n't loosening their purse strings either . the result is devastating for the german economy , which has been more or less stagnant over recent years .
exacerbating the problem are pension and health reforms introduced by the social democrat-green party government which mean less money in retirement and higher healthcare costs for patients . the upshot is that germany has found itself in a vicious circle .
if it reduces government spending , taxpayers will have fewer services or have to pay more .
but with lower wages and an uncertain future , people will not be able to pay for the essential goods and services they need . will a longer workweek save jobs ? for literally years now , the question has been : how to solve this dilemma ?
the latest remedial suggestion comes from klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research and ulrich ramm , chief economist at germany ’ s third largest bank , commerzbank . both men have proposed introducing a 50-hour workweek to prevent even more jobs being exported to low-wage countries .
ramm said he thinks germany has room for more jobs , but they have to be affordable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high wages make production in germany more expensive than in other countries .
" i can see a realistic chance for discussion and we should perhaps work a bit more because in germany we have a lack of payable labor and it 's not the lack of labor overall , " he said . in ramm ’ s view , the 50-hour workweek would not be permanent : by establishing a work-hour account of up to 50 hours for peak production periods , when production slowed , employees could work 30 hours instead for the same pay , he said . michael hüther , director of the german economic institute , agreed with ramm ’ s assessment and argued for a generally more flexible workweek .
still others , like gerhard handke , from the german wholesale and foreign trade association , think workers should also give up a week ’ s vacation per year to make germany more competitive . handke pointed to ireland , where workers have just 20 days off a year , compared to six weeks in germany .
handke reduced the situation to a simple formula : you can not remain affluent and continue working less than everybody else . an " abstruse proposal " ? meanwhile , one of germany ’ s most prominent economists , peter bofinger , a professor at the university of würzburg and a member of germany ’ s prestigious group of economic advisers , known as the “ wise men , ” is opposed to a longer workweek .
he conceded that longer hours are good for business , but warns of dangerous deflationary pressures when consumer buying power declines : " working longer means there will be less purchasing power in the hands of workers and given that we have a problem with our domestic demand this problem will be aggravated , " he said .
" as the example of the japanese economy shows , if you reduce wages in a relatively large economy in order to boost employment , you get just the opposite effect . " bofinger , at least , can be sure of support from germany ’ s labor unions .
the head of the country ’ s construction and agriculture union , klaus wiesehügel , called the 50-hour week an " abstruse proposal " that would generate more unemployment . even the chairman of germany ’ s technology giant , siemens , heinrich von pierer , said that talk of a 50-hour week was not very helpful in the current climate and would make people more insecure . gregg benzow -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : the job market limps along the long-awaited and forever promised economic revival in germany is a major topic in the nation ’ s newspapers this wednesday .

ministers from the states of hesse , lower saxony and bavaria had already signaled their support for a federal database where information on suspects from all states would be combined with national files to build a comprehensive list of suspected terrorists in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal interior minister otto schily schily -lrb- photo -rrb- added that , up until now , the transfer of information between individual departments had been unsatisfactory .
the federal interior minister told the german magazine stern that everything must be done to ensure " that really every detail goes into the central file . " for several months now , the state-level office for the protection of the constitution intelligence agencies have been sparring with berlin over proposals to abolish the state offices and consolidate them at the federal level or in a smaller grouping of regional offices . liberals protest over too much transparency the opposition free democratic party liberals , however , rejected the claim for a central database .
the fdp 's spokesperson for domestic affairs , max städter , told the berliner zeitung that the fight against terrorism should go on but by following constitutional principles .
he argued that a central file would provide the intelligence agencies with access to domestic police files and therefore more than just the necessary information to investigate terror suspects .
städter instead suggested creating two separate databases . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schily calls for unity in war on terror german interior minister otto schily opened the european police congress in bonn on monday with a speech that demanded more cooperation and resilience from all sides collaborating in the fight against terrorism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.07.2004 interior ministers agree on anti-terrorism database großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old world , new threats interior ministers from the german states concluded a two-day conference on internal security measures by agreeing on a federal database for terror suspects . the german ministers of the interior appeared to have put their differences aside as they concluded a conference in kiel on thursday dealing with counter-terrorism measures and the creation of a federal database for terror suspects . the ministers came to an agreement on closer cooperation between the german states on internal security matters and expressed support for federal minister of the interior otto schily 's plan of a central database where information would be pooled from all over germany . before the conference , the ministers had also agreed that they all wanted to expand the use of dna analysis from its current application in crimes such as murder and manslaughter cases and permit its use in less serious areas of investigation . ministers agree on pooled information file later schily confirmed that agreement had been met on his plan to create a central file for islamist terror suspects .
ministers from the states of hesse , lower saxony and bavaria had already signaled their support for a federal database where information on suspects from all states would be combined with national files to build a comprehensive list of suspected terrorists in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal interior minister otto schily schily -lrb- photo -rrb- added that , up until now , the transfer of information between individual departments had been unsatisfactory .
the federal interior minister told the german magazine stern that everything must be done to ensure " that really every detail goes into the central file . " for several months now , the state-level office for the protection of the constitution intelligence agencies have been sparring with berlin over proposals to abolish the state offices and consolidate them at the federal level or in a smaller grouping of regional offices . liberals protest over too much transparency the opposition free democratic party liberals , however , rejected the claim for a central database .
the fdp 's spokesperson for domestic affairs , max städter , told the berliner zeitung that the fight against terrorism should go on but by following constitutional principles .
he argued that a central file would provide the intelligence agencies with access to domestic police files and therefore more than just the necessary information to investigate terror suspects .
städter instead suggested creating two separate databases . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schily calls for unity in war on terror german interior minister otto schily opened the european police congress in bonn on monday with a speech that demanded more cooperation and resilience from all sides collaborating in the fight against terrorism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.07.2004 germans mull fifty-hour workweek großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions are fighting to keep a weekly work time of 35 hours in a move that will surely raise the hackles of germany ’ s labor unions , two leading economic and industry figures proposed introducing a 50-hour workweek as a means to reduce the country ’ s staggering unemployment rate . the suggestion is part of a reform debate in germany on how to cut costs to make the world ’ s third largest economy more competitive in the global market . the problem is two-fold .
germany is losing jobs to lower wage countries and consumers at home , who are either unemployed because of the job-drain or worried about losing work , are n't loosening their purse strings either . the result is devastating for the german economy , which has been more or less stagnant over recent years .
exacerbating the problem are pension and health reforms introduced by the social democrat-green party government which mean less money in retirement and higher healthcare costs for patients . the upshot is that germany has found itself in a vicious circle .
if it reduces government spending , taxpayers will have fewer services or have to pay more .
but with lower wages and an uncertain future , people will not be able to pay for the essential goods and services they need . will a longer workweek save jobs ? for literally years now , the question has been : how to solve this dilemma ?
the latest remedial suggestion comes from klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research and ulrich ramm , chief economist at germany ’ s third largest bank , commerzbank . both men have proposed introducing a 50-hour workweek to prevent even more jobs being exported to low-wage countries .
ramm said he thinks germany has room for more jobs , but they have to be affordable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high wages make production in germany more expensive than in other countries .
" i can see a realistic chance for discussion and we should perhaps work a bit more because in germany we have a lack of payable labor and it 's not the lack of labor overall , " he said . in ramm ’ s view , the 50-hour workweek would not be permanent : by establishing a work-hour account of up to 50 hours for peak production periods , when production slowed , employees could work 30 hours instead for the same pay , he said . michael hüther , director of the german economic institute , agreed with ramm ’ s assessment and argued for a generally more flexible workweek .
still others , like gerhard handke , from the german wholesale and foreign trade association , think workers should also give up a week ’ s vacation per year to make germany more competitive . handke pointed to ireland , where workers have just 20 days off a year , compared to six weeks in germany .
handke reduced the situation to a simple formula : you can not remain affluent and continue working less than everybody else . an " abstruse proposal " ? meanwhile , one of germany ’ s most prominent economists , peter bofinger , a professor at the university of würzburg and a member of germany ’ s prestigious group of economic advisers , known as the “ wise men , ” is opposed to a longer workweek .
he conceded that longer hours are good for business , but warns of dangerous deflationary pressures when consumer buying power declines : " working longer means there will be less purchasing power in the hands of workers and given that we have a problem with our domestic demand this problem will be aggravated , " he said .
" as the example of the japanese economy shows , if you reduce wages in a relatively large economy in order to boost employment , you get just the opposite effect . " bofinger , at least , can be sure of support from germany ’ s labor unions .
the head of the country ’ s construction and agriculture union , klaus wiesehügel , called the 50-hour week an " abstruse proposal " that would generate more unemployment . even the chairman of germany ’ s technology giant , siemens , heinrich von pierer , said that talk of a 50-hour week was not very helpful in the current climate and would make people more insecure . gregg benzow -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : the job market limps along the long-awaited and forever promised economic revival in germany is a major topic in the nation ’ s newspapers this wednesday .
unfortunately , most editors conclude , modest growth is n't enough to create new jobs .
-lrb- july 7 , 2004 -rrb- experts : longer work week already reality while germans are debating whether to extend the work week to help the country 's ailing economy , some experts say many employees already spend almost 40 hours on the job each week .

germany is losing jobs to lower wage countries and consumers at home , who are either unemployed because of the job-drain or worried about losing work , are n't loosening their purse strings either . the result is devastating for the german economy , which has been more or less stagnant over recent years .
exacerbating the problem are pension and health reforms introduced by the social democrat-green party government which mean less money in retirement and higher healthcare costs for patients . the upshot is that germany has found itself in a vicious circle .
if it reduces government spending , taxpayers will have fewer services or have to pay more .
but with lower wages and an uncertain future , people will not be able to pay for the essential goods and services they need . will a longer workweek save jobs ? for literally years now , the question has been : how to solve this dilemma ?
the latest remedial suggestion comes from klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research and ulrich ramm , chief economist at germany ’ s third largest bank , commerzbank . both men have proposed introducing a 50-hour workweek to prevent even more jobs being exported to low-wage countries .
ramm said he thinks germany has room for more jobs , but they have to be affordable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high wages make production in germany more expensive than in other countries .
" i can see a realistic chance for discussion and we should perhaps work a bit more because in germany we have a lack of payable labor and it 's not the lack of labor overall , " he said . in ramm ’ s view , the 50-hour workweek would not be permanent : by establishing a work-hour account of up to 50 hours for peak production periods , when production slowed , employees could work 30 hours instead for the same pay , he said . michael hüther , director of the german economic institute , agreed with ramm ’ s assessment and argued for a generally more flexible workweek .
still others , like gerhard handke , from the german wholesale and foreign trade association , think workers should also give up a week ’ s vacation per year to make germany more competitive . handke pointed to ireland , where workers have just 20 days off a year , compared to six weeks in germany .
handke reduced the situation to a simple formula : you can not remain affluent and continue working less than everybody else . an " abstruse proposal " ? meanwhile , one of germany ’ s most prominent economists , peter bofinger , a professor at the university of würzburg and a member of germany ’ s prestigious group of economic advisers , known as the “ wise men , ” is opposed to a longer workweek .
he conceded that longer hours are good for business , but warns of dangerous deflationary pressures when consumer buying power declines : " working longer means there will be less purchasing power in the hands of workers and given that we have a problem with our domestic demand this problem will be aggravated , " he said .
" as the example of the japanese economy shows , if you reduce wages in a relatively large economy in order to boost employment , you get just the opposite effect . " bofinger , at least , can be sure of support from germany ’ s labor unions .
the head of the country ’ s construction and agriculture union , klaus wiesehügel , called the 50-hour week an " abstruse proposal " that would generate more unemployment . even the chairman of germany ’ s technology giant , siemens , heinrich von pierer , said that talk of a 50-hour week was not very helpful in the current climate and would make people more insecure . gregg benzow -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : the job market limps along the long-awaited and forever promised economic revival in germany is a major topic in the nation ’ s newspapers this wednesday .
unfortunately , most editors conclude , modest growth is n't enough to create new jobs .
-lrb- july 7 , 2004 -rrb- experts : longer work week already reality while germans are debating whether to extend the work week to help the country 's ailing economy , some experts say many employees already spend almost 40 hours on the job each week .

the neighbors have issues of a failing democracy and economy to resolve . officials from the european union and the ukraine are meeting on thursday in the hague to discuss the relationship between the ukraine and the recently expanded eu .
the europeans are expected to pose some serious questions about the failing standards of democracy under the government of leonid kutschma , with many eu politicians loath to see him remain in office . the ukraine is beginning to look like the eu 's problem neighbor .
the former soviet republic has been described in brussels as a nation with failing democratic standards , which are becoming very noticeable as the country prepares for a presidential election in october . president criticized for democratic failures kutschma , the current ukraine president , has been criticized for many shortcomings in the running of a free market economy and the media coverage of the suspicious murder of journalist georgiy gongadze .
senior political and security figures have been implicated in the killing and many see it as a government effort to muzzle the press . the case of the murdered journalist has become a sticking point in bilateral talks - with the ukraine telling the eu to mind its own business while the eu cites it as a clear case of democratic deficiency in the ukraine .
brussels is slowly losing its patience and is hoping the elections in october will bring about positive change . “ we expect that the new president will follow the principles of an open-market economy , " eu member of parliament elisabeth schrödter told deutsche welle .
" we expect that the decision made by the ukrainian parliament , that ukrainian legislation will be adapted to conform to eu laws , will be put into practice .
we hope for concrete strategies in this respect and not just empty words . ” ukraine wants economic acknowledgement at thursday 's summit , the ukrainian government expects europe to tackle this thorny topic and acknowledge the country as a free market economy , which would also facilitate the ukraine ’ s entry to the world trade organization .
however , eu officials say they have had trouble finding reliable negotiators on the ukrainian side and a resolution may again be impossible at this stage . brussels will be watching the presidential elections in the ukraine closely .
most believe that a full change of government and policies in the ukraine is necessary for it to soldify the footing of its relationship with the eu . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de market status to come soon for ukraine during a meeting with ukraine 's premier viktor yanukovych , prodi hinted that the eu could grant ukraine its long sought-after market status at the forthcoming eu-ukraine ministerial meeting in july .

the message : larger german firms are already successful there and smaller ones should follow suit . after the russian economy collapsed in 1998 , the import and export industries likewise suffered .
in the meantime , however , little evidence remains of those troubled times , and russia presents a significant opportunity for german companies - both large and small . " the russian market is growing at an annual rate of 6 to 8 percent , and that 's particularly exciting for producers of consumer products , " says manfred sapper of the berlin-based german society for east european studies -lrb- dgo -rrb- .
as a result , german-russian trade is on the rise : last year trade volume between the two countries reached a record high of € 25.5 billion -lrb- $ 30.9 billion -rrb- . this trend is mirrored in trade relations between the whole of the european union and russia - 50 percent of all imports to russia come from the eu .
the only problem , according to sapper , is the fact that there is a massive trade imbalance between the eu and russia .
only five percent of the goods imported to the eu come from russia . the metro-group on the advance the düsseldorf-based retailer metro group is one of the largest german investors in russia .
the company stocks many of the consumer products russia 's 145 million inhabitants are looking to buy , and that 's proven to be a recipe for success . hans-joachim körber , the head of metro , is a prominent member of the delegation accompanying the chancellor on his trip to russia .
" we have been successful in russia since 2001 , " says jürgen homeyer , a spokesman for the metro-group . the large german retailer has five stores in moscow and two in st. petersburg .
to hear homeyer tell it , the metro group 's experience in russia has been nothing but positive .
" after just two years , our affiliates were already in the black , " he says .
" of course , our investments totalling more than € 15 million per store have not been redeemed yet , but we are still growing . " 90 percent of products produced in russia " in the coming year , we will increase the number of metro stores to 17 , " says homeyer .
but his company is not just in it for a short-term profit , he says .
they are looking to build-up stable long-term relations .
" in most cases , we buy the land we build our stores on , invest in the local infrastructure , create jobs , and 90 percent of the goods we sell come from russia , " he says . for homeyer , that explains why his company is so beloved in russia .
" the moscow mayor has been particularly supportive , " he says .
for other firms hoping to break into the russian market , the metro group 's experience sounds like a dream .
but , warns homeyer , it 's important to spend the time researching the market . warning : get expert advice it 's not all cinderella stories , as seems to have been the case for the metro group .
the russian market does pose certain risks .
smaller firms hoping to follow-up on the success of larger forerunners should seek expert advice , say those familiar with the pitfalls . " these companies should look for advice early , so they have a realistic understanding of the conditions of the russian market , " says peter presber , an expert on russia for the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
" there are huge differences between german and russian bureaucracy and corruption remains a problem , " he says . the fate of yukos , one of russia 's largest oil producers , for example , has made some foreign investors weary . they fear the arrest of the company 's former head , mikhail khodorkovsky , which caused the russian stock market to take a tumble , was politically motivated .
on wednesday night the saga continued , and bailiffs moved in on the yukos main offices after a midnight deadline passed for the company to pay a $ 3.4 billion tax bill from 2000 .
the move is likely to force the company into bankruptcy . on the other hand , presber does credit the russians with making improvements .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.07.2004 german firms head to russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder comes to russia on thursday accompanied by a delegation of businessmen , german chancellor gerhard schröder is visiting russia on thursday .
the message : larger german firms are already successful there and smaller ones should follow suit . after the russian economy collapsed in 1998 , the import and export industries likewise suffered .
in the meantime , however , little evidence remains of those troubled times , and russia presents a significant opportunity for german companies - both large and small . " the russian market is growing at an annual rate of 6 to 8 percent , and that 's particularly exciting for producers of consumer products , " says manfred sapper of the berlin-based german society for east european studies -lrb- dgo -rrb- .
as a result , german-russian trade is on the rise : last year trade volume between the two countries reached a record high of € 25.5 billion -lrb- $ 30.9 billion -rrb- . this trend is mirrored in trade relations between the whole of the european union and russia - 50 percent of all imports to russia come from the eu .
the only problem , according to sapper , is the fact that there is a massive trade imbalance between the eu and russia .
only five percent of the goods imported to the eu come from russia . the metro-group on the advance the düsseldorf-based retailer metro group is one of the largest german investors in russia .
the company stocks many of the consumer products russia 's 145 million inhabitants are looking to buy , and that 's proven to be a recipe for success . hans-joachim körber , the head of metro , is a prominent member of the delegation accompanying the chancellor on his trip to russia .
" we have been successful in russia since 2001 , " says jürgen homeyer , a spokesman for the metro-group . the large german retailer has five stores in moscow and two in st. petersburg .
to hear homeyer tell it , the metro group 's experience in russia has been nothing but positive .
" after just two years , our affiliates were already in the black , " he says .
" of course , our investments totalling more than € 15 million per store have not been redeemed yet , but we are still growing . " 90 percent of products produced in russia " in the coming year , we will increase the number of metro stores to 17 , " says homeyer .
but his company is not just in it for a short-term profit , he says .
they are looking to build-up stable long-term relations .
" in most cases , we buy the land we build our stores on , invest in the local infrastructure , create jobs , and 90 percent of the goods we sell come from russia , " he says . for homeyer , that explains why his company is so beloved in russia .
" the moscow mayor has been particularly supportive , " he says .
for other firms hoping to break into the russian market , the metro group 's experience sounds like a dream .
but , warns homeyer , it 's important to spend the time researching the market . warning : get expert advice it 's not all cinderella stories , as seems to have been the case for the metro group .
the russian market does pose certain risks .
smaller firms hoping to follow-up on the success of larger forerunners should seek expert advice , say those familiar with the pitfalls . " these companies should look for advice early , so they have a realistic understanding of the conditions of the russian market , " says peter presber , an expert on russia for the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
" there are huge differences between german and russian bureaucracy and corruption remains a problem , " he says . the fate of yukos , one of russia 's largest oil producers , for example , has made some foreign investors weary . they fear the arrest of the company 's former head , mikhail khodorkovsky , which caused the russian stock market to take a tumble , was politically motivated .
on wednesday night the saga continued , and bailiffs moved in on the yukos main offices after a midnight deadline passed for the company to pay a $ 3.4 billion tax bill from 2000 .
the move is likely to force the company into bankruptcy . on the other hand , presber does credit the russians with making improvements .
" in the last five or six years , numerous new laws have been passed that have improved the situation for foreign companies , " he says .
for presber and company at the dihk , the time is right to invest in russia : " the market is growing , and german companies should grow with it .

if approved , the u.k. would become the biggest net contributor of eu funds . britain is preparing to face off with its eu partners over plans to bring its € 3 billion eu budget rebate to an end and make britain the largest net contributor to eu funds , relative to the size of its economy .
the european commission 's plans for the budgetary period from 2007-2013 , drawn up by german budgetary commissioner michaele schreyer , would bring to a close the rebate which has been in place since 1984 .
if it is abolished , britain will become the biggest contributor to the eu 's € 100 billion a year budget and contribute 0.51 percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , compared to 0.35 for italy and 0.31 percent for france , countries of a similar size and wealth .
the rebate was originally introduced as compensation for britain which paid much more into eu coffers than it got back , largely because it benefited less than other member states from the common agricultural policy .
prime minister margaret thatcher secured the deal with german chancellor helmut kohl and french president francois mitterrand after famously demanding : " i want my money back . "
funds for new states prompt rethink but the introduction of ten new member states in may means that new eu regional and structural funds go largely to the accession countries , narrowing the net contributions gap between britain and other veteran members .
the commission says that if things are not changed , britain would pay just 0.25 percent of its gdp to the eu between 2007 and 2013 , compared with , for example , 0.56 percent for the netherlands and 0.54 percent for germany .
" the uk is going to become the smallest net contributor to the eu budget ... as a result , the current system of a correction reserved exclusively for the uk can not continue , " schreyer told reporters .

the neighbors have issues of a failing democracy and economy to resolve . officials from the european union and the ukraine are meeting on thursday in the hague to discuss the relationship between the ukraine and the recently expanded eu .
the europeans are expected to pose some serious questions about the failing standards of democracy under the government of leonid kutschma , with many eu politicians loath to see him remain in office . the ukraine is beginning to look like the eu 's problem neighbor .
the former soviet republic has been described in brussels as a nation with failing democratic standards , which are becoming very noticeable as the country prepares for a presidential election in october . president criticized for democratic failures kutschma , the current ukraine president , has been criticized for many shortcomings in the running of a free market economy and the media coverage of the suspicious murder of journalist georgiy gongadze .
senior political and security figures have been implicated in the killing and many see it as a government effort to muzzle the press . the case of the murdered journalist has become a sticking point in bilateral talks - with the ukraine telling the eu to mind its own business while the eu cites it as a clear case of democratic deficiency in the ukraine .
brussels is slowly losing its patience and is hoping the elections in october will bring about positive change . “ we expect that the new president will follow the principles of an open-market economy , " eu member of parliament elisabeth schrödter told deutsche welle .
" we expect that the decision made by the ukrainian parliament , that ukrainian legislation will be adapted to conform to eu laws , will be put into practice .
we hope for concrete strategies in this respect and not just empty words . ” ukraine wants economic acknowledgement at thursday 's summit , the ukrainian government expects europe to tackle this thorny topic and acknowledge the country as a free market economy , which would also facilitate the ukraine ’ s entry to the world trade organization .
however , eu officials say they have had trouble finding reliable negotiators on the ukrainian side and a resolution may again be impossible at this stage . brussels will be watching the presidential elections in the ukraine closely .

if approved , the u.k. would become the biggest net contributor of eu funds . britain is preparing to face off with its eu partners over plans to bring its € 3 billion eu budget rebate to an end and make britain the largest net contributor to eu funds , relative to the size of its economy .
the european commission 's plans for the budgetary period from 2007-2013 , drawn up by german budgetary commissioner michaele schreyer , would bring to a close the rebate which has been in place since 1984 .
if it is abolished , britain will become the biggest contributor to the eu 's € 100 billion a year budget and contribute 0.51 percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , compared to 0.35 for italy and 0.31 percent for france , countries of a similar size and wealth .
the rebate was originally introduced as compensation for britain which paid much more into eu coffers than it got back , largely because it benefited less than other member states from the common agricultural policy .
prime minister margaret thatcher secured the deal with german chancellor helmut kohl and french president francois mitterrand after famously demanding : " i want my money back . "
funds for new states prompt rethink but the introduction of ten new member states in may means that new eu regional and structural funds go largely to the accession countries , narrowing the net contributions gap between britain and other veteran members .
the commission says that if things are not changed , britain would pay just 0.25 percent of its gdp to the eu between 2007 and 2013 , compared with , for example , 0.56 percent for the netherlands and 0.54 percent for germany .
" the uk is going to become the smallest net contributor to the eu budget ... as a result , the current system of a correction reserved exclusively for the uk can not continue , " schreyer told reporters .

ministers from the states of hesse , lower saxony and bavaria had already signaled their support for a federal database where information on suspects from all states would be combined with national files to build a comprehensive list of suspected terrorists in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal interior minister otto schily schily -lrb- photo -rrb- added that , up until now , the transfer of information between individual departments had been unsatisfactory .
the federal interior minister told the german magazine stern that everything must be done to ensure " that really every detail goes into the central file . " for several months now , the state-level office for the protection of the constitution intelligence agencies have been sparring with berlin over proposals to abolish the state offices and consolidate them at the federal level or in a smaller grouping of regional offices . liberals protest over too much transparency the opposition free democratic party liberals , however , rejected the claim for a central database .
the fdp 's spokesperson for domestic affairs , max städter , told the berliner zeitung that the fight against terrorism should go on but by following constitutional principles .
he argued that a central file would provide the intelligence agencies with access to domestic police files and therefore more than just the necessary information to investigate terror suspects .
städter instead suggested creating two separate databases . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schily calls for unity in war on terror german interior minister otto schily opened the european police congress in bonn on monday with a speech that demanded more cooperation and resilience from all sides collaborating in the fight against terrorism .

the message : larger german firms are already successful there and smaller ones should follow suit . after the russian economy collapsed in 1998 , the import and export industries likewise suffered .
in the meantime , however , little evidence remains of those troubled times , and russia presents a significant opportunity for german companies - both large and small .

for other firms hoping to break into the russian market , the metro group 's experience sounds like a dream .

the message : larger german firms are already successful there and smaller ones should follow suit . after the russian economy collapsed in 1998 , the import and export industries likewise suffered .
in the meantime , however , little evidence remains of those troubled times , and russia presents a significant opportunity for german companies - both large and small . " the russian market is growing at an annual rate of 6 to 8 percent , and that 's particularly exciting for producers of consumer products , " says manfred sapper of the berlin-based german society for east european studies -lrb- dgo -rrb- .
as a result , german-russian trade is on the rise : last year trade volume between the two countries reached a record high of € 25.5 billion -lrb- $ 30.9 billion -rrb- . this trend is mirrored in trade relations between the whole of the european union and russia - 50 percent of all imports to russia come from the eu .
the only problem , according to sapper , is the fact that there is a massive trade imbalance between the eu and russia .
only five percent of the goods imported to the eu come from russia . the metro-group on the advance the düsseldorf-based retailer metro group is one of the largest german investors in russia .
the company stocks many of the consumer products russia 's 145 million inhabitants are looking to buy , and that 's proven to be a recipe for success . hans-joachim körber , the head of metro , is a prominent member of the delegation accompanying the chancellor on his trip to russia .
" we have been successful in russia since 2001 , " says jürgen homeyer , a spokesman for the metro-group . the large german retailer has five stores in moscow and two in st. petersburg .
to hear homeyer tell it , the metro group 's experience in russia has been nothing but positive .
" after just two years , our affiliates were already in the black , " he says .
" of course , our investments totalling more than € 15 million per store have not been redeemed yet , but we are still growing . " 90 percent of products produced in russia " in the coming year , we will increase the number of metro stores to 17 , " says homeyer .
but his company is not just in it for a short-term profit , he says .
they are looking to build-up stable long-term relations .
" in most cases , we buy the land we build our stores on , invest in the local infrastructure , create jobs , and 90 percent of the goods we sell come from russia , " he says . for homeyer , that explains why his company is so beloved in russia .
" the moscow mayor has been particularly supportive , " he says .
for other firms hoping to break into the russian market , the metro group 's experience sounds like a dream .
but , warns homeyer , it 's important to spend the time researching the market . warning : get expert advice it 's not all cinderella stories , as seems to have been the case for the metro group .
the russian market does pose certain risks .
smaller firms hoping to follow-up on the success of larger forerunners should seek expert advice , say those familiar with the pitfalls . " these companies should look for advice early , so they have a realistic understanding of the conditions of the russian market , " says peter presber , an expert on russia for the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
" there are huge differences between german and russian bureaucracy and corruption remains a problem , " he says . the fate of yukos , one of russia 's largest oil producers , for example , has made some foreign investors weary . they fear the arrest of the company 's former head , mikhail khodorkovsky , which caused the russian stock market to take a tumble , was politically motivated .
on wednesday night the saga continued , and bailiffs moved in on the yukos main offices after a midnight deadline passed for the company to pay a $ 3.4 billion tax bill from 2000 .
the move is likely to force the company into bankruptcy . on the other hand , presber does credit the russians with making improvements .
" in the last five or six years , numerous new laws have been passed that have improved the situation for foreign companies , " he says .

the neighbors have issues of a failing democracy and economy to resolve . officials from the european union and the ukraine are meeting on thursday in the hague to discuss the relationship between the ukraine and the recently expanded eu .
the europeans are expected to pose some serious questions about the failing standards of democracy under the government of leonid kutschma , with many eu politicians loath to see him remain in office . the ukraine is beginning to look like the eu 's problem neighbor .
the former soviet republic has been described in brussels as a nation with failing democratic standards , which are becoming very noticeable as the country prepares for a presidential election in october . president criticized for democratic failures kutschma , the current ukraine president , has been criticized for many shortcomings in the running of a free market economy and the media coverage of the suspicious murder of journalist georgiy gongadze .
senior political and security figures have been implicated in the killing and many see it as a government effort to muzzle the press . the case of the murdered journalist has become a sticking point in bilateral talks - with the ukraine telling the eu to mind its own business while the eu cites it as a clear case of democratic deficiency in the ukraine .
brussels is slowly losing its patience and is hoping the elections in october will bring about positive change . “ we expect that the new president will follow the principles of an open-market economy , " eu member of parliament elisabeth schrödter told deutsche welle .
" we expect that the decision made by the ukrainian parliament , that ukrainian legislation will be adapted to conform to eu laws , will be put into practice .
we hope for concrete strategies in this respect and not just empty words . ” ukraine wants economic acknowledgement at thursday 's summit , the ukrainian government expects europe to tackle this thorny topic and acknowledge the country as a free market economy , which would also facilitate the ukraine ’ s entry to the world trade organization .
however , eu officials say they have had trouble finding reliable negotiators on the ukrainian side and a resolution may again be impossible at this stage . brussels will be watching the presidential elections in the ukraine closely .

the neighbors have issues of a failing democracy and economy to resolve . officials from the european union and the ukraine are meeting on thursday in the hague to discuss the relationship between the ukraine and the recently expanded eu .
the europeans are expected to pose some serious questions about the failing standards of democracy under the government of leonid kutschma , with many eu politicians loath to see him remain in office . the ukraine is beginning to look like the eu 's problem neighbor .
the former soviet republic has been described in brussels as a nation with failing democratic standards , which are becoming very noticeable as the country prepares for a presidential election in october . president criticized for democratic failures kutschma , the current ukraine president , has been criticized for many shortcomings in the running of a free market economy and the media coverage of the suspicious murder of journalist georgiy gongadze .
senior political and security figures have been implicated in the killing and many see it as a government effort to muzzle the press . the case of the murdered journalist has become a sticking point in bilateral talks - with the ukraine telling the eu to mind its own business while the eu cites it as a clear case of democratic deficiency in the ukraine .
brussels is slowly losing its patience and is hoping the elections in october will bring about positive change . “ we expect that the new president will follow the principles of an open-market economy , " eu member of parliament elisabeth schrödter told deutsche welle .
" we expect that the decision made by the ukrainian parliament , that ukrainian legislation will be adapted to conform to eu laws , will be put into practice .
we hope for concrete strategies in this respect and not just empty words . ” ukraine wants economic acknowledgement at thursday 's summit , the ukrainian government expects europe to tackle this thorny topic and acknowledge the country as a free market economy , which would also facilitate the ukraine ’ s entry to the world trade organization .
however , eu officials say they have had trouble finding reliable negotiators on the ukrainian side and a resolution may again be impossible at this stage . brussels will be watching the presidential elections in the ukraine closely .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.07.2004 fashion 's high art hits a low großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bye-bye , haute couture : models applaud at hanae mori 's last show handcrafted luxury gowns are no longer en vogue : only eight paris fashion houses are participating in the current haute couture shows as demand for the unique creations has dropped over the past few years . fashion icon yves saint laurent once described haute couture as " whispered secrets passed on from generation to generation . "
he 's since pulled out of the business of selling deluxe dresses - just like many of his colleagues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yves saint laurent 's 2002 farewell show long gone are the days , when fabulously rich ladies ordered haute couture outfits by the dozen .
the value of brands is all that 's left of the " high art of tailoring . " " fashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months , " oscar wilde , the irish dandy and writer , remarked more than a century ago .
he was talking about prêt-a-porter collections , i.e. ready-to-wear , mass-produced clothing , for which haute couture remains the trend-setter . cheap advertising as a source of income , haute couture itself has become meaningless and only accounts for about 3 percent of revenues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : versace for the masses but the luxury lines are the perfect advertising gimmick : cosmetics , perfumes and accessories are sold by evoking the image of a brand 's star creations . " producing such a collection costs less money than a global advertising campaign , " said didier grumbach , president of the french fashion association , the federation francaise de la couture .
fashion houses still invest between € 500,000 -lrb- $ 617,000 -rrb- and € 2 million to put on a 20-minute haute couture show . those that keep doing it , that is : during its heydays in the 1950s , 23 paris fashion houses presented haute couture collections - soon only seven will be left : chanel , christian dior , christian lacroix , jean-paul gaultier , louis scherrer , dominique sirop and torrente . japanese fashion designer hanae mori , 78 , the first foreigner to be admitted into french fashion 's governing body , the chambre syndicale de la haute couture , showed her last collection on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-name bridal gowns at a wedding show " haute couture no longer responds to the needs of today 's women , " emanuel ungaro said when announcing his decision to drop designing luxury dresses and devote his entire attention to prêt-a-porter collections instead . a globalized fashion world ungaro is now longer his own master , anyway : back in 1996 , the italian fashion concern salvatore ferragamo - producer of luxury shoes , bags , accessories , watches and perfumes - had already taken over the brand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jennifer lopez is n't the only who likes louis vuitton bags christian dior , christian lacroix and givenchy on the other hand all belong to the world 's largest luxury conglomerate , lvmh -lrb- louis vuitton moet hennessy -rrb- , which still sells some haute couture in select boutiques .
the company 's revenues come mainly from the sale of wine , liquor , prêt-a-porter fashion and leather goods . hermes , synonymous with high-end accessories and perfumes , holds 35 percent of shares of jean-paul gaultier .
yves saint laurent has been taken over by sanoli .
jean-louis scherrer left his company after 30 years when seibu from japan took over . versace has also dropped haute couture for a pragmatic reason : after losses in 2002 , the company simply did n't have enough money to put on a show . balmain fashion house , founded in 1914 , is bankrupt but still hopes for a revival .
givenchy has nothing to offer , because the company is still looking for a successor for its former british chief designer , julien macdonald . faking it " the dress must not hang on the body but follow its lines , " madelein vionnet , grande dame of french fashion , once said about her work .
" it must accompany its wearer and when a woman smiles , the dress must smile with her . " haute couture remains unique and any standardization is strictly taboo : it 's fashion that beautifies drooping shoulders , hides crane-like necks and creates the perfect décolleté . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hennes & mauritz store in brussels but the luxury comes at a steep price : day dresses cost about € 15,000 , an evening gown starts at € 35,000 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.07.2004 germans mull fifty-hour workweek großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions are fighting to keep a weekly work time of 35 hours in a move that will surely raise the hackles of germany ’ s labor unions , two leading economic and industry figures proposed introducing a 50-hour workweek as a means to reduce the country ’ s staggering unemployment rate . the suggestion is part of a reform debate in germany on how to cut costs to make the world ’ s third largest economy more competitive in the global market . the problem is two-fold .
germany is losing jobs to lower wage countries and consumers at home , who are either unemployed because of the job-drain or worried about losing work , are n't loosening their purse strings either . the result is devastating for the german economy , which has been more or less stagnant over recent years .
exacerbating the problem are pension and health reforms introduced by the social democrat-green party government which mean less money in retirement and higher healthcare costs for patients . the upshot is that germany has found itself in a vicious circle .
if it reduces government spending , taxpayers will have fewer services or have to pay more .
but with lower wages and an uncertain future , people will not be able to pay for the essential goods and services they need . will a longer workweek save jobs ? for literally years now , the question has been : how to solve this dilemma ?
the latest remedial suggestion comes from klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research and ulrich ramm , chief economist at germany ’ s third largest bank , commerzbank . both men have proposed introducing a 50-hour workweek to prevent even more jobs being exported to low-wage countries .
ramm said he thinks germany has room for more jobs , but they have to be affordable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high wages make production in germany more expensive than in other countries .
" i can see a realistic chance for discussion and we should perhaps work a bit more because in germany we have a lack of payable labor and it 's not the lack of labor overall , " he said . in ramm ’ s view , the 50-hour workweek would not be permanent : by establishing a work-hour account of up to 50 hours for peak production periods , when production slowed , employees could work 30 hours instead for the same pay , he said . michael hüther , director of the german economic institute , agreed with ramm ’ s assessment and argued for a generally more flexible workweek .
still others , like gerhard handke , from the german wholesale and foreign trade association , think workers should also give up a week ’ s vacation per year to make germany more competitive . handke pointed to ireland , where workers have just 20 days off a year , compared to six weeks in germany .
handke reduced the situation to a simple formula : you can not remain affluent and continue working less than everybody else . an " abstruse proposal " ? meanwhile , one of germany ’ s most prominent economists , peter bofinger , a professor at the university of würzburg and a member of germany ’ s prestigious group of economic advisers , known as the “ wise men , ” is opposed to a longer workweek .
he conceded that longer hours are good for business , but warns of dangerous deflationary pressures when consumer buying power declines : " working longer means there will be less purchasing power in the hands of workers and given that we have a problem with our domestic demand this problem will be aggravated , " he said .
" as the example of the japanese economy shows , if you reduce wages in a relatively large economy in order to boost employment , you get just the opposite effect . " bofinger , at least , can be sure of support from germany ’ s labor unions .
the head of the country ’ s construction and agriculture union , klaus wiesehügel , called the 50-hour week an " abstruse proposal " that would generate more unemployment . even the chairman of germany ’ s technology giant , siemens , heinrich von pierer , said that talk of a 50-hour week was not very helpful in the current climate and would make people more insecure . gregg benzow -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : the job market limps along the long-awaited and forever promised economic revival in germany is a major topic in the nation ’ s newspapers this wednesday .
unfortunately , most editors conclude , modest growth is n't enough to create new jobs .
-lrb- july 7 , 2004 -rrb- experts : longer work week already reality while germans are debating whether to extend the work week to help the country 's ailing economy , some experts say many employees already spend almost 40 hours on the job each week .

germany is losing jobs to lower wage countries and consumers at home , who are either unemployed because of the job-drain or worried about losing work , are n't loosening their purse strings either . the result is devastating for the german economy , which has been more or less stagnant over recent years .
exacerbating the problem are pension and health reforms introduced by the social democrat-green party government which mean less money in retirement and higher healthcare costs for patients . the upshot is that germany has found itself in a vicious circle .
if it reduces government spending , taxpayers will have fewer services or have to pay more .
but with lower wages and an uncertain future , people will not be able to pay for the essential goods and services they need . will a longer workweek save jobs ? for literally years now , the question has been : how to solve this dilemma ?
the latest remedial suggestion comes from klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research and ulrich ramm , chief economist at germany ’ s third largest bank , commerzbank . both men have proposed introducing a 50-hour workweek to prevent even more jobs being exported to low-wage countries .
ramm said he thinks germany has room for more jobs , but they have to be affordable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high wages make production in germany more expensive than in other countries .
" i can see a realistic chance for discussion and we should perhaps work a bit more because in germany we have a lack of payable labor and it 's not the lack of labor overall , " he said . in ramm ’ s view , the 50-hour workweek would not be permanent : by establishing a work-hour account of up to 50 hours for peak production periods , when production slowed , employees could work 30 hours instead for the same pay , he said . michael hüther , director of the german economic institute , agreed with ramm ’ s assessment and argued for a generally more flexible workweek .
still others , like gerhard handke , from the german wholesale and foreign trade association , think workers should also give up a week ’ s vacation per year to make germany more competitive . handke pointed to ireland , where workers have just 20 days off a year , compared to six weeks in germany .
handke reduced the situation to a simple formula : you can not remain affluent and continue working less than everybody else . an " abstruse proposal " ? meanwhile , one of germany ’ s most prominent economists , peter bofinger , a professor at the university of würzburg and a member of germany ’ s prestigious group of economic advisers , known as the “ wise men , ” is opposed to a longer workweek .
he conceded that longer hours are good for business , but warns of dangerous deflationary pressures when consumer buying power declines : " working longer means there will be less purchasing power in the hands of workers and given that we have a problem with our domestic demand this problem will be aggravated , " he said .
" as the example of the japanese economy shows , if you reduce wages in a relatively large economy in order to boost employment , you get just the opposite effect . " bofinger , at least , can be sure of support from germany ’ s labor unions .
the head of the country ’ s construction and agriculture union , klaus wiesehügel , called the 50-hour week an " abstruse proposal " that would generate more unemployment . even the chairman of germany ’ s technology giant , siemens , heinrich von pierer , said that talk of a 50-hour week was not very helpful in the current climate and would make people more insecure . gregg benzow -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : the job market limps along the long-awaited and forever promised economic revival in germany is a major topic in the nation ’ s newspapers this wednesday .
unfortunately , most editors conclude , modest growth is n't enough to create new jobs .
-lrb- july 7 , 2004 -rrb- experts : longer work week already reality while germans are debating whether to extend the work week to help the country 's ailing economy , some experts say many employees already spend almost 40 hours on the job each week .

"
he 's since pulled out of the business of selling deluxe dresses - just like many of his colleagues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yves saint laurent 's 2002 farewell show long gone are the days , when fabulously rich ladies ordered haute couture outfits by the dozen .
the value of brands is all that 's left of the " high art of tailoring . " " fashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months , " oscar wilde , the irish dandy and writer , remarked more than a century ago .
he was talking about prêt-a-porter collections , i.e. ready-to-wear , mass-produced clothing , for which haute couture remains the trend-setter . cheap advertising as a source of income , haute couture itself has become meaningless and only accounts for about 3 percent of revenues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : versace for the masses but the luxury lines are the perfect advertising gimmick : cosmetics , perfumes and accessories are sold by evoking the image of a brand 's star creations . " producing such a collection costs less money than a global advertising campaign , " said didier grumbach , president of the french fashion association , the federation francaise de la couture .
fashion houses still invest between € 500,000 -lrb- $ 617,000 -rrb- and € 2 million to put on a 20-minute haute couture show . those that keep doing it , that is : during its heydays in the 1950s , 23 paris fashion houses presented haute couture collections - soon only seven will be left : chanel , christian dior , christian lacroix , jean-paul gaultier , louis scherrer , dominique sirop and torrente . japanese fashion designer hanae mori , 78 , the first foreigner to be admitted into french fashion 's governing body , the chambre syndicale de la haute couture , showed her last collection on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-name bridal gowns at a wedding show " haute couture no longer responds to the needs of today 's women , " emanuel ungaro said when announcing his decision to drop designing luxury dresses and devote his entire attention to prêt-a-porter collections instead . a globalized fashion world ungaro is now longer his own master , anyway : back in 1996 , the italian fashion concern salvatore ferragamo - producer of luxury shoes , bags , accessories , watches and perfumes - had already taken over the brand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jennifer lopez is n't the only who likes louis vuitton bags christian dior , christian lacroix and givenchy on the other hand all belong to the world 's largest luxury conglomerate , lvmh -lrb- louis vuitton moet hennessy -rrb- , which still sells some haute couture in select boutiques .
the company 's revenues come mainly from the sale of wine , liquor , prêt-a-porter fashion and leather goods . hermes , synonymous with high-end accessories and perfumes , holds 35 percent of shares of jean-paul gaultier .
yves saint laurent has been taken over by sanoli .
jean-louis scherrer left his company after 30 years when seibu from japan took over . versace has also dropped haute couture for a pragmatic reason : after losses in 2002 , the company simply did n't have enough money to put on a show . balmain fashion house , founded in 1914 , is bankrupt but still hopes for a revival .
givenchy has nothing to offer , because the company is still looking for a successor for its former british chief designer , julien macdonald . faking it " the dress must not hang on the body but follow its lines , " madelein vionnet , grande dame of french fashion , once said about her work .
" it must accompany its wearer and when a woman smiles , the dress must smile with her . " haute couture remains unique and any standardization is strictly taboo : it 's fashion that beautifies drooping shoulders , hides crane-like necks and creates the perfect décolleté . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hennes & mauritz store in brussels but the luxury comes at a steep price : day dresses cost about € 15,000 , an evening gown starts at € 35,000 .
is it worth that ?
even the super rich have begun to get stingy and turn to small tailors who will copy the original for a fraction of the price . fashion discounters such as zara and h & m also look at the collections for inspiration .

the court ruled that he should be moved after doctors carrying out tests on him came to the conclusion he was suffering a mental illness . mijailovic would have gone to prison for 15 years , the normal term in sweden for those sentenced to life , but now he faces being placed in a psychiatric institute for criminals .
however , there are no time limits for psychiatric patients , and some experts say he could be set free in a matter of months if deemed healthy .
initial assessment labelled killer sane bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the time of his arrest , mijailovic was assessed for psychiatric problems but the initial assessment concluded he was not mentally ill when he stabbed lindh on sept .
10 last year while she was out shopping in a stockholm department store .
the hugely popular minister died of her injuries a day later . while the appeals court said that 25-year-old mijailovic was a " traumatized person with significant psychiatric problems " and needed psychiatric care , it did uphold the guilty verdict for the murder of lindh .
mijailovic 's legal team had hoped to have the charge reduced to manslaughter arguing that their defendant had not intended to kill the politician . lawyers called lindh 's murder " coincidence " lawyer peter althin had told the court mijailovic had heard voices telling him to attack lindh , but that they said nothing about killing her and added that the killing was an " impulsive act " and that it was a " coincidence " mijailovic 's victim was anna lindh . however , the court took a different view , ruling : " it has been proven that mijailo mijailovic was completely indifferent as to whether anna lindh would die of her stab wounds and he therefore had intent to kill .

if approved , the u.k. would become the biggest net contributor of eu funds . britain is preparing to face off with its eu partners over plans to bring its € 3 billion eu budget rebate to an end and make britain the largest net contributor to eu funds , relative to the size of its economy .
the european commission 's plans for the budgetary period from 2007-2013 , drawn up by german budgetary commissioner michaele schreyer , would bring to a close the rebate which has been in place since 1984 .
if it is abolished , britain will become the biggest contributor to the eu 's € 100 billion a year budget and contribute 0.51 percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , compared to 0.35 for italy and 0.31 percent for france , countries of a similar size and wealth .
the rebate was originally introduced as compensation for britain which paid much more into eu coffers than it got back , largely because it benefited less than other member states from the common agricultural policy .
prime minister margaret thatcher secured the deal with german chancellor helmut kohl and french president francois mitterrand after famously demanding : " i want my money back . "
funds for new states prompt rethink but the introduction of ten new member states in may means that new eu regional and structural funds go largely to the accession countries , narrowing the net contributions gap between britain and other veteran members .
the commission says that if things are not changed , britain would pay just 0.25 percent of its gdp to the eu between 2007 and 2013 , compared with , for example , 0.56 percent for the netherlands and 0.54 percent for germany .
" the uk is going to become the smallest net contributor to the eu budget ... as a result , the current system of a correction reserved exclusively for the uk can not continue , " schreyer told reporters .
instead , brussels proposes a " general refund mechanism , " which would share out the rebate equally between all member states whose contributions to the eu exceed 0.35 percent of their gdp . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new plans to ease burden on eu net contributors the idea was proposed at an informal meeting of finance ministers and would go some way to easing concerns of net contributors to the eu budget that they are being asked to pay too much into the union 's coffers .

if approved , the u.k. would become the biggest net contributor of eu funds . britain is preparing to face off with its eu partners over plans to bring its € 3 billion eu budget rebate to an end and make britain the largest net contributor to eu funds , relative to the size of its economy .
the european commission 's plans for the budgetary period from 2007-2013 , drawn up by german budgetary commissioner michaele schreyer , would bring to a close the rebate which has been in place since 1984 .
if it is abolished , britain will become the biggest contributor to the eu 's € 100 billion a year budget and contribute 0.51 percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , compared to 0.35 for italy and 0.31 percent for france , countries of a similar size and wealth .
the rebate was originally introduced as compensation for britain which paid much more into eu coffers than it got back , largely because it benefited less than other member states from the common agricultural policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.07.2004 german firms head to russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder comes to russia on thursday accompanied by a delegation of businessmen , german chancellor gerhard schröder is visiting russia on thursday .
the message : larger german firms are already successful there and smaller ones should follow suit . after the russian economy collapsed in 1998 , the import and export industries likewise suffered .
in the meantime , however , little evidence remains of those troubled times , and russia presents a significant opportunity for german companies - both large and small . " the russian market is growing at an annual rate of 6 to 8 percent , and that 's particularly exciting for producers of consumer products , " says manfred sapper of the berlin-based german society for east european studies -lrb- dgo -rrb- .
as a result , german-russian trade is on the rise : last year trade volume between the two countries reached a record high of € 25.5 billion -lrb- $ 30.9 billion -rrb- . this trend is mirrored in trade relations between the whole of the european union and russia - 50 percent of all imports to russia come from the eu .
the only problem , according to sapper , is the fact that there is a massive trade imbalance between the eu and russia .
only five percent of the goods imported to the eu come from russia . the metro-group on the advance the düsseldorf-based retailer metro group is one of the largest german investors in russia .
the company stocks many of the consumer products russia 's 145 million inhabitants are looking to buy , and that 's proven to be a recipe for success . hans-joachim körber , the head of metro , is a prominent member of the delegation accompanying the chancellor on his trip to russia .
" we have been successful in russia since 2001 , " says jürgen homeyer , a spokesman for the metro-group . the large german retailer has five stores in moscow and two in st. petersburg .
to hear homeyer tell it , the metro group 's experience in russia has been nothing but positive .
" after just two years , our affiliates were already in the black , " he says .
" of course , our investments totalling more than € 15 million per store have not been redeemed yet , but we are still growing . " 90 percent of products produced in russia " in the coming year , we will increase the number of metro stores to 17 , " says homeyer .
but his company is not just in it for a short-term profit , he says .
they are looking to build-up stable long-term relations .
" in most cases , we buy the land we build our stores on , invest in the local infrastructure , create jobs , and 90 percent of the goods we sell come from russia , " he says . for homeyer , that explains why his company is so beloved in russia .
" the moscow mayor has been particularly supportive , " he says .
for other firms hoping to break into the russian market , the metro group 's experience sounds like a dream .
but , warns homeyer , it 's important to spend the time researching the market . warning : get expert advice it 's not all cinderella stories , as seems to have been the case for the metro group .
the russian market does pose certain risks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.07.2004 german firms head to russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder comes to russia on thursday accompanied by a delegation of businessmen , german chancellor gerhard schröder is visiting russia on thursday .
the message : larger german firms are already successful there and smaller ones should follow suit . after the russian economy collapsed in 1998 , the import and export industries likewise suffered .
in the meantime , however , little evidence remains of those troubled times , and russia presents a significant opportunity for german companies - both large and small . " the russian market is growing at an annual rate of 6 to 8 percent , and that 's particularly exciting for producers of consumer products , " says manfred sapper of the berlin-based german society for east european studies -lrb- dgo -rrb- .
as a result , german-russian trade is on the rise : last year trade volume between the two countries reached a record high of € 25.5 billion -lrb- $ 30.9 billion -rrb- . this trend is mirrored in trade relations between the whole of the european union and russia - 50 percent of all imports to russia come from the eu .
the only problem , according to sapper , is the fact that there is a massive trade imbalance between the eu and russia .
only five percent of the goods imported to the eu come from russia . the metro-group on the advance the düsseldorf-based retailer metro group is one of the largest german investors in russia .
the company stocks many of the consumer products russia 's 145 million inhabitants are looking to buy , and that 's proven to be a recipe for success . hans-joachim körber , the head of metro , is a prominent member of the delegation accompanying the chancellor on his trip to russia .
" we have been successful in russia since 2001 , " says jürgen homeyer , a spokesman for the metro-group . the large german retailer has five stores in moscow and two in st. petersburg .
to hear homeyer tell it , the metro group 's experience in russia has been nothing but positive .
" after just two years , our affiliates were already in the black , " he says .
" of course , our investments totalling more than € 15 million per store have not been redeemed yet , but we are still growing . " 90 percent of products produced in russia " in the coming year , we will increase the number of metro stores to 17 , " says homeyer .
but his company is not just in it for a short-term profit , he says .
they are looking to build-up stable long-term relations .
" in most cases , we buy the land we build our stores on , invest in the local infrastructure , create jobs , and 90 percent of the goods we sell come from russia , " he says . for homeyer , that explains why his company is so beloved in russia .
" the moscow mayor has been particularly supportive , " he says .
for other firms hoping to break into the russian market , the metro group 's experience sounds like a dream .
but , warns homeyer , it 's important to spend the time researching the market . warning : get expert advice it 's not all cinderella stories , as seems to have been the case for the metro group .
the russian market does pose certain risks .
smaller firms hoping to follow-up on the success of larger forerunners should seek expert advice , say those familiar with the pitfalls . " these companies should look for advice early , so they have a realistic understanding of the conditions of the russian market , " says peter presber , an expert on russia for the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .

if approved , the u.k. would become the biggest net contributor of eu funds . britain is preparing to face off with its eu partners over plans to bring its € 3 billion eu budget rebate to an end and make britain the largest net contributor to eu funds , relative to the size of its economy .
the european commission 's plans for the budgetary period from 2007-2013 , drawn up by german budgetary commissioner michaele schreyer , would bring to a close the rebate which has been in place since 1984 .
if it is abolished , britain will become the biggest contributor to the eu 's € 100 billion a year budget and contribute 0.51 percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , compared to 0.35 for italy and 0.31 percent for france , countries of a similar size and wealth .
the rebate was originally introduced as compensation for britain which paid much more into eu coffers than it got back , largely because it benefited less than other member states from the common agricultural policy .
prime minister margaret thatcher secured the deal with german chancellor helmut kohl and french president francois mitterrand after famously demanding : " i want my money back . "
funds for new states prompt rethink but the introduction of ten new member states in may means that new eu regional and structural funds go largely to the accession countries , narrowing the net contributions gap between britain and other veteran members .
the commission says that if things are not changed , britain would pay just 0.25 percent of its gdp to the eu between 2007 and 2013 , compared with , for example , 0.56 percent for the netherlands and 0.54 percent for germany .
" the uk is going to become the smallest net contributor to the eu budget ... as a result , the current system of a correction reserved exclusively for the uk can not continue , " schreyer told reporters .
instead , brussels proposes a " general refund mechanism , " which would share out the rebate equally between all member states whose contributions to the eu exceed 0.35 percent of their gdp . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new plans to ease burden on eu net contributors the idea was proposed at an informal meeting of finance ministers and would go some way to easing concerns of net contributors to the eu budget that they are being asked to pay too much into the union 's coffers .

the court ruled that he should be moved after doctors carrying out tests on him came to the conclusion he was suffering a mental illness . mijailovic would have gone to prison for 15 years , the normal term in sweden for those sentenced to life , but now he faces being placed in a psychiatric institute for criminals .
however , there are no time limits for psychiatric patients , and some experts say he could be set free in a matter of months if deemed healthy .
initial assessment labelled killer sane bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the time of his arrest , mijailovic was assessed for psychiatric problems but the initial assessment concluded he was not mentally ill when he stabbed lindh on sept .

the hugely popular minister died of her injuries a day later . while the appeals court said that 25-year-old mijailovic was a " traumatized person with significant psychiatric problems " and needed psychiatric care , it did uphold the guilty verdict for the murder of lindh .
mijailovic 's legal team had hoped to have the charge reduced to manslaughter arguing that their defendant had not intended to kill the politician . lawyers called lindh 's murder " coincidence " lawyer peter althin had told the court mijailovic had heard voices telling him to attack lindh , but that they said nothing about killing her and added that the killing was an " impulsive act " and that it was a " coincidence " mijailovic 's victim was anna lindh . however , the court took a different view , ruling : " it has been proven that mijailo mijailovic was completely indifferent as to whether anna lindh would die of her stab wounds and he therefore had intent to kill .

germany is losing jobs to lower wage countries and consumers at home , who are either unemployed because of the job-drain or worried about losing work , are n't loosening their purse strings either . the result is devastating for the german economy , which has been more or less stagnant over recent years .
exacerbating the problem are pension and health reforms introduced by the social democrat-green party government which mean less money in retirement and higher healthcare costs for patients . the upshot is that germany has found itself in a vicious circle .
if it reduces government spending , taxpayers will have fewer services or have to pay more .
but with lower wages and an uncertain future , people will not be able to pay for the essential goods and services they need . will a longer workweek save jobs ? for literally years now , the question has been : how to solve this dilemma ?
the latest remedial suggestion comes from klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research and ulrich ramm , chief economist at germany ’ s third largest bank , commerzbank . both men have proposed introducing a 50-hour workweek to prevent even more jobs being exported to low-wage countries .
ramm said he thinks germany has room for more jobs , but they have to be affordable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high wages make production in germany more expensive than in other countries .
" i can see a realistic chance for discussion and we should perhaps work a bit more because in germany we have a lack of payable labor and it 's not the lack of labor overall , " he said . in ramm ’ s view , the 50-hour workweek would not be permanent : by establishing a work-hour account of up to 50 hours for peak production periods , when production slowed , employees could work 30 hours instead for the same pay , he said . michael hüther , director of the german economic institute , agreed with ramm ’ s assessment and argued for a generally more flexible workweek .
still others , like gerhard handke , from the german wholesale and foreign trade association , think workers should also give up a week ’ s vacation per year to make germany more competitive . handke pointed to ireland , where workers have just 20 days off a year , compared to six weeks in germany .
handke reduced the situation to a simple formula : you can not remain affluent and continue working less than everybody else . an " abstruse proposal " ? meanwhile , one of germany ’ s most prominent economists , peter bofinger , a professor at the university of würzburg and a member of germany ’ s prestigious group of economic advisers , known as the “ wise men , ” is opposed to a longer workweek .
he conceded that longer hours are good for business , but warns of dangerous deflationary pressures when consumer buying power declines : " working longer means there will be less purchasing power in the hands of workers and given that we have a problem with our domestic demand this problem will be aggravated , " he said .
" as the example of the japanese economy shows , if you reduce wages in a relatively large economy in order to boost employment , you get just the opposite effect . " bofinger , at least , can be sure of support from germany ’ s labor unions .
the head of the country ’ s construction and agriculture union , klaus wiesehügel , called the 50-hour week an " abstruse proposal " that would generate more unemployment . even the chairman of germany ’ s technology giant , siemens , heinrich von pierer , said that talk of a 50-hour week was not very helpful in the current climate and would make people more insecure . gregg benzow -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : the job market limps along the long-awaited and forever promised economic revival in germany is a major topic in the nation ’ s newspapers this wednesday .

"
he 's since pulled out of the business of selling deluxe dresses - just like many of his colleagues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yves saint laurent 's 2002 farewell show long gone are the days , when fabulously rich ladies ordered haute couture outfits by the dozen .
the value of brands is all that 's left of the " high art of tailoring . " " fashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months , " oscar wilde , the irish dandy and writer , remarked more than a century ago .
he was talking about prêt-a-porter collections , i.e. ready-to-wear , mass-produced clothing , for which haute couture remains the trend-setter . cheap advertising as a source of income , haute couture itself has become meaningless and only accounts for about 3 percent of revenues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : versace for the masses but the luxury lines are the perfect advertising gimmick : cosmetics , perfumes and accessories are sold by evoking the image of a brand 's star creations . " producing such a collection costs less money than a global advertising campaign , " said didier grumbach , president of the french fashion association , the federation francaise de la couture .
fashion houses still invest between € 500,000 -lrb- $ 617,000 -rrb- and € 2 million to put on a 20-minute haute couture show . those that keep doing it , that is : during its heydays in the 1950s , 23 paris fashion houses presented haute couture collections - soon only seven will be left : chanel , christian dior , christian lacroix , jean-paul gaultier , louis scherrer , dominique sirop and torrente . japanese fashion designer hanae mori , 78 , the first foreigner to be admitted into french fashion 's governing body , the chambre syndicale de la haute couture , showed her last collection on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-name bridal gowns at a wedding show " haute couture no longer responds to the needs of today 's women , " emanuel ungaro said when announcing his decision to drop designing luxury dresses and devote his entire attention to prêt-a-porter collections instead . a globalized fashion world ungaro is now longer his own master , anyway : back in 1996 , the italian fashion concern salvatore ferragamo - producer of luxury shoes , bags , accessories , watches and perfumes - had already taken over the brand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jennifer lopez is n't the only who likes louis vuitton bags christian dior , christian lacroix and givenchy on the other hand all belong to the world 's largest luxury conglomerate , lvmh -lrb- louis vuitton moet hennessy -rrb- , which still sells some haute couture in select boutiques .
the company 's revenues come mainly from the sale of wine , liquor , prêt-a-porter fashion and leather goods . hermes , synonymous with high-end accessories and perfumes , holds 35 percent of shares of jean-paul gaultier .
yves saint laurent has been taken over by sanoli .
jean-louis scherrer left his company after 30 years when seibu from japan took over . versace has also dropped haute couture for a pragmatic reason : after losses in 2002 , the company simply did n't have enough money to put on a show . balmain fashion house , founded in 1914 , is bankrupt but still hopes for a revival .
givenchy has nothing to offer , because the company is still looking for a successor for its former british chief designer , julien macdonald . faking it " the dress must not hang on the body but follow its lines , " madelein vionnet , grande dame of french fashion , once said about her work .
" it must accompany its wearer and when a woman smiles , the dress must smile with her . " haute couture remains unique and any standardization is strictly taboo : it 's fashion that beautifies drooping shoulders , hides crane-like necks and creates the perfect décolleté . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hennes & mauritz store in brussels but the luxury comes at a steep price : day dresses cost about € 15,000 , an evening gown starts at € 35,000 .
is it worth that ?
even the super rich have begun to get stingy and turn to small tailors who will copy the original for a fraction of the price . fashion discounters such as zara and h & m also look at the collections for inspiration .
grumbach of the federation francaise de la couture bemoans the development - but there 's very little he can do to keep it from happening . ingun arnold -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lagerfeld at h & m : couture goes to the mall haute couture demigod karl lagerfeld has announced he 's designing a line of clothing for the swedish cut-rate retailer hennes & mauritz , h & m. the german-born designer for chanel and fendi insists he 's not just slumming .
-lrb- june 29 , 2004 -rrb- shopping with style and bucking the low-spender trend from " trend shopper " to " styler " , consumer sociologists are mapping the various types of german consumers , a boon to the country 's struggling retail industry .

germany is losing jobs to lower wage countries and consumers at home , who are either unemployed because of the job-drain or worried about losing work , are n't loosening their purse strings either . the result is devastating for the german economy , which has been more or less stagnant over recent years .
exacerbating the problem are pension and health reforms introduced by the social democrat-green party government which mean less money in retirement and higher healthcare costs for patients . the upshot is that germany has found itself in a vicious circle .
if it reduces government spending , taxpayers will have fewer services or have to pay more .
but with lower wages and an uncertain future , people will not be able to pay for the essential goods and services they need . will a longer workweek save jobs ? for literally years now , the question has been : how to solve this dilemma ?
the latest remedial suggestion comes from klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research and ulrich ramm , chief economist at germany ’ s third largest bank , commerzbank . both men have proposed introducing a 50-hour workweek to prevent even more jobs being exported to low-wage countries .
ramm said he thinks germany has room for more jobs , but they have to be affordable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high wages make production in germany more expensive than in other countries .
" i can see a realistic chance for discussion and we should perhaps work a bit more because in germany we have a lack of payable labor and it 's not the lack of labor overall , " he said . in ramm ’ s view , the 50-hour workweek would not be permanent : by establishing a work-hour account of up to 50 hours for peak production periods , when production slowed , employees could work 30 hours instead for the same pay , he said . michael hüther , director of the german economic institute , agreed with ramm ’ s assessment and argued for a generally more flexible workweek .
still others , like gerhard handke , from the german wholesale and foreign trade association , think workers should also give up a week ’ s vacation per year to make germany more competitive . handke pointed to ireland , where workers have just 20 days off a year , compared to six weeks in germany .
handke reduced the situation to a simple formula : you can not remain affluent and continue working less than everybody else . an " abstruse proposal " ? meanwhile , one of germany ’ s most prominent economists , peter bofinger , a professor at the university of würzburg and a member of germany ’ s prestigious group of economic advisers , known as the “ wise men , ” is opposed to a longer workweek .
he conceded that longer hours are good for business , but warns of dangerous deflationary pressures when consumer buying power declines : " working longer means there will be less purchasing power in the hands of workers and given that we have a problem with our domestic demand this problem will be aggravated , " he said .
" as the example of the japanese economy shows , if you reduce wages in a relatively large economy in order to boost employment , you get just the opposite effect . " bofinger , at least , can be sure of support from germany ’ s labor unions .
the head of the country ’ s construction and agriculture union , klaus wiesehügel , called the 50-hour week an " abstruse proposal " that would generate more unemployment . even the chairman of germany ’ s technology giant , siemens , heinrich von pierer , said that talk of a 50-hour week was not very helpful in the current climate and would make people more insecure . gregg benzow -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : the job market limps along the long-awaited and forever promised economic revival in germany is a major topic in the nation ’ s newspapers this wednesday .
unfortunately , most editors conclude , modest growth is n't enough to create new jobs .
-lrb- july 7 , 2004 -rrb- experts : longer work week already reality while germans are debating whether to extend the work week to help the country 's ailing economy , some experts say many employees already spend almost 40 hours on the job each week .
-lrb- june 29 , 2004 -rrb- siemens secures longer working hours with siemens threatening to relocate jobs to eastern europe , the powerful ig metall caved-in on a sacred issue : the 35-hour work week .
this could be the start of a trend towards longer hours for workers across germany .

germany is losing jobs to lower wage countries and consumers at home , who are either unemployed because of the job-drain or worried about losing work , are n't loosening their purse strings either . the result is devastating for the german economy , which has been more or less stagnant over recent years .
exacerbating the problem are pension and health reforms introduced by the social democrat-green party government which mean less money in retirement and higher healthcare costs for patients . the upshot is that germany has found itself in a vicious circle .
if it reduces government spending , taxpayers will have fewer services or have to pay more .
but with lower wages and an uncertain future , people will not be able to pay for the essential goods and services they need . will a longer workweek save jobs ? for literally years now , the question has been : how to solve this dilemma ?
the latest remedial suggestion comes from klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research and ulrich ramm , chief economist at germany ’ s third largest bank , commerzbank . both men have proposed introducing a 50-hour workweek to prevent even more jobs being exported to low-wage countries .
ramm said he thinks germany has room for more jobs , but they have to be affordable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high wages make production in germany more expensive than in other countries .
" i can see a realistic chance for discussion and we should perhaps work a bit more because in germany we have a lack of payable labor and it 's not the lack of labor overall , " he said . in ramm ’ s view , the 50-hour workweek would not be permanent : by establishing a work-hour account of up to 50 hours for peak production periods , when production slowed , employees could work 30 hours instead for the same pay , he said . michael hüther , director of the german economic institute , agreed with ramm ’ s assessment and argued for a generally more flexible workweek .
still others , like gerhard handke , from the german wholesale and foreign trade association , think workers should also give up a week ’ s vacation per year to make germany more competitive . handke pointed to ireland , where workers have just 20 days off a year , compared to six weeks in germany .
handke reduced the situation to a simple formula : you can not remain affluent and continue working less than everybody else . an " abstruse proposal " ? meanwhile , one of germany ’ s most prominent economists , peter bofinger , a professor at the university of würzburg and a member of germany ’ s prestigious group of economic advisers , known as the “ wise men , ” is opposed to a longer workweek .
he conceded that longer hours are good for business , but warns of dangerous deflationary pressures when consumer buying power declines : " working longer means there will be less purchasing power in the hands of workers and given that we have a problem with our domestic demand this problem will be aggravated , " he said .
" as the example of the japanese economy shows , if you reduce wages in a relatively large economy in order to boost employment , you get just the opposite effect . " bofinger , at least , can be sure of support from germany ’ s labor unions .
the head of the country ’ s construction and agriculture union , klaus wiesehügel , called the 50-hour week an " abstruse proposal " that would generate more unemployment . even the chairman of germany ’ s technology giant , siemens , heinrich von pierer , said that talk of a 50-hour week was not very helpful in the current climate and would make people more insecure . gregg benzow -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : the job market limps along the long-awaited and forever promised economic revival in germany is a major topic in the nation ’ s newspapers this wednesday .
unfortunately , most editors conclude , modest growth is n't enough to create new jobs .
-lrb- july 7 , 2004 -rrb- experts : longer work week already reality while germans are debating whether to extend the work week to help the country 's ailing economy , some experts say many employees already spend almost 40 hours on the job each week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.07.2004 german firms head to russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder comes to russia on thursday accompanied by a delegation of businessmen , german chancellor gerhard schröder is visiting russia on thursday .
the message : larger german firms are already successful there and smaller ones should follow suit . after the russian economy collapsed in 1998 , the import and export industries likewise suffered .
in the meantime , however , little evidence remains of those troubled times , and russia presents a significant opportunity for german companies - both large and small . " the russian market is growing at an annual rate of 6 to 8 percent , and that 's particularly exciting for producers of consumer products , " says manfred sapper of the berlin-based german society for east european studies -lrb- dgo -rrb- .
as a result , german-russian trade is on the rise : last year trade volume between the two countries reached a record high of € 25.5 billion -lrb- $ 30.9 billion -rrb- . this trend is mirrored in trade relations between the whole of the european union and russia - 50 percent of all imports to russia come from the eu .
the only problem , according to sapper , is the fact that there is a massive trade imbalance between the eu and russia .
only five percent of the goods imported to the eu come from russia . the metro-group on the advance the düsseldorf-based retailer metro group is one of the largest german investors in russia .
the company stocks many of the consumer products russia 's 145 million inhabitants are looking to buy , and that 's proven to be a recipe for success . hans-joachim körber , the head of metro , is a prominent member of the delegation accompanying the chancellor on his trip to russia .
" we have been successful in russia since 2001 , " says jürgen homeyer , a spokesman for the metro-group . the large german retailer has five stores in moscow and two in st. petersburg .
to hear homeyer tell it , the metro group 's experience in russia has been nothing but positive .
" after just two years , our affiliates were already in the black , " he says .
" of course , our investments totalling more than € 15 million per store have not been redeemed yet , but we are still growing . " 90 percent of products produced in russia " in the coming year , we will increase the number of metro stores to 17 , " says homeyer .
but his company is not just in it for a short-term profit , he says .
they are looking to build-up stable long-term relations .
" in most cases , we buy the land we build our stores on , invest in the local infrastructure , create jobs , and 90 percent of the goods we sell come from russia , " he says . for homeyer , that explains why his company is so beloved in russia .
" the moscow mayor has been particularly supportive , " he says .
for other firms hoping to break into the russian market , the metro group 's experience sounds like a dream .
but , warns homeyer , it 's important to spend the time researching the market . warning : get expert advice it 's not all cinderella stories , as seems to have been the case for the metro group .
the russian market does pose certain risks .
smaller firms hoping to follow-up on the success of larger forerunners should seek expert advice , say those familiar with the pitfalls . " these companies should look for advice early , so they have a realistic understanding of the conditions of the russian market , " says peter presber , an expert on russia for the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
" there are huge differences between german and russian bureaucracy and corruption remains a problem , " he says . the fate of yukos , one of russia 's largest oil producers , for example , has made some foreign investors weary . they fear the arrest of the company 's former head , mikhail khodorkovsky , which caused the russian stock market to take a tumble , was politically motivated .
on wednesday night the saga continued , and bailiffs moved in on the yukos main offices after a midnight deadline passed for the company to pay a $ 3.4 billion tax bill from 2000 .
the move is likely to force the company into bankruptcy . on the other hand , presber does credit the russians with making improvements .
" in the last five or six years , numerous new laws have been passed that have improved the situation for foreign companies , " he says .
for presber and company at the dihk , the time is right to invest in russia : " the market is growing , and german companies should grow with it .

the neighbors have issues of a failing democracy and economy to resolve . officials from the european union and the ukraine are meeting on thursday in the hague to discuss the relationship between the ukraine and the recently expanded eu .
the europeans are expected to pose some serious questions about the failing standards of democracy under the government of leonid kutschma , with many eu politicians loath to see him remain in office . the ukraine is beginning to look like the eu 's problem neighbor .
the former soviet republic has been described in brussels as a nation with failing democratic standards , which are becoming very noticeable as the country prepares for a presidential election in october . president criticized for democratic failures kutschma , the current ukraine president , has been criticized for many shortcomings in the running of a free market economy and the media coverage of the suspicious murder of journalist georgiy gongadze .
senior political and security figures have been implicated in the killing and many see it as a government effort to muzzle the press . the case of the murdered journalist has become a sticking point in bilateral talks - with the ukraine telling the eu to mind its own business while the eu cites it as a clear case of democratic deficiency in the ukraine .
brussels is slowly losing its patience and is hoping the elections in october will bring about positive change . “ we expect that the new president will follow the principles of an open-market economy , " eu member of parliament elisabeth schrödter told deutsche welle .
" we expect that the decision made by the ukrainian parliament , that ukrainian legislation will be adapted to conform to eu laws , will be put into practice .
we hope for concrete strategies in this respect and not just empty words . ” ukraine wants economic acknowledgement at thursday 's summit , the ukrainian government expects europe to tackle this thorny topic and acknowledge the country as a free market economy , which would also facilitate the ukraine ’ s entry to the world trade organization .
however , eu officials say they have had trouble finding reliable negotiators on the ukrainian side and a resolution may again be impossible at this stage . brussels will be watching the presidential elections in the ukraine closely .
most believe that a full change of government and policies in the ukraine is necessary for it to soldify the footing of its relationship with the eu . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de market status to come soon for ukraine during a meeting with ukraine 's premier viktor yanukovych , prodi hinted that the eu could grant ukraine its long sought-after market status at the forthcoming eu-ukraine ministerial meeting in july .

the neighbors have issues of a failing democracy and economy to resolve . officials from the european union and the ukraine are meeting on thursday in the hague to discuss the relationship between the ukraine and the recently expanded eu .
the europeans are expected to pose some serious questions about the failing standards of democracy under the government of leonid kutschma , with many eu politicians loath to see him remain in office . the ukraine is beginning to look like the eu 's problem neighbor .
the former soviet republic has been described in brussels as a nation with failing democratic standards , which are becoming very noticeable as the country prepares for a presidential election in october . president criticized for democratic failures kutschma , the current ukraine president , has been criticized for many shortcomings in the running of a free market economy and the media coverage of the suspicious murder of journalist georgiy gongadze .
senior political and security figures have been implicated in the killing and many see it as a government effort to muzzle the press . the case of the murdered journalist has become a sticking point in bilateral talks - with the ukraine telling the eu to mind its own business while the eu cites it as a clear case of democratic deficiency in the ukraine .
brussels is slowly losing its patience and is hoping the elections in october will bring about positive change . “ we expect that the new president will follow the principles of an open-market economy , " eu member of parliament elisabeth schrödter told deutsche welle .
" we expect that the decision made by the ukrainian parliament , that ukrainian legislation will be adapted to conform to eu laws , will be put into practice .
we hope for concrete strategies in this respect and not just empty words . ” ukraine wants economic acknowledgement at thursday 's summit , the ukrainian government expects europe to tackle this thorny topic and acknowledge the country as a free market economy , which would also facilitate the ukraine ’ s entry to the world trade organization .
however , eu officials say they have had trouble finding reliable negotiators on the ukrainian side and a resolution may again be impossible at this stage . brussels will be watching the presidential elections in the ukraine closely .
most believe that a full change of government and policies in the ukraine is necessary for it to soldify the footing of its relationship with the eu . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de market status to come soon for ukraine during a meeting with ukraine 's premier viktor yanukovych , prodi hinted that the eu could grant ukraine its long sought-after market status at the forthcoming eu-ukraine ministerial meeting in july .

ministers from the states of hesse , lower saxony and bavaria had already signaled their support for a federal database where information on suspects from all states would be combined with national files to build a comprehensive list of suspected terrorists in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal interior minister otto schily schily -lrb- photo -rrb- added that , up until now , the transfer of information between individual departments had been unsatisfactory .
the federal interior minister told the german magazine stern that everything must be done to ensure " that really every detail goes into the central file . " for several months now , the state-level office for the protection of the constitution intelligence agencies have been sparring with berlin over proposals to abolish the state offices and consolidate them at the federal level or in a smaller grouping of regional offices . liberals protest over too much transparency the opposition free democratic party liberals , however , rejected the claim for a central database .
the fdp 's spokesperson for domestic affairs , max städter , told the berliner zeitung that the fight against terrorism should go on but by following constitutional principles .
he argued that a central file would provide the intelligence agencies with access to domestic police files and therefore more than just the necessary information to investigate terror suspects .
städter instead suggested creating two separate databases . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schily calls for unity in war on terror german interior minister otto schily opened the european police congress in bonn on monday with a speech that demanded more cooperation and resilience from all sides collaborating in the fight against terrorism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.07.2004 germans mull fifty-hour workweek großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions are fighting to keep a weekly work time of 35 hours in a move that will surely raise the hackles of germany ’ s labor unions , two leading economic and industry figures proposed introducing a 50-hour workweek as a means to reduce the country ’ s staggering unemployment rate . the suggestion is part of a reform debate in germany on how to cut costs to make the world ’ s third largest economy more competitive in the global market . the problem is two-fold .
germany is losing jobs to lower wage countries and consumers at home , who are either unemployed because of the job-drain or worried about losing work , are n't loosening their purse strings either . the result is devastating for the german economy , which has been more or less stagnant over recent years .
exacerbating the problem are pension and health reforms introduced by the social democrat-green party government which mean less money in retirement and higher healthcare costs for patients . the upshot is that germany has found itself in a vicious circle .
if it reduces government spending , taxpayers will have fewer services or have to pay more .
but with lower wages and an uncertain future , people will not be able to pay for the essential goods and services they need . will a longer workweek save jobs ? for literally years now , the question has been : how to solve this dilemma ?
the latest remedial suggestion comes from klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research and ulrich ramm , chief economist at germany ’ s third largest bank , commerzbank . both men have proposed introducing a 50-hour workweek to prevent even more jobs being exported to low-wage countries .
ramm said he thinks germany has room for more jobs , but they have to be affordable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high wages make production in germany more expensive than in other countries .
" i can see a realistic chance for discussion and we should perhaps work a bit more because in germany we have a lack of payable labor and it 's not the lack of labor overall , " he said . in ramm ’ s view , the 50-hour workweek would not be permanent : by establishing a work-hour account of up to 50 hours for peak production periods , when production slowed , employees could work 30 hours instead for the same pay , he said . michael hüther , director of the german economic institute , agreed with ramm ’ s assessment and argued for a generally more flexible workweek .
still others , like gerhard handke , from the german wholesale and foreign trade association , think workers should also give up a week ’ s vacation per year to make germany more competitive . handke pointed to ireland , where workers have just 20 days off a year , compared to six weeks in germany .
handke reduced the situation to a simple formula : you can not remain affluent and continue working less than everybody else . an " abstruse proposal " ? meanwhile , one of germany ’ s most prominent economists , peter bofinger , a professor at the university of würzburg and a member of germany ’ s prestigious group of economic advisers , known as the “ wise men , ” is opposed to a longer workweek .

if approved , the u.k. would become the biggest net contributor of eu funds . britain is preparing to face off with its eu partners over plans to bring its € 3 billion eu budget rebate to an end and make britain the largest net contributor to eu funds , relative to the size of its economy .
the european commission 's plans for the budgetary period from 2007-2013 , drawn up by german budgetary commissioner michaele schreyer , would bring to a close the rebate which has been in place since 1984 .
if it is abolished , britain will become the biggest contributor to the eu 's € 100 billion a year budget and contribute 0.51 percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , compared to 0.35 for italy and 0.31 percent for france , countries of a similar size and wealth .
the rebate was originally introduced as compensation for britain which paid much more into eu coffers than it got back , largely because it benefited less than other member states from the common agricultural policy .
prime minister margaret thatcher secured the deal with german chancellor helmut kohl and french president francois mitterrand after famously demanding : " i want my money back . "
funds for new states prompt rethink but the introduction of ten new member states in may means that new eu regional and structural funds go largely to the accession countries , narrowing the net contributions gap between britain and other veteran members .
the commission says that if things are not changed , britain would pay just 0.25 percent of its gdp to the eu between 2007 and 2013 , compared with , for example , 0.56 percent for the netherlands and 0.54 percent for germany .
" the uk is going to become the smallest net contributor to the eu budget ... as a result , the current system of a correction reserved exclusively for the uk can not continue , " schreyer told reporters .
instead , brussels proposes a " general refund mechanism , " which would share out the rebate equally between all member states whose contributions to the eu exceed 0.35 percent of their gdp . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new plans to ease burden on eu net contributors the idea was proposed at an informal meeting of finance ministers and would go some way to easing concerns of net contributors to the eu budget that they are being asked to pay too much into the union 's coffers .

germany is losing jobs to lower wage countries and consumers at home , who are either unemployed because of the job-drain or worried about losing work , are n't loosening their purse strings either . the result is devastating for the german economy , which has been more or less stagnant over recent years .
exacerbating the problem are pension and health reforms introduced by the social democrat-green party government which mean less money in retirement and higher healthcare costs for patients . the upshot is that germany has found itself in a vicious circle .
if it reduces government spending , taxpayers will have fewer services or have to pay more .
but with lower wages and an uncertain future , people will not be able to pay for the essential goods and services they need . will a longer workweek save jobs ? for literally years now , the question has been : how to solve this dilemma ?
the latest remedial suggestion comes from klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research and ulrich ramm , chief economist at germany ’ s third largest bank , commerzbank . both men have proposed introducing a 50-hour workweek to prevent even more jobs being exported to low-wage countries .
ramm said he thinks germany has room for more jobs , but they have to be affordable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high wages make production in germany more expensive than in other countries .
" i can see a realistic chance for discussion and we should perhaps work a bit more because in germany we have a lack of payable labor and it 's not the lack of labor overall , " he said . in ramm ’ s view , the 50-hour workweek would not be permanent : by establishing a work-hour account of up to 50 hours for peak production periods , when production slowed , employees could work 30 hours instead for the same pay , he said . michael hüther , director of the german economic institute , agreed with ramm ’ s assessment and argued for a generally more flexible workweek .
still others , like gerhard handke , from the german wholesale and foreign trade association , think workers should also give up a week ’ s vacation per year to make germany more competitive . handke pointed to ireland , where workers have just 20 days off a year , compared to six weeks in germany .
handke reduced the situation to a simple formula : you can not remain affluent and continue working less than everybody else . an " abstruse proposal " ? meanwhile , one of germany ’ s most prominent economists , peter bofinger , a professor at the university of würzburg and a member of germany ’ s prestigious group of economic advisers , known as the “ wise men , ” is opposed to a longer workweek .
he conceded that longer hours are good for business , but warns of dangerous deflationary pressures when consumer buying power declines : " working longer means there will be less purchasing power in the hands of workers and given that we have a problem with our domestic demand this problem will be aggravated , " he said .
" as the example of the japanese economy shows , if you reduce wages in a relatively large economy in order to boost employment , you get just the opposite effect . " bofinger , at least , can be sure of support from germany ’ s labor unions .

the neighbors have issues of a failing democracy and economy to resolve . officials from the european union and the ukraine are meeting on thursday in the hague to discuss the relationship between the ukraine and the recently expanded eu .
the europeans are expected to pose some serious questions about the failing standards of democracy under the government of leonid kutschma , with many eu politicians loath to see him remain in office . the ukraine is beginning to look like the eu 's problem neighbor .
the former soviet republic has been described in brussels as a nation with failing democratic standards , which are becoming very noticeable as the country prepares for a presidential election in october . president criticized for democratic failures kutschma , the current ukraine president , has been criticized for many shortcomings in the running of a free market economy and the media coverage of the suspicious murder of journalist georgiy gongadze .
senior political and security figures have been implicated in the killing and many see it as a government effort to muzzle the press . the case of the murdered journalist has become a sticking point in bilateral talks - with the ukraine telling the eu to mind its own business while the eu cites it as a clear case of democratic deficiency in the ukraine .
brussels is slowly losing its patience and is hoping the elections in october will bring about positive change . “ we expect that the new president will follow the principles of an open-market economy , " eu member of parliament elisabeth schrödter told deutsche welle .
" we expect that the decision made by the ukrainian parliament , that ukrainian legislation will be adapted to conform to eu laws , will be put into practice .
we hope for concrete strategies in this respect and not just empty words . ” ukraine wants economic acknowledgement at thursday 's summit , the ukrainian government expects europe to tackle this thorny topic and acknowledge the country as a free market economy , which would also facilitate the ukraine ’ s entry to the world trade organization .
however , eu officials say they have had trouble finding reliable negotiators on the ukrainian side and a resolution may again be impossible at this stage . brussels will be watching the presidential elections in the ukraine closely .
most believe that a full change of government and policies in the ukraine is necessary for it to soldify the footing of its relationship with the eu . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de market status to come soon for ukraine during a meeting with ukraine 's premier viktor yanukovych , prodi hinted that the eu could grant ukraine its long sought-after market status at the forthcoming eu-ukraine ministerial meeting in july .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.07.2004 german firms head to russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder comes to russia on thursday accompanied by a delegation of businessmen , german chancellor gerhard schröder is visiting russia on thursday .
the message : larger german firms are already successful there and smaller ones should follow suit . after the russian economy collapsed in 1998 , the import and export industries likewise suffered .
in the meantime , however , little evidence remains of those troubled times , and russia presents a significant opportunity for german companies - both large and small . " the russian market is growing at an annual rate of 6 to 8 percent , and that 's particularly exciting for producers of consumer products , " says manfred sapper of the berlin-based german society for east european studies -lrb- dgo -rrb- .
as a result , german-russian trade is on the rise : last year trade volume between the two countries reached a record high of € 25.5 billion -lrb- $ 30.9 billion -rrb- . this trend is mirrored in trade relations between the whole of the european union and russia - 50 percent of all imports to russia come from the eu .
the only problem , according to sapper , is the fact that there is a massive trade imbalance between the eu and russia .
only five percent of the goods imported to the eu come from russia . the metro-group on the advance the düsseldorf-based retailer metro group is one of the largest german investors in russia .
the company stocks many of the consumer products russia 's 145 million inhabitants are looking to buy , and that 's proven to be a recipe for success . hans-joachim körber , the head of metro , is a prominent member of the delegation accompanying the chancellor on his trip to russia .
" we have been successful in russia since 2001 , " says jürgen homeyer , a spokesman for the metro-group . the large german retailer has five stores in moscow and two in st. petersburg .
to hear homeyer tell it , the metro group 's experience in russia has been nothing but positive .
" after just two years , our affiliates were already in the black , " he says .
" of course , our investments totalling more than € 15 million per store have not been redeemed yet , but we are still growing . " 90 percent of products produced in russia " in the coming year , we will increase the number of metro stores to 17 , " says homeyer .
but his company is not just in it for a short-term profit , he says .
they are looking to build-up stable long-term relations .
" in most cases , we buy the land we build our stores on , invest in the local infrastructure , create jobs , and 90 percent of the goods we sell come from russia , " he says . for homeyer , that explains why his company is so beloved in russia .
" the moscow mayor has been particularly supportive , " he says .
for other firms hoping to break into the russian market , the metro group 's experience sounds like a dream .
but , warns homeyer , it 's important to spend the time researching the market . warning : get expert advice it 's not all cinderella stories , as seems to have been the case for the metro group .
the russian market does pose certain risks .
smaller firms hoping to follow-up on the success of larger forerunners should seek expert advice , say those familiar with the pitfalls . " these companies should look for advice early , so they have a realistic understanding of the conditions of the russian market , " says peter presber , an expert on russia for the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
" there are huge differences between german and russian bureaucracy and corruption remains a problem , " he says . the fate of yukos , one of russia 's largest oil producers , for example , has made some foreign investors weary . they fear the arrest of the company 's former head , mikhail khodorkovsky , which caused the russian stock market to take a tumble , was politically motivated .
on wednesday night the saga continued , and bailiffs moved in on the yukos main offices after a midnight deadline passed for the company to pay a $ 3.4 billion tax bill from 2000 .
the move is likely to force the company into bankruptcy . on the other hand , presber does credit the russians with making improvements .
" in the last five or six years , numerous new laws have been passed that have improved the situation for foreign companies , " he says .
for presber and company at the dihk , the time is right to invest in russia : " the market is growing , and german companies should grow with it .

ministers from the states of hesse , lower saxony and bavaria had already signaled their support for a federal database where information on suspects from all states would be combined with national files to build a comprehensive list of suspected terrorists in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal interior minister otto schily schily -lrb- photo -rrb- added that , up until now , the transfer of information between individual departments had been unsatisfactory .

the fdp 's spokesperson for domestic affairs , max städter , told the berliner zeitung that the fight against terrorism should go on but by following constitutional principles .
he argued that a central file would provide the intelligence agencies with access to domestic police files and therefore more than just the necessary information to investigate terror suspects .

the rebate was originally introduced as compensation for britain which paid much more into eu coffers than it got back , largely because it benefited less than other member states from the common agricultural policy .
prime minister margaret thatcher secured the deal with german chancellor helmut kohl and french president francois mitterrand after famously demanding : " i want my money back . "
funds for new states prompt rethink but the introduction of ten new member states in may means that new eu regional and structural funds go largely to the accession countries , narrowing the net contributions gap between britain and other veteran members .
the commission says that if things are not changed , britain would pay just 0.25 percent of its gdp to the eu between 2007 and 2013 , compared with , for example , 0.56 percent for the netherlands and 0.54 percent for germany .
" the uk is going to become the smallest net contributor to the eu budget ... as a result , the current system of a correction reserved exclusively for the uk can not continue , " schreyer told reporters .

the message : larger german firms are already successful there and smaller ones should follow suit . after the russian economy collapsed in 1998 , the import and export industries likewise suffered .
in the meantime , however , little evidence remains of those troubled times , and russia presents a significant opportunity for german companies - both large and small . " the russian market is growing at an annual rate of 6 to 8 percent , and that 's particularly exciting for producers of consumer products , " says manfred sapper of the berlin-based german society for east european studies -lrb- dgo -rrb- .
as a result , german-russian trade is on the rise : last year trade volume between the two countries reached a record high of € 25.5 billion -lrb- $ 30.9 billion -rrb- . this trend is mirrored in trade relations between the whole of the european union and russia - 50 percent of all imports to russia come from the eu .
the only problem , according to sapper , is the fact that there is a massive trade imbalance between the eu and russia .
only five percent of the goods imported to the eu come from russia . the metro-group on the advance the düsseldorf-based retailer metro group is one of the largest german investors in russia .
the company stocks many of the consumer products russia 's 145 million inhabitants are looking to buy , and that 's proven to be a recipe for success . hans-joachim körber , the head of metro , is a prominent member of the delegation accompanying the chancellor on his trip to russia .
" we have been successful in russia since 2001 , " says jürgen homeyer , a spokesman for the metro-group . the large german retailer has five stores in moscow and two in st. petersburg .
to hear homeyer tell it , the metro group 's experience in russia has been nothing but positive .
" after just two years , our affiliates were already in the black , " he says .
" of course , our investments totalling more than € 15 million per store have not been redeemed yet , but we are still growing . " 90 percent of products produced in russia " in the coming year , we will increase the number of metro stores to 17 , " says homeyer .
but his company is not just in it for a short-term profit , he says .
they are looking to build-up stable long-term relations .
" in most cases , we buy the land we build our stores on , invest in the local infrastructure , create jobs , and 90 percent of the goods we sell come from russia , " he says . for homeyer , that explains why his company is so beloved in russia .
" the moscow mayor has been particularly supportive , " he says .
for other firms hoping to break into the russian market , the metro group 's experience sounds like a dream .
but , warns homeyer , it 's important to spend the time researching the market . warning : get expert advice it 's not all cinderella stories , as seems to have been the case for the metro group .
the russian market does pose certain risks .
smaller firms hoping to follow-up on the success of larger forerunners should seek expert advice , say those familiar with the pitfalls . " these companies should look for advice early , so they have a realistic understanding of the conditions of the russian market , " says peter presber , an expert on russia for the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
" there are huge differences between german and russian bureaucracy and corruption remains a problem , " he says . the fate of yukos , one of russia 's largest oil producers , for example , has made some foreign investors weary . they fear the arrest of the company 's former head , mikhail khodorkovsky , which caused the russian stock market to take a tumble , was politically motivated .
on wednesday night the saga continued , and bailiffs moved in on the yukos main offices after a midnight deadline passed for the company to pay a $ 3.4 billion tax bill from 2000 .
the move is likely to force the company into bankruptcy . on the other hand , presber does credit the russians with making improvements .
" in the last five or six years , numerous new laws have been passed that have improved the situation for foreign companies , " he says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.07.2004 britain in row with eu over budget rebate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair faces a showdown with brussels britain 's eu budget rebate could be cut after the european commission admitted it would debate plans to that effect in the coming weeks .
if approved , the u.k. would become the biggest net contributor of eu funds . britain is preparing to face off with its eu partners over plans to bring its € 3 billion eu budget rebate to an end and make britain the largest net contributor to eu funds , relative to the size of its economy .
the european commission 's plans for the budgetary period from 2007-2013 , drawn up by german budgetary commissioner michaele schreyer , would bring to a close the rebate which has been in place since 1984 .
if it is abolished , britain will become the biggest contributor to the eu 's € 100 billion a year budget and contribute 0.51 percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , compared to 0.35 for italy and 0.31 percent for france , countries of a similar size and wealth .
the rebate was originally introduced as compensation for britain which paid much more into eu coffers than it got back , largely because it benefited less than other member states from the common agricultural policy .
prime minister margaret thatcher secured the deal with german chancellor helmut kohl and french president francois mitterrand after famously demanding : " i want my money back . "
funds for new states prompt rethink but the introduction of ten new member states in may means that new eu regional and structural funds go largely to the accession countries , narrowing the net contributions gap between britain and other veteran members .
the commission says that if things are not changed , britain would pay just 0.25 percent of its gdp to the eu between 2007 and 2013 , compared with , for example , 0.56 percent for the netherlands and 0.54 percent for germany .
" the uk is going to become the smallest net contributor to the eu budget ... as a result , the current system of a correction reserved exclusively for the uk can not continue , " schreyer told reporters .
instead , brussels proposes a " general refund mechanism , " which would share out the rebate equally between all member states whose contributions to the eu exceed 0.35 percent of their gdp . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new plans to ease burden on eu net contributors the idea was proposed at an informal meeting of finance ministers and would go some way to easing concerns of net contributors to the eu budget that they are being asked to pay too much into the union 's coffers .

if approved , the u.k. would become the biggest net contributor of eu funds . britain is preparing to face off with its eu partners over plans to bring its € 3 billion eu budget rebate to an end and make britain the largest net contributor to eu funds , relative to the size of its economy .
the european commission 's plans for the budgetary period from 2007-2013 , drawn up by german budgetary commissioner michaele schreyer , would bring to a close the rebate which has been in place since 1984 .
if it is abolished , britain will become the biggest contributor to the eu 's € 100 billion a year budget and contribute 0.51 percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , compared to 0.35 for italy and 0.31 percent for france , countries of a similar size and wealth .
the rebate was originally introduced as compensation for britain which paid much more into eu coffers than it got back , largely because it benefited less than other member states from the common agricultural policy .
prime minister margaret thatcher secured the deal with german chancellor helmut kohl and french president francois mitterrand after famously demanding : " i want my money back . "
funds for new states prompt rethink but the introduction of ten new member states in may means that new eu regional and structural funds go largely to the accession countries , narrowing the net contributions gap between britain and other veteran members .
the commission says that if things are not changed , britain would pay just 0.25 percent of its gdp to the eu between 2007 and 2013 , compared with , for example , 0.56 percent for the netherlands and 0.54 percent for germany .
" the uk is going to become the smallest net contributor to the eu budget ... as a result , the current system of a correction reserved exclusively for the uk can not continue , " schreyer told reporters .
instead , brussels proposes a " general refund mechanism , " which would share out the rebate equally between all member states whose contributions to the eu exceed 0.35 percent of their gdp . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new plans to ease burden on eu net contributors the idea was proposed at an informal meeting of finance ministers and would go some way to easing concerns of net contributors to the eu budget that they are being asked to pay too much into the union 's coffers .

the message : larger german firms are already successful there and smaller ones should follow suit . after the russian economy collapsed in 1998 , the import and export industries likewise suffered .
in the meantime , however , little evidence remains of those troubled times , and russia presents a significant opportunity for german companies - both large and small . " the russian market is growing at an annual rate of 6 to 8 percent , and that 's particularly exciting for producers of consumer products , " says manfred sapper of the berlin-based german society for east european studies -lrb- dgo -rrb- .
as a result , german-russian trade is on the rise : last year trade volume between the two countries reached a record high of € 25.5 billion -lrb- $ 30.9 billion -rrb- . this trend is mirrored in trade relations between the whole of the european union and russia - 50 percent of all imports to russia come from the eu .
the only problem , according to sapper , is the fact that there is a massive trade imbalance between the eu and russia .
only five percent of the goods imported to the eu come from russia . the metro-group on the advance the düsseldorf-based retailer metro group is one of the largest german investors in russia .
the company stocks many of the consumer products russia 's 145 million inhabitants are looking to buy , and that 's proven to be a recipe for success . hans-joachim körber , the head of metro , is a prominent member of the delegation accompanying the chancellor on his trip to russia .
" we have been successful in russia since 2001 , " says jürgen homeyer , a spokesman for the metro-group . the large german retailer has five stores in moscow and two in st. petersburg .
to hear homeyer tell it , the metro group 's experience in russia has been nothing but positive .
" after just two years , our affiliates were already in the black , " he says .
" of course , our investments totalling more than € 15 million per store have not been redeemed yet , but we are still growing . " 90 percent of products produced in russia " in the coming year , we will increase the number of metro stores to 17 , " says homeyer .
but his company is not just in it for a short-term profit , he says .
they are looking to build-up stable long-term relations .
" in most cases , we buy the land we build our stores on , invest in the local infrastructure , create jobs , and 90 percent of the goods we sell come from russia , " he says . for homeyer , that explains why his company is so beloved in russia .
" the moscow mayor has been particularly supportive , " he says .
for other firms hoping to break into the russian market , the metro group 's experience sounds like a dream .
but , warns homeyer , it 's important to spend the time researching the market . warning : get expert advice it 's not all cinderella stories , as seems to have been the case for the metro group .
the russian market does pose certain risks .
smaller firms hoping to follow-up on the success of larger forerunners should seek expert advice , say those familiar with the pitfalls . " these companies should look for advice early , so they have a realistic understanding of the conditions of the russian market , " says peter presber , an expert on russia for the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
" there are huge differences between german and russian bureaucracy and corruption remains a problem , " he says . the fate of yukos , one of russia 's largest oil producers , for example , has made some foreign investors weary . they fear the arrest of the company 's former head , mikhail khodorkovsky , which caused the russian stock market to take a tumble , was politically motivated .
on wednesday night the saga continued , and bailiffs moved in on the yukos main offices after a midnight deadline passed for the company to pay a $ 3.4 billion tax bill from 2000 .
the move is likely to force the company into bankruptcy . on the other hand , presber does credit the russians with making improvements .
" in the last five or six years , numerous new laws have been passed that have improved the situation for foreign companies , " he says .

the message : larger german firms are already successful there and smaller ones should follow suit . after the russian economy collapsed in 1998 , the import and export industries likewise suffered .
in the meantime , however , little evidence remains of those troubled times , and russia presents a significant opportunity for german companies - both large and small . " the russian market is growing at an annual rate of 6 to 8 percent , and that 's particularly exciting for producers of consumer products , " says manfred sapper of the berlin-based german society for east european studies -lrb- dgo -rrb- .
as a result , german-russian trade is on the rise : last year trade volume between the two countries reached a record high of € 25.5 billion -lrb- $ 30.9 billion -rrb- . this trend is mirrored in trade relations between the whole of the european union and russia - 50 percent of all imports to russia come from the eu .
the only problem , according to sapper , is the fact that there is a massive trade imbalance between the eu and russia .
only five percent of the goods imported to the eu come from russia . the metro-group on the advance the düsseldorf-based retailer metro group is one of the largest german investors in russia .
the company stocks many of the consumer products russia 's 145 million inhabitants are looking to buy , and that 's proven to be a recipe for success . hans-joachim körber , the head of metro , is a prominent member of the delegation accompanying the chancellor on his trip to russia .
" we have been successful in russia since 2001 , " says jürgen homeyer , a spokesman for the metro-group . the large german retailer has five stores in moscow and two in st. petersburg .
to hear homeyer tell it , the metro group 's experience in russia has been nothing but positive .
" after just two years , our affiliates were already in the black , " he says .
" of course , our investments totalling more than € 15 million per store have not been redeemed yet , but we are still growing . " 90 percent of products produced in russia " in the coming year , we will increase the number of metro stores to 17 , " says homeyer .
but his company is not just in it for a short-term profit , he says .
they are looking to build-up stable long-term relations .
" in most cases , we buy the land we build our stores on , invest in the local infrastructure , create jobs , and 90 percent of the goods we sell come from russia , " he says . for homeyer , that explains why his company is so beloved in russia .
" the moscow mayor has been particularly supportive , " he says .
for other firms hoping to break into the russian market , the metro group 's experience sounds like a dream .
but , warns homeyer , it 's important to spend the time researching the market . warning : get expert advice it 's not all cinderella stories , as seems to have been the case for the metro group .
the russian market does pose certain risks .
smaller firms hoping to follow-up on the success of larger forerunners should seek expert advice , say those familiar with the pitfalls . " these companies should look for advice early , so they have a realistic understanding of the conditions of the russian market , " says peter presber , an expert on russia for the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
" there are huge differences between german and russian bureaucracy and corruption remains a problem , " he says . the fate of yukos , one of russia 's largest oil producers , for example , has made some foreign investors weary . they fear the arrest of the company 's former head , mikhail khodorkovsky , which caused the russian stock market to take a tumble , was politically motivated .
on wednesday night the saga continued , and bailiffs moved in on the yukos main offices after a midnight deadline passed for the company to pay a $ 3.4 billion tax bill from 2000 .
the move is likely to force the company into bankruptcy . on the other hand , presber does credit the russians with making improvements .
" in the last five or six years , numerous new laws have been passed that have improved the situation for foreign companies , " he says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.07.2004 german firms head to russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder comes to russia on thursday accompanied by a delegation of businessmen , german chancellor gerhard schröder is visiting russia on thursday .
the message : larger german firms are already successful there and smaller ones should follow suit . after the russian economy collapsed in 1998 , the import and export industries likewise suffered .
in the meantime , however , little evidence remains of those troubled times , and russia presents a significant opportunity for german companies - both large and small . " the russian market is growing at an annual rate of 6 to 8 percent , and that 's particularly exciting for producers of consumer products , " says manfred sapper of the berlin-based german society for east european studies -lrb- dgo -rrb- .
as a result , german-russian trade is on the rise : last year trade volume between the two countries reached a record high of € 25.5 billion -lrb- $ 30.9 billion -rrb- . this trend is mirrored in trade relations between the whole of the european union and russia - 50 percent of all imports to russia come from the eu .
the only problem , according to sapper , is the fact that there is a massive trade imbalance between the eu and russia .
only five percent of the goods imported to the eu come from russia . the metro-group on the advance the düsseldorf-based retailer metro group is one of the largest german investors in russia .
the company stocks many of the consumer products russia 's 145 million inhabitants are looking to buy , and that 's proven to be a recipe for success . hans-joachim körber , the head of metro , is a prominent member of the delegation accompanying the chancellor on his trip to russia .
" we have been successful in russia since 2001 , " says jürgen homeyer , a spokesman for the metro-group . the large german retailer has five stores in moscow and two in st. petersburg .
to hear homeyer tell it , the metro group 's experience in russia has been nothing but positive .
" after just two years , our affiliates were already in the black , " he says .
" of course , our investments totalling more than € 15 million per store have not been redeemed yet , but we are still growing . " 90 percent of products produced in russia " in the coming year , we will increase the number of metro stores to 17 , " says homeyer .
but his company is not just in it for a short-term profit , he says .
they are looking to build-up stable long-term relations .
" in most cases , we buy the land we build our stores on , invest in the local infrastructure , create jobs , and 90 percent of the goods we sell come from russia , " he says . for homeyer , that explains why his company is so beloved in russia .
" the moscow mayor has been particularly supportive , " he says .
for other firms hoping to break into the russian market , the metro group 's experience sounds like a dream .
but , warns homeyer , it 's important to spend the time researching the market . warning : get expert advice it 's not all cinderella stories , as seems to have been the case for the metro group .
the russian market does pose certain risks .
smaller firms hoping to follow-up on the success of larger forerunners should seek expert advice , say those familiar with the pitfalls . " these companies should look for advice early , so they have a realistic understanding of the conditions of the russian market , " says peter presber , an expert on russia for the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
" there are huge differences between german and russian bureaucracy and corruption remains a problem , " he says . the fate of yukos , one of russia 's largest oil producers , for example , has made some foreign investors weary . they fear the arrest of the company 's former head , mikhail khodorkovsky , which caused the russian stock market to take a tumble , was politically motivated .

the national plans are part of the eu 's " emissions trading scheme " -lrb- ets -rrb- whereby companies may trade allowances to emit greenhouse gasses .
the system will enter into force in january 2005 and is seen by the eu as a cost-effective way to comply with the international kyoto protocol on climate change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.07.2004 germans mull fifty-hour workweek großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions are fighting to keep a weekly work time of 35 hours in a move that will surely raise the hackles of germany ’ s labor unions , two leading economic and industry figures proposed introducing a 50-hour workweek as a means to reduce the country ’ s staggering unemployment rate . the suggestion is part of a reform debate in germany on how to cut costs to make the world ’ s third largest economy more competitive in the global market . the problem is two-fold .
germany is losing jobs to lower wage countries and consumers at home , who are either unemployed because of the job-drain or worried about losing work , are n't loosening their purse strings either . the result is devastating for the german economy , which has been more or less stagnant over recent years .
exacerbating the problem are pension and health reforms introduced by the social democrat-green party government which mean less money in retirement and higher healthcare costs for patients . the upshot is that germany has found itself in a vicious circle .
if it reduces government spending , taxpayers will have fewer services or have to pay more .
but with lower wages and an uncertain future , people will not be able to pay for the essential goods and services they need . will a longer workweek save jobs ? for literally years now , the question has been : how to solve this dilemma ?
the latest remedial suggestion comes from klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research and ulrich ramm , chief economist at germany ’ s third largest bank , commerzbank . both men have proposed introducing a 50-hour workweek to prevent even more jobs being exported to low-wage countries .
ramm said he thinks germany has room for more jobs , but they have to be affordable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high wages make production in germany more expensive than in other countries .
" i can see a realistic chance for discussion and we should perhaps work a bit more because in germany we have a lack of payable labor and it 's not the lack of labor overall , " he said . in ramm ’ s view , the 50-hour workweek would not be permanent : by establishing a work-hour account of up to 50 hours for peak production periods , when production slowed , employees could work 30 hours instead for the same pay , he said . michael hüther , director of the german economic institute , agreed with ramm ’ s assessment and argued for a generally more flexible workweek .
still others , like gerhard handke , from the german wholesale and foreign trade association , think workers should also give up a week ’ s vacation per year to make germany more competitive . handke pointed to ireland , where workers have just 20 days off a year , compared to six weeks in germany .
handke reduced the situation to a simple formula : you can not remain affluent and continue working less than everybody else . an " abstruse proposal " ? meanwhile , one of germany ’ s most prominent economists , peter bofinger , a professor at the university of würzburg and a member of germany ’ s prestigious group of economic advisers , known as the “ wise men , ” is opposed to a longer workweek .
he conceded that longer hours are good for business , but warns of dangerous deflationary pressures when consumer buying power declines : " working longer means there will be less purchasing power in the hands of workers and given that we have a problem with our domestic demand this problem will be aggravated , " he said .
" as the example of the japanese economy shows , if you reduce wages in a relatively large economy in order to boost employment , you get just the opposite effect . " bofinger , at least , can be sure of support from germany ’ s labor unions .
the head of the country ’ s construction and agriculture union , klaus wiesehügel , called the 50-hour week an " abstruse proposal " that would generate more unemployment . even the chairman of germany ’ s technology giant , siemens , heinrich von pierer , said that talk of a 50-hour week was not very helpful in the current climate and would make people more insecure . gregg benzow -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : the job market limps along the long-awaited and forever promised economic revival in germany is a major topic in the nation ’ s newspapers this wednesday .
unfortunately , most editors conclude , modest growth is n't enough to create new jobs .
-lrb- july 7 , 2004 -rrb- experts : longer work week already reality while germans are debating whether to extend the work week to help the country 's ailing economy , some experts say many employees already spend almost 40 hours on the job each week .
-lrb- june 29 , 2004 -rrb- siemens secures longer working hours with siemens threatening to relocate jobs to eastern europe , the powerful ig metall caved-in on a sacred issue : the 35-hour work week .

" it would n't be unreasonable , " said rogowski and justified his stance by pointing out that german industry had " practically earned nothing " in the past two years on account of relatively high non-wage labor costs and low operating margins .
rogowski stressed that germany was the worldwide leader with its 42 days of vacation and public holidays . dw-world.de germans mull fifty-hour workweek in a move that will surely raise the hackles of germany ’ s labor unions , two leading economic and industry figures proposed introducing a 50-hour workweek as a means to reduce the country ’ s staggering unemployment rate .

data from the british home office released on wednesday reveals that after may 1 , the day the eu enlarged by 10 new members , just over 8,000 " new europeans " entered britain to work legally .
" the predicted dramatic increase of new arrivals has not materialized , " the home office concludes in a press release .
the uk , along with ireland and sweden , was among only a handful of eu countries that opened their labor markets to workers from the new member states .
while uk authorities have placed no restrictions on numbers of workers from the new eu states , they do have limited access to the british social welfare net .
the british home secretary david blunkett said : " by contributing to our economy and paying into the system these accession state workers are supporting our public services , not being a drain upon them . "

the neighbors have issues of a failing democracy and economy to resolve . officials from the european union and the ukraine are meeting on thursday in the hague to discuss the relationship between the ukraine and the recently expanded eu .
the europeans are expected to pose some serious questions about the failing standards of democracy under the government of leonid kutschma , with many eu politicians loath to see him remain in office . the ukraine is beginning to look like the eu 's problem neighbor .
the former soviet republic has been described in brussels as a nation with failing democratic standards , which are becoming very noticeable as the country prepares for a presidential election in october . president criticized for democratic failures kutschma , the current ukraine president , has been criticized for many shortcomings in the running of a free market economy and the media coverage of the suspicious murder of journalist georgiy gongadze .
senior political and security figures have been implicated in the killing and many see it as a government effort to muzzle the press . the case of the murdered journalist has become a sticking point in bilateral talks - with the ukraine telling the eu to mind its own business while the eu cites it as a clear case of democratic deficiency in the ukraine .
brussels is slowly losing its patience and is hoping the elections in october will bring about positive change . “ we expect that the new president will follow the principles of an open-market economy , " eu member of parliament elisabeth schrödter told deutsche welle .
" we expect that the decision made by the ukrainian parliament , that ukrainian legislation will be adapted to conform to eu laws , will be put into practice .
we hope for concrete strategies in this respect and not just empty words . ” ukraine wants economic acknowledgement at thursday 's summit , the ukrainian government expects europe to tackle this thorny topic and acknowledge the country as a free market economy , which would also facilitate the ukraine ’ s entry to the world trade organization .
however , eu officials say they have had trouble finding reliable negotiators on the ukrainian side and a resolution may again be impossible at this stage . brussels will be watching the presidential elections in the ukraine closely .

the neighbors have issues of a failing democracy and economy to resolve . officials from the european union and the ukraine are meeting on thursday in the hague to discuss the relationship between the ukraine and the recently expanded eu .
the europeans are expected to pose some serious questions about the failing standards of democracy under the government of leonid kutschma , with many eu politicians loath to see him remain in office . the ukraine is beginning to look like the eu 's problem neighbor .
the former soviet republic has been described in brussels as a nation with failing democratic standards , which are becoming very noticeable as the country prepares for a presidential election in october . president criticized for democratic failures kutschma , the current ukraine president , has been criticized for many shortcomings in the running of a free market economy and the media coverage of the suspicious murder of journalist georgiy gongadze .
senior political and security figures have been implicated in the killing and many see it as a government effort to muzzle the press . the case of the murdered journalist has become a sticking point in bilateral talks - with the ukraine telling the eu to mind its own business while the eu cites it as a clear case of democratic deficiency in the ukraine .
brussels is slowly losing its patience and is hoping the elections in october will bring about positive change . “ we expect that the new president will follow the principles of an open-market economy , " eu member of parliament elisabeth schrödter told deutsche welle .
" we expect that the decision made by the ukrainian parliament , that ukrainian legislation will be adapted to conform to eu laws , will be put into practice .
we hope for concrete strategies in this respect and not just empty words . ” ukraine wants economic acknowledgement at thursday 's summit , the ukrainian government expects europe to tackle this thorny topic and acknowledge the country as a free market economy , which would also facilitate the ukraine ’ s entry to the world trade organization .
however , eu officials say they have had trouble finding reliable negotiators on the ukrainian side and a resolution may again be impossible at this stage . brussels will be watching the presidential elections in the ukraine closely .
most believe that a full change of government and policies in the ukraine is necessary for it to soldify the footing of its relationship with the eu . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de market status to come soon for ukraine during a meeting with ukraine 's premier viktor yanukovych , prodi hinted that the eu could grant ukraine its long sought-after market status at the forthcoming eu-ukraine ministerial meeting in july .

if approved , the u.k. would become the biggest net contributor of eu funds . britain is preparing to face off with its eu partners over plans to bring its € 3 billion eu budget rebate to an end and make britain the largest net contributor to eu funds , relative to the size of its economy .
the european commission 's plans for the budgetary period from 2007-2013 , drawn up by german budgetary commissioner michaele schreyer , would bring to a close the rebate which has been in place since 1984 .
if it is abolished , britain will become the biggest contributor to the eu 's € 100 billion a year budget and contribute 0.51 percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , compared to 0.35 for italy and 0.31 percent for france , countries of a similar size and wealth .
the rebate was originally introduced as compensation for britain which paid much more into eu coffers than it got back , largely because it benefited less than other member states from the common agricultural policy .
prime minister margaret thatcher secured the deal with german chancellor helmut kohl and french president francois mitterrand after famously demanding : " i want my money back . "
funds for new states prompt rethink but the introduction of ten new member states in may means that new eu regional and structural funds go largely to the accession countries , narrowing the net contributions gap between britain and other veteran members .
the commission says that if things are not changed , britain would pay just 0.25 percent of its gdp to the eu between 2007 and 2013 , compared with , for example , 0.56 percent for the netherlands and 0.54 percent for germany .
" the uk is going to become the smallest net contributor to the eu budget ... as a result , the current system of a correction reserved exclusively for the uk can not continue , " schreyer told reporters .
instead , brussels proposes a " general refund mechanism , " which would share out the rebate equally between all member states whose contributions to the eu exceed 0.35 percent of their gdp . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new plans to ease burden on eu net contributors the idea was proposed at an informal meeting of finance ministers and would go some way to easing concerns of net contributors to the eu budget that they are being asked to pay too much into the union 's coffers .

germany is losing jobs to lower wage countries and consumers at home , who are either unemployed because of the job-drain or worried about losing work , are n't loosening their purse strings either . the result is devastating for the german economy , which has been more or less stagnant over recent years .
exacerbating the problem are pension and health reforms introduced by the social democrat-green party government which mean less money in retirement and higher healthcare costs for patients . the upshot is that germany has found itself in a vicious circle .
if it reduces government spending , taxpayers will have fewer services or have to pay more .
but with lower wages and an uncertain future , people will not be able to pay for the essential goods and services they need . will a longer workweek save jobs ? for literally years now , the question has been : how to solve this dilemma ?
the latest remedial suggestion comes from klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research and ulrich ramm , chief economist at germany ’ s third largest bank , commerzbank . both men have proposed introducing a 50-hour workweek to prevent even more jobs being exported to low-wage countries .
ramm said he thinks germany has room for more jobs , but they have to be affordable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high wages make production in germany more expensive than in other countries .
" i can see a realistic chance for discussion and we should perhaps work a bit more because in germany we have a lack of payable labor and it 's not the lack of labor overall , " he said . in ramm ’ s view , the 50-hour workweek would not be permanent : by establishing a work-hour account of up to 50 hours for peak production periods , when production slowed , employees could work 30 hours instead for the same pay , he said . michael hüther , director of the german economic institute , agreed with ramm ’ s assessment and argued for a generally more flexible workweek .
still others , like gerhard handke , from the german wholesale and foreign trade association , think workers should also give up a week ’ s vacation per year to make germany more competitive . handke pointed to ireland , where workers have just 20 days off a year , compared to six weeks in germany .
handke reduced the situation to a simple formula : you can not remain affluent and continue working less than everybody else . an " abstruse proposal " ? meanwhile , one of germany ’ s most prominent economists , peter bofinger , a professor at the university of würzburg and a member of germany ’ s prestigious group of economic advisers , known as the “ wise men , ” is opposed to a longer workweek .
he conceded that longer hours are good for business , but warns of dangerous deflationary pressures when consumer buying power declines : " working longer means there will be less purchasing power in the hands of workers and given that we have a problem with our domestic demand this problem will be aggravated , " he said .
" as the example of the japanese economy shows , if you reduce wages in a relatively large economy in order to boost employment , you get just the opposite effect . " bofinger , at least , can be sure of support from germany ’ s labor unions .
the head of the country ’ s construction and agriculture union , klaus wiesehügel , called the 50-hour week an " abstruse proposal " that would generate more unemployment . even the chairman of germany ’ s technology giant , siemens , heinrich von pierer , said that talk of a 50-hour week was not very helpful in the current climate and would make people more insecure . gregg benzow -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : the job market limps along the long-awaited and forever promised economic revival in germany is a major topic in the nation ’ s newspapers this wednesday .
unfortunately , most editors conclude , modest growth is n't enough to create new jobs .
-lrb- july 7 , 2004 -rrb- experts : longer work week already reality while germans are debating whether to extend the work week to help the country 's ailing economy , some experts say many employees already spend almost 40 hours on the job each week .

if approved , the u.k. would become the biggest net contributor of eu funds . britain is preparing to face off with its eu partners over plans to bring its € 3 billion eu budget rebate to an end and make britain the largest net contributor to eu funds , relative to the size of its economy .
the european commission 's plans for the budgetary period from 2007-2013 , drawn up by german budgetary commissioner michaele schreyer , would bring to a close the rebate which has been in place since 1984 .
if it is abolished , britain will become the biggest contributor to the eu 's € 100 billion a year budget and contribute 0.51 percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , compared to 0.35 for italy and 0.31 percent for france , countries of a similar size and wealth .
the rebate was originally introduced as compensation for britain which paid much more into eu coffers than it got back , largely because it benefited less than other member states from the common agricultural policy .
prime minister margaret thatcher secured the deal with german chancellor helmut kohl and french president francois mitterrand after famously demanding : " i want my money back . "
funds for new states prompt rethink but the introduction of ten new member states in may means that new eu regional and structural funds go largely to the accession countries , narrowing the net contributions gap between britain and other veteran members .
the commission says that if things are not changed , britain would pay just 0.25 percent of its gdp to the eu between 2007 and 2013 , compared with , for example , 0.56 percent for the netherlands and 0.54 percent for germany .
" the uk is going to become the smallest net contributor to the eu budget ... as a result , the current system of a correction reserved exclusively for the uk can not continue , " schreyer told reporters .

germany is losing jobs to lower wage countries and consumers at home , who are either unemployed because of the job-drain or worried about losing work , are n't loosening their purse strings either . the result is devastating for the german economy , which has been more or less stagnant over recent years .
exacerbating the problem are pension and health reforms introduced by the social democrat-green party government which mean less money in retirement and higher healthcare costs for patients . the upshot is that germany has found itself in a vicious circle .
if it reduces government spending , taxpayers will have fewer services or have to pay more .
but with lower wages and an uncertain future , people will not be able to pay for the essential goods and services they need . will a longer workweek save jobs ? for literally years now , the question has been : how to solve this dilemma ?
the latest remedial suggestion comes from klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research and ulrich ramm , chief economist at germany ’ s third largest bank , commerzbank . both men have proposed introducing a 50-hour workweek to prevent even more jobs being exported to low-wage countries .
ramm said he thinks germany has room for more jobs , but they have to be affordable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high wages make production in germany more expensive than in other countries .
" i can see a realistic chance for discussion and we should perhaps work a bit more because in germany we have a lack of payable labor and it 's not the lack of labor overall , " he said . in ramm ’ s view , the 50-hour workweek would not be permanent : by establishing a work-hour account of up to 50 hours for peak production periods , when production slowed , employees could work 30 hours instead for the same pay , he said . michael hüther , director of the german economic institute , agreed with ramm ’ s assessment and argued for a generally more flexible workweek .
still others , like gerhard handke , from the german wholesale and foreign trade association , think workers should also give up a week ’ s vacation per year to make germany more competitive . handke pointed to ireland , where workers have just 20 days off a year , compared to six weeks in germany .
handke reduced the situation to a simple formula : you can not remain affluent and continue working less than everybody else . an " abstruse proposal " ? meanwhile , one of germany ’ s most prominent economists , peter bofinger , a professor at the university of würzburg and a member of germany ’ s prestigious group of economic advisers , known as the “ wise men , ” is opposed to a longer workweek .
he conceded that longer hours are good for business , but warns of dangerous deflationary pressures when consumer buying power declines : " working longer means there will be less purchasing power in the hands of workers and given that we have a problem with our domestic demand this problem will be aggravated , " he said .
" as the example of the japanese economy shows , if you reduce wages in a relatively large economy in order to boost employment , you get just the opposite effect . " bofinger , at least , can be sure of support from germany ’ s labor unions .
the head of the country ’ s construction and agriculture union , klaus wiesehügel , called the 50-hour week an " abstruse proposal " that would generate more unemployment . even the chairman of germany ’ s technology giant , siemens , heinrich von pierer , said that talk of a 50-hour week was not very helpful in the current climate and would make people more insecure . gregg benzow -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : the job market limps along the long-awaited and forever promised economic revival in germany is a major topic in the nation ’ s newspapers this wednesday .
unfortunately , most editors conclude , modest growth is n't enough to create new jobs .
-lrb- july 7 , 2004 -rrb- experts : longer work week already reality while germans are debating whether to extend the work week to help the country 's ailing economy , some experts say many employees already spend almost 40 hours on the job each week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.07.2004 germans mull fifty-hour workweek großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions are fighting to keep a weekly work time of 35 hours in a move that will surely raise the hackles of germany ’ s labor unions , two leading economic and industry figures proposed introducing a 50-hour workweek as a means to reduce the country ’ s staggering unemployment rate . the suggestion is part of a reform debate in germany on how to cut costs to make the world ’ s third largest economy more competitive in the global market . the problem is two-fold .
germany is losing jobs to lower wage countries and consumers at home , who are either unemployed because of the job-drain or worried about losing work , are n't loosening their purse strings either . the result is devastating for the german economy , which has been more or less stagnant over recent years .
exacerbating the problem are pension and health reforms introduced by the social democrat-green party government which mean less money in retirement and higher healthcare costs for patients . the upshot is that germany has found itself in a vicious circle .
if it reduces government spending , taxpayers will have fewer services or have to pay more .
but with lower wages and an uncertain future , people will not be able to pay for the essential goods and services they need . will a longer workweek save jobs ? for literally years now , the question has been : how to solve this dilemma ?
the latest remedial suggestion comes from klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research and ulrich ramm , chief economist at germany ’ s third largest bank , commerzbank . both men have proposed introducing a 50-hour workweek to prevent even more jobs being exported to low-wage countries .
ramm said he thinks germany has room for more jobs , but they have to be affordable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high wages make production in germany more expensive than in other countries .
" i can see a realistic chance for discussion and we should perhaps work a bit more because in germany we have a lack of payable labor and it 's not the lack of labor overall , " he said . in ramm ’ s view , the 50-hour workweek would not be permanent : by establishing a work-hour account of up to 50 hours for peak production periods , when production slowed , employees could work 30 hours instead for the same pay , he said . michael hüther , director of the german economic institute , agreed with ramm ’ s assessment and argued for a generally more flexible workweek .

data from the british home office released on wednesday reveals that after may 1 , the day the eu enlarged by 10 new members , just over 8,000 " new europeans " entered britain to work legally .
" the predicted dramatic increase of new arrivals has not materialized , " the home office concludes in a press release .
the uk , along with ireland and sweden , was among only a handful of eu countries that opened their labor markets to workers from the new member states .
while uk authorities have placed no restrictions on numbers of workers from the new eu states , they do have limited access to the british social welfare net .
the british home secretary david blunkett said : " by contributing to our economy and paying into the system these accession state workers are supporting our public services , not being a drain upon them . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.07.2004 a " pretty good story " in german , too großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton 's memoirs are expected to top the german bestseller list the german version of former u.s. president bill clinton 's autobiography " my life " - or " mein leben " - hits bookstores thursday , but the real highlight is the upcoming berlin visit of the author himself . in a display of typical clinton charm , the 57-year old former president joked at a new york launch party that he did n't have any idea if his autobiography was a great book .
" but it 's a pretty good story , " he said .
now , german readers will have the chance to form their own opinions about bill clinton 's story-telling abilities .
the 957-page tome detailing clinton 's political and personal life has been available in english since the book 's release on june 22 , but starting today , bookstores are stocking the german translation .
german hoopla surrounding the book , which has been dubbed the " harry potter for grown-ups " because of its record-breaking performance , probably wo n't reach fever pitch until july 11 , when clinton breezes into berlin for an autograph-signing session and talk-show appearances . limited signatures for german fans according to his aides , clinton is capable of cranking out 600 signatures an hour , though it 's unlikely that so many of his fans will be able to cram into the dussmann bookstore on berlin 's fashionable friedrichstrasse .
clinton 's appearance is being managed just like that of his wife , hillary rodham clinton , who signed copies of her own best-selling memoirs , " living history , " at the same venue last year .
then , 200 tickets for the signing were distributed on a first-come , first-serve basis . for both the clinton memoirs , german publisher econ-verlag , ordered an initial print-run of 100,000 copies .
though hillary clinton 's book was an immediate bestseller in germany , publicist carl carlsberg told dw-world that he expects her husband 's book to ring up more sales , as has been the case on the u.s. market . " in some sense , her book paved the way for bill 's autobiography , " carlsberg said .
" but bill clinton 's book will be much more successful .
he was , after all , the president , and only he can deliver those first-hand insights into politics . " rock-star aura bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton enjoyed rock star-like receptions on his past visits to berlin .
it 's unlikely that german sales of the book will match those in the u.s. , where it topped a million sales in the first week despite negative reviews such as that in the new york times , which called it " sloppy , self-indulgent and often eye-crossingly dull . " but there 's no denying the buzz surrounding the book 's german launch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former gov. bill clinton and his wife , hillary , celebrate his victory in the democratic runoff on june 8 , 1982 in little rock , ark .
" clinton has always been a popular president , " gary smith , director of the american academy in berlin told dw-world .
" i remember the two times he came to berlin , he had the aura of a rock star , not only for expats , but for germans as well .
he 's the most eloquent and international of presidents in memory .
he was educated abroad , he 's deeply passionate about politics , and more knowledgeable than most politicians about a broad range of issues .
that 's something that is , in a way , very european , because those qualities would also be expected of a british or german head of state . " clinton 's appeal can also be attributed to germans ' dissatisfaction with the current u.s. administration , said prof. reinhard isensee of the american studies department at berlin 's humboldt university . " in hindsight , he seems to be very different from the present president , " isensee told dw-world .
" people liked his way of approaching issues , even though they may not know that some of the current administration 's actions have their roots in things clinton did during his term . " the lewinsky factor across the atlantic , much of the hype surrounding clinton 's book has arisen because of curiosity over what the ex-president would say about his affair with former white house intern monica lewinsky .
but smith said those revelations wo n't be a major motivation for germans to shell out € 28 for a copy of " my life . " " the lewinsky affair was of less interest to europeans in general , " smith said .
" at the time , there was a widespread attitude of incomprehension about the impeachment proceedings .
germans could n't comprehend it was happening because he was trying to cover up an illicit liaison with another woman .
the fact that germans are so interested in his memoir says something deeper about germany 's relationship to the u.s. - and a strong foundation of pro-american feeling among german people . " in the book , which some reviewers have said reads like a very detailed diary , clinton tells how , after confessing to the affair , hillary insisted he sleep on the couch for a good two months .
he only managed to save his marriage and his relationship to daughter chelsea , by undergoing extensive family and individual therapy . but the first mention of monica lewinsky comes well over half-way into the book .
clinton devotes far more space to describing his troubled childhood in arkansas , and his astounding rise to his country 's highest office .
that is something that captures the german imagination , isensee said . appeal of the american dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill clinton : " mein leben . "
" germans want to read a story about someone who came from a socially disadvantaged background and worked his way up , " isensee said .
" with american personalities , they relate to this idea of the american dream , which was very true for clinton .
he had a tough childhood , he encountered various obstacles on his way up , and he 's a sort of witness of current american history . " for his account of recent history , clinton received a healthy $ 10 million advance - $ 2 million more than hillary received for her memoirs .
" i hope my publishers get their money back , " he was quoted as saying at the time of the book 's u.s. launch .
with world-wide sales of " my life " in 30 languages , clinton 's publishers can rest assured they will get their money back .
to ensure maximum regional interest , publishers have even taken the novel step of releasing custom-edited national editions .
the spanish-language edition , for example , contains lengthier passages on mexico 's debt crisis , while european editions devote more space to the balkans crisis and the kosovo bombings . " there was largely a commercial motivation , " smith said of clinton 's decision to pen his memoirs now .
" but of course , there was a political motivation too .
it was about setting the record straight on the issues that clouded his presidency - monica , the impeachment , and his bitterness about the way he was pursued by the right-wing - this hatred of clinton .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.07.2004 a " pretty good story " in german , too großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton 's memoirs are expected to top the german bestseller list the german version of former u.s. president bill clinton 's autobiography " my life " - or " mein leben " - hits bookstores thursday , but the real highlight is the upcoming berlin visit of the author himself . in a display of typical clinton charm , the 57-year old former president joked at a new york launch party that he did n't have any idea if his autobiography was a great book .
" but it 's a pretty good story , " he said .
now , german readers will have the chance to form their own opinions about bill clinton 's story-telling abilities .
the 957-page tome detailing clinton 's political and personal life has been available in english since the book 's release on june 22 , but starting today , bookstores are stocking the german translation .
german hoopla surrounding the book , which has been dubbed the " harry potter for grown-ups " because of its record-breaking performance , probably wo n't reach fever pitch until july 11 , when clinton breezes into berlin for an autograph-signing session and talk-show appearances . limited signatures for german fans according to his aides , clinton is capable of cranking out 600 signatures an hour , though it 's unlikely that so many of his fans will be able to cram into the dussmann bookstore on berlin 's fashionable friedrichstrasse .
clinton 's appearance is being managed just like that of his wife , hillary rodham clinton , who signed copies of her own best-selling memoirs , " living history , " at the same venue last year .
then , 200 tickets for the signing were distributed on a first-come , first-serve basis . for both the clinton memoirs , german publisher econ-verlag , ordered an initial print-run of 100,000 copies .
though hillary clinton 's book was an immediate bestseller in germany , publicist carl carlsberg told dw-world that he expects her husband 's book to ring up more sales , as has been the case on the u.s. market . " in some sense , her book paved the way for bill 's autobiography , " carlsberg said .
" but bill clinton 's book will be much more successful .
he was , after all , the president , and only he can deliver those first-hand insights into politics . " rock-star aura bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton enjoyed rock star-like receptions on his past visits to berlin .
it 's unlikely that german sales of the book will match those in the u.s. , where it topped a million sales in the first week despite negative reviews such as that in the new york times , which called it " sloppy , self-indulgent and often eye-crossingly dull . " but there 's no denying the buzz surrounding the book 's german launch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former gov. bill clinton and his wife , hillary , celebrate his victory in the democratic runoff on june 8 , 1982 in little rock , ark .
" clinton has always been a popular president , " gary smith , director of the american academy in berlin told dw-world .
" i remember the two times he came to berlin , he had the aura of a rock star , not only for expats , but for germans as well .
he 's the most eloquent and international of presidents in memory .
he was educated abroad , he 's deeply passionate about politics , and more knowledgeable than most politicians about a broad range of issues .
that 's something that is , in a way , very european , because those qualities would also be expected of a british or german head of state . " clinton 's appeal can also be attributed to germans ' dissatisfaction with the current u.s. administration , said prof. reinhard isensee of the american studies department at berlin 's humboldt university . " in hindsight , he seems to be very different from the present president , " isensee told dw-world .
" people liked his way of approaching issues , even though they may not know that some of the current administration 's actions have their roots in things clinton did during his term . " the lewinsky factor across the atlantic , much of the hype surrounding clinton 's book has arisen because of curiosity over what the ex-president would say about his affair with former white house intern monica lewinsky .
but smith said those revelations wo n't be a major motivation for germans to shell out € 28 for a copy of " my life . " " the lewinsky affair was of less interest to europeans in general , " smith said .
" at the time , there was a widespread attitude of incomprehension about the impeachment proceedings .
germans could n't comprehend it was happening because he was trying to cover up an illicit liaison with another woman .
the fact that germans are so interested in his memoir says something deeper about germany 's relationship to the u.s. - and a strong foundation of pro-american feeling among german people . " in the book , which some reviewers have said reads like a very detailed diary , clinton tells how , after confessing to the affair , hillary insisted he sleep on the couch for a good two months .
he only managed to save his marriage and his relationship to daughter chelsea , by undergoing extensive family and individual therapy . but the first mention of monica lewinsky comes well over half-way into the book .
clinton devotes far more space to describing his troubled childhood in arkansas , and his astounding rise to his country 's highest office .
that is something that captures the german imagination , isensee said . appeal of the american dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill clinton : " mein leben . "
" germans want to read a story about someone who came from a socially disadvantaged background and worked his way up , " isensee said .
" with american personalities , they relate to this idea of the american dream , which was very true for clinton .
he had a tough childhood , he encountered various obstacles on his way up , and he 's a sort of witness of current american history . " for his account of recent history , clinton received a healthy $ 10 million advance - $ 2 million more than hillary received for her memoirs .
" i hope my publishers get their money back , " he was quoted as saying at the time of the book 's u.s. launch .
with world-wide sales of " my life " in 30 languages , clinton 's publishers can rest assured they will get their money back .
to ensure maximum regional interest , publishers have even taken the novel step of releasing custom-edited national editions .
the spanish-language edition , for example , contains lengthier passages on mexico 's debt crisis , while european editions devote more space to the balkans crisis and the kosovo bombings . " there was largely a commercial motivation , " smith said of clinton 's decision to pen his memoirs now .
" but of course , there was a political motivation too .
it was about setting the record straight on the issues that clouded his presidency - monica , the impeachment , and his bitterness about the way he was pursued by the right-wing - this hatred of clinton .

" but it 's a pretty good story , " he said .
now , german readers will have the chance to form their own opinions about bill clinton 's story-telling abilities .
the 957-page tome detailing clinton 's political and personal life has been available in english since the book 's release on june 22 , but starting today , bookstores are stocking the german translation .
german hoopla surrounding the book , which has been dubbed the " harry potter for grown-ups " because of its record-breaking performance , probably wo n't reach fever pitch until july 11 , when clinton breezes into berlin for an autograph-signing session and talk-show appearances . limited signatures for german fans according to his aides , clinton is capable of cranking out 600 signatures an hour , though it 's unlikely that so many of his fans will be able to cram into the dussmann bookstore on berlin 's fashionable friedrichstrasse .
clinton 's appearance is being managed just like that of his wife , hillary rodham clinton , who signed copies of her own best-selling memoirs , " living history , " at the same venue last year .
then , 200 tickets for the signing were distributed on a first-come , first-serve basis . for both the clinton memoirs , german publisher econ-verlag , ordered an initial print-run of 100,000 copies .
though hillary clinton 's book was an immediate bestseller in germany , publicist carl carlsberg told dw-world that he expects her husband 's book to ring up more sales , as has been the case on the u.s. market . " in some sense , her book paved the way for bill 's autobiography , " carlsberg said .
" but bill clinton 's book will be much more successful .
he was , after all , the president , and only he can deliver those first-hand insights into politics . " rock-star aura bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton enjoyed rock star-like receptions on his past visits to berlin .
it 's unlikely that german sales of the book will match those in the u.s. , where it topped a million sales in the first week despite negative reviews such as that in the new york times , which called it " sloppy , self-indulgent and often eye-crossingly dull . " but there 's no denying the buzz surrounding the book 's german launch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former gov. bill clinton and his wife , hillary , celebrate his victory in the democratic runoff on june 8 , 1982 in little rock , ark .
" clinton has always been a popular president , " gary smith , director of the american academy in berlin told dw-world .
" i remember the two times he came to berlin , he had the aura of a rock star , not only for expats , but for germans as well .
he 's the most eloquent and international of presidents in memory .
he was educated abroad , he 's deeply passionate about politics , and more knowledgeable than most politicians about a broad range of issues .
that 's something that is , in a way , very european , because those qualities would also be expected of a british or german head of state . " clinton 's appeal can also be attributed to germans ' dissatisfaction with the current u.s. administration , said prof. reinhard isensee of the american studies department at berlin 's humboldt university . " in hindsight , he seems to be very different from the present president , " isensee told dw-world .
" people liked his way of approaching issues , even though they may not know that some of the current administration 's actions have their roots in things clinton did during his term . " the lewinsky factor across the atlantic , much of the hype surrounding clinton 's book has arisen because of curiosity over what the ex-president would say about his affair with former white house intern monica lewinsky .
but smith said those revelations wo n't be a major motivation for germans to shell out € 28 for a copy of " my life . " " the lewinsky affair was of less interest to europeans in general , " smith said .
" at the time , there was a widespread attitude of incomprehension about the impeachment proceedings .
germans could n't comprehend it was happening because he was trying to cover up an illicit liaison with another woman .
the fact that germans are so interested in his memoir says something deeper about germany 's relationship to the u.s. - and a strong foundation of pro-american feeling among german people . " in the book , which some reviewers have said reads like a very detailed diary , clinton tells how , after confessing to the affair , hillary insisted he sleep on the couch for a good two months .
he only managed to save his marriage and his relationship to daughter chelsea , by undergoing extensive family and individual therapy . but the first mention of monica lewinsky comes well over half-way into the book .
clinton devotes far more space to describing his troubled childhood in arkansas , and his astounding rise to his country 's highest office .
that is something that captures the german imagination , isensee said . appeal of the american dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill clinton : " mein leben . "
" germans want to read a story about someone who came from a socially disadvantaged background and worked his way up , " isensee said .
" with american personalities , they relate to this idea of the american dream , which was very true for clinton .
he had a tough childhood , he encountered various obstacles on his way up , and he 's a sort of witness of current american history . " for his account of recent history , clinton received a healthy $ 10 million advance - $ 2 million more than hillary received for her memoirs .
" i hope my publishers get their money back , " he was quoted as saying at the time of the book 's u.s. launch .
with world-wide sales of " my life " in 30 languages , clinton 's publishers can rest assured they will get their money back .
to ensure maximum regional interest , publishers have even taken the novel step of releasing custom-edited national editions .
the spanish-language edition , for example , contains lengthier passages on mexico 's debt crisis , while european editions devote more space to the balkans crisis and the kosovo bombings . " there was largely a commercial motivation , " smith said of clinton 's decision to pen his memoirs now .
" but of course , there was a political motivation too .
it was about setting the record straight on the issues that clouded his presidency - monica , the impeachment , and his bitterness about the way he was pursued by the right-wing - this hatred of clinton .

then , 200 tickets for the signing were distributed on a first-come , first-serve basis . for both the clinton memoirs , german publisher econ-verlag , ordered an initial print-run of 100,000 copies .
though hillary clinton 's book was an immediate bestseller in germany , publicist carl carlsberg told dw-world that he expects her husband 's book to ring up more sales , as has been the case on the u.s. market . " in some sense , her book paved the way for bill 's autobiography , " carlsberg said .
" but bill clinton 's book will be much more successful .
he was , after all , the president , and only he can deliver those first-hand insights into politics . " rock-star aura bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton enjoyed rock star-like receptions on his past visits to berlin .
it 's unlikely that german sales of the book will match those in the u.s. , where it topped a million sales in the first week despite negative reviews such as that in the new york times , which called it " sloppy , self-indulgent and often eye-crossingly dull . " but there 's no denying the buzz surrounding the book 's german launch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former gov. bill clinton and his wife , hillary , celebrate his victory in the democratic runoff on june 8 , 1982 in little rock , ark .
" clinton has always been a popular president , " gary smith , director of the american academy in berlin told dw-world .
" i remember the two times he came to berlin , he had the aura of a rock star , not only for expats , but for germans as well .
he 's the most eloquent and international of presidents in memory .
he was educated abroad , he 's deeply passionate about politics , and more knowledgeable than most politicians about a broad range of issues .
that 's something that is , in a way , very european , because those qualities would also be expected of a british or german head of state . " clinton 's appeal can also be attributed to germans ' dissatisfaction with the current u.s. administration , said prof. reinhard isensee of the american studies department at berlin 's humboldt university . " in hindsight , he seems to be very different from the present president , " isensee told dw-world .
" people liked his way of approaching issues , even though they may not know that some of the current administration 's actions have their roots in things clinton did during his term . " the lewinsky factor across the atlantic , much of the hype surrounding clinton 's book has arisen because of curiosity over what the ex-president would say about his affair with former white house intern monica lewinsky .
but smith said those revelations wo n't be a major motivation for germans to shell out € 28 for a copy of " my life . " " the lewinsky affair was of less interest to europeans in general , " smith said .
" at the time , there was a widespread attitude of incomprehension about the impeachment proceedings .
germans could n't comprehend it was happening because he was trying to cover up an illicit liaison with another woman .
the fact that germans are so interested in his memoir says something deeper about germany 's relationship to the u.s. - and a strong foundation of pro-american feeling among german people . " in the book , which some reviewers have said reads like a very detailed diary , clinton tells how , after confessing to the affair , hillary insisted he sleep on the couch for a good two months .
he only managed to save his marriage and his relationship to daughter chelsea , by undergoing extensive family and individual therapy . but the first mention of monica lewinsky comes well over half-way into the book .
clinton devotes far more space to describing his troubled childhood in arkansas , and his astounding rise to his country 's highest office .
that is something that captures the german imagination , isensee said . appeal of the american dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill clinton : " mein leben . "
" germans want to read a story about someone who came from a socially disadvantaged background and worked his way up , " isensee said .
" with american personalities , they relate to this idea of the american dream , which was very true for clinton .
he had a tough childhood , he encountered various obstacles on his way up , and he 's a sort of witness of current american history . " for his account of recent history , clinton received a healthy $ 10 million advance - $ 2 million more than hillary received for her memoirs .
" i hope my publishers get their money back , " he was quoted as saying at the time of the book 's u.s. launch .
with world-wide sales of " my life " in 30 languages , clinton 's publishers can rest assured they will get their money back .
to ensure maximum regional interest , publishers have even taken the novel step of releasing custom-edited national editions .
the spanish-language edition , for example , contains lengthier passages on mexico 's debt crisis , while european editions devote more space to the balkans crisis and the kosovo bombings . " there was largely a commercial motivation , " smith said of clinton 's decision to pen his memoirs now .
" but of course , there was a political motivation too .
it was about setting the record straight on the issues that clouded his presidency - monica , the impeachment , and his bitterness about the way he was pursued by the right-wing - this hatred of clinton .

ministers from the states of hesse , lower saxony and bavaria had already signaled their support for a federal database where information on suspects from all states would be combined with national files to build a comprehensive list of suspected terrorists in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal interior minister otto schily schily -lrb- photo -rrb- added that , up until now , the transfer of information between individual departments had been unsatisfactory .
the federal interior minister told the german magazine stern that everything must be done to ensure " that really every detail goes into the central file . " for several months now , the state-level office for the protection of the constitution intelligence agencies have been sparring with berlin over proposals to abolish the state offices and consolidate them at the federal level or in a smaller grouping of regional offices . liberals protest over too much transparency the opposition free democratic party liberals , however , rejected the claim for a central database .
the fdp 's spokesperson for domestic affairs , max städter , told the berliner zeitung that the fight against terrorism should go on but by following constitutional principles .
he argued that a central file would provide the intelligence agencies with access to domestic police files and therefore more than just the necessary information to investigate terror suspects .
städter instead suggested creating two separate databases . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schily calls for unity in war on terror german interior minister otto schily opened the european police congress in bonn on monday with a speech that demanded more cooperation and resilience from all sides collaborating in the fight against terrorism .

ministers from the states of hesse , lower saxony and bavaria had already signaled their support for a federal database where information on suspects from all states would be combined with national files to build a comprehensive list of suspected terrorists in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal interior minister otto schily schily -lrb- photo -rrb- added that , up until now , the transfer of information between individual departments had been unsatisfactory .
the federal interior minister told the german magazine stern that everything must be done to ensure " that really every detail goes into the central file . " for several months now , the state-level office for the protection of the constitution intelligence agencies have been sparring with berlin over proposals to abolish the state offices and consolidate them at the federal level or in a smaller grouping of regional offices . liberals protest over too much transparency the opposition free democratic party liberals , however , rejected the claim for a central database .
the fdp 's spokesperson for domestic affairs , max städter , told the berliner zeitung that the fight against terrorism should go on but by following constitutional principles .
he argued that a central file would provide the intelligence agencies with access to domestic police files and therefore more than just the necessary information to investigate terror suspects .
städter instead suggested creating two separate databases . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schily calls for unity in war on terror german interior minister otto schily opened the european police congress in bonn on monday with a speech that demanded more cooperation and resilience from all sides collaborating in the fight against terrorism .

the company 's revenues come mainly from the sale of wine , liquor , prêt-a-porter fashion and leather goods . hermes , synonymous with high-end accessories and perfumes , holds 35 percent of shares of jean-paul gaultier .
yves saint laurent has been taken over by sanoli .
jean-louis scherrer left his company after 30 years when seibu from japan took over . versace has also dropped haute couture for a pragmatic reason : after losses in 2002 , the company simply did n't have enough money to put on a show . balmain fashion house , founded in 1914 , is bankrupt but still hopes for a revival .
givenchy has nothing to offer , because the company is still looking for a successor for its former british chief designer , julien macdonald . faking it " the dress must not hang on the body but follow its lines , " madelein vionnet , grande dame of french fashion , once said about her work .
" it must accompany its wearer and when a woman smiles , the dress must smile with her . " haute couture remains unique and any standardization is strictly taboo : it 's fashion that beautifies drooping shoulders , hides crane-like necks and creates the perfect décolleté . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hennes & mauritz store in brussels but the luxury comes at a steep price : day dresses cost about € 15,000 , an evening gown starts at € 35,000 .
is it worth that ?
even the super rich have begun to get stingy and turn to small tailors who will copy the original for a fraction of the price . fashion discounters such as zara and h & m also look at the collections for inspiration .
grumbach of the federation francaise de la couture bemoans the development - but there 's very little he can do to keep it from happening . ingun arnold -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lagerfeld at h & m : couture goes to the mall haute couture demigod karl lagerfeld has announced he 's designing a line of clothing for the swedish cut-rate retailer hennes & mauritz , h & m. the german-born designer for chanel and fendi insists he 's not just slumming .

but many developing countries complain they have still not been guaranteed many of the concessions promised by the west three years ago .
the european union just recently said it would begin to phase out farming subsidies which developing countries argue distort global market prices .
under the doha agreement developing countries won a deal on patent rules allowing them to buy some cheaper generic drugs if faced with a medical emergency like hiv / aids .
however the patenting of other life forms including food products was not addressed by the trade body .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.07.2004 britain in row with eu over budget rebate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair faces a showdown with brussels britain 's eu budget rebate could be cut after the european commission admitted it would debate plans to that effect in the coming weeks .
if approved , the u.k. would become the biggest net contributor of eu funds . britain is preparing to face off with its eu partners over plans to bring its € 3 billion eu budget rebate to an end and make britain the largest net contributor to eu funds , relative to the size of its economy .
the european commission 's plans for the budgetary period from 2007-2013 , drawn up by german budgetary commissioner michaele schreyer , would bring to a close the rebate which has been in place since 1984 .
if it is abolished , britain will become the biggest contributor to the eu 's € 100 billion a year budget and contribute 0.51 percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , compared to 0.35 for italy and 0.31 percent for france , countries of a similar size and wealth .
the rebate was originally introduced as compensation for britain which paid much more into eu coffers than it got back , largely because it benefited less than other member states from the common agricultural policy .
prime minister margaret thatcher secured the deal with german chancellor helmut kohl and french president francois mitterrand after famously demanding : " i want my money back . "
funds for new states prompt rethink but the introduction of ten new member states in may means that new eu regional and structural funds go largely to the accession countries , narrowing the net contributions gap between britain and other veteran members .
the commission says that if things are not changed , britain would pay just 0.25 percent of its gdp to the eu between 2007 and 2013 , compared with , for example , 0.56 percent for the netherlands and 0.54 percent for germany .
" the uk is going to become the smallest net contributor to the eu budget ... as a result , the current system of a correction reserved exclusively for the uk can not continue , " schreyer told reporters .
instead , brussels proposes a " general refund mechanism , " which would share out the rebate equally between all member states whose contributions to the eu exceed 0.35 percent of their gdp . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new plans to ease burden on eu net contributors the idea was proposed at an informal meeting of finance ministers and would go some way to easing concerns of net contributors to the eu budget that they are being asked to pay too much into the union 's coffers .

germany is losing jobs to lower wage countries and consumers at home , who are either unemployed because of the job-drain or worried about losing work , are n't loosening their purse strings either . the result is devastating for the german economy , which has been more or less stagnant over recent years .
exacerbating the problem are pension and health reforms introduced by the social democrat-green party government which mean less money in retirement and higher healthcare costs for patients . the upshot is that germany has found itself in a vicious circle .
if it reduces government spending , taxpayers will have fewer services or have to pay more .
but with lower wages and an uncertain future , people will not be able to pay for the essential goods and services they need . will a longer workweek save jobs ? for literally years now , the question has been : how to solve this dilemma ?
the latest remedial suggestion comes from klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research and ulrich ramm , chief economist at germany ’ s third largest bank , commerzbank . both men have proposed introducing a 50-hour workweek to prevent even more jobs being exported to low-wage countries .
ramm said he thinks germany has room for more jobs , but they have to be affordable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high wages make production in germany more expensive than in other countries .
" i can see a realistic chance for discussion and we should perhaps work a bit more because in germany we have a lack of payable labor and it 's not the lack of labor overall , " he said . in ramm ’ s view , the 50-hour workweek would not be permanent : by establishing a work-hour account of up to 50 hours for peak production periods , when production slowed , employees could work 30 hours instead for the same pay , he said . michael hüther , director of the german economic institute , agreed with ramm ’ s assessment and argued for a generally more flexible workweek .
still others , like gerhard handke , from the german wholesale and foreign trade association , think workers should also give up a week ’ s vacation per year to make germany more competitive . handke pointed to ireland , where workers have just 20 days off a year , compared to six weeks in germany .
handke reduced the situation to a simple formula : you can not remain affluent and continue working less than everybody else . an " abstruse proposal " ? meanwhile , one of germany ’ s most prominent economists , peter bofinger , a professor at the university of würzburg and a member of germany ’ s prestigious group of economic advisers , known as the “ wise men , ” is opposed to a longer workweek .
he conceded that longer hours are good for business , but warns of dangerous deflationary pressures when consumer buying power declines : " working longer means there will be less purchasing power in the hands of workers and given that we have a problem with our domestic demand this problem will be aggravated , " he said .
" as the example of the japanese economy shows , if you reduce wages in a relatively large economy in order to boost employment , you get just the opposite effect . " bofinger , at least , can be sure of support from germany ’ s labor unions .
the head of the country ’ s construction and agriculture union , klaus wiesehügel , called the 50-hour week an " abstruse proposal " that would generate more unemployment . even the chairman of germany ’ s technology giant , siemens , heinrich von pierer , said that talk of a 50-hour week was not very helpful in the current climate and would make people more insecure . gregg benzow -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : the job market limps along the long-awaited and forever promised economic revival in germany is a major topic in the nation ’ s newspapers this wednesday .

germany is losing jobs to lower wage countries and consumers at home , who are either unemployed because of the job-drain or worried about losing work , are n't loosening their purse strings either . the result is devastating for the german economy , which has been more or less stagnant over recent years .
exacerbating the problem are pension and health reforms introduced by the social democrat-green party government which mean less money in retirement and higher healthcare costs for patients . the upshot is that germany has found itself in a vicious circle .
if it reduces government spending , taxpayers will have fewer services or have to pay more .
but with lower wages and an uncertain future , people will not be able to pay for the essential goods and services they need . will a longer workweek save jobs ? for literally years now , the question has been : how to solve this dilemma ?
the latest remedial suggestion comes from klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research and ulrich ramm , chief economist at germany ’ s third largest bank , commerzbank . both men have proposed introducing a 50-hour workweek to prevent even more jobs being exported to low-wage countries .
ramm said he thinks germany has room for more jobs , but they have to be affordable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high wages make production in germany more expensive than in other countries .
" i can see a realistic chance for discussion and we should perhaps work a bit more because in germany we have a lack of payable labor and it 's not the lack of labor overall , " he said . in ramm ’ s view , the 50-hour workweek would not be permanent : by establishing a work-hour account of up to 50 hours for peak production periods , when production slowed , employees could work 30 hours instead for the same pay , he said . michael hüther , director of the german economic institute , agreed with ramm ’ s assessment and argued for a generally more flexible workweek .
still others , like gerhard handke , from the german wholesale and foreign trade association , think workers should also give up a week ’ s vacation per year to make germany more competitive . handke pointed to ireland , where workers have just 20 days off a year , compared to six weeks in germany .
handke reduced the situation to a simple formula : you can not remain affluent and continue working less than everybody else . an " abstruse proposal " ? meanwhile , one of germany ’ s most prominent economists , peter bofinger , a professor at the university of würzburg and a member of germany ’ s prestigious group of economic advisers , known as the “ wise men , ” is opposed to a longer workweek .

the neighbors have issues of a failing democracy and economy to resolve . officials from the european union and the ukraine are meeting on thursday in the hague to discuss the relationship between the ukraine and the recently expanded eu .
the europeans are expected to pose some serious questions about the failing standards of democracy under the government of leonid kutschma , with many eu politicians loath to see him remain in office . the ukraine is beginning to look like the eu 's problem neighbor .
the former soviet republic has been described in brussels as a nation with failing democratic standards , which are becoming very noticeable as the country prepares for a presidential election in october . president criticized for democratic failures kutschma , the current ukraine president , has been criticized for many shortcomings in the running of a free market economy and the media coverage of the suspicious murder of journalist georgiy gongadze .
senior political and security figures have been implicated in the killing and many see it as a government effort to muzzle the press . the case of the murdered journalist has become a sticking point in bilateral talks - with the ukraine telling the eu to mind its own business while the eu cites it as a clear case of democratic deficiency in the ukraine .
brussels is slowly losing its patience and is hoping the elections in october will bring about positive change . “ we expect that the new president will follow the principles of an open-market economy , " eu member of parliament elisabeth schrödter told deutsche welle .
" we expect that the decision made by the ukrainian parliament , that ukrainian legislation will be adapted to conform to eu laws , will be put into practice .
we hope for concrete strategies in this respect and not just empty words . ” ukraine wants economic acknowledgement at thursday 's summit , the ukrainian government expects europe to tackle this thorny topic and acknowledge the country as a free market economy , which would also facilitate the ukraine ’ s entry to the world trade organization .
however , eu officials say they have had trouble finding reliable negotiators on the ukrainian side and a resolution may again be impossible at this stage . brussels will be watching the presidential elections in the ukraine closely .

the neighbors have issues of a failing democracy and economy to resolve . officials from the european union and the ukraine are meeting on thursday in the hague to discuss the relationship between the ukraine and the recently expanded eu .
the europeans are expected to pose some serious questions about the failing standards of democracy under the government of leonid kutschma , with many eu politicians loath to see him remain in office . the ukraine is beginning to look like the eu 's problem neighbor .
the former soviet republic has been described in brussels as a nation with failing democratic standards , which are becoming very noticeable as the country prepares for a presidential election in october . president criticized for democratic failures kutschma , the current ukraine president , has been criticized for many shortcomings in the running of a free market economy and the media coverage of the suspicious murder of journalist georgiy gongadze .
senior political and security figures have been implicated in the killing and many see it as a government effort to muzzle the press . the case of the murdered journalist has become a sticking point in bilateral talks - with the ukraine telling the eu to mind its own business while the eu cites it as a clear case of democratic deficiency in the ukraine .
brussels is slowly losing its patience and is hoping the elections in october will bring about positive change . “ we expect that the new president will follow the principles of an open-market economy , " eu member of parliament elisabeth schrödter told deutsche welle .
" we expect that the decision made by the ukrainian parliament , that ukrainian legislation will be adapted to conform to eu laws , will be put into practice .
we hope for concrete strategies in this respect and not just empty words . ” ukraine wants economic acknowledgement at thursday 's summit , the ukrainian government expects europe to tackle this thorny topic and acknowledge the country as a free market economy , which would also facilitate the ukraine ’ s entry to the world trade organization .
however , eu officials say they have had trouble finding reliable negotiators on the ukrainian side and a resolution may again be impossible at this stage . brussels will be watching the presidential elections in the ukraine closely .
most believe that a full change of government and policies in the ukraine is necessary for it to soldify the footing of its relationship with the eu . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de market status to come soon for ukraine during a meeting with ukraine 's premier viktor yanukovych , prodi hinted that the eu could grant ukraine its long sought-after market status at the forthcoming eu-ukraine ministerial meeting in july .

the message : larger german firms are already successful there and smaller ones should follow suit . after the russian economy collapsed in 1998 , the import and export industries likewise suffered .
in the meantime , however , little evidence remains of those troubled times , and russia presents a significant opportunity for german companies - both large and small . " the russian market is growing at an annual rate of 6 to 8 percent , and that 's particularly exciting for producers of consumer products , " says manfred sapper of the berlin-based german society for east european studies -lrb- dgo -rrb- .
as a result , german-russian trade is on the rise : last year trade volume between the two countries reached a record high of € 25.5 billion -lrb- $ 30.9 billion -rrb- . this trend is mirrored in trade relations between the whole of the european union and russia - 50 percent of all imports to russia come from the eu .
the only problem , according to sapper , is the fact that there is a massive trade imbalance between the eu and russia .
only five percent of the goods imported to the eu come from russia . the metro-group on the advance the düsseldorf-based retailer metro group is one of the largest german investors in russia .
the company stocks many of the consumer products russia 's 145 million inhabitants are looking to buy , and that 's proven to be a recipe for success . hans-joachim körber , the head of metro , is a prominent member of the delegation accompanying the chancellor on his trip to russia .
" we have been successful in russia since 2001 , " says jürgen homeyer , a spokesman for the metro-group . the large german retailer has five stores in moscow and two in st. petersburg .
to hear homeyer tell it , the metro group 's experience in russia has been nothing but positive .
" after just two years , our affiliates were already in the black , " he says .
" of course , our investments totalling more than € 15 million per store have not been redeemed yet , but we are still growing . " 90 percent of products produced in russia " in the coming year , we will increase the number of metro stores to 17 , " says homeyer .
but his company is not just in it for a short-term profit , he says .
they are looking to build-up stable long-term relations .
" in most cases , we buy the land we build our stores on , invest in the local infrastructure , create jobs , and 90 percent of the goods we sell come from russia , " he says . for homeyer , that explains why his company is so beloved in russia .
" the moscow mayor has been particularly supportive , " he says .
for other firms hoping to break into the russian market , the metro group 's experience sounds like a dream .
but , warns homeyer , it 's important to spend the time researching the market . warning : get expert advice it 's not all cinderella stories , as seems to have been the case for the metro group .
the russian market does pose certain risks .
smaller firms hoping to follow-up on the success of larger forerunners should seek expert advice , say those familiar with the pitfalls . " these companies should look for advice early , so they have a realistic understanding of the conditions of the russian market , " says peter presber , an expert on russia for the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
" there are huge differences between german and russian bureaucracy and corruption remains a problem , " he says . the fate of yukos , one of russia 's largest oil producers , for example , has made some foreign investors weary . they fear the arrest of the company 's former head , mikhail khodorkovsky , which caused the russian stock market to take a tumble , was politically motivated .
on wednesday night the saga continued , and bailiffs moved in on the yukos main offices after a midnight deadline passed for the company to pay a $ 3.4 billion tax bill from 2000 .

the message : larger german firms are already successful there and smaller ones should follow suit . after the russian economy collapsed in 1998 , the import and export industries likewise suffered .
in the meantime , however , little evidence remains of those troubled times , and russia presents a significant opportunity for german companies - both large and small . " the russian market is growing at an annual rate of 6 to 8 percent , and that 's particularly exciting for producers of consumer products , " says manfred sapper of the berlin-based german society for east european studies -lrb- dgo -rrb- .
as a result , german-russian trade is on the rise : last year trade volume between the two countries reached a record high of € 25.5 billion -lrb- $ 30.9 billion -rrb- . this trend is mirrored in trade relations between the whole of the european union and russia - 50 percent of all imports to russia come from the eu .
the only problem , according to sapper , is the fact that there is a massive trade imbalance between the eu and russia .
only five percent of the goods imported to the eu come from russia . the metro-group on the advance the düsseldorf-based retailer metro group is one of the largest german investors in russia .
the company stocks many of the consumer products russia 's 145 million inhabitants are looking to buy , and that 's proven to be a recipe for success . hans-joachim körber , the head of metro , is a prominent member of the delegation accompanying the chancellor on his trip to russia .
" we have been successful in russia since 2001 , " says jürgen homeyer , a spokesman for the metro-group . the large german retailer has five stores in moscow and two in st. petersburg .
to hear homeyer tell it , the metro group 's experience in russia has been nothing but positive .
" after just two years , our affiliates were already in the black , " he says .
" of course , our investments totalling more than € 15 million per store have not been redeemed yet , but we are still growing . " 90 percent of products produced in russia " in the coming year , we will increase the number of metro stores to 17 , " says homeyer .
but his company is not just in it for a short-term profit , he says .
they are looking to build-up stable long-term relations .
" in most cases , we buy the land we build our stores on , invest in the local infrastructure , create jobs , and 90 percent of the goods we sell come from russia , " he says . for homeyer , that explains why his company is so beloved in russia .
" the moscow mayor has been particularly supportive , " he says .
for other firms hoping to break into the russian market , the metro group 's experience sounds like a dream .
but , warns homeyer , it 's important to spend the time researching the market . warning : get expert advice it 's not all cinderella stories , as seems to have been the case for the metro group .
the russian market does pose certain risks .
smaller firms hoping to follow-up on the success of larger forerunners should seek expert advice , say those familiar with the pitfalls . " these companies should look for advice early , so they have a realistic understanding of the conditions of the russian market , " says peter presber , an expert on russia for the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
" there are huge differences between german and russian bureaucracy and corruption remains a problem , " he says . the fate of yukos , one of russia 's largest oil producers , for example , has made some foreign investors weary . they fear the arrest of the company 's former head , mikhail khodorkovsky , which caused the russian stock market to take a tumble , was politically motivated .
on wednesday night the saga continued , and bailiffs moved in on the yukos main offices after a midnight deadline passed for the company to pay a $ 3.4 billion tax bill from 2000 .
the move is likely to force the company into bankruptcy . on the other hand , presber does credit the russians with making improvements .
" in the last five or six years , numerous new laws have been passed that have improved the situation for foreign companies , " he says .

if approved , the u.k. would become the biggest net contributor of eu funds . britain is preparing to face off with its eu partners over plans to bring its € 3 billion eu budget rebate to an end and make britain the largest net contributor to eu funds , relative to the size of its economy .
the european commission 's plans for the budgetary period from 2007-2013 , drawn up by german budgetary commissioner michaele schreyer , would bring to a close the rebate which has been in place since 1984 .
if it is abolished , britain will become the biggest contributor to the eu 's € 100 billion a year budget and contribute 0.51 percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , compared to 0.35 for italy and 0.31 percent for france , countries of a similar size and wealth .
the rebate was originally introduced as compensation for britain which paid much more into eu coffers than it got back , largely because it benefited less than other member states from the common agricultural policy .
prime minister margaret thatcher secured the deal with german chancellor helmut kohl and french president francois mitterrand after famously demanding : " i want my money back . "
funds for new states prompt rethink but the introduction of ten new member states in may means that new eu regional and structural funds go largely to the accession countries , narrowing the net contributions gap between britain and other veteran members .
the commission says that if things are not changed , britain would pay just 0.25 percent of its gdp to the eu between 2007 and 2013 , compared with , for example , 0.56 percent for the netherlands and 0.54 percent for germany .
" the uk is going to become the smallest net contributor to the eu budget ... as a result , the current system of a correction reserved exclusively for the uk can not continue , " schreyer told reporters .

dr andrew mclellan , chief inspector of prisons for scotland , said the problem at greenock prison was having a demoralising effect on prisoners .
but he praised the jail for addressing almost every concern raised last year .
it has experienced no escapes , low levels of violence and a full programme of work and activities for women .

" many prisoners in ailsa hall have an empty day , with prisoners on remand and on protection having the least opportunities to take part in useful activities . "

bridgend , cardiff and swansea are among 77 towns and cities across wales and england involved in the campaign .
people who sell alcohol to under-18s , and bars and clubs accused of promoting drunkenness and drink-related violence will be targeted .
the two welsh forces involved are dyfed-powys and south wales .
but the plans - put forward by the home office and the association of chief police officers -lrb- acpo -rrb- - have already attracted some criticism .
dyfed-powys chief constable terry grange has accused the uk government of a " knee-jerk " response to binge drinking , while letting bars open 24 hours a day . "

sting operations the campaign , which is launched on thursday , will use tough enforcement measures to take action against those who buy and sell alcohol .
the powers they will use will include closing ' rowdy ' premises for 24 hours and issuing £ 40 fixed penalty notices for being drunk and disorderly .
under-18s will also be used for sting operations in off-licences , supermarkets , bars and clubs .
there will also be " naming and shaming " of bars and clubs after conviction .
the aim of the eight-week campaign , according to home office minister hazel blears , is to create a society where it is less acceptable to get drunk and behave in an anti-social or violent manner .
" we 're aiming to kick start a culture change where it will be less accepted by society for young men and women to go out and drink until they ca n't remember who they are , to start fights in taxi queues , and cause violent , drink-fuelled scenes , " she said .

bridgend , cardiff and swansea are among 77 towns and cities across wales and england involved in the campaign .
people who sell alcohol to under-18s , and bars and clubs accused of promoting drunkenness and drink-related violence will be targeted .
the two welsh forces involved are dyfed-powys and south wales .
but the plans - put forward by the home office and the association of chief police officers -lrb- acpo -rrb- - have already attracted some criticism .
dyfed-powys chief constable terry grange has accused the uk government of a " knee-jerk " response to binge drinking , while letting bars open 24 hours a day .
we are working closely with the police , drinks industry and local councils to reclaim our town and city centres for decent , law abiding citizens hazel blears mr grange blamed ministers for failing to plan a long-term response to alcohol abuse , " hypocritical " licensees and parents who taught their children how to drink too much .
sting operations the campaign , which is launched on thursday , will use tough enforcement measures to take action against those who buy and sell alcohol .
the powers they will use will include closing ' rowdy ' premises for 24 hours and issuing £ 40 fixed penalty notices for being drunk and disorderly .
under-18s will also be used for sting operations in off-licences , supermarkets , bars and clubs .
there will also be " naming and shaming " of bars and clubs after conviction .
the aim of the eight-week campaign , according to home office minister hazel blears , is to create a society where it is less acceptable to get drunk and behave in an anti-social or violent manner .
" we 're aiming to kick start a culture change where it will be less accepted by society for young men and women to go out and drink until they ca n't remember who they are , to start fights in taxi queues , and cause violent , drink-fuelled scenes , " she said .
" we are working closely with the police , drinks industry and local councils to reclaim our town and city centres for decent , law-abiding citizens . "

mr green has raised his proposed takeover offer for m & s to £ 4 a share .
the offer is 8 % higher than his previous one of about 370p per share , but will have to be recommended by the m & s board before becoming a formal bid .
meanwhile , mr green 's request for a meeting with the pension fund trustees of the firm has been turned down .
mr green said on thursday the new offer had the support of schroder investment management limited , which owns around 1.2 % of m & s shares , conditional upon acceptance of the offer by the retailer 's board .
it comes a day after m & s 's biggest shareholder , us-based investment group brandes said it would support his offer if it was backed by the m & s board .
it has agreed to sell its 11.7 % stake in m & s if he makes a formal bid .
mr green 's latest offer values m & s at around £ 9.1bn -lrb- $ 17bn -rrb- .
" i think the marks and spencer board will basically have to decide what they want to do , " mr green told the bbc .
i think we still need to hear from m & s what their plans for the business actually are robert talbot , isis asset management q & a : the takeover battle he said they could accept the offer " on the table " , recommend its acceptance , and allow mr green access to its books , or they could reject the offer .
" there is nothing to negotiate , " he said .
" this is it , this is the price . "
shares in m & s gained 2 % at the close of trade on the london stock exchange , up 8.25 pence at 368.25 pence .
' bid merits consideration ' the m & s board met on wednesday afternoon to consider its response , without coming to any conclusion .
standard life , owner of 2 % of m & s and thus one of its larger institutional shareholders , has said the proposal " merits consideration " .
" marks & spencer will now have to clearly articulate their new strategy under stuart rose and then respond to shareholder views on the strategy before deciding whether to accept or reject the bid , " standard life said in a statement .
and robert talbot of isis asset management , which holds m & s shares , said the new bid had a better chance of success than mr green 's previous offers .
" i think it 's an offer that shareholders would want to take seriously , " he told bbc radio 4 .
" but lots of shareholders will have differences of opinion as to what is the right price for them to sell .
" and i think we still need to hear from m & s what their plans for the business actually are . "
newly installed m & s chief executive stuart rose is due to give an update on cost savings at m & s on 12 july .
pension deficit mr green , owner of bhs and high street fashion stores top shop , dorothy perkins and miss selfridge , has long signalled his desire to take over the retailer through his bid vehicle revival acquisitions .
he has now made three offers for m & s. 1 .
first philip green offer 2 .
m & s reject bid 3 .
second philip green offer 4 .
second m & s rejection 5 .
latest offer from tycoon check m & s 's share price the first two - one offering 310p per share in cash and a 25 % stake in revival , and a second cash offer worth about 370p a share - were both rejected .
thursday 's cash-only approach suggests a cash and share alternative comprising 335 pence a share in cash and a 30 % equity interest in revival .
on tuesday the uk 's takeover panel gave mr green until midday on 6 august to make a formal offer for the high street favourite .
meeting but the deal still hinges on the support of the m & s board , and other conditions , including being allowed a closer look at m & s 's accounts .
" this is the biggest amount of money ever put up in europe , " mr green said .
" most people would understand that we need to get an element of comfort because we are on the outside looking in .
that ca n't be unreasonable . "
separately , trustees of m & s 's pension board have declined an invitation to meet mr green .
mr green is said to be looking to find out how much the pension fund 's liabilities and shortfall may be taken into account in any takeover .
but the trustees said it was not their role to either help or hinder any potential bidder for the company .
they added that they believed they were not in a position to share any information about the pension scheme which was not already public knowledge .
m & s disclosed a pensions deficit of at least £ 585m in march .
property values in the meantime , investors are eagerly awaiting mr rose 's 12 july update , which is expected to include savings from the supply chain , a revaluation of m & s property and initiatives to drive like-for-like sales .
retail analyst nick bubb of evolution beeson gregory said he thought the review would be " pretty punchy " and that profits forecasts may be moved up .
" this is not a joke offer -lrb- from mr green -rrb- but , given all that m & s is doing to improve profitability , i think it 's not going to be quite enough , " he said .
he said he did not think m & s , which has still to react to the proposal , would give mr green the recommendation he was after .

shares in m & s gained 2 % at the close of trade on the london stock exchange , up 8.25 pence at 368.25 pence .
' bid merits consideration ' the m & s board met on wednesday afternoon to consider its response , without coming to any conclusion .
standard life , owner of 2 % of m & s and thus one of its larger institutional shareholders , has said the proposal " merits consideration " .
" marks & spencer will now have to clearly articulate their new strategy under stuart rose and then respond to shareholder views on the strategy before deciding whether to accept or reject the bid , " standard life said in a statement .
and robert talbot of isis asset management , which holds m & s shares , said the new bid had a better chance of success than mr green 's previous offers .
" i think it 's an offer that shareholders would want to take seriously , " he told bbc radio 4 .
" but lots of shareholders will have differences of opinion as to what is the right price for them to sell .
" and i think we still need to hear from m & s what their plans for the business actually are . "
newly installed m & s chief executive stuart rose is due to give an update on cost savings at m & s on 12 july .
pension deficit mr green , owner of bhs and high street fashion stores top shop , dorothy perkins and miss selfridge , has long signalled his desire to take over the retailer through his bid vehicle revival acquisitions .
he has now made three offers for m & s. 1 .
first philip green offer 2 .
m & s reject bid 3 .
second philip green offer 4 .
second m & s rejection 5 .
latest offer from tycoon check m & s 's share price the first two - one offering 310p per share in cash and a 25 % stake in revival , and a second cash offer worth about 370p a share - were both rejected .
thursday 's cash-only approach suggests a cash and share alternative comprising 335 pence a share in cash and a 30 % equity interest in revival .
on tuesday the uk 's takeover panel gave mr green until midday on 6 august to make a formal offer for the high street favourite .
meeting but the deal still hinges on the support of the m & s board , and other conditions , including being allowed a closer look at m & s 's accounts .
" this is the biggest amount of money ever put up in europe , " mr green said .
" most people would understand that we need to get an element of comfort because we are on the outside looking in .
that ca n't be unreasonable . "
separately , trustees of m & s 's pension board have declined an invitation to meet mr green .
mr green is said to be looking to find out how much the pension fund 's liabilities and shortfall may be taken into account in any takeover .
but the trustees said it was not their role to either help or hinder any potential bidder for the company .
they added that they believed they were not in a position to share any information about the pension scheme which was not already public knowledge .
m & s disclosed a pensions deficit of at least £ 585m in march .
property values in the meantime , investors are eagerly awaiting mr rose 's 12 july update , which is expected to include savings from the supply chain , a revaluation of m & s property and initiatives to drive like-for-like sales .
retail analyst nick bubb of evolution beeson gregory said he thought the review would be " pretty punchy " and that profits forecasts may be moved up .
" this is not a joke offer -lrb- from mr green -rrb- but , given all that m & s is doing to improve profitability , i think it 's not going to be quite enough , " he said .
he said he did not think m & s , which has still to react to the proposal , would give mr green the recommendation he was after .

the findings were contained in a social trends survey of life in the province published on thursday .
the number of single parent households has increased by 18 % in the last 10 years , accounting for almost 13 % of all households .
information firm experian compiled the report using data from the 2001 census and other sources .
the study also cited the emergence of what it called " student enclaves " in south belfast and coleraine , as more young people were studying at the universities there .
it said " thriving micro-economies " were operating for students , typically amid concentrations of privately rented terraced accommodation .
it also highlighted a population shift out of central belfast to suburbs and surrounding towns .
bangor , county down and newtownabbey , county antrim , were picked out as satellite towns serving an increasingly affluent commuter population .
decline the study also found a strong east-west divide , with towns west of the river bann suffering most from a decline in traditional industries .
" this has left a hard core of genuinely poor and breadline pensioners , welfare dependent single parent families and anti-social problems associated with drugs and crime , " it said .
towns east of the bann - which roughly divides the province in two - had retained a larger share of population and wealth .
each household was classified into one of 36 types in the survey , with names such as cultural avant garde , community stalwarts , cycles of poverty , breadline pensioners , proud traditions and rural entrepreneurs .
it was compiled using a mosaic classification system , which experian said was " an excellent predictor of many economic variables such as incomes , spending characteristics and household demand " .
the system operates at a household rather than postcode level .
rob haslingden of experian said the survey 's findings " will prove invaluable to social commentators , planners , investors , commercial and retail developers and many other organisations in the public and private sector " .

the labour msp for edinburgh east and musselburgh said there was strong anecdotal evidence that the problem was spreading in the capital .
she said executive guidelines banning schools from sending warning letters to parents were making matters worse .
ministers said they had stopped writing warning letters to reduce the " stigma " .
not ashamed ms deacon , who was the executive health minister from 1999 until jack mcconnell became first minister in december 2001 , said there was a case for moving away from the old-style alert letters .
however , she said : " if you stop sending out letters then you have got to do something else to raise awareness and to explain to parents how and when they can check their children 's heads and steps they can take that will tackle this .
" the best way of reducing stigma is to discuss this openly because any child can be affected by head lice so we should not be ashamed of talking about it . "
she said the executive had created advice packs on head lice but they were not being distributed widely enough .
the executive defended its approach , saying it had been writing to local authorities over the summer reminding them that they should be proactive in making parents aware of the risks .
nhs lothian said there was no evidence of an increase in head lice cases .
however , ms deacon said it was impossible to know the extent of the problem as there was " no systematic gathering of evidence " .
she added anecdotal evidence suggested that over recent years this problem has become " rife " in our communities .
" the executive acted on that to the extent of developing new guidance and putting out an information leaflet to parents , " ms deacon said .
" while this guidance was good intentioned , my concern is that it does not work .
" rather than raising awareness of this issue , what it serves to do is close down discussion and communication .
" if that happens , parents do n't know what to do , do n't know when to act and , as a consequence , head lice infections simply become more deep-rooted in our classrooms and in our communities . "
