german beer : worth a scientific look business -pipe- 23.04.2004 crying in your beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german beer market is firmly in foreign hands .
german beer day on april 23 celebrates germany 's famous reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law , which was established in 1516 .
unfortunately the country 's proud brewing tradition has n't helped the industry compete globally . germans love beer , there 's no doubt about that .
nearly every town or region has its own particular take on what is affectionately called " liquid bread " here .
the reinheitsgebot , set down by bavarian duke wilhelm iv , allows beer to be made from only hops , barley and water .
it 's a guideline that has served brewers who care about their product well over the centuries . making beer may not have changed radically over the past 500 years , but the beer industry certainly has , which is today big business on a global scale .
and that 's why german brewers have little reason to raise a mug of their favorite amber suds in celebration this friday of german beer day . the country 's fractionalized and provincial attitudes towards brewing - according to germany 's federal statistics office , there were 1,268 registered breweries in 2003 - has led to the creation of a mindboggling variety of beer . takeover targets but it has also made brewers easy targets for large foreign beer conglomerates looking to snap up bargains with growth potential .
in particular , belgium 's interbrew has been actively snapping up german brands , including the proud bavarian house spaten , which had been independent for over 600 years .
interbrew also owns germany 's ubiquitous beck 's beer . dutch brewer heineken started the raid on german beer makers in 2001 by buying half of munich-based schörghuber-gruppe , which makes paulaner , hacker-pschorr and kulmbacher beers .
that encouraged interbrew to go on an acquisition spree that started with beck 's and quickly added diebels and hasseröder before crowning things off last year with spaten .
not to be left out of the action , danish group carlsberg took over the hamburg-based holsten brewer at the being of 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many german beer aficionados , having their favorite drink sold off to the makers of what they consider inferior brews is humiliating , but spaten head jobst kayser-eichberg places blame squarely with those in the german brewing industry . " no global vision , provincial thinking , fantasies about staying independent and also pure vanity on the part of the german beer barons hindered mergers that could have led to a globally expanding german brewer , " kayser-eichberg told the associated press . consumption declining he also noted declining beer consumption in germany as a reason why local brewers will need a strong international partner to help increase export sales .
according to the munich-based ifo institute , germans drank only 118 liters per capita last year , compared to 122 liters in 2002 .
back in 1997 the germans swigged down on average 131 liters .
that means germans are now only the third biggest beer drinkers in europe , falling behind the czechs and the irish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite all the problems , the biggest insult for german beer lovers is perhaps yet to come .
during the 2006 world cup , which germany is hosting , german beer is likely to be banned from the country 's stadiums because u.s. beer giant anheuser-busch has a sponsoring agreement with soccer 's international governing body , fifa . on the brighter side , at least germans probably do n't have to fear that interbrew or heineken will try to supplant regional favorites with mass-produced foreign beers .
michael dietzsch , head of the second largest still german-run brewing concern bitburger , believes peoples ' local preferences are too strongly set for that . " that 's why foreign investors are buying german market brands and are n't trying to sell their own here , " dietzsch told the german news agency dpa . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's " bud " or nothing at world cup 2006 want to throw back a nice bavarian brew while watching a world cup match in germany in 2006 ?

german beer : worth a scientific look business -pipe- 23.04.2004 crying in your beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german beer market is firmly in foreign hands .
german beer day on april 23 celebrates germany 's famous reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law , which was established in 1516 .
unfortunately the country 's proud brewing tradition has n't helped the industry compete globally . germans love beer , there 's no doubt about that .
nearly every town or region has its own particular take on what is affectionately called " liquid bread " here .
the reinheitsgebot , set down by bavarian duke wilhelm iv , allows beer to be made from only hops , barley and water .
it 's a guideline that has served brewers who care about their product well over the centuries . making beer may not have changed radically over the past 500 years , but the beer industry certainly has , which is today big business on a global scale .
and that 's why german brewers have little reason to raise a mug of their favorite amber suds in celebration this friday of german beer day . the country 's fractionalized and provincial attitudes towards brewing - according to germany 's federal statistics office , there were 1,268 registered breweries in 2003 - has led to the creation of a mindboggling variety of beer . takeover targets but it has also made brewers easy targets for large foreign beer conglomerates looking to snap up bargains with growth potential .
in particular , belgium 's interbrew has been actively snapping up german brands , including the proud bavarian house spaten , which had been independent for over 600 years .
interbrew also owns germany 's ubiquitous beck 's beer . dutch brewer heineken started the raid on german beer makers in 2001 by buying half of munich-based schörghuber-gruppe , which makes paulaner , hacker-pschorr and kulmbacher beers .
that encouraged interbrew to go on an acquisition spree that started with beck 's and quickly added diebels and hasseröder before crowning things off last year with spaten .
not to be left out of the action , danish group carlsberg took over the hamburg-based holsten brewer at the being of 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many german beer aficionados , having their favorite drink sold off to the makers of what they consider inferior brews is humiliating , but spaten head jobst kayser-eichberg places blame squarely with those in the german brewing industry . " no global vision , provincial thinking , fantasies about staying independent and also pure vanity on the part of the german beer barons hindered mergers that could have led to a globally expanding german brewer , " kayser-eichberg told the associated press . consumption declining he also noted declining beer consumption in germany as a reason why local brewers will need a strong international partner to help increase export sales .
according to the munich-based ifo institute , germans drank only 118 liters per capita last year , compared to 122 liters in 2002 .
back in 1997 the germans swigged down on average 131 liters .
that means germans are now only the third biggest beer drinkers in europe , falling behind the czechs and the irish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite all the problems , the biggest insult for german beer lovers is perhaps yet to come .
during the 2006 world cup , which germany is hosting , german beer is likely to be banned from the country 's stadiums because u.s. beer giant anheuser-busch has a sponsoring agreement with soccer 's international governing body , fifa . on the brighter side , at least germans probably do n't have to fear that interbrew or heineken will try to supplant regional favorites with mass-produced foreign beers .
michael dietzsch , head of the second largest still german-run brewing concern bitburger , believes peoples ' local preferences are too strongly set for that . " that 's why foreign investors are buying german market brands and are n't trying to sell their own here , " dietzsch told the german news agency dpa . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's " bud " or nothing at world cup 2006 want to throw back a nice bavarian brew while watching a world cup match in germany in 2006 ?

german beer : worth a scientific look business -pipe- 23.04.2004 crying in your beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german beer market is firmly in foreign hands .
german beer day on april 23 celebrates germany 's famous reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law , which was established in 1516 .
unfortunately the country 's proud brewing tradition has n't helped the industry compete globally . germans love beer , there 's no doubt about that .
nearly every town or region has its own particular take on what is affectionately called " liquid bread " here .
the reinheitsgebot , set down by bavarian duke wilhelm iv , allows beer to be made from only hops , barley and water .
it 's a guideline that has served brewers who care about their product well over the centuries . making beer may not have changed radically over the past 500 years , but the beer industry certainly has , which is today big business on a global scale .
and that 's why german brewers have little reason to raise a mug of their favorite amber suds in celebration this friday of german beer day . the country 's fractionalized and provincial attitudes towards brewing - according to germany 's federal statistics office , there were 1,268 registered breweries in 2003 - has led to the creation of a mindboggling variety of beer . takeover targets but it has also made brewers easy targets for large foreign beer conglomerates looking to snap up bargains with growth potential .
in particular , belgium 's interbrew has been actively snapping up german brands , including the proud bavarian house spaten , which had been independent for over 600 years .
interbrew also owns germany 's ubiquitous beck 's beer . dutch brewer heineken started the raid on german beer makers in 2001 by buying half of munich-based schörghuber-gruppe , which makes paulaner , hacker-pschorr and kulmbacher beers .
that encouraged interbrew to go on an acquisition spree that started with beck 's and quickly added diebels and hasseröder before crowning things off last year with spaten .
not to be left out of the action , danish group carlsberg took over the hamburg-based holsten brewer at the being of 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many german beer aficionados , having their favorite drink sold off to the makers of what they consider inferior brews is humiliating , but spaten head jobst kayser-eichberg places blame squarely with those in the german brewing industry . " no global vision , provincial thinking , fantasies about staying independent and also pure vanity on the part of the german beer barons hindered mergers that could have led to a globally expanding german brewer , " kayser-eichberg told the associated press . consumption declining he also noted declining beer consumption in germany as a reason why local brewers will need a strong international partner to help increase export sales .
according to the munich-based ifo institute , germans drank only 118 liters per capita last year , compared to 122 liters in 2002 .
back in 1997 the germans swigged down on average 131 liters .
that means germans are now only the third biggest beer drinkers in europe , falling behind the czechs and the irish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite all the problems , the biggest insult for german beer lovers is perhaps yet to come .
during the 2006 world cup , which germany is hosting , german beer is likely to be banned from the country 's stadiums because u.s. beer giant anheuser-busch has a sponsoring agreement with soccer 's international governing body , fifa . on the brighter side , at least germans probably do n't have to fear that interbrew or heineken will try to supplant regional favorites with mass-produced foreign beers .
michael dietzsch , head of the second largest still german-run brewing concern bitburger , believes peoples ' local preferences are too strongly set for that . " that 's why foreign investors are buying german market brands and are n't trying to sell their own here , " dietzsch told the german news agency dpa . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's " bud " or nothing at world cup 2006 want to throw back a nice bavarian brew while watching a world cup match in germany in 2006 ?

as media organizations around the world continue to react to the screening of pictures showing princess diana dying in the wreckage of her car , the german journalist 's federation warned members not to show the images . the german journalist 's federation -lrb- djv -rrb- has joined the growing number of international press associations in condemning the use of images screened on u.s. television on wednesday which allegedly showed diana , princess of wales , as she lay dying in the wreck of her mercedes in a paris underpass . the broadcasting of the pictures , as part of an investigative report into the princess 's death in 1997 in the cbs show " 48 hours investigates " , was " not responsible journalism , " according to djv chairperson michael konken who warned the german media not to follow suit and show the images . konken called the decision by cbs " an unambiguous offence against the press code " during a press conference in berlin on thursday and stressed that human dignity stands above the need of viewers and readers for information .
he also warned that any use of the images as part of articles condemning the cbs report would be just as offensive . breaking taboos should not be a marketing tool konken also demanded that the policy of breaking taboos should not be employed as a calculated marketing instrument by publishing companies wanting to improve circulation or viewing figures .
the djv chairman concluded by saying any german organization pursuing such an action would face a reprimand from the german press council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess diana and dodi fayed died in a car crash in paris .
the black and white photos of diana and her lover dodi al fayed were taken shortly after the accident on august 31 , 1997 .
in the images , an unconscious diana is being attended to by a doctor who attempts to resuscitate her through the wreckage of her limousine .
two hours later , diana died in a paris clinic .
al fayed and the driver henri paul were also killed .
the pictures are part of a confidential 4,000-page accident report compiled by french investigators . cbs defends journalistic context on thursday , cbs spokesperson sandra genelius once again defended the decision to show the pictures as the outrage spread around the globe .
the spokesperson reiterated that the pictures were shown in the context of an interview with the doctor seen treating diana at the time as illustrations to accompany his statements .
the pictures were shown " in a journalistic context - an examination of the medical treatment given diana after the crash , " genelius said . the spokesperson added that it was not the intention of cbs for the pictures to be seen outside the united states .
however , there have been rumors that the pictures had been offered to a number of newspapers before cbs secured the images and aired them . the statements from the u.s. broadcaster in the immediate wake of the show on wednesday night did little to placate the press in britain where diana remains an icon almost seven years after her death .
the fact that someone had crossed the line and showed the first pictures of the dying princess caused outrage in the british press . british press united in outrage the guardian wrote that cbs had " plumb new depths of prurience in the princess diana industry " while the tabloid daily mirror called the airing of the pictures " hideous , horrible and offensive " and the sun described them as " horrific . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions from public figures mined the same vein .
while clarence house , the office of diana 's former husband , prince charles , and her two sons , declined to comment , royal-watchers expressed concern for the princess ' sons william , 21 -lrb- photo -rrb- and harry , 19 .
" it 's going to be painful for william and harry , " former buckingham palace spokesman dickie arbiter told bbc radio .
" they 're young men now .
they 're going to have to live with it for the rest of their lives . " buckingham palace , which speaks on behalf of diana 's sons , said it would not comment on the cbs pictures , but did not hide its displeasure .
" we 've made our opinion very clear in the past on this sort of thing and we wo n't be commenting specifically . "
british prime minister tony blair also expressed his distaste .
asked about the matter at his monthly news conference , blair told reporters : " i think everyone finds it distasteful that there are pictures that can cause distress to the family . "
princess 's family sickened by images a brief statement released on behalf of diana 's brother said " lord spencer and his family are shocked and sickened by cbs ' actions . "
dodi fayed 's father , mohamed al fayed , said cbs had behaved in " disgraceful and insensitive " manner .
" cbs obviously do n't care about the appalling effect of showing images of murder victims , " said fayed , who has long insisted that diana and his son were murdered .

as media organizations around the world continue to react to the screening of pictures showing princess diana dying in the wreckage of her car , the german journalist 's federation warned members not to show the images . the german journalist 's federation -lrb- djv -rrb- has joined the growing number of international press associations in condemning the use of images screened on u.s. television on wednesday which allegedly showed diana , princess of wales , as she lay dying in the wreck of her mercedes in a paris underpass . the broadcasting of the pictures , as part of an investigative report into the princess 's death in 1997 in the cbs show " 48 hours investigates " , was " not responsible journalism , " according to djv chairperson michael konken who warned the german media not to follow suit and show the images . konken called the decision by cbs " an unambiguous offence against the press code " during a press conference in berlin on thursday and stressed that human dignity stands above the need of viewers and readers for information .
he also warned that any use of the images as part of articles condemning the cbs report would be just as offensive . breaking taboos should not be a marketing tool konken also demanded that the policy of breaking taboos should not be employed as a calculated marketing instrument by publishing companies wanting to improve circulation or viewing figures .
the djv chairman concluded by saying any german organization pursuing such an action would face a reprimand from the german press council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess diana and dodi fayed died in a car crash in paris .
the black and white photos of diana and her lover dodi al fayed were taken shortly after the accident on august 31 , 1997 .
in the images , an unconscious diana is being attended to by a doctor who attempts to resuscitate her through the wreckage of her limousine .
two hours later , diana died in a paris clinic .
al fayed and the driver henri paul were also killed .
the pictures are part of a confidential 4,000-page accident report compiled by french investigators . cbs defends journalistic context on thursday , cbs spokesperson sandra genelius once again defended the decision to show the pictures as the outrage spread around the globe .
the spokesperson reiterated that the pictures were shown in the context of an interview with the doctor seen treating diana at the time as illustrations to accompany his statements .
the pictures were shown " in a journalistic context - an examination of the medical treatment given diana after the crash , " genelius said . the spokesperson added that it was not the intention of cbs for the pictures to be seen outside the united states .
however , there have been rumors that the pictures had been offered to a number of newspapers before cbs secured the images and aired them . the statements from the u.s. broadcaster in the immediate wake of the show on wednesday night did little to placate the press in britain where diana remains an icon almost seven years after her death .
the fact that someone had crossed the line and showed the first pictures of the dying princess caused outrage in the british press . british press united in outrage the guardian wrote that cbs had " plumb new depths of prurience in the princess diana industry " while the tabloid daily mirror called the airing of the pictures " hideous , horrible and offensive " and the sun described them as " horrific . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions from public figures mined the same vein .
while clarence house , the office of diana 's former husband , prince charles , and her two sons , declined to comment , royal-watchers expressed concern for the princess ' sons william , 21 -lrb- photo -rrb- and harry , 19 .
" it 's going to be painful for william and harry , " former buckingham palace spokesman dickie arbiter told bbc radio .
" they 're young men now .
they 're going to have to live with it for the rest of their lives . " buckingham palace , which speaks on behalf of diana 's sons , said it would not comment on the cbs pictures , but did not hide its displeasure .
" we 've made our opinion very clear in the past on this sort of thing and we wo n't be commenting specifically . "
british prime minister tony blair also expressed his distaste .
asked about the matter at his monthly news conference , blair told reporters : " i think everyone finds it distasteful that there are pictures that can cause distress to the family . "
princess 's family sickened by images a brief statement released on behalf of diana 's brother said " lord spencer and his family are shocked and sickened by cbs ' actions . "
dodi fayed 's father , mohamed al fayed , said cbs had behaved in " disgraceful and insensitive " manner .
" cbs obviously do n't care about the appalling effect of showing images of murder victims , " said fayed , who has long insisted that diana and his son were murdered .
a lengthy french investigation concluded the crash was an accident caused by drunk and speeding driver paul . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diana 's death : catastrophe or conspiracy ?

however , there have been rumors that the pictures had been offered to a number of newspapers before cbs secured the images and aired them . the statements from the u.s. broadcaster in the immediate wake of the show on wednesday night did little to placate the press in britain where diana remains an icon almost seven years after her death .

as media organizations around the world continue to react to the screening of pictures showing princess diana dying in the wreckage of her car , the german journalist 's federation warned members not to show the images . the german journalist 's federation -lrb- djv -rrb- has joined the growing number of international press associations in condemning the use of images screened on u.s. television on wednesday which allegedly showed diana , princess of wales , as she lay dying in the wreck of her mercedes in a paris underpass . the broadcasting of the pictures , as part of an investigative report into the princess 's death in 1997 in the cbs show " 48 hours investigates " , was " not responsible journalism , " according to djv chairperson michael konken who warned the german media not to follow suit and show the images . konken called the decision by cbs " an unambiguous offence against the press code " during a press conference in berlin on thursday and stressed that human dignity stands above the need of viewers and readers for information .
he also warned that any use of the images as part of articles condemning the cbs report would be just as offensive . breaking taboos should not be a marketing tool konken also demanded that the policy of breaking taboos should not be employed as a calculated marketing instrument by publishing companies wanting to improve circulation or viewing figures .
the djv chairman concluded by saying any german organization pursuing such an action would face a reprimand from the german press council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess diana and dodi fayed died in a car crash in paris .
the black and white photos of diana and her lover dodi al fayed were taken shortly after the accident on august 31 , 1997 .
in the images , an unconscious diana is being attended to by a doctor who attempts to resuscitate her through the wreckage of her limousine .
two hours later , diana died in a paris clinic .
al fayed and the driver henri paul were also killed .
the pictures are part of a confidential 4,000-page accident report compiled by french investigators . cbs defends journalistic context on thursday , cbs spokesperson sandra genelius once again defended the decision to show the pictures as the outrage spread around the globe .
the spokesperson reiterated that the pictures were shown in the context of an interview with the doctor seen treating diana at the time as illustrations to accompany his statements .
the pictures were shown " in a journalistic context - an examination of the medical treatment given diana after the crash , " genelius said . the spokesperson added that it was not the intention of cbs for the pictures to be seen outside the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 23.04.2004 german journalist federation warns media over diana images großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the images of the dying diana have caused widespread outrage .
as media organizations around the world continue to react to the screening of pictures showing princess diana dying in the wreckage of her car , the german journalist 's federation warned members not to show the images . the german journalist 's federation -lrb- djv -rrb- has joined the growing number of international press associations in condemning the use of images screened on u.s. television on wednesday which allegedly showed diana , princess of wales , as she lay dying in the wreck of her mercedes in a paris underpass . the broadcasting of the pictures , as part of an investigative report into the princess 's death in 1997 in the cbs show " 48 hours investigates " , was " not responsible journalism , " according to djv chairperson michael konken who warned the german media not to follow suit and show the images . konken called the decision by cbs " an unambiguous offence against the press code " during a press conference in berlin on thursday and stressed that human dignity stands above the need of viewers and readers for information .
he also warned that any use of the images as part of articles condemning the cbs report would be just as offensive . breaking taboos should not be a marketing tool konken also demanded that the policy of breaking taboos should not be employed as a calculated marketing instrument by publishing companies wanting to improve circulation or viewing figures .
the djv chairman concluded by saying any german organization pursuing such an action would face a reprimand from the german press council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess diana and dodi fayed died in a car crash in paris .
the black and white photos of diana and her lover dodi al fayed were taken shortly after the accident on august 31 , 1997 .
in the images , an unconscious diana is being attended to by a doctor who attempts to resuscitate her through the wreckage of her limousine .
two hours later , diana died in a paris clinic .
al fayed and the driver henri paul were also killed .
the pictures are part of a confidential 4,000-page accident report compiled by french investigators . cbs defends journalistic context on thursday , cbs spokesperson sandra genelius once again defended the decision to show the pictures as the outrage spread around the globe .
the spokesperson reiterated that the pictures were shown in the context of an interview with the doctor seen treating diana at the time as illustrations to accompany his statements .
the pictures were shown " in a journalistic context - an examination of the medical treatment given diana after the crash , " genelius said . the spokesperson added that it was not the intention of cbs for the pictures to be seen outside the united states .
however , there have been rumors that the pictures had been offered to a number of newspapers before cbs secured the images and aired them . the statements from the u.s. broadcaster in the immediate wake of the show on wednesday night did little to placate the press in britain where diana remains an icon almost seven years after her death .
the fact that someone had crossed the line and showed the first pictures of the dying princess caused outrage in the british press . british press united in outrage the guardian wrote that cbs had " plumb new depths of prurience in the princess diana industry " while the tabloid daily mirror called the airing of the pictures " hideous , horrible and offensive " and the sun described them as " horrific . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions from public figures mined the same vein .
while clarence house , the office of diana 's former husband , prince charles , and her two sons , declined to comment , royal-watchers expressed concern for the princess ' sons william , 21 -lrb- photo -rrb- and harry , 19 .
" it 's going to be painful for william and harry , " former buckingham palace spokesman dickie arbiter told bbc radio .
" they 're young men now .
they 're going to have to live with it for the rest of their lives . " buckingham palace , which speaks on behalf of diana 's sons , said it would not comment on the cbs pictures , but did not hide its displeasure .
" we 've made our opinion very clear in the past on this sort of thing and we wo n't be commenting specifically . "
british prime minister tony blair also expressed his distaste .
asked about the matter at his monthly news conference , blair told reporters : " i think everyone finds it distasteful that there are pictures that can cause distress to the family . "
princess 's family sickened by images a brief statement released on behalf of diana 's brother said " lord spencer and his family are shocked and sickened by cbs ' actions . "
dodi fayed 's father , mohamed al fayed , said cbs had behaved in " disgraceful and insensitive " manner .
" cbs obviously do n't care about the appalling effect of showing images of murder victims , " said fayed , who has long insisted that diana and his son were murdered .
a lengthy french investigation concluded the crash was an accident caused by drunk and speeding driver paul . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diana 's death : catastrophe or conspiracy ?

as media organizations around the world continue to react to the screening of pictures showing princess diana dying in the wreckage of her car , the german journalist 's federation warned members not to show the images . the german journalist 's federation -lrb- djv -rrb- has joined the growing number of international press associations in condemning the use of images screened on u.s. television on wednesday which allegedly showed diana , princess of wales , as she lay dying in the wreck of her mercedes in a paris underpass . the broadcasting of the pictures , as part of an investigative report into the princess 's death in 1997 in the cbs show " 48 hours investigates " , was " not responsible journalism , " according to djv chairperson michael konken who warned the german media not to follow suit and show the images . konken called the decision by cbs " an unambiguous offence against the press code " during a press conference in berlin on thursday and stressed that human dignity stands above the need of viewers and readers for information .
he also warned that any use of the images as part of articles condemning the cbs report would be just as offensive . breaking taboos should not be a marketing tool konken also demanded that the policy of breaking taboos should not be employed as a calculated marketing instrument by publishing companies wanting to improve circulation or viewing figures .
the djv chairman concluded by saying any german organization pursuing such an action would face a reprimand from the german press council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess diana and dodi fayed died in a car crash in paris .
the black and white photos of diana and her lover dodi al fayed were taken shortly after the accident on august 31 , 1997 .
in the images , an unconscious diana is being attended to by a doctor who attempts to resuscitate her through the wreckage of her limousine .
two hours later , diana died in a paris clinic .
al fayed and the driver henri paul were also killed .
the pictures are part of a confidential 4,000-page accident report compiled by french investigators . cbs defends journalistic context on thursday , cbs spokesperson sandra genelius once again defended the decision to show the pictures as the outrage spread around the globe .
the spokesperson reiterated that the pictures were shown in the context of an interview with the doctor seen treating diana at the time as illustrations to accompany his statements .
the pictures were shown " in a journalistic context - an examination of the medical treatment given diana after the crash , " genelius said . the spokesperson added that it was not the intention of cbs for the pictures to be seen outside the united states .
however , there have been rumors that the pictures had been offered to a number of newspapers before cbs secured the images and aired them . the statements from the u.s. broadcaster in the immediate wake of the show on wednesday night did little to placate the press in britain where diana remains an icon almost seven years after her death .
the fact that someone had crossed the line and showed the first pictures of the dying princess caused outrage in the british press . british press united in outrage the guardian wrote that cbs had " plumb new depths of prurience in the princess diana industry " while the tabloid daily mirror called the airing of the pictures " hideous , horrible and offensive " and the sun described them as " horrific . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions from public figures mined the same vein .
while clarence house , the office of diana 's former husband , prince charles , and her two sons , declined to comment , royal-watchers expressed concern for the princess ' sons william , 21 -lrb- photo -rrb- and harry , 19 .
" it 's going to be painful for william and harry , " former buckingham palace spokesman dickie arbiter told bbc radio .
" they 're young men now .
they 're going to have to live with it for the rest of their lives . " buckingham palace , which speaks on behalf of diana 's sons , said it would not comment on the cbs pictures , but did not hide its displeasure .
" we 've made our opinion very clear in the past on this sort of thing and we wo n't be commenting specifically . "
british prime minister tony blair also expressed his distaste .
asked about the matter at his monthly news conference , blair told reporters : " i think everyone finds it distasteful that there are pictures that can cause distress to the family . "
princess 's family sickened by images a brief statement released on behalf of diana 's brother said " lord spencer and his family are shocked and sickened by cbs ' actions . "
dodi fayed 's father , mohamed al fayed , said cbs had behaved in " disgraceful and insensitive " manner .
" cbs obviously do n't care about the appalling effect of showing images of murder victims , " said fayed , who has long insisted that diana and his son were murdered .

german beer : worth a scientific look business -pipe- 23.04.2004 crying in your beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german beer market is firmly in foreign hands .
german beer day on april 23 celebrates germany 's famous reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law , which was established in 1516 .
unfortunately the country 's proud brewing tradition has n't helped the industry compete globally . germans love beer , there 's no doubt about that .
nearly every town or region has its own particular take on what is affectionately called " liquid bread " here .
the reinheitsgebot , set down by bavarian duke wilhelm iv , allows beer to be made from only hops , barley and water .
it 's a guideline that has served brewers who care about their product well over the centuries . making beer may not have changed radically over the past 500 years , but the beer industry certainly has , which is today big business on a global scale .
and that 's why german brewers have little reason to raise a mug of their favorite amber suds in celebration this friday of german beer day . the country 's fractionalized and provincial attitudes towards brewing - according to germany 's federal statistics office , there were 1,268 registered breweries in 2003 - has led to the creation of a mindboggling variety of beer . takeover targets but it has also made brewers easy targets for large foreign beer conglomerates looking to snap up bargains with growth potential .
in particular , belgium 's interbrew has been actively snapping up german brands , including the proud bavarian house spaten , which had been independent for over 600 years .
interbrew also owns germany 's ubiquitous beck 's beer . dutch brewer heineken started the raid on german beer makers in 2001 by buying half of munich-based schörghuber-gruppe , which makes paulaner , hacker-pschorr and kulmbacher beers .
that encouraged interbrew to go on an acquisition spree that started with beck 's and quickly added diebels and hasseröder before crowning things off last year with spaten .
not to be left out of the action , danish group carlsberg took over the hamburg-based holsten brewer at the being of 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many german beer aficionados , having their favorite drink sold off to the makers of what they consider inferior brews is humiliating , but spaten head jobst kayser-eichberg places blame squarely with those in the german brewing industry . " no global vision , provincial thinking , fantasies about staying independent and also pure vanity on the part of the german beer barons hindered mergers that could have led to a globally expanding german brewer , " kayser-eichberg told the associated press . consumption declining he also noted declining beer consumption in germany as a reason why local brewers will need a strong international partner to help increase export sales .
according to the munich-based ifo institute , germans drank only 118 liters per capita last year , compared to 122 liters in 2002 .
back in 1997 the germans swigged down on average 131 liters .
that means germans are now only the third biggest beer drinkers in europe , falling behind the czechs and the irish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite all the problems , the biggest insult for german beer lovers is perhaps yet to come .
during the 2006 world cup , which germany is hosting , german beer is likely to be banned from the country 's stadiums because u.s. beer giant anheuser-busch has a sponsoring agreement with soccer 's international governing body , fifa . on the brighter side , at least germans probably do n't have to fear that interbrew or heineken will try to supplant regional favorites with mass-produced foreign beers .
michael dietzsch , head of the second largest still german-run brewing concern bitburger , believes peoples ' local preferences are too strongly set for that .

german beer : worth a scientific look business -pipe- 23.04.2004 crying in your beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german beer market is firmly in foreign hands .
german beer day on april 23 celebrates germany 's famous reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law , which was established in 1516 .
unfortunately the country 's proud brewing tradition has n't helped the industry compete globally . germans love beer , there 's no doubt about that .
nearly every town or region has its own particular take on what is affectionately called " liquid bread " here .
the reinheitsgebot , set down by bavarian duke wilhelm iv , allows beer to be made from only hops , barley and water .
it 's a guideline that has served brewers who care about their product well over the centuries . making beer may not have changed radically over the past 500 years , but the beer industry certainly has , which is today big business on a global scale .
and that 's why german brewers have little reason to raise a mug of their favorite amber suds in celebration this friday of german beer day . the country 's fractionalized and provincial attitudes towards brewing - according to germany 's federal statistics office , there were 1,268 registered breweries in 2003 - has led to the creation of a mindboggling variety of beer . takeover targets but it has also made brewers easy targets for large foreign beer conglomerates looking to snap up bargains with growth potential .
in particular , belgium 's interbrew has been actively snapping up german brands , including the proud bavarian house spaten , which had been independent for over 600 years .
interbrew also owns germany 's ubiquitous beck 's beer . dutch brewer heineken started the raid on german beer makers in 2001 by buying half of munich-based schörghuber-gruppe , which makes paulaner , hacker-pschorr and kulmbacher beers .
that encouraged interbrew to go on an acquisition spree that started with beck 's and quickly added diebels and hasseröder before crowning things off last year with spaten .
not to be left out of the action , danish group carlsberg took over the hamburg-based holsten brewer at the being of 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many german beer aficionados , having their favorite drink sold off to the makers of what they consider inferior brews is humiliating , but spaten head jobst kayser-eichberg places blame squarely with those in the german brewing industry . " no global vision , provincial thinking , fantasies about staying independent and also pure vanity on the part of the german beer barons hindered mergers that could have led to a globally expanding german brewer , " kayser-eichberg told the associated press . consumption declining he also noted declining beer consumption in germany as a reason why local brewers will need a strong international partner to help increase export sales .
according to the munich-based ifo institute , germans drank only 118 liters per capita last year , compared to 122 liters in 2002 .
back in 1997 the germans swigged down on average 131 liters .

german schools are increasingly grappling with cases of muslim girls pushing for exemption from co-ed swimming and sports on religious grounds , sorely testing the country 's ability to integrate its muslim population . with her flawless german , good grades and ambition to study towards a career , ayse yilmaz seems a model of muslim integration at her berlin high school .
she considers herself part of a growing group of young , educated muslims who have " a modern understanding of islam , " as the 18-year-old student of turkish-kurdish origin puts it .
but yilmaz - whose name has been changed here to protect her anonymit - has angered school authorities by refusing to take off her headscarf during sports class and going on school trips with her classmates .
“ i felt uncomfortable about the alcohol , partying and fooling around that takes place there , ” said yilmaz of the trips . as for her headscarf , yilmaz says , " there is no question of me taking it off just for sports or something .
it 's just part of me . " yilmaz ’ s arguments are becoming familiar ones to school authorities across germany , as muslim students and their parents clash with schools over whether the tenants of their faith should be allowed to bend the rules of germany 's secular school system .
though no reliable statistics are available , school authorities across the country say that an increasing number of muslim parents are demanding exemptions for their daughters on religious grounds from co-ed swimming , sports and biology classes .
thwarting integration efforts ?
the issue has turned into a potent flashpoint in german schools struggling with muslim integration .
“ it ’ s a difficult situation , ” said marion berning , director of the rixdorfer primary school , one of the largest in berlin ’ s neukölln district , where girls with headscarves are a common sight .
“ we have muslim girls who say they don ’ t want to swim with the boys .
it ’ s obvious the parents exert pressure on them , but they -lrb- the parents -rrb- have to accept that co-education is part of german schools . "

" when it comes to sex education , it ’ s shocking how little the muslim students know about the topic .
it ’ s absolutely taboo in their homes , ” she said .
resurgent muslim identity in the absence of a common law governing the issue , some schools have attempted to appease muslim parents by offering gender-segregated biology and swimming classes , discussing the issue with them in parent-teacher meetings or allowing muslim girls to wear loose-fitting clothing during sports . but that hasn ’ t stopped some muslim parents from appealing to the courts to enforce their religious rights .
in 1993 , a landmark ruling by germany ’ s federal administrative court allowed a 13-year-old turkish girl to be exempted from co-ed sport lessons if the school failed to proved gender-segregated sports class .
the girl ’ s father argued that his daughter would face a moral conflict if she was forced to do sports with boys in tight-fitting clothes .
in another instance , a court in münster in 2002 exempted a muslim girl in the 10th grade from a class trip after her parents argued their faith forbade their daughter to stay overnight outside of the house without the company of a male relative .
the court cases point to what islam experts say is the growing need within the muslim community to assert themselves in western society .
“ the message is ‘ we ’ re here , we ’ re proud , we ’ re going to live our religion and not going to hide ourselves anymore ’ , ” said riem spielhaus , an islamic studies lecturer at berlin ’ s humboldt university .

german schools are increasingly grappling with cases of muslim girls pushing for exemption from co-ed swimming and sports on religious grounds , sorely testing the country 's ability to integrate its muslim population . with her flawless german , good grades and ambition to study towards a career , ayse yilmaz seems a model of muslim integration at her berlin high school .
she considers herself part of a growing group of young , educated muslims who have " a modern understanding of islam , " as the 18-year-old student of turkish-kurdish origin puts it .
but yilmaz - whose name has been changed here to protect her anonymit - has angered school authorities by refusing to take off her headscarf during sports class and going on school trips with her classmates .
“ i felt uncomfortable about the alcohol , partying and fooling around that takes place there , ” said yilmaz of the trips . as for her headscarf , yilmaz says , " there is no question of me taking it off just for sports or something .
it 's just part of me . " yilmaz ’ s arguments are becoming familiar ones to school authorities across germany , as muslim students and their parents clash with schools over whether the tenants of their faith should be allowed to bend the rules of germany 's secular school system .
though no reliable statistics are available , school authorities across the country say that an increasing number of muslim parents are demanding exemptions for their daughters on religious grounds from co-ed swimming , sports and biology classes .
thwarting integration efforts ?
the issue has turned into a potent flashpoint in german schools struggling with muslim integration .
“ it ’ s a difficult situation , ” said marion berning , director of the rixdorfer primary school , one of the largest in berlin ’ s neukölln district , where girls with headscarves are a common sight .
“ we have muslim girls who say they don ’ t want to swim with the boys .

" when it comes to sex education , it ’ s shocking how little the muslim students know about the topic .
it ’ s absolutely taboo in their homes , ” she said .
resurgent muslim identity in the absence of a common law governing the issue , some schools have attempted to appease muslim parents by offering gender-segregated biology and swimming classes , discussing the issue with them in parent-teacher meetings or allowing muslim girls to wear loose-fitting clothing during sports . but that hasn ’ t stopped some muslim parents from appealing to the courts to enforce their religious rights .
in 1993 , a landmark ruling by germany ’ s federal administrative court allowed a 13-year-old turkish girl to be exempted from co-ed sport lessons if the school failed to proved gender-segregated sports class .

german schools are increasingly grappling with cases of muslim girls pushing for exemption from co-ed swimming and sports on religious grounds , sorely testing the country 's ability to integrate its muslim population . with her flawless german , good grades and ambition to study towards a career , ayse yilmaz seems a model of muslim integration at her berlin high school .
she considers herself part of a growing group of young , educated muslims who have " a modern understanding of islam , " as the 18-year-old student of turkish-kurdish origin puts it .
but yilmaz - whose name has been changed here to protect her anonymit - has angered school authorities by refusing to take off her headscarf during sports class and going on school trips with her classmates .
“ i felt uncomfortable about the alcohol , partying and fooling around that takes place there , ” said yilmaz of the trips . as for her headscarf , yilmaz says , " there is no question of me taking it off just for sports or something .
it 's just part of me . " yilmaz ’ s arguments are becoming familiar ones to school authorities across germany , as muslim students and their parents clash with schools over whether the tenants of their faith should be allowed to bend the rules of germany 's secular school system .
though no reliable statistics are available , school authorities across the country say that an increasing number of muslim parents are demanding exemptions for their daughters on religious grounds from co-ed swimming , sports and biology classes .
thwarting integration efforts ?
the issue has turned into a potent flashpoint in german schools struggling with muslim integration .
“ it ’ s a difficult situation , ” said marion berning , director of the rixdorfer primary school , one of the largest in berlin ’ s neukölln district , where girls with headscarves are a common sight .
“ we have muslim girls who say they don ’ t want to swim with the boys .
it ’ s obvious the parents exert pressure on them , but they -lrb- the parents -rrb- have to accept that co-education is part of german schools . "
at another school in berlin 's turkish- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex is " absolutely taboo at home . " dominated kreuzberg district , principal annette spieler worries muslim girls exempted from biology class are missing out on lessons vital to teenagers .
" when it comes to sex education , it ’ s shocking how little the muslim students know about the topic .
it ’ s absolutely taboo in their homes , ” she said .
resurgent muslim identity in the absence of a common law governing the issue , some schools have attempted to appease muslim parents by offering gender-segregated biology and swimming classes , discussing the issue with them in parent-teacher meetings or allowing muslim girls to wear loose-fitting clothing during sports . but that hasn ’ t stopped some muslim parents from appealing to the courts to enforce their religious rights .
in 1993 , a landmark ruling by germany ’ s federal administrative court allowed a 13-year-old turkish girl to be exempted from co-ed sport lessons if the school failed to proved gender-segregated sports class .
the girl ’ s father argued that his daughter would face a moral conflict if she was forced to do sports with boys in tight-fitting clothes .
in another instance , a court in münster in 2002 exempted a muslim girl in the 10th grade from a class trip after her parents argued their faith forbade their daughter to stay overnight outside of the house without the company of a male relative .
the court cases point to what islam experts say is the growing need within the muslim community to assert themselves in western society .

german schools are increasingly grappling with cases of muslim girls pushing for exemption from co-ed swimming and sports on religious grounds , sorely testing the country 's ability to integrate its muslim population . with her flawless german , good grades and ambition to study towards a career , ayse yilmaz seems a model of muslim integration at her berlin high school .
she considers herself part of a growing group of young , educated muslims who have " a modern understanding of islam , " as the 18-year-old student of turkish-kurdish origin puts it .
but yilmaz - whose name has been changed here to protect her anonymit - has angered school authorities by refusing to take off her headscarf during sports class and going on school trips with her classmates .
“ i felt uncomfortable about the alcohol , partying and fooling around that takes place there , ” said yilmaz of the trips . as for her headscarf , yilmaz says , " there is no question of me taking it off just for sports or something .
it 's just part of me . " yilmaz ’ s arguments are becoming familiar ones to school authorities across germany , as muslim students and their parents clash with schools over whether the tenants of their faith should be allowed to bend the rules of germany 's secular school system .
though no reliable statistics are available , school authorities across the country say that an increasing number of muslim parents are demanding exemptions for their daughters on religious grounds from co-ed swimming , sports and biology classes .
thwarting integration efforts ?
the issue has turned into a potent flashpoint in german schools struggling with muslim integration .
“ it ’ s a difficult situation , ” said marion berning , director of the rixdorfer primary school , one of the largest in berlin ’ s neukölln district , where girls with headscarves are a common sight .
“ we have muslim girls who say they don ’ t want to swim with the boys .
it ’ s obvious the parents exert pressure on them , but they -lrb- the parents -rrb- have to accept that co-education is part of german schools . "
at another school in berlin 's turkish- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex is " absolutely taboo at home . " dominated kreuzberg district , principal annette spieler worries muslim girls exempted from biology class are missing out on lessons vital to teenagers .
" when it comes to sex education , it ’ s shocking how little the muslim students know about the topic .
it ’ s absolutely taboo in their homes , ” she said .
resurgent muslim identity in the absence of a common law governing the issue , some schools have attempted to appease muslim parents by offering gender-segregated biology and swimming classes , discussing the issue with them in parent-teacher meetings or allowing muslim girls to wear loose-fitting clothing during sports . but that hasn ’ t stopped some muslim parents from appealing to the courts to enforce their religious rights .
in 1993 , a landmark ruling by germany ’ s federal administrative court allowed a 13-year-old turkish girl to be exempted from co-ed sport lessons if the school failed to proved gender-segregated sports class .
the girl ’ s father argued that his daughter would face a moral conflict if she was forced to do sports with boys in tight-fitting clothes .
in another instance , a court in münster in 2002 exempted a muslim girl in the 10th grade from a class trip after her parents argued their faith forbade their daughter to stay overnight outside of the house without the company of a male relative .
the court cases point to what islam experts say is the growing need within the muslim community to assert themselves in western society .
“ the message is ‘ we ’ re here , we ’ re proud , we ’ re going to live our religion and not going to hide ourselves anymore ’ , ” said riem spielhaus , an islamic studies lecturer at berlin ’ s humboldt university .

german schools are increasingly grappling with cases of muslim girls pushing for exemption from co-ed swimming and sports on religious grounds , sorely testing the country 's ability to integrate its muslim population . with her flawless german , good grades and ambition to study towards a career , ayse yilmaz seems a model of muslim integration at her berlin high school .
she considers herself part of a growing group of young , educated muslims who have " a modern understanding of islam , " as the 18-year-old student of turkish-kurdish origin puts it .
but yilmaz - whose name has been changed here to protect her anonymit - has angered school authorities by refusing to take off her headscarf during sports class and going on school trips with her classmates .
“ i felt uncomfortable about the alcohol , partying and fooling around that takes place there , ” said yilmaz of the trips . as for her headscarf , yilmaz says , " there is no question of me taking it off just for sports or something .
it 's just part of me . " yilmaz ’ s arguments are becoming familiar ones to school authorities across germany , as muslim students and their parents clash with schools over whether the tenants of their faith should be allowed to bend the rules of germany 's secular school system .
though no reliable statistics are available , school authorities across the country say that an increasing number of muslim parents are demanding exemptions for their daughters on religious grounds from co-ed swimming , sports and biology classes .
thwarting integration efforts ?
the issue has turned into a potent flashpoint in german schools struggling with muslim integration .
“ it ’ s a difficult situation , ” said marion berning , director of the rixdorfer primary school , one of the largest in berlin ’ s neukölln district , where girls with headscarves are a common sight .
“ we have muslim girls who say they don ’ t want to swim with the boys .

" when it comes to sex education , it ’ s shocking how little the muslim students know about the topic .
it ’ s absolutely taboo in their homes , ” she said .
resurgent muslim identity in the absence of a common law governing the issue , some schools have attempted to appease muslim parents by offering gender-segregated biology and swimming classes , discussing the issue with them in parent-teacher meetings or allowing muslim girls to wear loose-fitting clothing during sports . but that hasn ’ t stopped some muslim parents from appealing to the courts to enforce their religious rights .

german schools are increasingly grappling with cases of muslim girls pushing for exemption from co-ed swimming and sports on religious grounds , sorely testing the country 's ability to integrate its muslim population . with her flawless german , good grades and ambition to study towards a career , ayse yilmaz seems a model of muslim integration at her berlin high school .
she considers herself part of a growing group of young , educated muslims who have " a modern understanding of islam , " as the 18-year-old student of turkish-kurdish origin puts it .
but yilmaz - whose name has been changed here to protect her anonymit - has angered school authorities by refusing to take off her headscarf during sports class and going on school trips with her classmates .
“ i felt uncomfortable about the alcohol , partying and fooling around that takes place there , ” said yilmaz of the trips . as for her headscarf , yilmaz says , " there is no question of me taking it off just for sports or something .
it 's just part of me . " yilmaz ’ s arguments are becoming familiar ones to school authorities across germany , as muslim students and their parents clash with schools over whether the tenants of their faith should be allowed to bend the rules of germany 's secular school system .
though no reliable statistics are available , school authorities across the country say that an increasing number of muslim parents are demanding exemptions for their daughters on religious grounds from co-ed swimming , sports and biology classes .
thwarting integration efforts ?
the issue has turned into a potent flashpoint in german schools struggling with muslim integration .
“ it ’ s a difficult situation , ” said marion berning , director of the rixdorfer primary school , one of the largest in berlin ’ s neukölln district , where girls with headscarves are a common sight .
“ we have muslim girls who say they don ’ t want to swim with the boys .
it ’ s obvious the parents exert pressure on them , but they -lrb- the parents -rrb- have to accept that co-education is part of german schools . "
at another school in berlin 's turkish- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex is " absolutely taboo at home . " dominated kreuzberg district , principal annette spieler worries muslim girls exempted from biology class are missing out on lessons vital to teenagers .
" when it comes to sex education , it ’ s shocking how little the muslim students know about the topic .
it ’ s absolutely taboo in their homes , ” she said .
resurgent muslim identity in the absence of a common law governing the issue , some schools have attempted to appease muslim parents by offering gender-segregated biology and swimming classes , discussing the issue with them in parent-teacher meetings or allowing muslim girls to wear loose-fitting clothing during sports . but that hasn ’ t stopped some muslim parents from appealing to the courts to enforce their religious rights .
in 1993 , a landmark ruling by germany ’ s federal administrative court allowed a 13-year-old turkish girl to be exempted from co-ed sport lessons if the school failed to proved gender-segregated sports class .
the girl ’ s father argued that his daughter would face a moral conflict if she was forced to do sports with boys in tight-fitting clothes .
in another instance , a court in münster in 2002 exempted a muslim girl in the 10th grade from a class trip after her parents argued their faith forbade their daughter to stay overnight outside of the house without the company of a male relative .

german schools are increasingly grappling with cases of muslim girls pushing for exemption from co-ed swimming and sports on religious grounds , sorely testing the country 's ability to integrate its muslim population . with her flawless german , good grades and ambition to study towards a career , ayse yilmaz seems a model of muslim integration at her berlin high school .
she considers herself part of a growing group of young , educated muslims who have " a modern understanding of islam , " as the 18-year-old student of turkish-kurdish origin puts it .
but yilmaz - whose name has been changed here to protect her anonymit - has angered school authorities by refusing to take off her headscarf during sports class and going on school trips with her classmates .
“ i felt uncomfortable about the alcohol , partying and fooling around that takes place there , ” said yilmaz of the trips . as for her headscarf , yilmaz says , " there is no question of me taking it off just for sports or something .
it 's just part of me . " yilmaz ’ s arguments are becoming familiar ones to school authorities across germany , as muslim students and their parents clash with schools over whether the tenants of their faith should be allowed to bend the rules of germany 's secular school system .
though no reliable statistics are available , school authorities across the country say that an increasing number of muslim parents are demanding exemptions for their daughters on religious grounds from co-ed swimming , sports and biology classes .
thwarting integration efforts ?
the issue has turned into a potent flashpoint in german schools struggling with muslim integration .
“ it ’ s a difficult situation , ” said marion berning , director of the rixdorfer primary school , one of the largest in berlin ’ s neukölln district , where girls with headscarves are a common sight .
“ we have muslim girls who say they don ’ t want to swim with the boys .
it ’ s obvious the parents exert pressure on them , but they -lrb- the parents -rrb- have to accept that co-education is part of german schools . "
at another school in berlin 's turkish- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex is " absolutely taboo at home . " dominated kreuzberg district , principal annette spieler worries muslim girls exempted from biology class are missing out on lessons vital to teenagers .
" when it comes to sex education , it ’ s shocking how little the muslim students know about the topic .
it ’ s absolutely taboo in their homes , ” she said .
resurgent muslim identity in the absence of a common law governing the issue , some schools have attempted to appease muslim parents by offering gender-segregated biology and swimming classes , discussing the issue with them in parent-teacher meetings or allowing muslim girls to wear loose-fitting clothing during sports . but that hasn ’ t stopped some muslim parents from appealing to the courts to enforce their religious rights .
in 1993 , a landmark ruling by germany ’ s federal administrative court allowed a 13-year-old turkish girl to be exempted from co-ed sport lessons if the school failed to proved gender-segregated sports class .
the girl ’ s father argued that his daughter would face a moral conflict if she was forced to do sports with boys in tight-fitting clothes .
in another instance , a court in münster in 2002 exempted a muslim girl in the 10th grade from a class trip after her parents argued their faith forbade their daughter to stay overnight outside of the house without the company of a male relative .
the court cases point to what islam experts say is the growing need within the muslim community to assert themselves in western society .
“ the message is ‘ we ’ re here , we ’ re proud , we ’ re going to live our religion and not going to hide ourselves anymore ’ , ” said riem spielhaus , an islamic studies lecturer at berlin ’ s humboldt university .

german schools are increasingly grappling with cases of muslim girls pushing for exemption from co-ed swimming and sports on religious grounds , sorely testing the country 's ability to integrate its muslim population . with her flawless german , good grades and ambition to study towards a career , ayse yilmaz seems a model of muslim integration at her berlin high school .
she considers herself part of a growing group of young , educated muslims who have " a modern understanding of islam , " as the 18-year-old student of turkish-kurdish origin puts it .
but yilmaz - whose name has been changed here to protect her anonymit - has angered school authorities by refusing to take off her headscarf during sports class and going on school trips with her classmates .
“ i felt uncomfortable about the alcohol , partying and fooling around that takes place there , ” said yilmaz of the trips . as for her headscarf , yilmaz says , " there is no question of me taking it off just for sports or something .
it 's just part of me . " yilmaz ’ s arguments are becoming familiar ones to school authorities across germany , as muslim students and their parents clash with schools over whether the tenants of their faith should be allowed to bend the rules of germany 's secular school system .
though no reliable statistics are available , school authorities across the country say that an increasing number of muslim parents are demanding exemptions for their daughters on religious grounds from co-ed swimming , sports and biology classes .

the issue has turned into a potent flashpoint in german schools struggling with muslim integration .

in addition , making exceptions for muslim students amounts to giving preferential treatment to one religion and could lead to their isolation , said turgut hüner .
the chairman of the turkish parents organization in berlin-brandenburg believes the trend among muslim parents to exempt their children from class has been fueled by the introduction of islamic religious classes in german schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is being taught in mosques and the koranic schools they sponsor ?
while learning their own language and religion is vital to second-generation muslims living in the country , hüner warned that it ’ s important to know just what is being taught under the guise of religious instruction .
he criticized berlin school authorities for allowing organizations such as the strongly-conservative islamic federation , which is on german law enforcement 's watch list , to impart islamic instruction in 28 schools in the german capital .
“ it ’ s a slippery slope , " said hüner .
" that ’ s when some parents get old-fashioned ideas into their hands and decide not to send their daughters to biology or swimming class . "
living in a muslim virtual world indeed , the islamic federation ran into trouble recently with the berlin education ministry for allegedly handing out application forms printed from the internet to muslim parents to get their daughters exempted from co-educative classes .
a look at the virtual world shows just how easy that is .
a web site called muslim-markt.de run by two muslim brothers offers muslims links and information to muslim doctors , lawyers , hairdressers , companies and so on .
the site " muslimrecht , " based in hamburg , offers detailed moral and legal guidelines to muslim parents wanting to free their daughters from co-ed sports and swimming lessons .
“ if you don ’ t stand up for your rights , it won ’ t just become a disadvantage to you , but will also lead to a restriction of rights for the coming generation of students , ” it warns its readers .
headscarf equals " problem child " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate is simmering while the debate simmers , some experts say it also reflects german teachers ’ poor understanding of the delicate integration process underway .
“ many have no idea how difficult it can be for a muslim girl caught between her traditional parents and a more permissive western society where she ’ s growing up , ” said spielhaus .
yilmaz knows that only too well .
“ as a muslim girl with a headscarf you ’ re immediately labeled ‘ dumb ’ , " she said .

in addition , making exceptions for muslim students amounts to giving preferential treatment to one religion and could lead to their isolation , said turgut hüner .
the chairman of the turkish parents organization in berlin-brandenburg believes the trend among muslim parents to exempt their children from class has been fueled by the introduction of islamic religious classes in german schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is being taught in mosques and the koranic schools they sponsor ?
while learning their own language and religion is vital to second-generation muslims living in the country , hüner warned that it ’ s important to know just what is being taught under the guise of religious instruction .
he criticized berlin school authorities for allowing organizations such as the strongly-conservative islamic federation , which is on german law enforcement 's watch list , to impart islamic instruction in 28 schools in the german capital .
“ it ’ s a slippery slope , " said hüner .
" that ’ s when some parents get old-fashioned ideas into their hands and decide not to send their daughters to biology or swimming class . "
living in a muslim virtual world indeed , the islamic federation ran into trouble recently with the berlin education ministry for allegedly handing out application forms printed from the internet to muslim parents to get their daughters exempted from co-educative classes .
a look at the virtual world shows just how easy that is .
a web site called muslim-markt.de run by two muslim brothers offers muslims links and information to muslim doctors , lawyers , hairdressers , companies and so on .
the site " muslimrecht , " based in hamburg , offers detailed moral and legal guidelines to muslim parents wanting to free their daughters from co-ed sports and swimming lessons .
“ if you don ’ t stand up for your rights , it won ’ t just become a disadvantage to you , but will also lead to a restriction of rights for the coming generation of students , ” it warns its readers .
headscarf equals " problem child " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate is simmering while the debate simmers , some experts say it also reflects german teachers ’ poor understanding of the delicate integration process underway .
“ many have no idea how difficult it can be for a muslim girl caught between her traditional parents and a more permissive western society where she ’ s growing up , ” said spielhaus .
yilmaz knows that only too well .
“ as a muslim girl with a headscarf you ’ re immediately labeled ‘ dumb ’ , " she said .

german schools are increasingly grappling with cases of muslim girls pushing for exemption from co-ed swimming and sports on religious grounds , sorely testing the country 's ability to integrate its muslim population . with her flawless german , good grades and ambition to study towards a career , ayse yilmaz seems a model of muslim integration at her berlin high school .
she considers herself part of a growing group of young , educated muslims who have " a modern understanding of islam , " as the 18-year-old student of turkish-kurdish origin puts it .
but yilmaz - whose name has been changed here to protect her anonymit - has angered school authorities by refusing to take off her headscarf during sports class and going on school trips with her classmates .
“ i felt uncomfortable about the alcohol , partying and fooling around that takes place there , ” said yilmaz of the trips . as for her headscarf , yilmaz says , " there is no question of me taking it off just for sports or something .
it 's just part of me . " yilmaz ’ s arguments are becoming familiar ones to school authorities across germany , as muslim students and their parents clash with schools over whether the tenants of their faith should be allowed to bend the rules of germany 's secular school system .
though no reliable statistics are available , school authorities across the country say that an increasing number of muslim parents are demanding exemptions for their daughters on religious grounds from co-ed swimming , sports and biology classes .
thwarting integration efforts ?
the issue has turned into a potent flashpoint in german schools struggling with muslim integration .
“ it ’ s a difficult situation , ” said marion berning , director of the rixdorfer primary school , one of the largest in berlin ’ s neukölln district , where girls with headscarves are a common sight .
“ we have muslim girls who say they don ’ t want to swim with the boys .
it ’ s obvious the parents exert pressure on them , but they -lrb- the parents -rrb- have to accept that co-education is part of german schools . "
at another school in berlin 's turkish- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex is " absolutely taboo at home . " dominated kreuzberg district , principal annette spieler worries muslim girls exempted from biology class are missing out on lessons vital to teenagers .
" when it comes to sex education , it ’ s shocking how little the muslim students know about the topic .
it ’ s absolutely taboo in their homes , ” she said .
resurgent muslim identity in the absence of a common law governing the issue , some schools have attempted to appease muslim parents by offering gender-segregated biology and swimming classes , discussing the issue with them in parent-teacher meetings or allowing muslim girls to wear loose-fitting clothing during sports . but that hasn ’ t stopped some muslim parents from appealing to the courts to enforce their religious rights .
in 1993 , a landmark ruling by germany ’ s federal administrative court allowed a 13-year-old turkish girl to be exempted from co-ed sport lessons if the school failed to proved gender-segregated sports class .
the girl ’ s father argued that his daughter would face a moral conflict if she was forced to do sports with boys in tight-fitting clothes .
in another instance , a court in münster in 2002 exempted a muslim girl in the 10th grade from a class trip after her parents argued their faith forbade their daughter to stay overnight outside of the house without the company of a male relative .
the court cases point to what islam experts say is the growing need within the muslim community to assert themselves in western society .
“ the message is ‘ we ’ re here , we ’ re proud , we ’ re going to live our religion and not going to hide ourselves anymore ’ , ” said riem spielhaus , an islamic studies lecturer at berlin ’ s humboldt university .

as media organizations around the world continue to react to the screening of pictures showing princess diana dying in the wreckage of her car , the german journalist 's federation warned members not to show the images . the german journalist 's federation -lrb- djv -rrb- has joined the growing number of international press associations in condemning the use of images screened on u.s. television on wednesday which allegedly showed diana , princess of wales , as she lay dying in the wreck of her mercedes in a paris underpass . the broadcasting of the pictures , as part of an investigative report into the princess 's death in 1997 in the cbs show " 48 hours investigates " , was " not responsible journalism , " according to djv chairperson michael konken who warned the german media not to follow suit and show the images . konken called the decision by cbs " an unambiguous offence against the press code " during a press conference in berlin on thursday and stressed that human dignity stands above the need of viewers and readers for information .
he also warned that any use of the images as part of articles condemning the cbs report would be just as offensive . breaking taboos should not be a marketing tool konken also demanded that the policy of breaking taboos should not be employed as a calculated marketing instrument by publishing companies wanting to improve circulation or viewing figures .
the djv chairman concluded by saying any german organization pursuing such an action would face a reprimand from the german press council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess diana and dodi fayed died in a car crash in paris .
the black and white photos of diana and her lover dodi al fayed were taken shortly after the accident on august 31 , 1997 .
in the images , an unconscious diana is being attended to by a doctor who attempts to resuscitate her through the wreckage of her limousine .
two hours later , diana died in a paris clinic .
al fayed and the driver henri paul were also killed .
the pictures are part of a confidential 4,000-page accident report compiled by french investigators . cbs defends journalistic context on thursday , cbs spokesperson sandra genelius once again defended the decision to show the pictures as the outrage spread around the globe .
the spokesperson reiterated that the pictures were shown in the context of an interview with the doctor seen treating diana at the time as illustrations to accompany his statements .
the pictures were shown " in a journalistic context - an examination of the medical treatment given diana after the crash , " genelius said . the spokesperson added that it was not the intention of cbs for the pictures to be seen outside the united states .
however , there have been rumors that the pictures had been offered to a number of newspapers before cbs secured the images and aired them . the statements from the u.s. broadcaster in the immediate wake of the show on wednesday night did little to placate the press in britain where diana remains an icon almost seven years after her death .
the fact that someone had crossed the line and showed the first pictures of the dying princess caused outrage in the british press . british press united in outrage the guardian wrote that cbs had " plumb new depths of prurience in the princess diana industry " while the tabloid daily mirror called the airing of the pictures " hideous , horrible and offensive " and the sun described them as " horrific . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions from public figures mined the same vein .
while clarence house , the office of diana 's former husband , prince charles , and her two sons , declined to comment , royal-watchers expressed concern for the princess ' sons william , 21 -lrb- photo -rrb- and harry , 19 .
" it 's going to be painful for william and harry , " former buckingham palace spokesman dickie arbiter told bbc radio .
" they 're young men now .
they 're going to have to live with it for the rest of their lives . " buckingham palace , which speaks on behalf of diana 's sons , said it would not comment on the cbs pictures , but did not hide its displeasure .
" we 've made our opinion very clear in the past on this sort of thing and we wo n't be commenting specifically . "
british prime minister tony blair also expressed his distaste .
asked about the matter at his monthly news conference , blair told reporters : " i think everyone finds it distasteful that there are pictures that can cause distress to the family . "
princess 's family sickened by images a brief statement released on behalf of diana 's brother said " lord spencer and his family are shocked and sickened by cbs ' actions . "
dodi fayed 's father , mohamed al fayed , said cbs had behaved in " disgraceful and insensitive " manner .
" cbs obviously do n't care about the appalling effect of showing images of murder victims , " said fayed , who has long insisted that diana and his son were murdered .
a lengthy french investigation concluded the crash was an accident caused by drunk and speeding driver paul . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diana 's death : catastrophe or conspiracy ?

german beer : worth a scientific look business -pipe- 23.04.2004 crying in your beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german beer market is firmly in foreign hands .
german beer day on april 23 celebrates germany 's famous reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law , which was established in 1516 .
unfortunately the country 's proud brewing tradition has n't helped the industry compete globally . germans love beer , there 's no doubt about that .
nearly every town or region has its own particular take on what is affectionately called " liquid bread " here .
the reinheitsgebot , set down by bavarian duke wilhelm iv , allows beer to be made from only hops , barley and water .
it 's a guideline that has served brewers who care about their product well over the centuries . making beer may not have changed radically over the past 500 years , but the beer industry certainly has , which is today big business on a global scale .
and that 's why german brewers have little reason to raise a mug of their favorite amber suds in celebration this friday of german beer day . the country 's fractionalized and provincial attitudes towards brewing - according to germany 's federal statistics office , there were 1,268 registered breweries in 2003 - has led to the creation of a mindboggling variety of beer . takeover targets but it has also made brewers easy targets for large foreign beer conglomerates looking to snap up bargains with growth potential .
in particular , belgium 's interbrew has been actively snapping up german brands , including the proud bavarian house spaten , which had been independent for over 600 years .
interbrew also owns germany 's ubiquitous beck 's beer . dutch brewer heineken started the raid on german beer makers in 2001 by buying half of munich-based schörghuber-gruppe , which makes paulaner , hacker-pschorr and kulmbacher beers .
that encouraged interbrew to go on an acquisition spree that started with beck 's and quickly added diebels and hasseröder before crowning things off last year with spaten .
not to be left out of the action , danish group carlsberg took over the hamburg-based holsten brewer at the being of 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many german beer aficionados , having their favorite drink sold off to the makers of what they consider inferior brews is humiliating , but spaten head jobst kayser-eichberg places blame squarely with those in the german brewing industry . " no global vision , provincial thinking , fantasies about staying independent and also pure vanity on the part of the german beer barons hindered mergers that could have led to a globally expanding german brewer , " kayser-eichberg told the associated press . consumption declining he also noted declining beer consumption in germany as a reason why local brewers will need a strong international partner to help increase export sales .
according to the munich-based ifo institute , germans drank only 118 liters per capita last year , compared to 122 liters in 2002 .
back in 1997 the germans swigged down on average 131 liters .
that means germans are now only the third biggest beer drinkers in europe , falling behind the czechs and the irish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite all the problems , the biggest insult for german beer lovers is perhaps yet to come .
during the 2006 world cup , which germany is hosting , german beer is likely to be banned from the country 's stadiums because u.s. beer giant anheuser-busch has a sponsoring agreement with soccer 's international governing body , fifa . on the brighter side , at least germans probably do n't have to fear that interbrew or heineken will try to supplant regional favorites with mass-produced foreign beers .
michael dietzsch , head of the second largest still german-run brewing concern bitburger , believes peoples ' local preferences are too strongly set for that . " that 's why foreign investors are buying german market brands and are n't trying to sell their own here , " dietzsch told the german news agency dpa . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's " bud " or nothing at world cup 2006 want to throw back a nice bavarian brew while watching a world cup match in germany in 2006 ?

" that 's why foreign investors are buying german market brands and are n't trying to sell their own here , " dietzsch told the german news agency dpa . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's " bud " or nothing at world cup 2006 want to throw back a nice bavarian brew while watching a world cup match in germany in 2006 ?

as media organizations around the world continue to react to the screening of pictures showing princess diana dying in the wreckage of her car , the german journalist 's federation warned members not to show the images . the german journalist 's federation -lrb- djv -rrb- has joined the growing number of international press associations in condemning the use of images screened on u.s. television on wednesday which allegedly showed diana , princess of wales , as she lay dying in the wreck of her mercedes in a paris underpass . the broadcasting of the pictures , as part of an investigative report into the princess 's death in 1997 in the cbs show " 48 hours investigates " , was " not responsible journalism , " according to djv chairperson michael konken who warned the german media not to follow suit and show the images . konken called the decision by cbs " an unambiguous offence against the press code " during a press conference in berlin on thursday and stressed that human dignity stands above the need of viewers and readers for information .
he also warned that any use of the images as part of articles condemning the cbs report would be just as offensive . breaking taboos should not be a marketing tool konken also demanded that the policy of breaking taboos should not be employed as a calculated marketing instrument by publishing companies wanting to improve circulation or viewing figures .
the djv chairman concluded by saying any german organization pursuing such an action would face a reprimand from the german press council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess diana and dodi fayed died in a car crash in paris .
the black and white photos of diana and her lover dodi al fayed were taken shortly after the accident on august 31 , 1997 .
in the images , an unconscious diana is being attended to by a doctor who attempts to resuscitate her through the wreckage of her limousine .
two hours later , diana died in a paris clinic .
al fayed and the driver henri paul were also killed .
the pictures are part of a confidential 4,000-page accident report compiled by french investigators . cbs defends journalistic context on thursday , cbs spokesperson sandra genelius once again defended the decision to show the pictures as the outrage spread around the globe .
the spokesperson reiterated that the pictures were shown in the context of an interview with the doctor seen treating diana at the time as illustrations to accompany his statements .
the pictures were shown " in a journalistic context - an examination of the medical treatment given diana after the crash , " genelius said . the spokesperson added that it was not the intention of cbs for the pictures to be seen outside the united states .
however , there have been rumors that the pictures had been offered to a number of newspapers before cbs secured the images and aired them . the statements from the u.s. broadcaster in the immediate wake of the show on wednesday night did little to placate the press in britain where diana remains an icon almost seven years after her death .
the fact that someone had crossed the line and showed the first pictures of the dying princess caused outrage in the british press . british press united in outrage the guardian wrote that cbs had " plumb new depths of prurience in the princess diana industry " while the tabloid daily mirror called the airing of the pictures " hideous , horrible and offensive " and the sun described them as " horrific . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions from public figures mined the same vein .
while clarence house , the office of diana 's former husband , prince charles , and her two sons , declined to comment , royal-watchers expressed concern for the princess ' sons william , 21 -lrb- photo -rrb- and harry , 19 .
" it 's going to be painful for william and harry , " former buckingham palace spokesman dickie arbiter told bbc radio .
" they 're young men now .
they 're going to have to live with it for the rest of their lives . " buckingham palace , which speaks on behalf of diana 's sons , said it would not comment on the cbs pictures , but did not hide its displeasure .
" we 've made our opinion very clear in the past on this sort of thing and we wo n't be commenting specifically . "
british prime minister tony blair also expressed his distaste .
asked about the matter at his monthly news conference , blair told reporters : " i think everyone finds it distasteful that there are pictures that can cause distress to the family . "
princess 's family sickened by images a brief statement released on behalf of diana 's brother said " lord spencer and his family are shocked and sickened by cbs ' actions . "
dodi fayed 's father , mohamed al fayed , said cbs had behaved in " disgraceful and insensitive " manner .
" cbs obviously do n't care about the appalling effect of showing images of murder victims , " said fayed , who has long insisted that diana and his son were murdered .

german beer : worth a scientific look business -pipe- 23.04.2004 crying in your beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german beer market is firmly in foreign hands .
german beer day on april 23 celebrates germany 's famous reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law , which was established in 1516 .
unfortunately the country 's proud brewing tradition has n't helped the industry compete globally . germans love beer , there 's no doubt about that .

as media organizations around the world continue to react to the screening of pictures showing princess diana dying in the wreckage of her car , the german journalist 's federation warned members not to show the images . the german journalist 's federation -lrb- djv -rrb- has joined the growing number of international press associations in condemning the use of images screened on u.s. television on wednesday which allegedly showed diana , princess of wales , as she lay dying in the wreck of her mercedes in a paris underpass . the broadcasting of the pictures , as part of an investigative report into the princess 's death in 1997 in the cbs show " 48 hours investigates " , was " not responsible journalism , " according to djv chairperson michael konken who warned the german media not to follow suit and show the images . konken called the decision by cbs " an unambiguous offence against the press code " during a press conference in berlin on thursday and stressed that human dignity stands above the need of viewers and readers for information .
he also warned that any use of the images as part of articles condemning the cbs report would be just as offensive . breaking taboos should not be a marketing tool konken also demanded that the policy of breaking taboos should not be employed as a calculated marketing instrument by publishing companies wanting to improve circulation or viewing figures .
the djv chairman concluded by saying any german organization pursuing such an action would face a reprimand from the german press council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess diana and dodi fayed died in a car crash in paris .
the black and white photos of diana and her lover dodi al fayed were taken shortly after the accident on august 31 , 1997 .
in the images , an unconscious diana is being attended to by a doctor who attempts to resuscitate her through the wreckage of her limousine .
two hours later , diana died in a paris clinic .
al fayed and the driver henri paul were also killed .
the pictures are part of a confidential 4,000-page accident report compiled by french investigators . cbs defends journalistic context on thursday , cbs spokesperson sandra genelius once again defended the decision to show the pictures as the outrage spread around the globe .
the spokesperson reiterated that the pictures were shown in the context of an interview with the doctor seen treating diana at the time as illustrations to accompany his statements .
the pictures were shown " in a journalistic context - an examination of the medical treatment given diana after the crash , " genelius said . the spokesperson added that it was not the intention of cbs for the pictures to be seen outside the united states .
however , there have been rumors that the pictures had been offered to a number of newspapers before cbs secured the images and aired them . the statements from the u.s. broadcaster in the immediate wake of the show on wednesday night did little to placate the press in britain where diana remains an icon almost seven years after her death .
the fact that someone had crossed the line and showed the first pictures of the dying princess caused outrage in the british press . british press united in outrage the guardian wrote that cbs had " plumb new depths of prurience in the princess diana industry " while the tabloid daily mirror called the airing of the pictures " hideous , horrible and offensive " and the sun described them as " horrific . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions from public figures mined the same vein .
while clarence house , the office of diana 's former husband , prince charles , and her two sons , declined to comment , royal-watchers expressed concern for the princess ' sons william , 21 -lrb- photo -rrb- and harry , 19 .
" it 's going to be painful for william and harry , " former buckingham palace spokesman dickie arbiter told bbc radio .
" they 're young men now .
they 're going to have to live with it for the rest of their lives . " buckingham palace , which speaks on behalf of diana 's sons , said it would not comment on the cbs pictures , but did not hide its displeasure .
" we 've made our opinion very clear in the past on this sort of thing and we wo n't be commenting specifically . "
british prime minister tony blair also expressed his distaste .
asked about the matter at his monthly news conference , blair told reporters : " i think everyone finds it distasteful that there are pictures that can cause distress to the family . "
princess 's family sickened by images a brief statement released on behalf of diana 's brother said " lord spencer and his family are shocked and sickened by cbs ' actions . "
dodi fayed 's father , mohamed al fayed , said cbs had behaved in " disgraceful and insensitive " manner .
" cbs obviously do n't care about the appalling effect of showing images of murder victims , " said fayed , who has long insisted that diana and his son were murdered .

german schools are increasingly grappling with cases of muslim girls pushing for exemption from co-ed swimming and sports on religious grounds , sorely testing the country 's ability to integrate its muslim population . with her flawless german , good grades and ambition to study towards a career , ayse yilmaz seems a model of muslim integration at her berlin high school .
she considers herself part of a growing group of young , educated muslims who have " a modern understanding of islam , " as the 18-year-old student of turkish-kurdish origin puts it .
but yilmaz - whose name has been changed here to protect her anonymit - has angered school authorities by refusing to take off her headscarf during sports class and going on school trips with her classmates .
“ i felt uncomfortable about the alcohol , partying and fooling around that takes place there , ” said yilmaz of the trips . as for her headscarf , yilmaz says , " there is no question of me taking it off just for sports or something .
it 's just part of me . " yilmaz ’ s arguments are becoming familiar ones to school authorities across germany , as muslim students and their parents clash with schools over whether the tenants of their faith should be allowed to bend the rules of germany 's secular school system .
though no reliable statistics are available , school authorities across the country say that an increasing number of muslim parents are demanding exemptions for their daughters on religious grounds from co-ed swimming , sports and biology classes .
thwarting integration efforts ?
the issue has turned into a potent flashpoint in german schools struggling with muslim integration .
“ it ’ s a difficult situation , ” said marion berning , director of the rixdorfer primary school , one of the largest in berlin ’ s neukölln district , where girls with headscarves are a common sight .
“ we have muslim girls who say they don ’ t want to swim with the boys .
it ’ s obvious the parents exert pressure on them , but they -lrb- the parents -rrb- have to accept that co-education is part of german schools . "
at another school in berlin 's turkish- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex is " absolutely taboo at home . " dominated kreuzberg district , principal annette spieler worries muslim girls exempted from biology class are missing out on lessons vital to teenagers .
" when it comes to sex education , it ’ s shocking how little the muslim students know about the topic .
it ’ s absolutely taboo in their homes , ” she said .
resurgent muslim identity in the absence of a common law governing the issue , some schools have attempted to appease muslim parents by offering gender-segregated biology and swimming classes , discussing the issue with them in parent-teacher meetings or allowing muslim girls to wear loose-fitting clothing during sports . but that hasn ’ t stopped some muslim parents from appealing to the courts to enforce their religious rights .
in 1993 , a landmark ruling by germany ’ s federal administrative court allowed a 13-year-old turkish girl to be exempted from co-ed sport lessons if the school failed to proved gender-segregated sports class .
the girl ’ s father argued that his daughter would face a moral conflict if she was forced to do sports with boys in tight-fitting clothes .
in another instance , a court in münster in 2002 exempted a muslim girl in the 10th grade from a class trip after her parents argued their faith forbade their daughter to stay overnight outside of the house without the company of a male relative .
the court cases point to what islam experts say is the growing need within the muslim community to assert themselves in western society .
“ the message is ‘ we ’ re here , we ’ re proud , we ’ re going to live our religion and not going to hide ourselves anymore ’ , ” said riem spielhaus , an islamic studies lecturer at berlin ’ s humboldt university .

in addition , making exceptions for muslim students amounts to giving preferential treatment to one religion and could lead to their isolation , said turgut hüner .
the chairman of the turkish parents organization in berlin-brandenburg believes the trend among muslim parents to exempt their children from class has been fueled by the introduction of islamic religious classes in german schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is being taught in mosques and the koranic schools they sponsor ?
while learning their own language and religion is vital to second-generation muslims living in the country , hüner warned that it ’ s important to know just what is being taught under the guise of religious instruction .
he criticized berlin school authorities for allowing organizations such as the strongly-conservative islamic federation , which is on german law enforcement 's watch list , to impart islamic instruction in 28 schools in the german capital .
“ it ’ s a slippery slope , " said hüner .
" that ’ s when some parents get old-fashioned ideas into their hands and decide not to send their daughters to biology or swimming class . "
living in a muslim virtual world indeed , the islamic federation ran into trouble recently with the berlin education ministry for allegedly handing out application forms printed from the internet to muslim parents to get their daughters exempted from co-educative classes .
a look at the virtual world shows just how easy that is .
a web site called muslim-markt.de run by two muslim brothers offers muslims links and information to muslim doctors , lawyers , hairdressers , companies and so on .
the site " muslimrecht , " based in hamburg , offers detailed moral and legal guidelines to muslim parents wanting to free their daughters from co-ed sports and swimming lessons .
“ if you don ’ t stand up for your rights , it won ’ t just become a disadvantage to you , but will also lead to a restriction of rights for the coming generation of students , ” it warns its readers .
headscarf equals " problem child " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate is simmering while the debate simmers , some experts say it also reflects german teachers ’ poor understanding of the delicate integration process underway .
“ many have no idea how difficult it can be for a muslim girl caught between her traditional parents and a more permissive western society where she ’ s growing up , ” said spielhaus .
yilmaz knows that only too well .
“ as a muslim girl with a headscarf you ’ re immediately labeled ‘ dumb ’ , " she said .

in addition , making exceptions for muslim students amounts to giving preferential treatment to one religion and could lead to their isolation , said turgut hüner .
the chairman of the turkish parents organization in berlin-brandenburg believes the trend among muslim parents to exempt their children from class has been fueled by the introduction of islamic religious classes in german schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is being taught in mosques and the koranic schools they sponsor ?
while learning their own language and religion is vital to second-generation muslims living in the country , hüner warned that it ’ s important to know just what is being taught under the guise of religious instruction .
he criticized berlin school authorities for allowing organizations such as the strongly-conservative islamic federation , which is on german law enforcement 's watch list , to impart islamic instruction in 28 schools in the german capital .
“ it ’ s a slippery slope , " said hüner .
" that ’ s when some parents get old-fashioned ideas into their hands and decide not to send their daughters to biology or swimming class . "
living in a muslim virtual world indeed , the islamic federation ran into trouble recently with the berlin education ministry for allegedly handing out application forms printed from the internet to muslim parents to get their daughters exempted from co-educative classes .
a look at the virtual world shows just how easy that is .
a web site called muslim-markt.de run by two muslim brothers offers muslims links and information to muslim doctors , lawyers , hairdressers , companies and so on .
the site " muslimrecht , " based in hamburg , offers detailed moral and legal guidelines to muslim parents wanting to free their daughters from co-ed sports and swimming lessons .
“ if you don ’ t stand up for your rights , it won ’ t just become a disadvantage to you , but will also lead to a restriction of rights for the coming generation of students , ” it warns its readers .
headscarf equals " problem child " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate is simmering while the debate simmers , some experts say it also reflects german teachers ’ poor understanding of the delicate integration process underway .
“ many have no idea how difficult it can be for a muslim girl caught between her traditional parents and a more permissive western society where she ’ s growing up , ” said spielhaus .
yilmaz knows that only too well .
“ as a muslim girl with a headscarf you ’ re immediately labeled ‘ dumb ’ , " she said .
" i have to work extra hard at school to earn the recognition of my teachers so that they don ’ t think i ’ m a problem child .

german schools are increasingly grappling with cases of muslim girls pushing for exemption from co-ed swimming and sports on religious grounds , sorely testing the country 's ability to integrate its muslim population . with her flawless german , good grades and ambition to study towards a career , ayse yilmaz seems a model of muslim integration at her berlin high school .
she considers herself part of a growing group of young , educated muslims who have " a modern understanding of islam , " as the 18-year-old student of turkish-kurdish origin puts it .
but yilmaz - whose name has been changed here to protect her anonymit - has angered school authorities by refusing to take off her headscarf during sports class and going on school trips with her classmates .
“ i felt uncomfortable about the alcohol , partying and fooling around that takes place there , ” said yilmaz of the trips . as for her headscarf , yilmaz says , " there is no question of me taking it off just for sports or something .
it 's just part of me . " yilmaz ’ s arguments are becoming familiar ones to school authorities across germany , as muslim students and their parents clash with schools over whether the tenants of their faith should be allowed to bend the rules of germany 's secular school system .
though no reliable statistics are available , school authorities across the country say that an increasing number of muslim parents are demanding exemptions for their daughters on religious grounds from co-ed swimming , sports and biology classes .
thwarting integration efforts ?
the issue has turned into a potent flashpoint in german schools struggling with muslim integration .
“ it ’ s a difficult situation , ” said marion berning , director of the rixdorfer primary school , one of the largest in berlin ’ s neukölln district , where girls with headscarves are a common sight .
“ we have muslim girls who say they don ’ t want to swim with the boys .
it ’ s obvious the parents exert pressure on them , but they -lrb- the parents -rrb- have to accept that co-education is part of german schools . "

" when it comes to sex education , it ’ s shocking how little the muslim students know about the topic .
it ’ s absolutely taboo in their homes , ” she said .
resurgent muslim identity in the absence of a common law governing the issue , some schools have attempted to appease muslim parents by offering gender-segregated biology and swimming classes , discussing the issue with them in parent-teacher meetings or allowing muslim girls to wear loose-fitting clothing during sports . but that hasn ’ t stopped some muslim parents from appealing to the courts to enforce their religious rights .
in 1993 , a landmark ruling by germany ’ s federal administrative court allowed a 13-year-old turkish girl to be exempted from co-ed sport lessons if the school failed to proved gender-segregated sports class .
the girl ’ s father argued that his daughter would face a moral conflict if she was forced to do sports with boys in tight-fitting clothes .
in another instance , a court in münster in 2002 exempted a muslim girl in the 10th grade from a class trip after her parents argued their faith forbade their daughter to stay overnight outside of the house without the company of a male relative .
the court cases point to what islam experts say is the growing need within the muslim community to assert themselves in western society .
“ the message is ‘ we ’ re here , we ’ re proud , we ’ re going to live our religion and not going to hide ourselves anymore ’ , ” said riem spielhaus , an islamic studies lecturer at berlin ’ s humboldt university .

but yilmaz - whose name has been changed here to protect her anonymit - has angered school authorities by refusing to take off her headscarf during sports class and going on school trips with her classmates .
“ i felt uncomfortable about the alcohol , partying and fooling around that takes place there , ” said yilmaz of the trips . as for her headscarf , yilmaz says , " there is no question of me taking it off just for sports or something .
it 's just part of me . " yilmaz ’ s arguments are becoming familiar ones to school authorities across germany , as muslim students and their parents clash with schools over whether the tenants of their faith should be allowed to bend the rules of germany 's secular school system .
though no reliable statistics are available , school authorities across the country say that an increasing number of muslim parents are demanding exemptions for their daughters on religious grounds from co-ed swimming , sports and biology classes .
thwarting integration efforts ?
the issue has turned into a potent flashpoint in german schools struggling with muslim integration .
“ it ’ s a difficult situation , ” said marion berning , director of the rixdorfer primary school , one of the largest in berlin ’ s neukölln district , where girls with headscarves are a common sight .
“ we have muslim girls who say they don ’ t want to swim with the boys .
it ’ s obvious the parents exert pressure on them , but they -lrb- the parents -rrb- have to accept that co-education is part of german schools . "
at another school in berlin 's turkish- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex is " absolutely taboo at home . " dominated kreuzberg district , principal annette spieler worries muslim girls exempted from biology class are missing out on lessons vital to teenagers .
" when it comes to sex education , it ’ s shocking how little the muslim students know about the topic .
it ’ s absolutely taboo in their homes , ” she said .
resurgent muslim identity in the absence of a common law governing the issue , some schools have attempted to appease muslim parents by offering gender-segregated biology and swimming classes , discussing the issue with them in parent-teacher meetings or allowing muslim girls to wear loose-fitting clothing during sports . but that hasn ’ t stopped some muslim parents from appealing to the courts to enforce their religious rights .
in 1993 , a landmark ruling by germany ’ s federal administrative court allowed a 13-year-old turkish girl to be exempted from co-ed sport lessons if the school failed to proved gender-segregated sports class .
the girl ’ s father argued that his daughter would face a moral conflict if she was forced to do sports with boys in tight-fitting clothes .
in another instance , a court in münster in 2002 exempted a muslim girl in the 10th grade from a class trip after her parents argued their faith forbade their daughter to stay overnight outside of the house without the company of a male relative .
the court cases point to what islam experts say is the growing need within the muslim community to assert themselves in western society .
“ the message is ‘ we ’ re here , we ’ re proud , we ’ re going to live our religion and not going to hide ourselves anymore ’ , ” said riem spielhaus , an islamic studies lecturer at berlin ’ s humboldt university .

german schools are increasingly grappling with cases of muslim girls pushing for exemption from co-ed swimming and sports on religious grounds , sorely testing the country 's ability to integrate its muslim population . with her flawless german , good grades and ambition to study towards a career , ayse yilmaz seems a model of muslim integration at her berlin high school .
she considers herself part of a growing group of young , educated muslims who have " a modern understanding of islam , " as the 18-year-old student of turkish-kurdish origin puts it .
but yilmaz - whose name has been changed here to protect her anonymit - has angered school authorities by refusing to take off her headscarf during sports class and going on school trips with her classmates .
“ i felt uncomfortable about the alcohol , partying and fooling around that takes place there , ” said yilmaz of the trips . as for her headscarf , yilmaz says , " there is no question of me taking it off just for sports or something .
it 's just part of me . " yilmaz ’ s arguments are becoming familiar ones to school authorities across germany , as muslim students and their parents clash with schools over whether the tenants of their faith should be allowed to bend the rules of germany 's secular school system .
though no reliable statistics are available , school authorities across the country say that an increasing number of muslim parents are demanding exemptions for their daughters on religious grounds from co-ed swimming , sports and biology classes .
thwarting integration efforts ?
the issue has turned into a potent flashpoint in german schools struggling with muslim integration .
“ it ’ s a difficult situation , ” said marion berning , director of the rixdorfer primary school , one of the largest in berlin ’ s neukölln district , where girls with headscarves are a common sight .
“ we have muslim girls who say they don ’ t want to swim with the boys .
it ’ s obvious the parents exert pressure on them , but they -lrb- the parents -rrb- have to accept that co-education is part of german schools . "
at another school in berlin 's turkish- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex is " absolutely taboo at home . " dominated kreuzberg district , principal annette spieler worries muslim girls exempted from biology class are missing out on lessons vital to teenagers .
" when it comes to sex education , it ’ s shocking how little the muslim students know about the topic .
it ’ s absolutely taboo in their homes , ” she said .
resurgent muslim identity in the absence of a common law governing the issue , some schools have attempted to appease muslim parents by offering gender-segregated biology and swimming classes , discussing the issue with them in parent-teacher meetings or allowing muslim girls to wear loose-fitting clothing during sports . but that hasn ’ t stopped some muslim parents from appealing to the courts to enforce their religious rights .
in 1993 , a landmark ruling by germany ’ s federal administrative court allowed a 13-year-old turkish girl to be exempted from co-ed sport lessons if the school failed to proved gender-segregated sports class .
the girl ’ s father argued that his daughter would face a moral conflict if she was forced to do sports with boys in tight-fitting clothes .
in another instance , a court in münster in 2002 exempted a muslim girl in the 10th grade from a class trip after her parents argued their faith forbade their daughter to stay overnight outside of the house without the company of a male relative .
the court cases point to what islam experts say is the growing need within the muslim community to assert themselves in western society .
“ the message is ‘ we ’ re here , we ’ re proud , we ’ re going to live our religion and not going to hide ourselves anymore ’ , ” said riem spielhaus , an islamic studies lecturer at berlin ’ s humboldt university .

in addition , making exceptions for muslim students amounts to giving preferential treatment to one religion and could lead to their isolation , said turgut hüner .
the chairman of the turkish parents organization in berlin-brandenburg believes the trend among muslim parents to exempt their children from class has been fueled by the introduction of islamic religious classes in german schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is being taught in mosques and the koranic schools they sponsor ?
while learning their own language and religion is vital to second-generation muslims living in the country , hüner warned that it ’ s important to know just what is being taught under the guise of religious instruction .
he criticized berlin school authorities for allowing organizations such as the strongly-conservative islamic federation , which is on german law enforcement 's watch list , to impart islamic instruction in 28 schools in the german capital .

german schools are increasingly grappling with cases of muslim girls pushing for exemption from co-ed swimming and sports on religious grounds , sorely testing the country 's ability to integrate its muslim population . with her flawless german , good grades and ambition to study towards a career , ayse yilmaz seems a model of muslim integration at her berlin high school .
she considers herself part of a growing group of young , educated muslims who have " a modern understanding of islam , " as the 18-year-old student of turkish-kurdish origin puts it .
but yilmaz - whose name has been changed here to protect her anonymit - has angered school authorities by refusing to take off her headscarf during sports class and going on school trips with her classmates .
“ i felt uncomfortable about the alcohol , partying and fooling around that takes place there , ” said yilmaz of the trips . as for her headscarf , yilmaz says , " there is no question of me taking it off just for sports or something .
it 's just part of me . " yilmaz ’ s arguments are becoming familiar ones to school authorities across germany , as muslim students and their parents clash with schools over whether the tenants of their faith should be allowed to bend the rules of germany 's secular school system .
though no reliable statistics are available , school authorities across the country say that an increasing number of muslim parents are demanding exemptions for their daughters on religious grounds from co-ed swimming , sports and biology classes .
thwarting integration efforts ?
the issue has turned into a potent flashpoint in german schools struggling with muslim integration .
“ it ’ s a difficult situation , ” said marion berning , director of the rixdorfer primary school , one of the largest in berlin ’ s neukölln district , where girls with headscarves are a common sight .
“ we have muslim girls who say they don ’ t want to swim with the boys .
it ’ s obvious the parents exert pressure on them , but they -lrb- the parents -rrb- have to accept that co-education is part of german schools . "
at another school in berlin 's turkish- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex is " absolutely taboo at home .

" when it comes to sex education , it ’ s shocking how little the muslim students know about the topic .
it ’ s absolutely taboo in their homes , ” she said .
resurgent muslim identity in the absence of a common law governing the issue , some schools have attempted to appease muslim parents by offering gender-segregated biology and swimming classes , discussing the issue with them in parent-teacher meetings or allowing muslim girls to wear loose-fitting clothing during sports . but that hasn ’ t stopped some muslim parents from appealing to the courts to enforce their religious rights .
in 1993 , a landmark ruling by germany ’ s federal administrative court allowed a 13-year-old turkish girl to be exempted from co-ed sport lessons if the school failed to proved gender-segregated sports class .
the girl ’ s father argued that his daughter would face a moral conflict if she was forced to do sports with boys in tight-fitting clothes .
in another instance , a court in münster in 2002 exempted a muslim girl in the 10th grade from a class trip after her parents argued their faith forbade their daughter to stay overnight outside of the house without the company of a male relative .
the court cases point to what islam experts say is the growing need within the muslim community to assert themselves in western society .
“ the message is ‘ we ’ re here , we ’ re proud , we ’ re going to live our religion and not going to hide ourselves anymore ’ , ” said riem spielhaus , an islamic studies lecturer at berlin ’ s humboldt university .

german schools are increasingly grappling with cases of muslim girls pushing for exemption from co-ed swimming and sports on religious grounds , sorely testing the country 's ability to integrate its muslim population . with her flawless german , good grades and ambition to study towards a career , ayse yilmaz seems a model of muslim integration at her berlin high school .
she considers herself part of a growing group of young , educated muslims who have " a modern understanding of islam , " as the 18-year-old student of turkish-kurdish origin puts it .
but yilmaz - whose name has been changed here to protect her anonymit - has angered school authorities by refusing to take off her headscarf during sports class and going on school trips with her classmates .
“ i felt uncomfortable about the alcohol , partying and fooling around that takes place there , ” said yilmaz of the trips . as for her headscarf , yilmaz says , " there is no question of me taking it off just for sports or something .
it 's just part of me . " yilmaz ’ s arguments are becoming familiar ones to school authorities across germany , as muslim students and their parents clash with schools over whether the tenants of their faith should be allowed to bend the rules of germany 's secular school system .
though no reliable statistics are available , school authorities across the country say that an increasing number of muslim parents are demanding exemptions for their daughters on religious grounds from co-ed swimming , sports and biology classes .
thwarting integration efforts ?
the issue has turned into a potent flashpoint in german schools struggling with muslim integration .
“ it ’ s a difficult situation , ” said marion berning , director of the rixdorfer primary school , one of the largest in berlin ’ s neukölln district , where girls with headscarves are a common sight .
“ we have muslim girls who say they don ’ t want to swim with the boys .
it ’ s obvious the parents exert pressure on them , but they -lrb- the parents -rrb- have to accept that co-education is part of german schools . "

" dominated kreuzberg district , principal annette spieler worries muslim girls exempted from biology class are missing out on lessons vital to teenagers .
" when it comes to sex education , it ’ s shocking how little the muslim students know about the topic .
it ’ s absolutely taboo in their homes , ” she said .
resurgent muslim identity in the absence of a common law governing the issue , some schools have attempted to appease muslim parents by offering gender-segregated biology and swimming classes , discussing the issue with them in parent-teacher meetings or allowing muslim girls to wear loose-fitting clothing during sports . but that hasn ’ t stopped some muslim parents from appealing to the courts to enforce their religious rights .
in 1993 , a landmark ruling by germany ’ s federal administrative court allowed a 13-year-old turkish girl to be exempted from co-ed sport lessons if the school failed to proved gender-segregated sports class .
the girl ’ s father argued that his daughter would face a moral conflict if she was forced to do sports with boys in tight-fitting clothes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 23.04.2004 german journalist federation warns media over diana images großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the images of the dying diana have caused widespread outrage .
as media organizations around the world continue to react to the screening of pictures showing princess diana dying in the wreckage of her car , the german journalist 's federation warned members not to show the images . the german journalist 's federation -lrb- djv -rrb- has joined the growing number of international press associations in condemning the use of images screened on u.s. television on wednesday which allegedly showed diana , princess of wales , as she lay dying in the wreck of her mercedes in a paris underpass . the broadcasting of the pictures , as part of an investigative report into the princess 's death in 1997 in the cbs show " 48 hours investigates " , was " not responsible journalism , " according to djv chairperson michael konken who warned the german media not to follow suit and show the images . konken called the decision by cbs " an unambiguous offence against the press code " during a press conference in berlin on thursday and stressed that human dignity stands above the need of viewers and readers for information .
he also warned that any use of the images as part of articles condemning the cbs report would be just as offensive . breaking taboos should not be a marketing tool konken also demanded that the policy of breaking taboos should not be employed as a calculated marketing instrument by publishing companies wanting to improve circulation or viewing figures .
the djv chairman concluded by saying any german organization pursuing such an action would face a reprimand from the german press council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess diana and dodi fayed died in a car crash in paris .
the black and white photos of diana and her lover dodi al fayed were taken shortly after the accident on august 31 , 1997 .
in the images , an unconscious diana is being attended to by a doctor who attempts to resuscitate her through the wreckage of her limousine .
two hours later , diana died in a paris clinic .
al fayed and the driver henri paul were also killed .
the pictures are part of a confidential 4,000-page accident report compiled by french investigators . cbs defends journalistic context on thursday , cbs spokesperson sandra genelius once again defended the decision to show the pictures as the outrage spread around the globe .
the spokesperson reiterated that the pictures were shown in the context of an interview with the doctor seen treating diana at the time as illustrations to accompany his statements .
the pictures were shown " in a journalistic context - an examination of the medical treatment given diana after the crash , " genelius said . the spokesperson added that it was not the intention of cbs for the pictures to be seen outside the united states .
however , there have been rumors that the pictures had been offered to a number of newspapers before cbs secured the images and aired them . the statements from the u.s. broadcaster in the immediate wake of the show on wednesday night did little to placate the press in britain where diana remains an icon almost seven years after her death .
the fact that someone had crossed the line and showed the first pictures of the dying princess caused outrage in the british press . british press united in outrage the guardian wrote that cbs had " plumb new depths of prurience in the princess diana industry " while the tabloid daily mirror called the airing of the pictures " hideous , horrible and offensive " and the sun described them as " horrific . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions from public figures mined the same vein .
while clarence house , the office of diana 's former husband , prince charles , and her two sons , declined to comment , royal-watchers expressed concern for the princess ' sons william , 21 -lrb- photo -rrb- and harry , 19 .
" it 's going to be painful for william and harry , " former buckingham palace spokesman dickie arbiter told bbc radio .

as media organizations around the world continue to react to the screening of pictures showing princess diana dying in the wreckage of her car , the german journalist 's federation warned members not to show the images . the german journalist 's federation -lrb- djv -rrb- has joined the growing number of international press associations in condemning the use of images screened on u.s. television on wednesday which allegedly showed diana , princess of wales , as she lay dying in the wreck of her mercedes in a paris underpass . the broadcasting of the pictures , as part of an investigative report into the princess 's death in 1997 in the cbs show " 48 hours investigates " , was " not responsible journalism , " according to djv chairperson michael konken who warned the german media not to follow suit and show the images . konken called the decision by cbs " an unambiguous offence against the press code " during a press conference in berlin on thursday and stressed that human dignity stands above the need of viewers and readers for information .
he also warned that any use of the images as part of articles condemning the cbs report would be just as offensive . breaking taboos should not be a marketing tool konken also demanded that the policy of breaking taboos should not be employed as a calculated marketing instrument by publishing companies wanting to improve circulation or viewing figures .
the djv chairman concluded by saying any german organization pursuing such an action would face a reprimand from the german press council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess diana and dodi fayed died in a car crash in paris .
the black and white photos of diana and her lover dodi al fayed were taken shortly after the accident on august 31 , 1997 .
in the images , an unconscious diana is being attended to by a doctor who attempts to resuscitate her through the wreckage of her limousine .
two hours later , diana died in a paris clinic .
al fayed and the driver henri paul were also killed .
the pictures are part of a confidential 4,000-page accident report compiled by french investigators . cbs defends journalistic context on thursday , cbs spokesperson sandra genelius once again defended the decision to show the pictures as the outrage spread around the globe .
the spokesperson reiterated that the pictures were shown in the context of an interview with the doctor seen treating diana at the time as illustrations to accompany his statements .
the pictures were shown " in a journalistic context - an examination of the medical treatment given diana after the crash , " genelius said . the spokesperson added that it was not the intention of cbs for the pictures to be seen outside the united states .
however , there have been rumors that the pictures had been offered to a number of newspapers before cbs secured the images and aired them . the statements from the u.s. broadcaster in the immediate wake of the show on wednesday night did little to placate the press in britain where diana remains an icon almost seven years after her death .
the fact that someone had crossed the line and showed the first pictures of the dying princess caused outrage in the british press . british press united in outrage the guardian wrote that cbs had " plumb new depths of prurience in the princess diana industry " while the tabloid daily mirror called the airing of the pictures " hideous , horrible and offensive " and the sun described them as " horrific . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions from public figures mined the same vein .
while clarence house , the office of diana 's former husband , prince charles , and her two sons , declined to comment , royal-watchers expressed concern for the princess ' sons william , 21 -lrb- photo -rrb- and harry , 19 .
" it 's going to be painful for william and harry , " former buckingham palace spokesman dickie arbiter told bbc radio .
" they 're young men now .
they 're going to have to live with it for the rest of their lives . " buckingham palace , which speaks on behalf of diana 's sons , said it would not comment on the cbs pictures , but did not hide its displeasure .

german beer : worth a scientific look business -pipe- 23.04.2004 crying in your beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german beer market is firmly in foreign hands .
german beer day on april 23 celebrates germany 's famous reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law , which was established in 1516 .
unfortunately the country 's proud brewing tradition has n't helped the industry compete globally . germans love beer , there 's no doubt about that .
nearly every town or region has its own particular take on what is affectionately called " liquid bread " here .
the reinheitsgebot , set down by bavarian duke wilhelm iv , allows beer to be made from only hops , barley and water .
it 's a guideline that has served brewers who care about their product well over the centuries . making beer may not have changed radically over the past 500 years , but the beer industry certainly has , which is today big business on a global scale .
and that 's why german brewers have little reason to raise a mug of their favorite amber suds in celebration this friday of german beer day . the country 's fractionalized and provincial attitudes towards brewing - according to germany 's federal statistics office , there were 1,268 registered breweries in 2003 - has led to the creation of a mindboggling variety of beer . takeover targets but it has also made brewers easy targets for large foreign beer conglomerates looking to snap up bargains with growth potential .
in particular , belgium 's interbrew has been actively snapping up german brands , including the proud bavarian house spaten , which had been independent for over 600 years .
interbrew also owns germany 's ubiquitous beck 's beer . dutch brewer heineken started the raid on german beer makers in 2001 by buying half of munich-based schörghuber-gruppe , which makes paulaner , hacker-pschorr and kulmbacher beers .
that encouraged interbrew to go on an acquisition spree that started with beck 's and quickly added diebels and hasseröder before crowning things off last year with spaten .
not to be left out of the action , danish group carlsberg took over the hamburg-based holsten brewer at the being of 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many german beer aficionados , having their favorite drink sold off to the makers of what they consider inferior brews is humiliating , but spaten head jobst kayser-eichberg places blame squarely with those in the german brewing industry . " no global vision , provincial thinking , fantasies about staying independent and also pure vanity on the part of the german beer barons hindered mergers that could have led to a globally expanding german brewer , " kayser-eichberg told the associated press . consumption declining he also noted declining beer consumption in germany as a reason why local brewers will need a strong international partner to help increase export sales .
according to the munich-based ifo institute , germans drank only 118 liters per capita last year , compared to 122 liters in 2002 .
back in 1997 the germans swigged down on average 131 liters .
that means germans are now only the third biggest beer drinkers in europe , falling behind the czechs and the irish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite all the problems , the biggest insult for german beer lovers is perhaps yet to come .
during the 2006 world cup , which germany is hosting , german beer is likely to be banned from the country 's stadiums because u.s. beer giant anheuser-busch has a sponsoring agreement with soccer 's international governing body , fifa . on the brighter side , at least germans probably do n't have to fear that interbrew or heineken will try to supplant regional favorites with mass-produced foreign beers .
michael dietzsch , head of the second largest still german-run brewing concern bitburger , believes peoples ' local preferences are too strongly set for that . " that 's why foreign investors are buying german market brands and are n't trying to sell their own here , " dietzsch told the german news agency dpa . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's " bud " or nothing at world cup 2006 want to throw back a nice bavarian brew while watching a world cup match in germany in 2006 ?

al fayed and the driver henri paul were also killed .
the pictures are part of a confidential 4,000-page accident report compiled by french investigators . cbs defends journalistic context on thursday , cbs spokesperson sandra genelius once again defended the decision to show the pictures as the outrage spread around the globe .
the spokesperson reiterated that the pictures were shown in the context of an interview with the doctor seen treating diana at the time as illustrations to accompany his statements .
the pictures were shown " in a journalistic context - an examination of the medical treatment given diana after the crash , " genelius said . the spokesperson added that it was not the intention of cbs for the pictures to be seen outside the united states .
however , there have been rumors that the pictures had been offered to a number of newspapers before cbs secured the images and aired them . the statements from the u.s. broadcaster in the immediate wake of the show on wednesday night did little to placate the press in britain where diana remains an icon almost seven years after her death .
the fact that someone had crossed the line and showed the first pictures of the dying princess caused outrage in the british press . british press united in outrage the guardian wrote that cbs had " plumb new depths of prurience in the princess diana industry " while the tabloid daily mirror called the airing of the pictures " hideous , horrible and offensive " and the sun described them as " horrific . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions from public figures mined the same vein .
while clarence house , the office of diana 's former husband , prince charles , and her two sons , declined to comment , royal-watchers expressed concern for the princess ' sons william , 21 -lrb- photo -rrb- and harry , 19 .
" it 's going to be painful for william and harry , " former buckingham palace spokesman dickie arbiter told bbc radio .
" they 're young men now .
they 're going to have to live with it for the rest of their lives . " buckingham palace , which speaks on behalf of diana 's sons , said it would not comment on the cbs pictures , but did not hide its displeasure .
" we 've made our opinion very clear in the past on this sort of thing and we wo n't be commenting specifically . "
british prime minister tony blair also expressed his distaste .
asked about the matter at his monthly news conference , blair told reporters : " i think everyone finds it distasteful that there are pictures that can cause distress to the family . "
princess 's family sickened by images a brief statement released on behalf of diana 's brother said " lord spencer and his family are shocked and sickened by cbs ' actions . "
dodi fayed 's father , mohamed al fayed , said cbs had behaved in " disgraceful and insensitive " manner .
" cbs obviously do n't care about the appalling effect of showing images of murder victims , " said fayed , who has long insisted that diana and his son were murdered .

german beer : worth a scientific look business -pipe- 23.04.2004 crying in your beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german beer market is firmly in foreign hands .
german beer day on april 23 celebrates germany 's famous reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law , which was established in 1516 .
unfortunately the country 's proud brewing tradition has n't helped the industry compete globally . germans love beer , there 's no doubt about that .
nearly every town or region has its own particular take on what is affectionately called " liquid bread " here .
the reinheitsgebot , set down by bavarian duke wilhelm iv , allows beer to be made from only hops , barley and water .
it 's a guideline that has served brewers who care about their product well over the centuries . making beer may not have changed radically over the past 500 years , but the beer industry certainly has , which is today big business on a global scale .
and that 's why german brewers have little reason to raise a mug of their favorite amber suds in celebration this friday of german beer day . the country 's fractionalized and provincial attitudes towards brewing - according to germany 's federal statistics office , there were 1,268 registered breweries in 2003 - has led to the creation of a mindboggling variety of beer . takeover targets but it has also made brewers easy targets for large foreign beer conglomerates looking to snap up bargains with growth potential .
in particular , belgium 's interbrew has been actively snapping up german brands , including the proud bavarian house spaten , which had been independent for over 600 years .
interbrew also owns germany 's ubiquitous beck 's beer . dutch brewer heineken started the raid on german beer makers in 2001 by buying half of munich-based schörghuber-gruppe , which makes paulaner , hacker-pschorr and kulmbacher beers .
that encouraged interbrew to go on an acquisition spree that started with beck 's and quickly added diebels and hasseröder before crowning things off last year with spaten .
not to be left out of the action , danish group carlsberg took over the hamburg-based holsten brewer at the being of 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many german beer aficionados , having their favorite drink sold off to the makers of what they consider inferior brews is humiliating , but spaten head jobst kayser-eichberg places blame squarely with those in the german brewing industry . " no global vision , provincial thinking , fantasies about staying independent and also pure vanity on the part of the german beer barons hindered mergers that could have led to a globally expanding german brewer , " kayser-eichberg told the associated press . consumption declining he also noted declining beer consumption in germany as a reason why local brewers will need a strong international partner to help increase export sales .
according to the munich-based ifo institute , germans drank only 118 liters per capita last year , compared to 122 liters in 2002 .
back in 1997 the germans swigged down on average 131 liters .
that means germans are now only the third biggest beer drinkers in europe , falling behind the czechs and the irish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite all the problems , the biggest insult for german beer lovers is perhaps yet to come .
during the 2006 world cup , which germany is hosting , german beer is likely to be banned from the country 's stadiums because u.s. beer giant anheuser-busch has a sponsoring agreement with soccer 's international governing body , fifa . on the brighter side , at least germans probably do n't have to fear that interbrew or heineken will try to supplant regional favorites with mass-produced foreign beers .
michael dietzsch , head of the second largest still german-run brewing concern bitburger , believes peoples ' local preferences are too strongly set for that .

as media organizations around the world continue to react to the screening of pictures showing princess diana dying in the wreckage of her car , the german journalist 's federation warned members not to show the images . the german journalist 's federation -lrb- djv -rrb- has joined the growing number of international press associations in condemning the use of images screened on u.s. television on wednesday which allegedly showed diana , princess of wales , as she lay dying in the wreck of her mercedes in a paris underpass . the broadcasting of the pictures , as part of an investigative report into the princess 's death in 1997 in the cbs show " 48 hours investigates " , was " not responsible journalism , " according to djv chairperson michael konken who warned the german media not to follow suit and show the images . konken called the decision by cbs " an unambiguous offence against the press code " during a press conference in berlin on thursday and stressed that human dignity stands above the need of viewers and readers for information .
he also warned that any use of the images as part of articles condemning the cbs report would be just as offensive . breaking taboos should not be a marketing tool konken also demanded that the policy of breaking taboos should not be employed as a calculated marketing instrument by publishing companies wanting to improve circulation or viewing figures .
the djv chairman concluded by saying any german organization pursuing such an action would face a reprimand from the german press council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess diana and dodi fayed died in a car crash in paris .
the black and white photos of diana and her lover dodi al fayed were taken shortly after the accident on august 31 , 1997 .
in the images , an unconscious diana is being attended to by a doctor who attempts to resuscitate her through the wreckage of her limousine .
two hours later , diana died in a paris clinic .
al fayed and the driver henri paul were also killed .
the pictures are part of a confidential 4,000-page accident report compiled by french investigators . cbs defends journalistic context on thursday , cbs spokesperson sandra genelius once again defended the decision to show the pictures as the outrage spread around the globe .

as media organizations around the world continue to react to the screening of pictures showing princess diana dying in the wreckage of her car , the german journalist 's federation warned members not to show the images . the german journalist 's federation -lrb- djv -rrb- has joined the growing number of international press associations in condemning the use of images screened on u.s. television on wednesday which allegedly showed diana , princess of wales , as she lay dying in the wreck of her mercedes in a paris underpass . the broadcasting of the pictures , as part of an investigative report into the princess 's death in 1997 in the cbs show " 48 hours investigates " , was " not responsible journalism , " according to djv chairperson michael konken who warned the german media not to follow suit and show the images . konken called the decision by cbs " an unambiguous offence against the press code " during a press conference in berlin on thursday and stressed that human dignity stands above the need of viewers and readers for information .
he also warned that any use of the images as part of articles condemning the cbs report would be just as offensive . breaking taboos should not be a marketing tool konken also demanded that the policy of breaking taboos should not be employed as a calculated marketing instrument by publishing companies wanting to improve circulation or viewing figures .
the djv chairman concluded by saying any german organization pursuing such an action would face a reprimand from the german press council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess diana and dodi fayed died in a car crash in paris .
the black and white photos of diana and her lover dodi al fayed were taken shortly after the accident on august 31 , 1997 .
in the images , an unconscious diana is being attended to by a doctor who attempts to resuscitate her through the wreckage of her limousine .
two hours later , diana died in a paris clinic .
al fayed and the driver henri paul were also killed .
the pictures are part of a confidential 4,000-page accident report compiled by french investigators . cbs defends journalistic context on thursday , cbs spokesperson sandra genelius once again defended the decision to show the pictures as the outrage spread around the globe .
the spokesperson reiterated that the pictures were shown in the context of an interview with the doctor seen treating diana at the time as illustrations to accompany his statements .
the pictures were shown " in a journalistic context - an examination of the medical treatment given diana after the crash , " genelius said . the spokesperson added that it was not the intention of cbs for the pictures to be seen outside the united states .
however , there have been rumors that the pictures had been offered to a number of newspapers before cbs secured the images and aired them . the statements from the u.s. broadcaster in the immediate wake of the show on wednesday night did little to placate the press in britain where diana remains an icon almost seven years after her death .
the fact that someone had crossed the line and showed the first pictures of the dying princess caused outrage in the british press . british press united in outrage the guardian wrote that cbs had " plumb new depths of prurience in the princess diana industry " while the tabloid daily mirror called the airing of the pictures " hideous , horrible and offensive " and the sun described them as " horrific . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions from public figures mined the same vein .
while clarence house , the office of diana 's former husband , prince charles , and her two sons , declined to comment , royal-watchers expressed concern for the princess ' sons william , 21 -lrb- photo -rrb- and harry , 19 .
" it 's going to be painful for william and harry , " former buckingham palace spokesman dickie arbiter told bbc radio .
" they 're young men now .
they 're going to have to live with it for the rest of their lives . " buckingham palace , which speaks on behalf of diana 's sons , said it would not comment on the cbs pictures , but did not hide its displeasure .
" we 've made our opinion very clear in the past on this sort of thing and we wo n't be commenting specifically . "
british prime minister tony blair also expressed his distaste .
asked about the matter at his monthly news conference , blair told reporters : " i think everyone finds it distasteful that there are pictures that can cause distress to the family . "
princess 's family sickened by images a brief statement released on behalf of diana 's brother said " lord spencer and his family are shocked and sickened by cbs ' actions . "
dodi fayed 's father , mohamed al fayed , said cbs had behaved in " disgraceful and insensitive " manner .
" cbs obviously do n't care about the appalling effect of showing images of murder victims , " said fayed , who has long insisted that diana and his son were murdered .
a lengthy french investigation concluded the crash was an accident caused by drunk and speeding driver paul . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diana 's death : catastrophe or conspiracy ?

as media organizations around the world continue to react to the screening of pictures showing princess diana dying in the wreckage of her car , the german journalist 's federation warned members not to show the images . the german journalist 's federation -lrb- djv -rrb- has joined the growing number of international press associations in condemning the use of images screened on u.s. television on wednesday which allegedly showed diana , princess of wales , as she lay dying in the wreck of her mercedes in a paris underpass . the broadcasting of the pictures , as part of an investigative report into the princess 's death in 1997 in the cbs show " 48 hours investigates " , was " not responsible journalism , " according to djv chairperson michael konken who warned the german media not to follow suit and show the images . konken called the decision by cbs " an unambiguous offence against the press code " during a press conference in berlin on thursday and stressed that human dignity stands above the need of viewers and readers for information .
he also warned that any use of the images as part of articles condemning the cbs report would be just as offensive . breaking taboos should not be a marketing tool konken also demanded that the policy of breaking taboos should not be employed as a calculated marketing instrument by publishing companies wanting to improve circulation or viewing figures .
the djv chairman concluded by saying any german organization pursuing such an action would face a reprimand from the german press council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess diana and dodi fayed died in a car crash in paris .
the black and white photos of diana and her lover dodi al fayed were taken shortly after the accident on august 31 , 1997 .
in the images , an unconscious diana is being attended to by a doctor who attempts to resuscitate her through the wreckage of her limousine .
two hours later , diana died in a paris clinic .
al fayed and the driver henri paul were also killed .
the pictures are part of a confidential 4,000-page accident report compiled by french investigators . cbs defends journalistic context on thursday , cbs spokesperson sandra genelius once again defended the decision to show the pictures as the outrage spread around the globe .
the spokesperson reiterated that the pictures were shown in the context of an interview with the doctor seen treating diana at the time as illustrations to accompany his statements .
the pictures were shown " in a journalistic context - an examination of the medical treatment given diana after the crash , " genelius said . the spokesperson added that it was not the intention of cbs for the pictures to be seen outside the united states .
however , there have been rumors that the pictures had been offered to a number of newspapers before cbs secured the images and aired them . the statements from the u.s. broadcaster in the immediate wake of the show on wednesday night did little to placate the press in britain where diana remains an icon almost seven years after her death .
the fact that someone had crossed the line and showed the first pictures of the dying princess caused outrage in the british press . british press united in outrage the guardian wrote that cbs had " plumb new depths of prurience in the princess diana industry " while the tabloid daily mirror called the airing of the pictures " hideous , horrible and offensive " and the sun described them as " horrific . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions from public figures mined the same vein .
while clarence house , the office of diana 's former husband , prince charles , and her two sons , declined to comment , royal-watchers expressed concern for the princess ' sons william , 21 -lrb- photo -rrb- and harry , 19 .
" it 's going to be painful for william and harry , " former buckingham palace spokesman dickie arbiter told bbc radio .
" they 're young men now .
they 're going to have to live with it for the rest of their lives . " buckingham palace , which speaks on behalf of diana 's sons , said it would not comment on the cbs pictures , but did not hide its displeasure .
" we 've made our opinion very clear in the past on this sort of thing and we wo n't be commenting specifically . "
british prime minister tony blair also expressed his distaste .
asked about the matter at his monthly news conference , blair told reporters : " i think everyone finds it distasteful that there are pictures that can cause distress to the family . "
princess 's family sickened by images a brief statement released on behalf of diana 's brother said " lord spencer and his family are shocked and sickened by cbs ' actions . "

german beer : worth a scientific look business -pipe- 23.04.2004 crying in your beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german beer market is firmly in foreign hands .
german beer day on april 23 celebrates germany 's famous reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law , which was established in 1516 .
unfortunately the country 's proud brewing tradition has n't helped the industry compete globally . germans love beer , there 's no doubt about that .
nearly every town or region has its own particular take on what is affectionately called " liquid bread " here .
the reinheitsgebot , set down by bavarian duke wilhelm iv , allows beer to be made from only hops , barley and water .
it 's a guideline that has served brewers who care about their product well over the centuries . making beer may not have changed radically over the past 500 years , but the beer industry certainly has , which is today big business on a global scale .
and that 's why german brewers have little reason to raise a mug of their favorite amber suds in celebration this friday of german beer day . the country 's fractionalized and provincial attitudes towards brewing - according to germany 's federal statistics office , there were 1,268 registered breweries in 2003 - has led to the creation of a mindboggling variety of beer . takeover targets but it has also made brewers easy targets for large foreign beer conglomerates looking to snap up bargains with growth potential .
in particular , belgium 's interbrew has been actively snapping up german brands , including the proud bavarian house spaten , which had been independent for over 600 years .
interbrew also owns germany 's ubiquitous beck 's beer . dutch brewer heineken started the raid on german beer makers in 2001 by buying half of munich-based schörghuber-gruppe , which makes paulaner , hacker-pschorr and kulmbacher beers .
that encouraged interbrew to go on an acquisition spree that started with beck 's and quickly added diebels and hasseröder before crowning things off last year with spaten .
not to be left out of the action , danish group carlsberg took over the hamburg-based holsten brewer at the being of 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many german beer aficionados , having their favorite drink sold off to the makers of what they consider inferior brews is humiliating , but spaten head jobst kayser-eichberg places blame squarely with those in the german brewing industry . " no global vision , provincial thinking , fantasies about staying independent and also pure vanity on the part of the german beer barons hindered mergers that could have led to a globally expanding german brewer , " kayser-eichberg told the associated press . consumption declining he also noted declining beer consumption in germany as a reason why local brewers will need a strong international partner to help increase export sales .
according to the munich-based ifo institute , germans drank only 118 liters per capita last year , compared to 122 liters in 2002 .
back in 1997 the germans swigged down on average 131 liters .
that means germans are now only the third biggest beer drinkers in europe , falling behind the czechs and the irish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite all the problems , the biggest insult for german beer lovers is perhaps yet to come .
during the 2006 world cup , which germany is hosting , german beer is likely to be banned from the country 's stadiums because u.s. beer giant anheuser-busch has a sponsoring agreement with soccer 's international governing body , fifa . on the brighter side , at least germans probably do n't have to fear that interbrew or heineken will try to supplant regional favorites with mass-produced foreign beers .
michael dietzsch , head of the second largest still german-run brewing concern bitburger , believes peoples ' local preferences are too strongly set for that . " that 's why foreign investors are buying german market brands and are n't trying to sell their own here , " dietzsch told the german news agency dpa . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's " bud " or nothing at world cup 2006 want to throw back a nice bavarian brew while watching a world cup match in germany in 2006 ?

german beer : worth a scientific look business -pipe- 23.04.2004 crying in your beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german beer market is firmly in foreign hands .
german beer day on april 23 celebrates germany 's famous reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law , which was established in 1516 .
unfortunately the country 's proud brewing tradition has n't helped the industry compete globally . germans love beer , there 's no doubt about that .
nearly every town or region has its own particular take on what is affectionately called " liquid bread " here .
the reinheitsgebot , set down by bavarian duke wilhelm iv , allows beer to be made from only hops , barley and water .
it 's a guideline that has served brewers who care about their product well over the centuries . making beer may not have changed radically over the past 500 years , but the beer industry certainly has , which is today big business on a global scale .
and that 's why german brewers have little reason to raise a mug of their favorite amber suds in celebration this friday of german beer day . the country 's fractionalized and provincial attitudes towards brewing - according to germany 's federal statistics office , there were 1,268 registered breweries in 2003 - has led to the creation of a mindboggling variety of beer . takeover targets but it has also made brewers easy targets for large foreign beer conglomerates looking to snap up bargains with growth potential .
in particular , belgium 's interbrew has been actively snapping up german brands , including the proud bavarian house spaten , which had been independent for over 600 years .
interbrew also owns germany 's ubiquitous beck 's beer . dutch brewer heineken started the raid on german beer makers in 2001 by buying half of munich-based schörghuber-gruppe , which makes paulaner , hacker-pschorr and kulmbacher beers .
that encouraged interbrew to go on an acquisition spree that started with beck 's and quickly added diebels and hasseröder before crowning things off last year with spaten .
not to be left out of the action , danish group carlsberg took over the hamburg-based holsten brewer at the being of 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many german beer aficionados , having their favorite drink sold off to the makers of what they consider inferior brews is humiliating , but spaten head jobst kayser-eichberg places blame squarely with those in the german brewing industry .

as media organizations around the world continue to react to the screening of pictures showing princess diana dying in the wreckage of her car , the german journalist 's federation warned members not to show the images . the german journalist 's federation -lrb- djv -rrb- has joined the growing number of international press associations in condemning the use of images screened on u.s. television on wednesday which allegedly showed diana , princess of wales , as she lay dying in the wreck of her mercedes in a paris underpass . the broadcasting of the pictures , as part of an investigative report into the princess 's death in 1997 in the cbs show " 48 hours investigates " , was " not responsible journalism , " according to djv chairperson michael konken who warned the german media not to follow suit and show the images . konken called the decision by cbs " an unambiguous offence against the press code " during a press conference in berlin on thursday and stressed that human dignity stands above the need of viewers and readers for information .
he also warned that any use of the images as part of articles condemning the cbs report would be just as offensive . breaking taboos should not be a marketing tool konken also demanded that the policy of breaking taboos should not be employed as a calculated marketing instrument by publishing companies wanting to improve circulation or viewing figures .
the djv chairman concluded by saying any german organization pursuing such an action would face a reprimand from the german press council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess diana and dodi fayed died in a car crash in paris .
the black and white photos of diana and her lover dodi al fayed were taken shortly after the accident on august 31 , 1997 .
in the images , an unconscious diana is being attended to by a doctor who attempts to resuscitate her through the wreckage of her limousine .
two hours later , diana died in a paris clinic .
al fayed and the driver henri paul were also killed .
the pictures are part of a confidential 4,000-page accident report compiled by french investigators . cbs defends journalistic context on thursday , cbs spokesperson sandra genelius once again defended the decision to show the pictures as the outrage spread around the globe .
the spokesperson reiterated that the pictures were shown in the context of an interview with the doctor seen treating diana at the time as illustrations to accompany his statements .
the pictures were shown " in a journalistic context - an examination of the medical treatment given diana after the crash , " genelius said . the spokesperson added that it was not the intention of cbs for the pictures to be seen outside the united states .
however , there have been rumors that the pictures had been offered to a number of newspapers before cbs secured the images and aired them . the statements from the u.s. broadcaster in the immediate wake of the show on wednesday night did little to placate the press in britain where diana remains an icon almost seven years after her death .
the fact that someone had crossed the line and showed the first pictures of the dying princess caused outrage in the british press . british press united in outrage the guardian wrote that cbs had " plumb new depths of prurience in the princess diana industry " while the tabloid daily mirror called the airing of the pictures " hideous , horrible and offensive " and the sun described them as " horrific . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions from public figures mined the same vein .
while clarence house , the office of diana 's former husband , prince charles , and her two sons , declined to comment , royal-watchers expressed concern for the princess ' sons william , 21 -lrb- photo -rrb- and harry , 19 .
" it 's going to be painful for william and harry , " former buckingham palace spokesman dickie arbiter told bbc radio .
" they 're young men now .
they 're going to have to live with it for the rest of their lives . " buckingham palace , which speaks on behalf of diana 's sons , said it would not comment on the cbs pictures , but did not hide its displeasure .
" we 've made our opinion very clear in the past on this sort of thing and we wo n't be commenting specifically . "
british prime minister tony blair also expressed his distaste .
asked about the matter at his monthly news conference , blair told reporters : " i think everyone finds it distasteful that there are pictures that can cause distress to the family . "
princess 's family sickened by images a brief statement released on behalf of diana 's brother said " lord spencer and his family are shocked and sickened by cbs ' actions . "
dodi fayed 's father , mohamed al fayed , said cbs had behaved in " disgraceful and insensitive " manner .
" cbs obviously do n't care about the appalling effect of showing images of murder victims , " said fayed , who has long insisted that diana and his son were murdered .
a lengthy french investigation concluded the crash was an accident caused by drunk and speeding driver paul . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diana 's death : catastrophe or conspiracy ?

german schools are increasingly grappling with cases of muslim girls pushing for exemption from co-ed swimming and sports on religious grounds , sorely testing the country 's ability to integrate its muslim population . with her flawless german , good grades and ambition to study towards a career , ayse yilmaz seems a model of muslim integration at her berlin high school .
she considers herself part of a growing group of young , educated muslims who have " a modern understanding of islam , " as the 18-year-old student of turkish-kurdish origin puts it .
but yilmaz - whose name has been changed here to protect her anonymit - has angered school authorities by refusing to take off her headscarf during sports class and going on school trips with her classmates .
“ i felt uncomfortable about the alcohol , partying and fooling around that takes place there , ” said yilmaz of the trips . as for her headscarf , yilmaz says , " there is no question of me taking it off just for sports or something .
it 's just part of me . " yilmaz ’ s arguments are becoming familiar ones to school authorities across germany , as muslim students and their parents clash with schools over whether the tenants of their faith should be allowed to bend the rules of germany 's secular school system .
though no reliable statistics are available , school authorities across the country say that an increasing number of muslim parents are demanding exemptions for their daughters on religious grounds from co-ed swimming , sports and biology classes .
thwarting integration efforts ?
the issue has turned into a potent flashpoint in german schools struggling with muslim integration .
“ it ’ s a difficult situation , ” said marion berning , director of the rixdorfer primary school , one of the largest in berlin ’ s neukölln district , where girls with headscarves are a common sight .
“ we have muslim girls who say they don ’ t want to swim with the boys .
it ’ s obvious the parents exert pressure on them , but they -lrb- the parents -rrb- have to accept that co-education is part of german schools . "
at another school in berlin 's turkish- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex is " absolutely taboo at home . " dominated kreuzberg district , principal annette spieler worries muslim girls exempted from biology class are missing out on lessons vital to teenagers .
" when it comes to sex education , it ’ s shocking how little the muslim students know about the topic .
it ’ s absolutely taboo in their homes , ” she said .
resurgent muslim identity in the absence of a common law governing the issue , some schools have attempted to appease muslim parents by offering gender-segregated biology and swimming classes , discussing the issue with them in parent-teacher meetings or allowing muslim girls to wear loose-fitting clothing during sports . but that hasn ’ t stopped some muslim parents from appealing to the courts to enforce their religious rights .
in 1993 , a landmark ruling by germany ’ s federal administrative court allowed a 13-year-old turkish girl to be exempted from co-ed sport lessons if the school failed to proved gender-segregated sports class .
the girl ’ s father argued that his daughter would face a moral conflict if she was forced to do sports with boys in tight-fitting clothes .
in another instance , a court in münster in 2002 exempted a muslim girl in the 10th grade from a class trip after her parents argued their faith forbade their daughter to stay overnight outside of the house without the company of a male relative .
the court cases point to what islam experts say is the growing need within the muslim community to assert themselves in western society .
“ the message is ‘ we ’ re here , we ’ re proud , we ’ re going to live our religion and not going to hide ourselves anymore ’ , ” said riem spielhaus , an islamic studies lecturer at berlin ’ s humboldt university .

in addition , making exceptions for muslim students amounts to giving preferential treatment to one religion and could lead to their isolation , said turgut hüner .
the chairman of the turkish parents organization in berlin-brandenburg believes the trend among muslim parents to exempt their children from class has been fueled by the introduction of islamic religious classes in german schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is being taught in mosques and the koranic schools they sponsor ?
while learning their own language and religion is vital to second-generation muslims living in the country , hüner warned that it ’ s important to know just what is being taught under the guise of religious instruction .
he criticized berlin school authorities for allowing organizations such as the strongly-conservative islamic federation , which is on german law enforcement 's watch list , to impart islamic instruction in 28 schools in the german capital .
“ it ’ s a slippery slope , " said hüner .
" that ’ s when some parents get old-fashioned ideas into their hands and decide not to send their daughters to biology or swimming class . "
living in a muslim virtual world indeed , the islamic federation ran into trouble recently with the berlin education ministry for allegedly handing out application forms printed from the internet to muslim parents to get their daughters exempted from co-educative classes .
a look at the virtual world shows just how easy that is .
a web site called muslim-markt.de run by two muslim brothers offers muslims links and information to muslim doctors , lawyers , hairdressers , companies and so on .
the site " muslimrecht , " based in hamburg , offers detailed moral and legal guidelines to muslim parents wanting to free their daughters from co-ed sports and swimming lessons .
“ if you don ’ t stand up for your rights , it won ’ t just become a disadvantage to you , but will also lead to a restriction of rights for the coming generation of students , ” it warns its readers .

“ many have no idea how difficult it can be for a muslim girl caught between her traditional parents and a more permissive western society where she ’ s growing up , ” said spielhaus .
yilmaz knows that only too well .

german schools are increasingly grappling with cases of muslim girls pushing for exemption from co-ed swimming and sports on religious grounds , sorely testing the country 's ability to integrate its muslim population . with her flawless german , good grades and ambition to study towards a career , ayse yilmaz seems a model of muslim integration at her berlin high school .
she considers herself part of a growing group of young , educated muslims who have " a modern understanding of islam , " as the 18-year-old student of turkish-kurdish origin puts it .
but yilmaz - whose name has been changed here to protect her anonymit - has angered school authorities by refusing to take off her headscarf during sports class and going on school trips with her classmates .
“ i felt uncomfortable about the alcohol , partying and fooling around that takes place there , ” said yilmaz of the trips . as for her headscarf , yilmaz says , " there is no question of me taking it off just for sports or something .
it 's just part of me . " yilmaz ’ s arguments are becoming familiar ones to school authorities across germany , as muslim students and their parents clash with schools over whether the tenants of their faith should be allowed to bend the rules of germany 's secular school system .
though no reliable statistics are available , school authorities across the country say that an increasing number of muslim parents are demanding exemptions for their daughters on religious grounds from co-ed swimming , sports and biology classes .

the issue has turned into a potent flashpoint in german schools struggling with muslim integration .
“ it ’ s a difficult situation , ” said marion berning , director of the rixdorfer primary school , one of the largest in berlin ’ s neukölln district , where girls with headscarves are a common sight .
“ we have muslim girls who say they don ’ t want to swim with the boys .

resurgent muslim identity in the absence of a common law governing the issue , some schools have attempted to appease muslim parents by offering gender-segregated biology and swimming classes , discussing the issue with them in parent-teacher meetings or allowing muslim girls to wear loose-fitting clothing during sports . but that hasn ’ t stopped some muslim parents from appealing to the courts to enforce their religious rights .
in 1993 , a landmark ruling by germany ’ s federal administrative court allowed a 13-year-old turkish girl to be exempted from co-ed sport lessons if the school failed to proved gender-segregated sports class .
the girl ’ s father argued that his daughter would face a moral conflict if she was forced to do sports with boys in tight-fitting clothes .
in another instance , a court in münster in 2002 exempted a muslim girl in the 10th grade from a class trip after her parents argued their faith forbade their daughter to stay overnight outside of the house without the company of a male relative .

in addition , making exceptions for muslim students amounts to giving preferential treatment to one religion and could lead to their isolation , said turgut hüner .

while learning their own language and religion is vital to second-generation muslims living in the country , hüner warned that it ’ s important to know just what is being taught under the guise of religious instruction .
he criticized berlin school authorities for allowing organizations such as the strongly-conservative islamic federation , which is on german law enforcement 's watch list , to impart islamic instruction in 28 schools in the german capital .

in addition , making exceptions for muslim students amounts to giving preferential treatment to one religion and could lead to their isolation , said turgut hüner .
the chairman of the turkish parents organization in berlin-brandenburg believes the trend among muslim parents to exempt their children from class has been fueled by the introduction of islamic religious classes in german schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is being taught in mosques and the koranic schools they sponsor ?
while learning their own language and religion is vital to second-generation muslims living in the country , hüner warned that it ’ s important to know just what is being taught under the guise of religious instruction .
he criticized berlin school authorities for allowing organizations such as the strongly-conservative islamic federation , which is on german law enforcement 's watch list , to impart islamic instruction in 28 schools in the german capital .
“ it ’ s a slippery slope , " said hüner .
" that ’ s when some parents get old-fashioned ideas into their hands and decide not to send their daughters to biology or swimming class . "
living in a muslim virtual world indeed , the islamic federation ran into trouble recently with the berlin education ministry for allegedly handing out application forms printed from the internet to muslim parents to get their daughters exempted from co-educative classes .
a look at the virtual world shows just how easy that is .
a web site called muslim-markt.de run by two muslim brothers offers muslims links and information to muslim doctors , lawyers , hairdressers , companies and so on .
the site " muslimrecht , " based in hamburg , offers detailed moral and legal guidelines to muslim parents wanting to free their daughters from co-ed sports and swimming lessons .
“ if you don ’ t stand up for your rights , it won ’ t just become a disadvantage to you , but will also lead to a restriction of rights for the coming generation of students , ” it warns its readers .
headscarf equals " problem child " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate is simmering while the debate simmers , some experts say it also reflects german teachers ’ poor understanding of the delicate integration process underway .
“ many have no idea how difficult it can be for a muslim girl caught between her traditional parents and a more permissive western society where she ’ s growing up , ” said spielhaus .
yilmaz knows that only too well .
“ as a muslim girl with a headscarf you ’ re immediately labeled ‘ dumb ’ , " she said .

german schools are increasingly grappling with cases of muslim girls pushing for exemption from co-ed swimming and sports on religious grounds , sorely testing the country 's ability to integrate its muslim population . with her flawless german , good grades and ambition to study towards a career , ayse yilmaz seems a model of muslim integration at her berlin high school .
she considers herself part of a growing group of young , educated muslims who have " a modern understanding of islam , " as the 18-year-old student of turkish-kurdish origin puts it .
but yilmaz - whose name has been changed here to protect her anonymit - has angered school authorities by refusing to take off her headscarf during sports class and going on school trips with her classmates .
“ i felt uncomfortable about the alcohol , partying and fooling around that takes place there , ” said yilmaz of the trips . as for her headscarf , yilmaz says , " there is no question of me taking it off just for sports or something .
it 's just part of me . " yilmaz ’ s arguments are becoming familiar ones to school authorities across germany , as muslim students and their parents clash with schools over whether the tenants of their faith should be allowed to bend the rules of germany 's secular school system .
though no reliable statistics are available , school authorities across the country say that an increasing number of muslim parents are demanding exemptions for their daughters on religious grounds from co-ed swimming , sports and biology classes .
thwarting integration efforts ?
the issue has turned into a potent flashpoint in german schools struggling with muslim integration .
“ it ’ s a difficult situation , ” said marion berning , director of the rixdorfer primary school , one of the largest in berlin ’ s neukölln district , where girls with headscarves are a common sight .
“ we have muslim girls who say they don ’ t want to swim with the boys .
it ’ s obvious the parents exert pressure on them , but they -lrb- the parents -rrb- have to accept that co-education is part of german schools . "
at another school in berlin 's turkish- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex is " absolutely taboo at home . " dominated kreuzberg district , principal annette spieler worries muslim girls exempted from biology class are missing out on lessons vital to teenagers .
" when it comes to sex education , it ’ s shocking how little the muslim students know about the topic .
it ’ s absolutely taboo in their homes , ” she said .
resurgent muslim identity in the absence of a common law governing the issue , some schools have attempted to appease muslim parents by offering gender-segregated biology and swimming classes , discussing the issue with them in parent-teacher meetings or allowing muslim girls to wear loose-fitting clothing during sports . but that hasn ’ t stopped some muslim parents from appealing to the courts to enforce their religious rights .
in 1993 , a landmark ruling by germany ’ s federal administrative court allowed a 13-year-old turkish girl to be exempted from co-ed sport lessons if the school failed to proved gender-segregated sports class .
the girl ’ s father argued that his daughter would face a moral conflict if she was forced to do sports with boys in tight-fitting clothes .
in another instance , a court in münster in 2002 exempted a muslim girl in the 10th grade from a class trip after her parents argued their faith forbade their daughter to stay overnight outside of the house without the company of a male relative .
the court cases point to what islam experts say is the growing need within the muslim community to assert themselves in western society .

german schools are increasingly grappling with cases of muslim girls pushing for exemption from co-ed swimming and sports on religious grounds , sorely testing the country 's ability to integrate its muslim population . with her flawless german , good grades and ambition to study towards a career , ayse yilmaz seems a model of muslim integration at her berlin high school .
she considers herself part of a growing group of young , educated muslims who have " a modern understanding of islam , " as the 18-year-old student of turkish-kurdish origin puts it .
but yilmaz - whose name has been changed here to protect her anonymit - has angered school authorities by refusing to take off her headscarf during sports class and going on school trips with her classmates .
“ i felt uncomfortable about the alcohol , partying and fooling around that takes place there , ” said yilmaz of the trips . as for her headscarf , yilmaz says , " there is no question of me taking it off just for sports or something .
it 's just part of me . " yilmaz ’ s arguments are becoming familiar ones to school authorities across germany , as muslim students and their parents clash with schools over whether the tenants of their faith should be allowed to bend the rules of germany 's secular school system .
though no reliable statistics are available , school authorities across the country say that an increasing number of muslim parents are demanding exemptions for their daughters on religious grounds from co-ed swimming , sports and biology classes .
thwarting integration efforts ?
the issue has turned into a potent flashpoint in german schools struggling with muslim integration .
“ it ’ s a difficult situation , ” said marion berning , director of the rixdorfer primary school , one of the largest in berlin ’ s neukölln district , where girls with headscarves are a common sight .
“ we have muslim girls who say they don ’ t want to swim with the boys .
it ’ s obvious the parents exert pressure on them , but they -lrb- the parents -rrb- have to accept that co-education is part of german schools . "
at another school in berlin 's turkish- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex is " absolutely taboo at home . " dominated kreuzberg district , principal annette spieler worries muslim girls exempted from biology class are missing out on lessons vital to teenagers .
" when it comes to sex education , it ’ s shocking how little the muslim students know about the topic .
it ’ s absolutely taboo in their homes , ” she said .
resurgent muslim identity in the absence of a common law governing the issue , some schools have attempted to appease muslim parents by offering gender-segregated biology and swimming classes , discussing the issue with them in parent-teacher meetings or allowing muslim girls to wear loose-fitting clothing during sports . but that hasn ’ t stopped some muslim parents from appealing to the courts to enforce their religious rights .
in 1993 , a landmark ruling by germany ’ s federal administrative court allowed a 13-year-old turkish girl to be exempted from co-ed sport lessons if the school failed to proved gender-segregated sports class .
the girl ’ s father argued that his daughter would face a moral conflict if she was forced to do sports with boys in tight-fitting clothes .
in another instance , a court in münster in 2002 exempted a muslim girl in the 10th grade from a class trip after her parents argued their faith forbade their daughter to stay overnight outside of the house without the company of a male relative .
the court cases point to what islam experts say is the growing need within the muslim community to assert themselves in western society .
“ the message is ‘ we ’ re here , we ’ re proud , we ’ re going to live our religion and not going to hide ourselves anymore ’ , ” said riem spielhaus , an islamic studies lecturer at berlin ’ s humboldt university .

though no reliable statistics are available , school authorities across the country say that an increasing number of muslim parents are demanding exemptions for their daughters on religious grounds from co-ed swimming , sports and biology classes .
thwarting integration efforts ?
the issue has turned into a potent flashpoint in german schools struggling with muslim integration .
“ it ’ s a difficult situation , ” said marion berning , director of the rixdorfer primary school , one of the largest in berlin ’ s neukölln district , where girls with headscarves are a common sight .
“ we have muslim girls who say they don ’ t want to swim with the boys .
it ’ s obvious the parents exert pressure on them , but they -lrb- the parents -rrb- have to accept that co-education is part of german schools . "
at another school in berlin 's turkish- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex is " absolutely taboo at home . " dominated kreuzberg district , principal annette spieler worries muslim girls exempted from biology class are missing out on lessons vital to teenagers .
" when it comes to sex education , it ’ s shocking how little the muslim students know about the topic .
it ’ s absolutely taboo in their homes , ” she said .
resurgent muslim identity in the absence of a common law governing the issue , some schools have attempted to appease muslim parents by offering gender-segregated biology and swimming classes , discussing the issue with them in parent-teacher meetings or allowing muslim girls to wear loose-fitting clothing during sports . but that hasn ’ t stopped some muslim parents from appealing to the courts to enforce their religious rights .
in 1993 , a landmark ruling by germany ’ s federal administrative court allowed a 13-year-old turkish girl to be exempted from co-ed sport lessons if the school failed to proved gender-segregated sports class .
the girl ’ s father argued that his daughter would face a moral conflict if she was forced to do sports with boys in tight-fitting clothes .
in another instance , a court in münster in 2002 exempted a muslim girl in the 10th grade from a class trip after her parents argued their faith forbade their daughter to stay overnight outside of the house without the company of a male relative .
the court cases point to what islam experts say is the growing need within the muslim community to assert themselves in western society .
“ the message is ‘ we ’ re here , we ’ re proud , we ’ re going to live our religion and not going to hide ourselves anymore ’ , ” said riem spielhaus , an islamic studies lecturer at berlin ’ s humboldt university .

german beer : worth a scientific look business -pipe- 23.04.2004 crying in your beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german beer market is firmly in foreign hands .
german beer day on april 23 celebrates germany 's famous reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law , which was established in 1516 .
unfortunately the country 's proud brewing tradition has n't helped the industry compete globally . germans love beer , there 's no doubt about that .
nearly every town or region has its own particular take on what is affectionately called " liquid bread " here .
the reinheitsgebot , set down by bavarian duke wilhelm iv , allows beer to be made from only hops , barley and water .
it 's a guideline that has served brewers who care about their product well over the centuries . making beer may not have changed radically over the past 500 years , but the beer industry certainly has , which is today big business on a global scale .
and that 's why german brewers have little reason to raise a mug of their favorite amber suds in celebration this friday of german beer day . the country 's fractionalized and provincial attitudes towards brewing - according to germany 's federal statistics office , there were 1,268 registered breweries in 2003 - has led to the creation of a mindboggling variety of beer . takeover targets but it has also made brewers easy targets for large foreign beer conglomerates looking to snap up bargains with growth potential .
in particular , belgium 's interbrew has been actively snapping up german brands , including the proud bavarian house spaten , which had been independent for over 600 years .
interbrew also owns germany 's ubiquitous beck 's beer . dutch brewer heineken started the raid on german beer makers in 2001 by buying half of munich-based schörghuber-gruppe , which makes paulaner , hacker-pschorr and kulmbacher beers .
that encouraged interbrew to go on an acquisition spree that started with beck 's and quickly added diebels and hasseröder before crowning things off last year with spaten .
not to be left out of the action , danish group carlsberg took over the hamburg-based holsten brewer at the being of 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many german beer aficionados , having their favorite drink sold off to the makers of what they consider inferior brews is humiliating , but spaten head jobst kayser-eichberg places blame squarely with those in the german brewing industry . " no global vision , provincial thinking , fantasies about staying independent and also pure vanity on the part of the german beer barons hindered mergers that could have led to a globally expanding german brewer , " kayser-eichberg told the associated press . consumption declining he also noted declining beer consumption in germany as a reason why local brewers will need a strong international partner to help increase export sales .
according to the munich-based ifo institute , germans drank only 118 liters per capita last year , compared to 122 liters in 2002 .
back in 1997 the germans swigged down on average 131 liters .
that means germans are now only the third biggest beer drinkers in europe , falling behind the czechs and the irish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite all the problems , the biggest insult for german beer lovers is perhaps yet to come .
during the 2006 world cup , which germany is hosting , german beer is likely to be banned from the country 's stadiums because u.s. beer giant anheuser-busch has a sponsoring agreement with soccer 's international governing body , fifa . on the brighter side , at least germans probably do n't have to fear that interbrew or heineken will try to supplant regional favorites with mass-produced foreign beers .
michael dietzsch , head of the second largest still german-run brewing concern bitburger , believes peoples ' local preferences are too strongly set for that . " that 's why foreign investors are buying german market brands and are n't trying to sell their own here , " dietzsch told the german news agency dpa . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's " bud " or nothing at world cup 2006 want to throw back a nice bavarian brew while watching a world cup match in germany in 2006 ?

as media organizations around the world continue to react to the screening of pictures showing princess diana dying in the wreckage of her car , the german journalist 's federation warned members not to show the images . the german journalist 's federation -lrb- djv -rrb- has joined the growing number of international press associations in condemning the use of images screened on u.s. television on wednesday which allegedly showed diana , princess of wales , as she lay dying in the wreck of her mercedes in a paris underpass . the broadcasting of the pictures , as part of an investigative report into the princess 's death in 1997 in the cbs show " 48 hours investigates " , was " not responsible journalism , " according to djv chairperson michael konken who warned the german media not to follow suit and show the images . konken called the decision by cbs " an unambiguous offence against the press code " during a press conference in berlin on thursday and stressed that human dignity stands above the need of viewers and readers for information .
he also warned that any use of the images as part of articles condemning the cbs report would be just as offensive . breaking taboos should not be a marketing tool konken also demanded that the policy of breaking taboos should not be employed as a calculated marketing instrument by publishing companies wanting to improve circulation or viewing figures .
the djv chairman concluded by saying any german organization pursuing such an action would face a reprimand from the german press council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess diana and dodi fayed died in a car crash in paris .
the black and white photos of diana and her lover dodi al fayed were taken shortly after the accident on august 31 , 1997 .
in the images , an unconscious diana is being attended to by a doctor who attempts to resuscitate her through the wreckage of her limousine .
two hours later , diana died in a paris clinic .
al fayed and the driver henri paul were also killed .
the pictures are part of a confidential 4,000-page accident report compiled by french investigators . cbs defends journalistic context on thursday , cbs spokesperson sandra genelius once again defended the decision to show the pictures as the outrage spread around the globe .
the spokesperson reiterated that the pictures were shown in the context of an interview with the doctor seen treating diana at the time as illustrations to accompany his statements .
the pictures were shown " in a journalistic context - an examination of the medical treatment given diana after the crash , " genelius said . the spokesperson added that it was not the intention of cbs for the pictures to be seen outside the united states .
however , there have been rumors that the pictures had been offered to a number of newspapers before cbs secured the images and aired them . the statements from the u.s. broadcaster in the immediate wake of the show on wednesday night did little to placate the press in britain where diana remains an icon almost seven years after her death .
the fact that someone had crossed the line and showed the first pictures of the dying princess caused outrage in the british press . british press united in outrage the guardian wrote that cbs had " plumb new depths of prurience in the princess diana industry " while the tabloid daily mirror called the airing of the pictures " hideous , horrible and offensive " and the sun described them as " horrific . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions from public figures mined the same vein .
while clarence house , the office of diana 's former husband , prince charles , and her two sons , declined to comment , royal-watchers expressed concern for the princess ' sons william , 21 -lrb- photo -rrb- and harry , 19 .
" it 's going to be painful for william and harry , " former buckingham palace spokesman dickie arbiter told bbc radio .
" they 're young men now .
they 're going to have to live with it for the rest of their lives . " buckingham palace , which speaks on behalf of diana 's sons , said it would not comment on the cbs pictures , but did not hide its displeasure .
" we 've made our opinion very clear in the past on this sort of thing and we wo n't be commenting specifically . "
british prime minister tony blair also expressed his distaste .
asked about the matter at his monthly news conference , blair told reporters : " i think everyone finds it distasteful that there are pictures that can cause distress to the family . "
princess 's family sickened by images a brief statement released on behalf of diana 's brother said " lord spencer and his family are shocked and sickened by cbs ' actions . "
dodi fayed 's father , mohamed al fayed , said cbs had behaved in " disgraceful and insensitive " manner .
" cbs obviously do n't care about the appalling effect of showing images of murder victims , " said fayed , who has long insisted that diana and his son were murdered .

as media organizations around the world continue to react to the screening of pictures showing princess diana dying in the wreckage of her car , the german journalist 's federation warned members not to show the images . the german journalist 's federation -lrb- djv -rrb- has joined the growing number of international press associations in condemning the use of images screened on u.s. television on wednesday which allegedly showed diana , princess of wales , as she lay dying in the wreck of her mercedes in a paris underpass . the broadcasting of the pictures , as part of an investigative report into the princess 's death in 1997 in the cbs show " 48 hours investigates " , was " not responsible journalism , " according to djv chairperson michael konken who warned the german media not to follow suit and show the images . konken called the decision by cbs " an unambiguous offence against the press code " during a press conference in berlin on thursday and stressed that human dignity stands above the need of viewers and readers for information .
he also warned that any use of the images as part of articles condemning the cbs report would be just as offensive . breaking taboos should not be a marketing tool konken also demanded that the policy of breaking taboos should not be employed as a calculated marketing instrument by publishing companies wanting to improve circulation or viewing figures .
the djv chairman concluded by saying any german organization pursuing such an action would face a reprimand from the german press council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess diana and dodi fayed died in a car crash in paris .
the black and white photos of diana and her lover dodi al fayed were taken shortly after the accident on august 31 , 1997 .
in the images , an unconscious diana is being attended to by a doctor who attempts to resuscitate her through the wreckage of her limousine .
two hours later , diana died in a paris clinic .
al fayed and the driver henri paul were also killed .
the pictures are part of a confidential 4,000-page accident report compiled by french investigators . cbs defends journalistic context on thursday , cbs spokesperson sandra genelius once again defended the decision to show the pictures as the outrage spread around the globe .
the spokesperson reiterated that the pictures were shown in the context of an interview with the doctor seen treating diana at the time as illustrations to accompany his statements .
the pictures were shown " in a journalistic context - an examination of the medical treatment given diana after the crash , " genelius said . the spokesperson added that it was not the intention of cbs for the pictures to be seen outside the united states .
however , there have been rumors that the pictures had been offered to a number of newspapers before cbs secured the images and aired them . the statements from the u.s. broadcaster in the immediate wake of the show on wednesday night did little to placate the press in britain where diana remains an icon almost seven years after her death .
the fact that someone had crossed the line and showed the first pictures of the dying princess caused outrage in the british press . british press united in outrage the guardian wrote that cbs had " plumb new depths of prurience in the princess diana industry " while the tabloid daily mirror called the airing of the pictures " hideous , horrible and offensive " and the sun described them as " horrific . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions from public figures mined the same vein .
while clarence house , the office of diana 's former husband , prince charles , and her two sons , declined to comment , royal-watchers expressed concern for the princess ' sons william , 21 -lrb- photo -rrb- and harry , 19 .
" it 's going to be painful for william and harry , " former buckingham palace spokesman dickie arbiter told bbc radio .
" they 're young men now .
they 're going to have to live with it for the rest of their lives . " buckingham palace , which speaks on behalf of diana 's sons , said it would not comment on the cbs pictures , but did not hide its displeasure .
" we 've made our opinion very clear in the past on this sort of thing and we wo n't be commenting specifically . "

german beer : worth a scientific look business -pipe- 23.04.2004 crying in your beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german beer market is firmly in foreign hands .
german beer day on april 23 celebrates germany 's famous reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law , which was established in 1516 .
unfortunately the country 's proud brewing tradition has n't helped the industry compete globally . germans love beer , there 's no doubt about that .
nearly every town or region has its own particular take on what is affectionately called " liquid bread " here .
the reinheitsgebot , set down by bavarian duke wilhelm iv , allows beer to be made from only hops , barley and water .
it 's a guideline that has served brewers who care about their product well over the centuries . making beer may not have changed radically over the past 500 years , but the beer industry certainly has , which is today big business on a global scale .
and that 's why german brewers have little reason to raise a mug of their favorite amber suds in celebration this friday of german beer day . the country 's fractionalized and provincial attitudes towards brewing - according to germany 's federal statistics office , there were 1,268 registered breweries in 2003 - has led to the creation of a mindboggling variety of beer . takeover targets but it has also made brewers easy targets for large foreign beer conglomerates looking to snap up bargains with growth potential .
in particular , belgium 's interbrew has been actively snapping up german brands , including the proud bavarian house spaten , which had been independent for over 600 years .
interbrew also owns germany 's ubiquitous beck 's beer . dutch brewer heineken started the raid on german beer makers in 2001 by buying half of munich-based schörghuber-gruppe , which makes paulaner , hacker-pschorr and kulmbacher beers .
that encouraged interbrew to go on an acquisition spree that started with beck 's and quickly added diebels and hasseröder before crowning things off last year with spaten .
not to be left out of the action , danish group carlsberg took over the hamburg-based holsten brewer at the being of 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many german beer aficionados , having their favorite drink sold off to the makers of what they consider inferior brews is humiliating , but spaten head jobst kayser-eichberg places blame squarely with those in the german brewing industry . " no global vision , provincial thinking , fantasies about staying independent and also pure vanity on the part of the german beer barons hindered mergers that could have led to a globally expanding german brewer , " kayser-eichberg told the associated press . consumption declining he also noted declining beer consumption in germany as a reason why local brewers will need a strong international partner to help increase export sales .
according to the munich-based ifo institute , germans drank only 118 liters per capita last year , compared to 122 liters in 2002 .
back in 1997 the germans swigged down on average 131 liters .
that means germans are now only the third biggest beer drinkers in europe , falling behind the czechs and the irish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite all the problems , the biggest insult for german beer lovers is perhaps yet to come .
during the 2006 world cup , which germany is hosting , german beer is likely to be banned from the country 's stadiums because u.s. beer giant anheuser-busch has a sponsoring agreement with soccer 's international governing body , fifa . on the brighter side , at least germans probably do n't have to fear that interbrew or heineken will try to supplant regional favorites with mass-produced foreign beers .
michael dietzsch , head of the second largest still german-run brewing concern bitburger , believes peoples ' local preferences are too strongly set for that .

according to the munich-based ifo institute , germans drank only 118 liters per capita last year , compared to 122 liters in 2002 .

german schools are increasingly grappling with cases of muslim girls pushing for exemption from co-ed swimming and sports on religious grounds , sorely testing the country 's ability to integrate its muslim population . with her flawless german , good grades and ambition to study towards a career , ayse yilmaz seems a model of muslim integration at her berlin high school .
she considers herself part of a growing group of young , educated muslims who have " a modern understanding of islam , " as the 18-year-old student of turkish-kurdish origin puts it .
but yilmaz - whose name has been changed here to protect her anonymit - has angered school authorities by refusing to take off her headscarf during sports class and going on school trips with her classmates .
“ i felt uncomfortable about the alcohol , partying and fooling around that takes place there , ” said yilmaz of the trips . as for her headscarf , yilmaz says , " there is no question of me taking it off just for sports or something .
it 's just part of me . " yilmaz ’ s arguments are becoming familiar ones to school authorities across germany , as muslim students and their parents clash with schools over whether the tenants of their faith should be allowed to bend the rules of germany 's secular school system .
though no reliable statistics are available , school authorities across the country say that an increasing number of muslim parents are demanding exemptions for their daughters on religious grounds from co-ed swimming , sports and biology classes .
thwarting integration efforts ?
the issue has turned into a potent flashpoint in german schools struggling with muslim integration .
“ it ’ s a difficult situation , ” said marion berning , director of the rixdorfer primary school , one of the largest in berlin ’ s neukölln district , where girls with headscarves are a common sight .
“ we have muslim girls who say they don ’ t want to swim with the boys .
it ’ s obvious the parents exert pressure on them , but they -lrb- the parents -rrb- have to accept that co-education is part of german schools . "
at another school in berlin 's turkish- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex is " absolutely taboo at home . " dominated kreuzberg district , principal annette spieler worries muslim girls exempted from biology class are missing out on lessons vital to teenagers .
" when it comes to sex education , it ’ s shocking how little the muslim students know about the topic .
it ’ s absolutely taboo in their homes , ” she said .
resurgent muslim identity in the absence of a common law governing the issue , some schools have attempted to appease muslim parents by offering gender-segregated biology and swimming classes , discussing the issue with them in parent-teacher meetings or allowing muslim girls to wear loose-fitting clothing during sports . but that hasn ’ t stopped some muslim parents from appealing to the courts to enforce their religious rights .
in 1993 , a landmark ruling by germany ’ s federal administrative court allowed a 13-year-old turkish girl to be exempted from co-ed sport lessons if the school failed to proved gender-segregated sports class .
the girl ’ s father argued that his daughter would face a moral conflict if she was forced to do sports with boys in tight-fitting clothes .
in another instance , a court in münster in 2002 exempted a muslim girl in the 10th grade from a class trip after her parents argued their faith forbade their daughter to stay overnight outside of the house without the company of a male relative .
the court cases point to what islam experts say is the growing need within the muslim community to assert themselves in western society .
“ the message is ‘ we ’ re here , we ’ re proud , we ’ re going to live our religion and not going to hide ourselves anymore ’ , ” said riem spielhaus , an islamic studies lecturer at berlin ’ s humboldt university .

german schools are increasingly grappling with cases of muslim girls pushing for exemption from co-ed swimming and sports on religious grounds , sorely testing the country 's ability to integrate its muslim population . with her flawless german , good grades and ambition to study towards a career , ayse yilmaz seems a model of muslim integration at her berlin high school .
she considers herself part of a growing group of young , educated muslims who have " a modern understanding of islam , " as the 18-year-old student of turkish-kurdish origin puts it .
but yilmaz - whose name has been changed here to protect her anonymit - has angered school authorities by refusing to take off her headscarf during sports class and going on school trips with her classmates .
“ i felt uncomfortable about the alcohol , partying and fooling around that takes place there , ” said yilmaz of the trips . as for her headscarf , yilmaz says , " there is no question of me taking it off just for sports or something .
it 's just part of me . " yilmaz ’ s arguments are becoming familiar ones to school authorities across germany , as muslim students and their parents clash with schools over whether the tenants of their faith should be allowed to bend the rules of germany 's secular school system .
though no reliable statistics are available , school authorities across the country say that an increasing number of muslim parents are demanding exemptions for their daughters on religious grounds from co-ed swimming , sports and biology classes .
thwarting integration efforts ?
the issue has turned into a potent flashpoint in german schools struggling with muslim integration .
“ it ’ s a difficult situation , ” said marion berning , director of the rixdorfer primary school , one of the largest in berlin ’ s neukölln district , where girls with headscarves are a common sight .
“ we have muslim girls who say they don ’ t want to swim with the boys .
it ’ s obvious the parents exert pressure on them , but they -lrb- the parents -rrb- have to accept that co-education is part of german schools . "
at another school in berlin 's turkish- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex is " absolutely taboo at home . " dominated kreuzberg district , principal annette spieler worries muslim girls exempted from biology class are missing out on lessons vital to teenagers .
" when it comes to sex education , it ’ s shocking how little the muslim students know about the topic .
it ’ s absolutely taboo in their homes , ” she said .
resurgent muslim identity in the absence of a common law governing the issue , some schools have attempted to appease muslim parents by offering gender-segregated biology and swimming classes , discussing the issue with them in parent-teacher meetings or allowing muslim girls to wear loose-fitting clothing during sports . but that hasn ’ t stopped some muslim parents from appealing to the courts to enforce their religious rights .
in 1993 , a landmark ruling by germany ’ s federal administrative court allowed a 13-year-old turkish girl to be exempted from co-ed sport lessons if the school failed to proved gender-segregated sports class .
the girl ’ s father argued that his daughter would face a moral conflict if she was forced to do sports with boys in tight-fitting clothes .
in another instance , a court in münster in 2002 exempted a muslim girl in the 10th grade from a class trip after her parents argued their faith forbade their daughter to stay overnight outside of the house without the company of a male relative .
the court cases point to what islam experts say is the growing need within the muslim community to assert themselves in western society .
“ the message is ‘ we ’ re here , we ’ re proud , we ’ re going to live our religion and not going to hide ourselves anymore ’ , ” said riem spielhaus , an islamic studies lecturer at berlin ’ s humboldt university .

german schools are increasingly grappling with cases of muslim girls pushing for exemption from co-ed swimming and sports on religious grounds , sorely testing the country 's ability to integrate its muslim population . with her flawless german , good grades and ambition to study towards a career , ayse yilmaz seems a model of muslim integration at her berlin high school .

but yilmaz - whose name has been changed here to protect her anonymit - has angered school authorities by refusing to take off her headscarf during sports class and going on school trips with her classmates .
“ i felt uncomfortable about the alcohol , partying and fooling around that takes place there , ” said yilmaz of the trips . as for her headscarf , yilmaz says , " there is no question of me taking it off just for sports or something .

in another instance , a court in münster in 2002 exempted a muslim girl in the 10th grade from a class trip after her parents argued their faith forbade their daughter to stay overnight outside of the house without the company of a male relative .
the court cases point to what islam experts say is the growing need within the muslim community to assert themselves in western society .
“ the message is ‘ we ’ re here , we ’ re proud , we ’ re going to live our religion and not going to hide ourselves anymore ’ , ” said riem spielhaus , an islamic studies lecturer at berlin ’ s humboldt university .

german schools are increasingly grappling with cases of muslim girls pushing for exemption from co-ed swimming and sports on religious grounds , sorely testing the country 's ability to integrate its muslim population . with her flawless german , good grades and ambition to study towards a career , ayse yilmaz seems a model of muslim integration at her berlin high school .
she considers herself part of a growing group of young , educated muslims who have " a modern understanding of islam , " as the 18-year-old student of turkish-kurdish origin puts it .
but yilmaz - whose name has been changed here to protect her anonymit - has angered school authorities by refusing to take off her headscarf during sports class and going on school trips with her classmates .
“ i felt uncomfortable about the alcohol , partying and fooling around that takes place there , ” said yilmaz of the trips . as for her headscarf , yilmaz says , " there is no question of me taking it off just for sports or something .
it 's just part of me . " yilmaz ’ s arguments are becoming familiar ones to school authorities across germany , as muslim students and their parents clash with schools over whether the tenants of their faith should be allowed to bend the rules of germany 's secular school system .
though no reliable statistics are available , school authorities across the country say that an increasing number of muslim parents are demanding exemptions for their daughters on religious grounds from co-ed swimming , sports and biology classes .
thwarting integration efforts ?
the issue has turned into a potent flashpoint in german schools struggling with muslim integration .
“ it ’ s a difficult situation , ” said marion berning , director of the rixdorfer primary school , one of the largest in berlin ’ s neukölln district , where girls with headscarves are a common sight .
“ we have muslim girls who say they don ’ t want to swim with the boys .
it ’ s obvious the parents exert pressure on them , but they -lrb- the parents -rrb- have to accept that co-education is part of german schools . "

" when it comes to sex education , it ’ s shocking how little the muslim students know about the topic .
it ’ s absolutely taboo in their homes , ” she said .
resurgent muslim identity in the absence of a common law governing the issue , some schools have attempted to appease muslim parents by offering gender-segregated biology and swimming classes , discussing the issue with them in parent-teacher meetings or allowing muslim girls to wear loose-fitting clothing during sports . but that hasn ’ t stopped some muslim parents from appealing to the courts to enforce their religious rights .

german schools are increasingly grappling with cases of muslim girls pushing for exemption from co-ed swimming and sports on religious grounds , sorely testing the country 's ability to integrate its muslim population . with her flawless german , good grades and ambition to study towards a career , ayse yilmaz seems a model of muslim integration at her berlin high school .
she considers herself part of a growing group of young , educated muslims who have " a modern understanding of islam , " as the 18-year-old student of turkish-kurdish origin puts it .
but yilmaz - whose name has been changed here to protect her anonymit - has angered school authorities by refusing to take off her headscarf during sports class and going on school trips with her classmates .
“ i felt uncomfortable about the alcohol , partying and fooling around that takes place there , ” said yilmaz of the trips . as for her headscarf , yilmaz says , " there is no question of me taking it off just for sports or something .
it 's just part of me . " yilmaz ’ s arguments are becoming familiar ones to school authorities across germany , as muslim students and their parents clash with schools over whether the tenants of their faith should be allowed to bend the rules of germany 's secular school system .
though no reliable statistics are available , school authorities across the country say that an increasing number of muslim parents are demanding exemptions for their daughters on religious grounds from co-ed swimming , sports and biology classes .
thwarting integration efforts ?
the issue has turned into a potent flashpoint in german schools struggling with muslim integration .
“ it ’ s a difficult situation , ” said marion berning , director of the rixdorfer primary school , one of the largest in berlin ’ s neukölln district , where girls with headscarves are a common sight .
“ we have muslim girls who say they don ’ t want to swim with the boys .
it ’ s obvious the parents exert pressure on them , but they -lrb- the parents -rrb- have to accept that co-education is part of german schools . "
at another school in berlin 's turkish- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex is " absolutely taboo at home . " dominated kreuzberg district , principal annette spieler worries muslim girls exempted from biology class are missing out on lessons vital to teenagers .
" when it comes to sex education , it ’ s shocking how little the muslim students know about the topic .
it ’ s absolutely taboo in their homes , ” she said .
resurgent muslim identity in the absence of a common law governing the issue , some schools have attempted to appease muslim parents by offering gender-segregated biology and swimming classes , discussing the issue with them in parent-teacher meetings or allowing muslim girls to wear loose-fitting clothing during sports . but that hasn ’ t stopped some muslim parents from appealing to the courts to enforce their religious rights .
in 1993 , a landmark ruling by germany ’ s federal administrative court allowed a 13-year-old turkish girl to be exempted from co-ed sport lessons if the school failed to proved gender-segregated sports class .
the girl ’ s father argued that his daughter would face a moral conflict if she was forced to do sports with boys in tight-fitting clothes .
in another instance , a court in münster in 2002 exempted a muslim girl in the 10th grade from a class trip after her parents argued their faith forbade their daughter to stay overnight outside of the house without the company of a male relative .
the court cases point to what islam experts say is the growing need within the muslim community to assert themselves in western society .
“ the message is ‘ we ’ re here , we ’ re proud , we ’ re going to live our religion and not going to hide ourselves anymore ’ , ” said riem spielhaus , an islamic studies lecturer at berlin ’ s humboldt university .

german schools are increasingly grappling with cases of muslim girls pushing for exemption from co-ed swimming and sports on religious grounds , sorely testing the country 's ability to integrate its muslim population . with her flawless german , good grades and ambition to study towards a career , ayse yilmaz seems a model of muslim integration at her berlin high school .
she considers herself part of a growing group of young , educated muslims who have " a modern understanding of islam , " as the 18-year-old student of turkish-kurdish origin puts it .
but yilmaz - whose name has been changed here to protect her anonymit - has angered school authorities by refusing to take off her headscarf during sports class and going on school trips with her classmates .
“ i felt uncomfortable about the alcohol , partying and fooling around that takes place there , ” said yilmaz of the trips . as for her headscarf , yilmaz says , " there is no question of me taking it off just for sports or something .
it 's just part of me . " yilmaz ’ s arguments are becoming familiar ones to school authorities across germany , as muslim students and their parents clash with schools over whether the tenants of their faith should be allowed to bend the rules of germany 's secular school system .
though no reliable statistics are available , school authorities across the country say that an increasing number of muslim parents are demanding exemptions for their daughters on religious grounds from co-ed swimming , sports and biology classes .
thwarting integration efforts ?
the issue has turned into a potent flashpoint in german schools struggling with muslim integration .
“ it ’ s a difficult situation , ” said marion berning , director of the rixdorfer primary school , one of the largest in berlin ’ s neukölln district , where girls with headscarves are a common sight .
“ we have muslim girls who say they don ’ t want to swim with the boys .
it ’ s obvious the parents exert pressure on them , but they -lrb- the parents -rrb- have to accept that co-education is part of german schools . "
at another school in berlin 's turkish- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex is " absolutely taboo at home . " dominated kreuzberg district , principal annette spieler worries muslim girls exempted from biology class are missing out on lessons vital to teenagers .
" when it comes to sex education , it ’ s shocking how little the muslim students know about the topic .
it ’ s absolutely taboo in their homes , ” she said .
resurgent muslim identity in the absence of a common law governing the issue , some schools have attempted to appease muslim parents by offering gender-segregated biology and swimming classes , discussing the issue with them in parent-teacher meetings or allowing muslim girls to wear loose-fitting clothing during sports . but that hasn ’ t stopped some muslim parents from appealing to the courts to enforce their religious rights .
in 1993 , a landmark ruling by germany ’ s federal administrative court allowed a 13-year-old turkish girl to be exempted from co-ed sport lessons if the school failed to proved gender-segregated sports class .
the girl ’ s father argued that his daughter would face a moral conflict if she was forced to do sports with boys in tight-fitting clothes .
in another instance , a court in münster in 2002 exempted a muslim girl in the 10th grade from a class trip after her parents argued their faith forbade their daughter to stay overnight outside of the house without the company of a male relative .
the court cases point to what islam experts say is the growing need within the muslim community to assert themselves in western society .
“ the message is ‘ we ’ re here , we ’ re proud , we ’ re going to live our religion and not going to hide ourselves anymore ’ , ” said riem spielhaus , an islamic studies lecturer at berlin ’ s humboldt university .

in addition , making exceptions for muslim students amounts to giving preferential treatment to one religion and could lead to their isolation , said turgut hüner .
the chairman of the turkish parents organization in berlin-brandenburg believes the trend among muslim parents to exempt their children from class has been fueled by the introduction of islamic religious classes in german schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what is being taught in mosques and the koranic schools they sponsor ?
while learning their own language and religion is vital to second-generation muslims living in the country , hüner warned that it ’ s important to know just what is being taught under the guise of religious instruction .
he criticized berlin school authorities for allowing organizations such as the strongly-conservative islamic federation , which is on german law enforcement 's watch list , to impart islamic instruction in 28 schools in the german capital .
“ it ’ s a slippery slope , " said hüner .
" that ’ s when some parents get old-fashioned ideas into their hands and decide not to send their daughters to biology or swimming class . "
living in a muslim virtual world indeed , the islamic federation ran into trouble recently with the berlin education ministry for allegedly handing out application forms printed from the internet to muslim parents to get their daughters exempted from co-educative classes .
a look at the virtual world shows just how easy that is .
a web site called muslim-markt.de run by two muslim brothers offers muslims links and information to muslim doctors , lawyers , hairdressers , companies and so on .
the site " muslimrecht , " based in hamburg , offers detailed moral and legal guidelines to muslim parents wanting to free their daughters from co-ed sports and swimming lessons .
“ if you don ’ t stand up for your rights , it won ’ t just become a disadvantage to you , but will also lead to a restriction of rights for the coming generation of students , ” it warns its readers .
headscarf equals " problem child " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate is simmering while the debate simmers , some experts say it also reflects german teachers ’ poor understanding of the delicate integration process underway .
“ many have no idea how difficult it can be for a muslim girl caught between her traditional parents and a more permissive western society where she ’ s growing up , ” said spielhaus .
yilmaz knows that only too well .
“ as a muslim girl with a headscarf you ’ re immediately labeled ‘ dumb ’ , " she said .

german beer : worth a scientific look business -pipe- 23.04.2004 crying in your beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german beer market is firmly in foreign hands .
german beer day on april 23 celebrates germany 's famous reinheitsgebot , or beer purity law , which was established in 1516 .
unfortunately the country 's proud brewing tradition has n't helped the industry compete globally . germans love beer , there 's no doubt about that .
nearly every town or region has its own particular take on what is affectionately called " liquid bread " here .
the reinheitsgebot , set down by bavarian duke wilhelm iv , allows beer to be made from only hops , barley and water .
it 's a guideline that has served brewers who care about their product well over the centuries . making beer may not have changed radically over the past 500 years , but the beer industry certainly has , which is today big business on a global scale .
and that 's why german brewers have little reason to raise a mug of their favorite amber suds in celebration this friday of german beer day . the country 's fractionalized and provincial attitudes towards brewing - according to germany 's federal statistics office , there were 1,268 registered breweries in 2003 - has led to the creation of a mindboggling variety of beer . takeover targets but it has also made brewers easy targets for large foreign beer conglomerates looking to snap up bargains with growth potential .
in particular , belgium 's interbrew has been actively snapping up german brands , including the proud bavarian house spaten , which had been independent for over 600 years .
interbrew also owns germany 's ubiquitous beck 's beer . dutch brewer heineken started the raid on german beer makers in 2001 by buying half of munich-based schörghuber-gruppe , which makes paulaner , hacker-pschorr and kulmbacher beers .
that encouraged interbrew to go on an acquisition spree that started with beck 's and quickly added diebels and hasseröder before crowning things off last year with spaten .
not to be left out of the action , danish group carlsberg took over the hamburg-based holsten brewer at the being of 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many german beer aficionados , having their favorite drink sold off to the makers of what they consider inferior brews is humiliating , but spaten head jobst kayser-eichberg places blame squarely with those in the german brewing industry . " no global vision , provincial thinking , fantasies about staying independent and also pure vanity on the part of the german beer barons hindered mergers that could have led to a globally expanding german brewer , " kayser-eichberg told the associated press . consumption declining he also noted declining beer consumption in germany as a reason why local brewers will need a strong international partner to help increase export sales .
according to the munich-based ifo institute , germans drank only 118 liters per capita last year , compared to 122 liters in 2002 .
back in 1997 the germans swigged down on average 131 liters .
that means germans are now only the third biggest beer drinkers in europe , falling behind the czechs and the irish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite all the problems , the biggest insult for german beer lovers is perhaps yet to come .
during the 2006 world cup , which germany is hosting , german beer is likely to be banned from the country 's stadiums because u.s. beer giant anheuser-busch has a sponsoring agreement with soccer 's international governing body , fifa . on the brighter side , at least germans probably do n't have to fear that interbrew or heineken will try to supplant regional favorites with mass-produced foreign beers .
michael dietzsch , head of the second largest still german-run brewing concern bitburger , believes peoples ' local preferences are too strongly set for that . " that 's why foreign investors are buying german market brands and are n't trying to sell their own here , " dietzsch told the german news agency dpa . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's " bud " or nothing at world cup 2006 want to throw back a nice bavarian brew while watching a world cup match in germany in 2006 ?

german schools are increasingly grappling with cases of muslim girls pushing for exemption from co-ed swimming and sports on religious grounds , sorely testing the country 's ability to integrate its muslim population . with her flawless german , good grades and ambition to study towards a career , ayse yilmaz seems a model of muslim integration at her berlin high school .
she considers herself part of a growing group of young , educated muslims who have " a modern understanding of islam , " as the 18-year-old student of turkish-kurdish origin puts it .
but yilmaz - whose name has been changed here to protect her anonymit - has angered school authorities by refusing to take off her headscarf during sports class and going on school trips with her classmates .
“ i felt uncomfortable about the alcohol , partying and fooling around that takes place there , ” said yilmaz of the trips . as for her headscarf , yilmaz says , " there is no question of me taking it off just for sports or something .
it 's just part of me . " yilmaz ’ s arguments are becoming familiar ones to school authorities across germany , as muslim students and their parents clash with schools over whether the tenants of their faith should be allowed to bend the rules of germany 's secular school system .
though no reliable statistics are available , school authorities across the country say that an increasing number of muslim parents are demanding exemptions for their daughters on religious grounds from co-ed swimming , sports and biology classes .
thwarting integration efforts ?
the issue has turned into a potent flashpoint in german schools struggling with muslim integration .
“ it ’ s a difficult situation , ” said marion berning , director of the rixdorfer primary school , one of the largest in berlin ’ s neukölln district , where girls with headscarves are a common sight .
“ we have muslim girls who say they don ’ t want to swim with the boys .
it ’ s obvious the parents exert pressure on them , but they -lrb- the parents -rrb- have to accept that co-education is part of german schools . "
at another school in berlin 's turkish- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex is " absolutely taboo at home . " dominated kreuzberg district , principal annette spieler worries muslim girls exempted from biology class are missing out on lessons vital to teenagers .
" when it comes to sex education , it ’ s shocking how little the muslim students know about the topic .
it ’ s absolutely taboo in their homes , ” she said .
resurgent muslim identity in the absence of a common law governing the issue , some schools have attempted to appease muslim parents by offering gender-segregated biology and swimming classes , discussing the issue with them in parent-teacher meetings or allowing muslim girls to wear loose-fitting clothing during sports . but that hasn ’ t stopped some muslim parents from appealing to the courts to enforce their religious rights .
in 1993 , a landmark ruling by germany ’ s federal administrative court allowed a 13-year-old turkish girl to be exempted from co-ed sport lessons if the school failed to proved gender-segregated sports class .
the girl ’ s father argued that his daughter would face a moral conflict if she was forced to do sports with boys in tight-fitting clothes .
in another instance , a court in münster in 2002 exempted a muslim girl in the 10th grade from a class trip after her parents argued their faith forbade their daughter to stay overnight outside of the house without the company of a male relative .
the court cases point to what islam experts say is the growing need within the muslim community to assert themselves in western society .
“ the message is ‘ we ’ re here , we ’ re proud , we ’ re going to live our religion and not going to hide ourselves anymore ’ , ” said riem spielhaus , an islamic studies lecturer at berlin ’ s humboldt university .

german schools are increasingly grappling with cases of muslim girls pushing for exemption from co-ed swimming and sports on religious grounds , sorely testing the country 's ability to integrate its muslim population . with her flawless german , good grades and ambition to study towards a career , ayse yilmaz seems a model of muslim integration at her berlin high school .
she considers herself part of a growing group of young , educated muslims who have " a modern understanding of islam , " as the 18-year-old student of turkish-kurdish origin puts it .
but yilmaz - whose name has been changed here to protect her anonymit - has angered school authorities by refusing to take off her headscarf during sports class and going on school trips with her classmates .
“ i felt uncomfortable about the alcohol , partying and fooling around that takes place there , ” said yilmaz of the trips . as for her headscarf , yilmaz says , " there is no question of me taking it off just for sports or something .
it 's just part of me . " yilmaz ’ s arguments are becoming familiar ones to school authorities across germany , as muslim students and their parents clash with schools over whether the tenants of their faith should be allowed to bend the rules of germany 's secular school system .
though no reliable statistics are available , school authorities across the country say that an increasing number of muslim parents are demanding exemptions for their daughters on religious grounds from co-ed swimming , sports and biology classes .
thwarting integration efforts ?
the issue has turned into a potent flashpoint in german schools struggling with muslim integration .
“ it ’ s a difficult situation , ” said marion berning , director of the rixdorfer primary school , one of the largest in berlin ’ s neukölln district , where girls with headscarves are a common sight .
“ we have muslim girls who say they don ’ t want to swim with the boys .
it ’ s obvious the parents exert pressure on them , but they -lrb- the parents -rrb- have to accept that co-education is part of german schools . "
at another school in berlin 's turkish- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex is " absolutely taboo at home . " dominated kreuzberg district , principal annette spieler worries muslim girls exempted from biology class are missing out on lessons vital to teenagers .
" when it comes to sex education , it ’ s shocking how little the muslim students know about the topic .
it ’ s absolutely taboo in their homes , ” she said .
resurgent muslim identity in the absence of a common law governing the issue , some schools have attempted to appease muslim parents by offering gender-segregated biology and swimming classes , discussing the issue with them in parent-teacher meetings or allowing muslim girls to wear loose-fitting clothing during sports . but that hasn ’ t stopped some muslim parents from appealing to the courts to enforce their religious rights .
in 1993 , a landmark ruling by germany ’ s federal administrative court allowed a 13-year-old turkish girl to be exempted from co-ed sport lessons if the school failed to proved gender-segregated sports class .
the girl ’ s father argued that his daughter would face a moral conflict if she was forced to do sports with boys in tight-fitting clothes .
in another instance , a court in münster in 2002 exempted a muslim girl in the 10th grade from a class trip after her parents argued their faith forbade their daughter to stay overnight outside of the house without the company of a male relative .
the court cases point to what islam experts say is the growing need within the muslim community to assert themselves in western society .
“ the message is ‘ we ’ re here , we ’ re proud , we ’ re going to live our religion and not going to hide ourselves anymore ’ , ” said riem spielhaus , an islamic studies lecturer at berlin ’ s humboldt university .

the body which acts as a watchdog for national parks has announced it will take the pembrokeshire coast national park authority to the high court over its backing for the bluestone project .
the council for national parks -lrb- cnp -rrb- said it took the " exceptional " decision with a " heavy heart " over a scheme it claims would be harmful .
but the developer of the 500-acre leisure and sports village , which would create 600 permanent jobs , criticised its " predictable delaying tactic " .
part of the village is on land belonging to the national park , which had to give its approval before it could go ahead . "
this proposal has been democratically voted in .
what they are challenging is that they do n't like the decision " william mcnamara , bluestone the park authority gave unanimous backing last month .
after the decision the cnp called for the welsh assembly government to intervene , and had already warned that it was considering legal action .
ruth chambers , head of policy at the cnp , said : " we have taken the exceptional step of challenging the national park authority 's decision in the high court because of serious legal concerns about the authority 's disregard for its own policies and the way in which the decision was made " .
' staunch supporter ' she said the cnp had done all it could to avoid a legal challenge as it should always be a last resort .
" however given the major issues at stake for the future of national parks we have decided to take that last resort and have instructed our lawyers to issue legal proceedings immediately , " said ms chambers .
" we take this decision with a very heavy heart .
cnp is a staunch supporter of the work of the national park authorities .
" however in the case of bluestone we think that the park authority 's judgement is seriously flawed and are prepared to challenge this in court " .
the £ 60m park would include 340 log cabins , a snow dome and a sports club .
bluestone chief executive william mcnamara said he had expected the legal action .
he said the park authority had been advised that all correct procedures were followed strictly and there had been such a long planning process to ensure it was not open to legal challenge .
he told bbc radio wales : " we 're not surprised at what they are doing .
they 've tried all these 11th hour tactics since day one .
they 've been very unhelpful . "
he said it would affect two cornfields , not overlooked by any homes and it was not part of the coastal national park .
" this is serious because if they were succesful , we 're talking 600 full-time year- round jobs in pembrokeshire and we find it very tiresome at this stage .
" the reality is this proposal has been democratically voted in .

the body which acts as a watchdog for national parks has announced it will take the pembrokeshire coast national park authority to the high court over its backing for the bluestone project .
the council for national parks -lrb- cnp -rrb- said it took the " exceptional " decision with a " heavy heart " over a scheme it claims would be harmful .
but the developer of the 500-acre leisure and sports village , which would create 600 permanent jobs , criticised its " predictable delaying tactic " .
part of the village is on land belonging to the national park , which had to give its approval before it could go ahead .
this proposal has been democratically voted in .
what they are challenging is that they do n't like the decision william mcnamara , bluestone the park authority gave unanimous backing last month .
after the decision the cnp called for the welsh assembly government to intervene , and had already warned that it was considering legal action .
ruth chambers , head of policy at the cnp , said : " we have taken the exceptional step of challenging the national park authority 's decision in the high court because of serious legal concerns about the authority 's disregard for its own policies and the way in which the decision was made " .
' staunch supporter ' she said the cnp had done all it could to avoid a legal challenge as it should always be a last resort .
" however given the major issues at stake for the future of national parks we have decided to take that last resort and have instructed our lawyers to issue legal proceedings immediately , " said ms chambers .
" we take this decision with a very heavy heart .
cnp is a staunch supporter of the work of the national park authorities .
" however in the case of bluestone we think that the park authority 's judgement is seriously flawed and are prepared to challenge this in court " .
the £ 60m park would include 340 log cabins , a snow dome and a sports club .
bluestone chief executive william mcnamara said he had expected the legal action .
he said the park authority had been advised that all correct procedures were followed strictly and there had been such a long planning process to ensure it was not open to legal challenge .
he told bbc radio wales : " we 're not surprised at what they are doing .
they 've tried all these 11th hour tactics since day one .
they 've been very unhelpful . "
he said it would affect two cornfields , not overlooked by any homes and it was not part of the coastal national park .
" this is serious because if they were succesful , we 're talking 600 full-time year- round jobs in pembrokeshire and we find it very tiresome at this stage .
" the reality is this proposal has been democratically voted in .
what they are challenging is that they do n't like the decision . "

elsewhere in the uk , the surge of inflation in the 1970s sealed the fate of the pound note .

the uk 's £ 1 coin has been in circulation for 21 years , having been issued for the first time on 23 april 1983 .
but the royal bank of scotland has continued to issue the paper version , with millions of the notes still in circulation .
pound notes still circulate alongside coins in scotland the reverse side of the scottish pound note features one of the most famous views in scotland , edinburgh castle .
scottish banknotes have an unusual status , with roots in the country 's history .
in 1826 , the british parliament passed legislation preventing banks from issuing their own pound notes , a practice which was threatening to get out of hand .
but a vigorous campaign in scotland , which enlisted figures such as the writer sir walter scott , ensured that it was exempted from the new law .
in scotland , three banks retain the right to print their own money : the royal bank of scotland , the bank of scotland and the clydesdale bank .
of these , only the royal bank still issues £ 1 notes .
inflation surge most of the scottish currency is backed by holdings of bank of england notes , but the banks are allowed to issue an additional sum equivalent to the notes and coins in circulation in 1845 .
at £ 3m , this figure now represents a very small proportion of the value of all scottish banknotes .
elsewhere in the uk , the surge of inflation in the 1970s sealed the fate of the pound note .
it had become worth too little to justify the costs of printing notes which had a much shorter life than coins .
the initial move from paper was kick-started with the minting of more than 400m pound coins in 1983 .

the day before the local a bus shelter was the same old drab , concrete shelter from the rain - nothing more than a shabby refuge for villagers waiting for the infrequent bus service to nearby tregaron and aberystwyth .
then , in a storyline worthy of a magical fairytale , the bus stop underwent a startling transformation .
overnight it had been painted in a delicate pink .
a table had been assembled and decorated with a vase of freshly cut flowers .
the once grubby floor had been carpeted with a set of shelves teeming with books and magazines completing the interior .
who on earth , villagers wondered , was responsible for the covert makeover ?
after extensive investigations llangeitho community council have now found out that the work has been done by a secret group of young artists who want to remain anonymous .
villagers believe it is the work of the secret society of active artists in wales -lrb- saw -rrb- , whose members plan to take up one project a month .
mattie williams believes the group have decorated the shelter simply for the benefit of the village .
" it 's a big secret and the artists do n't want any publicity - they 've done it for the sheer enjoyment it will bring to local people , " said ms williams .
the thermometer gives the shelter a homely feeling painter and decorator ceitho jenkins , who has been in the business for 50 years , thinks the artists have done a great diy job .
" it looks fantastic and it 's good to see it done up like this - i 've never seen a decorated bus shelter before , " he said .
elwyn james , one of the owners of bus company james brothers , thinks the new-look shelter will encourage travellers .
" it 's a nice change from seeing vandalised and neglected shelters and it might entice people to come and wait for the bus , " said mr james .

last month tony bennett , 47 , was given permission to open the otter pub in drayton for an extra hour on 23 april .
but magistrates agreed only because the pub would raise money for charity - not because the day is special in law .
he has since had around 1,000 messages of support from around the world and a website in support of his campaign will go live to mark the day on friday .
mr bennett believes st george should have the same status as st patrick 's day and american independence day .
we are making a whole weekend event of it - we are going to make this bigger than st patrick 's day tony bennett he said as well as the launch of the website , celebrations at the otter to commemorate england 's patron saint will now last throughout the weekend , and will include a medieval banquet and a visit from a george medal holder .
" we are making a whole weekend event of it - we are going to make this bigger than st patrick 's day , " he said .
" that is the whole idea , to make everyone aware of st george 's day .

last month tony bennett , 47 , was given permission to open the otter pub in drayton for an extra hour on 23 april .
but magistrates agreed only because the pub would raise money for charity - not because the day is special in law .
he has since had around 1,000 messages of support from around the world and a website in support of his campaign will go live to mark the day on friday .
mr bennett believes st george should have the same status as st patrick 's day and american independence day .
we are making a whole weekend event of it - we are going to make this bigger than st patrick 's day tony bennett he said as well as the launch of the website , celebrations at the otter to commemorate england 's patron saint will now last throughout the weekend , and will include a medieval banquet and a visit from a george medal holder .
" we are making a whole weekend event of it - we are going to make this bigger than st patrick 's day , " he said .
" that is the whole idea , to make everyone aware of st george 's day .
" if everyone turns up that has said they will , i am expecting thousands .
" we should be in for a good weekend . "
he said petitions were being signed in pubs throughout the country in support of making the day a national holiday and he was " hopeful " westminster would take notice .
" the campaign is beginning to take off .

the disease , seen mainly in sub-saharan africa , can be difficult to diagnose until it is fairly advanced .
but experts at london 's st george 's medical school , writing in the lancet , say the blood test they have developed could be carried out much earlier .
however , other scientists have questioned whether it is too " high-tech " to be used widely .
sleeping sickness affects up to 500,000 each year .
it is a chronic , progressive disease which , unless treated , usually results in death .
the world health organisation estimates that 66,000 people die from the disease every year .
establishing an effective test is important to avoid unnecessary administration of drugs , which can have serious and sometimes fatal side effects .
sleeping sickness is spread by the tsetse fly and is caused by a parasite called trypanosome which is carried by the tiny creature .
i am very pleased that we have managed to contribute to the diagnosis of a terrible and completely neglected disease professor sanjeev krishna , st george 's hospital medical school once in the blood stream it attacks the blood and nervous system .
conventional tests for sleeping sickness involve blood tests to check for the presence of antibodies or parasites .
however , professor sanjeev krishna and his team in london have discovered a way of diagnosing the disease by extracting serum from the blood and checking for a specific pattern of proteins that are detected using a sophisticated machine called a mass spectrometer .
this characteristic signature of protein patterns gives a " fingerprint " to the elusive killer .
sickness symptoms the technique has been used to test for ovarian and other cancers , but this is the first time an infection has been diagnosed using such advanced technology .
professor krishna said : " i am very pleased that we have managed to contribute to the diagnosis of a terrible and completely neglected disease .
" we now want to use this information to develop tests that can be applied easily in areas where patients are actually suffering from this infection .
the tsetse fly spreads the disease " work on sequencing all the genes of the organism that causes sleeping sickness , supported by the wellcome trust , will undoubtedly help us in this objective . "
the test has been developed to detect the trypanosoma brucei gambiensi variant of sleeping sickness , which is found in west africa and causes a delayed chronic illness that can last years .
symptoms start with fever , headache , joint pain and once the parasites crosses the blood brain barrier , characteristic neurological symptoms and signs present ; altered mental state , irritability , sensory disturbances , and co-ordination problems .
however , the practicalities of using the technique are being questioned from an economical as well as a medical perspective .
further research simon croft , professor of parasytology at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine , is sceptical .
he said : " there 's urgent need for a much improved diagnostic test , not just one that tells you if you have the disease , but one that could be used during treatment , to see if it is working properly .
" this is a high-tech solution which is not applicable in its current form because of the technology and equipment required .
" it needs a bit more research .
it is interesting , but there is a long way to go . "
professor krishna and his team worked in collaboration with angolan doctors and the university of wurzburg in germany .
professor krishna says his discovery may be useful in the detection of other serious diseases .
he said : " the same approach could , equally , be used to improve the diagnostic accuracy of other infections , such as tuberculosis , which can be difficult to detect using conventional tests " .

i was just helping out a friend , nothing more than that .
she had left her country because of war and most of her friends who had made it here had regularised their status a long time ago .
she had been studying and had just been renewing study visas .
but finally it all caught up with her .
her course was finishing , she had to leave the country .
maybe she had been disorganised , but she had been here 10 years , she had a life here .
it seemed an easy thing to do .
we did make a point of learning a lot about each other 's backgrounds .
we were worried about being summoned for interview at the passport office , although it never happened .
i did feel a little overwhelmed by the ceremony before going through with it , i was looking for someone who had been through the process .
a couple of weeks after my ' wife ' had been for her forms a friend admitted he had done it and said the interview process is horrific .
he knew this woman well .
they had to convince a panel that they were in a relationship .
they were asking questions like ' what university did your wife 's brother go to , what was his first job ? ' .
and they are apparently very good with shared experiences .
' where were you on your wife 's birthday ? '
in my case , my wife 's landlord , who was a friend of hers , wrote us a tenancy agreement and all of my correspondence and bills went through that address .
but then she moved out and we were pretending to live together at an address where neither of us lived .
i was quite pleased to thumb my nose at the institution of marriage .
my parents have always dreamed i would get married one day .
i almost relished the iconoclasm of it all , but at the same time there was something about it that i did feel a little overwhelmed by the ceremony .
she was in a plastic tiara , i was in an ill-fitting suit - it was good fun .
we were trying so hard to be ' the couple ' , and there were a few guests who actually thought we were getting married .
she was in a plastic tiara , i was in an ill-fitting suit .
it was good fun .
her boyfriend was a film-maker and at one point , we were kissing , and he turned the camera on himself and said ' i 'm filming my reaction ' .
we had been told anecdotally that it would be a good thing if we could have third parties and pictures and memories of the day .
we put on a real show .
but i would now advise people against it , knowing about how difficult it is .
my own paperwork has been difficult .
i 've never come across a negative reaction .
my mum rolled her eyes but by that time she knew i was never going to do what she wanted and she took it in her stride .
most people have said that it is nice .

the travellers did not apply for planning permission to erect buildings , fences and roads on the land .
they bought the land before moving into caravans on the site , building roads and erecting fences .
although they had purchased the land the development of the site was against the law .
the council postponed an eviction in january after the group dug trenches , formed a human shield and set fire to caravans to prevent bailiffs from evicting them .
david willshaw , a solicitor representing the travellers , said the council needs to work with them to resolve the problem .
the meeting will take place next week .

the contract , which was agreed last year , was supposed to be in place in february .
but the bma says managers at many trusts are refusing to agree job plans with consultants .
ministers hope the contract , designed to allow doctors to work more flexibly , will help cut nhs waiting times .
the government agrees with the bma and is committed to implementing the consultant contract as quickly as possible health minister john hutton the bma says the contract needs to be introduced as soon as possible .
" this needs to be done in a short time frame , " said dr jonathan fielden , deputy chairman of its consultants committee .
" we have the working time directive coming in for junior doctors in august and their hours will come down dramatically .
" if you have n't resolved the issue for senior doctors , then you wo n't be able to resolve the issue for juniors . "
' best case scenario ' according to the bma , just one in four trusts has implemented the new contract although some are expected to agree job plans with consultants over the next two weeks .
" less than a quarter of consultants signed up and ready to go on the contract , " said dr fielden .
" the best case scenario we feel for the end of this month is half . "
dr fielden said the delays were down to some trust managers acting unreasonably and failing to work in partnership with doctors .
" you have to have a partnership and cooperative approach , " he said .
" trusts that are doing that are getting results . "
health minister john hutton insisted progress is being made .
" the government agrees with the bma and is committed to implementing the consultant contract as quickly as possible .
" we have been pleased to see a significant amount of progress has been made by employing organisations in implementing the contract recently .
" we expect that this progress will continue and the great majority of consultants will receive final proposed job plan offers by the end of this month . "
but shadow health secretary andrew lansley criticised the government .
" the incompetence of this government is shocking .
they continue to introduce changes but do not provide the necessary support to ensure that the nhs can carry them out . "
