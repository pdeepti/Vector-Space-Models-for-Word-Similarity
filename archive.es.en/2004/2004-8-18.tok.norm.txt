opposition voices have questioned his wisdom . german defense minister peter struck on tuesday set out for a summer tour of military bases to see how the current restructuring of the national armed forces is progressing .
in line with eu and nato defense policies , the bundeswehr is reshaping its troops to be better prepared for peacekeeping or peace-enforcing missions abroad . however , struck is facing a hard time explaining his decision to close numerous bundeswehr bases across the country , which will coincide with the large-scale withdrawal of us forces from western germany : struck had gained wide respect for starting to overhaul the national armed forces and handling out-of-area peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and the balkans .
while he has given up pipe smoking after the stroke he suffered in june , he has not reduced his ambitions to push through the biggest restructuring of the bundeswehr to date . troops to be cut down to 250,000 the emphasis will be on training mobile units to be employed quickly in crisis areas outside nato territory .
in the next couple of years , troop strength will be reduced by 30,000 to 250,000 - a measure long overdue after the end of the cold war .
the number of military bases will also be cut drastically .
details on the closures will be announced in november . opposition conservative defense spokesman christian schmidt warned about rushing into defense decisions now that it has been announced that the united states will be withdrawing a large contingent of their 70,000 troops now stationed in germany .
schmidt called on the defense minister on tuesday to ensure that the communities affected will receive some sort of compensation for the looming economic losses . " i myself come from a region which will be largely affected by the withdrawal of us troops with the bases in bamberg and würzburg soon to be deserted , " schmidt told dw-radio . looming economic and social problems " we ’ ve always come out in favor of providing financial help for restructuring programs after such a pull-out of troops .
but at present , there are no such means available , neither at federal , nor at community level .
we ’ ll see massive social and economic problems in the affected regions .
i ’ m optimistic that policy-makers will not leave these communities to their own devices and raise restructuring funds , probably also out of european union coffers . " schmidt , as well as bavaria ’ s christian social union leader edmund stoiber , is hoping that the defense minister will readjust his original plan to close down german military bases to the realities created by the us troop pull-out .
both theorized that a number of abandoned us bases may in the future be used by the bundeswehr instead . future planning is questioned “ i can only suggest thinking harder about harmonizing us and national defense policies , said schmidt .
" struck is expected to close down up to 100 bundeswehr bases over the next few years .
us bases will vanish too .
i ’ m not convinced that everything has been carefully coordinated yet .
i believe there ’ s a need to reconsider the planned scope of closures here . ” but the cash-strapped defense minister is unlikely to effect major changes .
many of germany 's military installations , struck argues , weren ’ t needed any longer 10 years ago , but the government was afforded the luxury of maintaining them anyway .
now , with a revamped defense strategy in place and all the budgetary constraints at hand , he says , that doesn ’ t make sense anymore . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us troop withdrawal raises concerns washington ’ s biggest military reorganization in 50 years has caused ripples around the world , but while the nations due to wave good-bye to us forces have issued muted regret , criticism is gaining pace in the us .

we regret it ; the american soldiers were welcome here .

this news has raised concerns in russia , which has called for a detailed explanation of the military re-organization .

moscow is concerned that as the nato alliance expands , the united states will station troops along its borders .
further , it continues to worry about the future presence of western troops in energy-rich centra asian , which russia once dominated .
the russian foreign ministry said in a statement that , “ our view of these plans will depend on the spelled-out details , and whether they pose a danger to russia ’ s national interests . ”
moscow ’ s statement stressed that it expected washington to adhere to previous agreements that , in moscow ’ s view , ban the united states from stationing its troops in the baltics or the caucasus . democrats seize on bush 's plan but while the germans were putting on a brave face and the russians remained edgy , opposition to the withdrawal in the united states was more vociferous .

it 's going to weaken our national security , " said richard holbrooke , a kerry foreign policy adviser and former ambassador to the un and germany under former president clinton , in a widely reported statement .
" it is not going to save us money .
it will cost billions of dollars to bring these troops home . " holbrooke also focused on the economic demands which the troop redeployment would shift from the host countries back to the united states .
" germany , south korea and japan , which will see the biggest cuts , all spend billions of dollars to support the troops .
and i am very concerned about this . " holbrooke also rejected president george w. bush 's assertion that bringing the troops home would make it easier to rapidly deploy them to global trouble spots .
he called bases in germany , south korea and okinawa " essential " along with other forward deployments . " even in the modern world , airplanes take time to get places , " holbrooke said .
" this is a weakening of our traditional ties to our closest allies just when we need them most . " ex-general clark warns of timing in terror war another kerry-supporter , retired army general wesley clark , warned of a military mistake in the making .
" as we face a global war on terror with al qaeda active in more than 60 countries , now is not the time to pull back our forces . " clark , who commanded nato and us forces in europe from 1997 to 2000 , added in his statement : " this ill-conceived move and its timing seem politically motivated rather than designed to strengthen our national security .

kerry himself is expected to voice his own opposition to the bush administration 's plans when he gives a speech to the veterans of foreign wars in cincinnati on wednesday .
it will be a chance for the presidential candidate make clear one of the distinct strategic differences between himself and george w. bush .
kerry is preparing to argue that the withdrawal of troops from europe and asia threatens to undercut alliances and weakens america 's ability to project its power overseas , according to michael meehan , a senior adviser in the democratic party , quoted in the financial times .

the russian foreign ministry said in a statement that , “ our view of these plans will depend on the spelled-out details , and whether they pose a danger to russia ’ s national interests . ”

the politicians , however , have been doing their best to hide their displeasure . germany regrets decision but understands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary donald rumsfeld with german defense minister peter struck german defense minister peter struck said in a statement that he regretted the withdrawal , but washington had no choice .
" that 's a big loss to a lot of regions , " he said .
" but the decision of the us president is without alternative . " karsten voigt , berlin 's coordinator for german-american relations , said germany would remain the largest base for us troops in europe and security in europe was not at risk . " but , nevertheless , the withdrawal of troops is a loss , of course .
we regret it ; the american soldiers were welcome here .
but it is a sign of success at the same time - the success of having overcome the cold war and european division , " voigt told reporters . the us plans to move about half of its foreign-based troops , with many heading back to the states and others from european bases penciled in for deployment in the former soviet baltic republics .
this news has raised concerns in russia , which has called for a detailed explanation of the military re-organization .
russia suspicious of us intentions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. forces could be on russia 's doorstep .
moscow is concerned that as the nato alliance expands , the united states will station troops along its borders .
further , it continues to worry about the future presence of western troops in energy-rich centra asian , which russia once dominated .
the russian foreign ministry said in a statement that , “ our view of these plans will depend on the spelled-out details , and whether they pose a danger to russia ’ s national interests . ”
moscow ’ s statement stressed that it expected washington to adhere to previous agreements that , in moscow ’ s view , ban the united states from stationing its troops in the baltics or the caucasus . democrats seize on bush 's plan but while the germans were putting on a brave face and the russians remained edgy , opposition to the withdrawal in the united states was more vociferous .
unsurprisingly , the majority of criticism came from supporters of democratic presidential candidate john kerry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke " this is another example of the -lrb- bush -rrb- administration 's unilateralism .
it 's going to weaken our national security , " said richard holbrooke , a kerry foreign policy adviser and former ambassador to the un and germany under former president clinton , in a widely reported statement .
" it is not going to save us money .
it will cost billions of dollars to bring these troops home . " holbrooke also focused on the economic demands which the troop redeployment would shift from the host countries back to the united states .
" germany , south korea and japan , which will see the biggest cuts , all spend billions of dollars to support the troops .
and i am very concerned about this . " holbrooke also rejected president george w. bush 's assertion that bringing the troops home would make it easier to rapidly deploy them to global trouble spots .
he called bases in germany , south korea and okinawa " essential " along with other forward deployments . " even in the modern world , airplanes take time to get places , " holbrooke said .
" this is a weakening of our traditional ties to our closest allies just when we need them most . " ex-general clark warns of timing in terror war another kerry-supporter , retired army general wesley clark , warned of a military mistake in the making .
" as we face a global war on terror with al qaeda active in more than 60 countries , now is not the time to pull back our forces . " clark , who commanded nato and us forces in europe from 1997 to 2000 , added in his statement : " this ill-conceived move and its timing seem politically motivated rather than designed to strengthen our national security . " kerry to publicly address restructuring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential hopeful john kerry is expected to criticize the us troop plans .
kerry himself is expected to voice his own opposition to the bush administration 's plans when he gives a speech to the veterans of foreign wars in cincinnati on wednesday .
it will be a chance for the presidential candidate make clear one of the distinct strategic differences between himself and george w. bush .
kerry is preparing to argue that the withdrawal of troops from europe and asia threatens to undercut alliances and weakens america 's ability to project its power overseas , according to michael meehan , a senior adviser in the democratic party , quoted in the financial times .
meehan told the ft that kerry will make a " sweeping critique " of the realignment at the convention in cincinnati , the same venue where the president this week announced the planned withdrawal of a third of us forces from their foreign bases . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us troop pullout to hit local german economies the impact of us plans to pull some 70,000 troops out of europe and asia is likely to be felt most acutely in germany - especially in smaller towns whose economies depend on the us presence .
-lrb- august 17 , 2004 -rrb- bush : " our posture must change " us president george w. bush has announced plans to shift up to 70,000 us troops stationed in western europe and asia .
some of them are expected to be moved to posts in eastern europe while others will return home .

opposition voices have questioned his wisdom . german defense minister peter struck on tuesday set out for a summer tour of military bases to see how the current restructuring of the national armed forces is progressing .
in line with eu and nato defense policies , the bundeswehr is reshaping its troops to be better prepared for peacekeeping or peace-enforcing missions abroad . however , struck is facing a hard time explaining his decision to close numerous bundeswehr bases across the country , which will coincide with the large-scale withdrawal of us forces from western germany : struck had gained wide respect for starting to overhaul the national armed forces and handling out-of-area peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and the balkans .
while he has given up pipe smoking after the stroke he suffered in june , he has not reduced his ambitions to push through the biggest restructuring of the bundeswehr to date . troops to be cut down to 250,000 the emphasis will be on training mobile units to be employed quickly in crisis areas outside nato territory .
in the next couple of years , troop strength will be reduced by 30,000 to 250,000 - a measure long overdue after the end of the cold war .
the number of military bases will also be cut drastically .
details on the closures will be announced in november . opposition conservative defense spokesman christian schmidt warned about rushing into defense decisions now that it has been announced that the united states will be withdrawing a large contingent of their 70,000 troops now stationed in germany .
schmidt called on the defense minister on tuesday to ensure that the communities affected will receive some sort of compensation for the looming economic losses . " i myself come from a region which will be largely affected by the withdrawal of us troops with the bases in bamberg and würzburg soon to be deserted , " schmidt told dw-radio . looming economic and social problems " we ’ ve always come out in favor of providing financial help for restructuring programs after such a pull-out of troops .
but at present , there are no such means available , neither at federal , nor at community level .
we ’ ll see massive social and economic problems in the affected regions .
i ’ m optimistic that policy-makers will not leave these communities to their own devices and raise restructuring funds , probably also out of european union coffers . " schmidt , as well as bavaria ’ s christian social union leader edmund stoiber , is hoping that the defense minister will readjust his original plan to close down german military bases to the realities created by the us troop pull-out .
both theorized that a number of abandoned us bases may in the future be used by the bundeswehr instead . future planning is questioned “ i can only suggest thinking harder about harmonizing us and national defense policies , said schmidt .
" struck is expected to close down up to 100 bundeswehr bases over the next few years .
us bases will vanish too .
i ’ m not convinced that everything has been carefully coordinated yet .
i believe there ’ s a need to reconsider the planned scope of closures here . ” but the cash-strapped defense minister is unlikely to effect major changes .
many of germany 's military installations , struck argues , weren ’ t needed any longer 10 years ago , but the government was afforded the luxury of maintaining them anyway .
now , with a revamped defense strategy in place and all the budgetary constraints at hand , he says , that doesn ’ t make sense anymore . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us troop withdrawal raises concerns washington ’ s biggest military reorganization in 50 years has caused ripples around the world , but while the nations due to wave good-bye to us forces have issued muted regret , criticism is gaining pace in the us .

even as health experts warn that german youngsters are getting fatter , obesity levels continue to climb among the country 's migrant children population .
television and fast food are n't the only culprits . on a sunny august day , ten-year-old murat -lrb- name changed -rrb- lies on his back on a grassy lawn at a public outdoor swimming pool in berlin 's wedding district , home to a large immigrant population . licking a chocolate ice cream , murat , who is of turkish origin , might sound like a normal youngster , but he does n't look like one .
clad in an " l " size pair of swimming trunks , the porky fourth-grader tips the scales at nearly 44 kilos -lrb- 97 lbs . -rrb- . " the school authorities said he needs to exercise and lose weight .
that 's why i take him for a swim here , " his mother ayse -lrb- name changed -rrb- told dw-world .
the ice cream , she said , is a reward for him doing two laps in the pool .
" besides , it 's so hot , " she added . murat , who said his favorite food is nutella -lrb- a chocolate spread -rrb- , is not alone .
in past years , a rise in weight levels among children from germany 's immigrant families , a largely ignored group in obesity research until recently , has fuelled concern among health authorities . " sitting on a powder keg " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister renate künast is spearheading the drive for healthy nutrition to bring down obesity levels .
the german minister for consumer protection and agriculture , renate künast , estimated this year that every fifth child and every third teenager in germany is overweight .
the number of obese children signing up for school has risen three-fold compared to a decade ago .
" the country is sitting on a powder keg , " künast warned . though there are no country-wide studies on the prevalence of obesity among migrant children , statistics on the problem in cities with high foreign populations leave little room for doubt . in frankfurt , home to around 180,000 immigrants from 180 nations , research on the number of those children who joined school this year found that 12.5 percent were overweight . experts say that a six-year-old who has a body mass index of 15.4 is considered of normal weight .
the frankfurt statistics showed that moroccan and turkish children , in particular , had a body mass index of more than 18 percent , at 18.4 and 22 percent respectively .
among ten-year-olds , turkish children weighed the most at 34 percent , compared to 19 percent for german youngsters . eating to the point of disorder " it 's alarming , " holger meireis , head of frankfurt 's child and youth department told dw-world .
" if you interpret immigration in a broad sense , beyond borders of nationality , then almost 50 percent of frankfurt 's foreign population is overweight .
it ca n't be ignored any longer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neukölln is home to a large muslim population .
dr rainer moehl , a physician in neukölln , an immigrant-dominated berlin neighborhood , agreed that obesity was a widespread problem among his patients .
" by the time children in turkish and arab families reach school-going age , there 's usually a clear gender-specific difference : it 's mostly boys who develop obesity during puberty , while girls have eating disorders like bulimia , " moehl said . he warned that overweight children are likely to develop problems such as mobility and spinal and metabolic disorders , high blood pressure , diabetes and depression . filling the stomach cheaply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that low income and education levels can have disastrous consequences for obese people .
while experts point to the usual suspects - too much television , too little activity , fast food and sweets - they agree that the spread of obesity among migrant children is largely tied to their financial and social situation . jeffrey butler from the health department in berlin 's wedding district , which holds the dubious record of being home to berlin 's pudgiest kids -lrb- 20.7 percent body mass index -rrb- , points to the fact that the neighborhood is also one of the capital 's poorest . with an unemployment rate of around 24 percent , low education levels and around 26 percent of children and teenagers living on welfare , wedding has acquired notoriety as a social flashpoint . " most of the families here do n't have the means to buy healthy food , even if they wanted to , " butler said .
" it 's just easier to shop for packaged and fast food that fills you up . " calories and stress others caution that the problem has much more complex cultural reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations in a döner shop in berlin .

in past years , a rise in weight levels among children from germany 's immigrant families , a largely ignored group in obesity research until recently , has fuelled concern among health authorities . " sitting on a powder keg " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister renate künast is spearheading the drive for healthy nutrition to bring down obesity levels .
the german minister for consumer protection and agriculture , renate künast , estimated this year that every fifth child and every third teenager in germany is overweight .
the number of obese children signing up for school has risen three-fold compared to a decade ago .
" the country is sitting on a powder keg , " künast warned . though there are no country-wide studies on the prevalence of obesity among migrant children , statistics on the problem in cities with high foreign populations leave little room for doubt . in frankfurt , home to around 180,000 immigrants from 180 nations , research on the number of those children who joined school this year found that 12.5 percent were overweight . experts say that a six-year-old who has a body mass index of 15.4 is considered of normal weight .
the frankfurt statistics showed that moroccan and turkish children , in particular , had a body mass index of more than 18 percent , at 18.4 and 22 percent respectively .
among ten-year-olds , turkish children weighed the most at 34 percent , compared to 19 percent for german youngsters . eating to the point of disorder " it 's alarming , " holger meireis , head of frankfurt 's child and youth department told dw-world .

it ca n't be ignored any longer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neukölln is home to a large muslim population .
dr rainer moehl , a physician in neukölln , an immigrant-dominated berlin neighborhood , agreed that obesity was a widespread problem among his patients .
" by the time children in turkish and arab families reach school-going age , there 's usually a clear gender-specific difference : it 's mostly boys who develop obesity during puberty , while girls have eating disorders like bulimia , " moehl said . he warned that overweight children are likely to develop problems such as mobility and spinal and metabolic disorders , high blood pressure , diabetes and depression . filling the stomach cheaply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that low income and education levels can have disastrous consequences for obese people .
while experts point to the usual suspects - too much television , too little activity , fast food and sweets - they agree that the spread of obesity among migrant children is largely tied to their financial and social situation . jeffrey butler from the health department in berlin 's wedding district , which holds the dubious record of being home to berlin 's pudgiest kids -lrb- 20.7 percent body mass index -rrb- , points to the fact that the neighborhood is also one of the capital 's poorest . with an unemployment rate of around 24 percent , low education levels and around 26 percent of children and teenagers living on welfare , wedding has acquired notoriety as a social flashpoint . " most of the families here do n't have the means to buy healthy food , even if they wanted to , " butler said .

even as health experts warn that german youngsters are getting fatter , obesity levels continue to climb among the country 's migrant children population .
television and fast food are n't the only culprits . on a sunny august day , ten-year-old murat -lrb- name changed -rrb- lies on his back on a grassy lawn at a public outdoor swimming pool in berlin 's wedding district , home to a large immigrant population . licking a chocolate ice cream , murat , who is of turkish origin , might sound like a normal youngster , but he does n't look like one .
clad in an " l " size pair of swimming trunks , the porky fourth-grader tips the scales at nearly 44 kilos -lrb- 97 lbs . -rrb- . " the school authorities said he needs to exercise and lose weight .
that 's why i take him for a swim here , " his mother ayse -lrb- name changed -rrb- told dw-world .
the ice cream , she said , is a reward for him doing two laps in the pool .
" besides , it 's so hot , " she added . murat , who said his favorite food is nutella -lrb- a chocolate spread -rrb- , is not alone .
in past years , a rise in weight levels among children from germany 's immigrant families , a largely ignored group in obesity research until recently , has fuelled concern among health authorities . " sitting on a powder keg " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister renate künast is spearheading the drive for healthy nutrition to bring down obesity levels .
the german minister for consumer protection and agriculture , renate künast , estimated this year that every fifth child and every third teenager in germany is overweight .
the number of obese children signing up for school has risen three-fold compared to a decade ago .
" the country is sitting on a powder keg , " künast warned . though there are no country-wide studies on the prevalence of obesity among migrant children , statistics on the problem in cities with high foreign populations leave little room for doubt . in frankfurt , home to around 180,000 immigrants from 180 nations , research on the number of those children who joined school this year found that 12.5 percent were overweight . experts say that a six-year-old who has a body mass index of 15.4 is considered of normal weight .
the frankfurt statistics showed that moroccan and turkish children , in particular , had a body mass index of more than 18 percent , at 18.4 and 22 percent respectively .
among ten-year-olds , turkish children weighed the most at 34 percent , compared to 19 percent for german youngsters . eating to the point of disorder " it 's alarming , " holger meireis , head of frankfurt 's child and youth department told dw-world .
" if you interpret immigration in a broad sense , beyond borders of nationality , then almost 50 percent of frankfurt 's foreign population is overweight .
it ca n't be ignored any longer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neukölln is home to a large muslim population .
dr rainer moehl , a physician in neukölln , an immigrant-dominated berlin neighborhood , agreed that obesity was a widespread problem among his patients .
" by the time children in turkish and arab families reach school-going age , there 's usually a clear gender-specific difference : it 's mostly boys who develop obesity during puberty , while girls have eating disorders like bulimia , " moehl said . he warned that overweight children are likely to develop problems such as mobility and spinal and metabolic disorders , high blood pressure , diabetes and depression . filling the stomach cheaply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that low income and education levels can have disastrous consequences for obese people .
while experts point to the usual suspects - too much television , too little activity , fast food and sweets - they agree that the spread of obesity among migrant children is largely tied to their financial and social situation . jeffrey butler from the health department in berlin 's wedding district , which holds the dubious record of being home to berlin 's pudgiest kids -lrb- 20.7 percent body mass index -rrb- , points to the fact that the neighborhood is also one of the capital 's poorest . with an unemployment rate of around 24 percent , low education levels and around 26 percent of children and teenagers living on welfare , wedding has acquired notoriety as a social flashpoint . " most of the families here do n't have the means to buy healthy food , even if they wanted to , " butler said .
" it 's just easier to shop for packaged and fast food that fills you up . " calories and stress others caution that the problem has much more complex cultural reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations in a döner shop in berlin .
meat is a staple among turks .
" the common family meal is the focal point in a turkish home , and traditional turkish cuisine is actually healthy , " jutta kolletzki , a therapist who runs a counseling and treatment center for weight-loss and eating disorders in frankfurt , said .
" but meals are cooked with so much sugar and fat that it turns into a real calorie bomb , " she said . kolletzki added that many immigrants often are n't well-informed about what constitutes healthy nutrition .
differing perspectives of health also contribute to the problem , she said .
" in traditional families , a tubby child is usually considered well-fed and a sign of prosperity rather than as a problem , " kolletzki explained . she also warned that children straddling two cultures are often under a lot of emotional stress .
" separations or moving from one country to another is difficult for a child , " she said .
" eating more is a way of coping with it . " battle of the bulge bildunterschrift : children take part in a weight-loss program at germany 's baltic sea coast .
obesity among migrant children is now recognized as a serious problem , judging by the number of initiatives and projects springing up in several german cities to tackle it . most involve networking with kindergartens and schools to encourage them to introduce healthy breakfasts and impress upon the kids and parents the benefits of a healthy diet and exercise .
the emphasis is on prevention , taking into account cultural differences and using interpreters to reach the target groups . minister künast is kicking off a major nationwide project in september involving parents , health insurance companies and the food industry .
a spokeswoman at the ministry stressed that though this was n't a special programs for migrant children as yet , they were working on it . germany , it seems , is determined to win the battle of the bulge and avoid the rather drastic scenario predicted in a recent british survey , which suggested that the younger generation would be the first to die before their parents .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.08.2004 moma berlin exhibition slammed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some art fans are unhappy with the show unhappy with the long entrance lines , art fans are directing criticism at the organizers of berlin 's moma exhibition .
now , a notable art critic is accusing the new york curators of cultural colonialism . judging by the huge number of visitors - more than 800,000 at last count - some of whom have lined up for more than eight hours to gain entry into the special exhibition of the new york-based museum of modern art 's -lrb- moma -rrb- show at berlin 's national gallery , it has been a huge success . many even credit the mania surrounding the display of more than 200 paintings and sculptures from moma 's famous collection with helping to spur tourism to germany 's capital to a post-world war ii high , and there is no indication that the steady flow of visitors will slack off before it closes on sept .
19 . however , increasing numbers of art fans who have had to wait - sometimes in the hot summer sun - are less inclined to view the exhibition as a triumph , and some have even accused the organizers of deliberately keeping the lines long in order to stir up publicity .
the fact that those willing to pay € 27 -lrb- $ 33 -rrb- can avoid the long lines entirely does stink a bit of cultural elitism . now werner spies , a noted art historian , one time friend of pablo picasso and max ernst , and former director of the national museum of modern art at the georges pompidou center in paris , has joined the critics . but the nature of his criticism is different .
in an article in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday , spies accused the new york-based curators - who decided on the exhibition 's content with no input from their berlin hosts - of cultural colonialism . american art the culmination of modern development ? the crux of spies ' criticism centers around the portion of the exhibit looking at modern art in the second half of the last century , which , compared to the first half , includes almost no selections from european masters .
in short , spies accuses the new york-based curators of falsely claiming that the " new american painting , " which emerged in the postwar years , is the culmination of the 20th century 's modern art movement . for spies , the failure to include the works of matisse , max ernst , dubuffet and giacometti , is inexcusable and not merely an oversight but suggests that moma curators have an agenda to determine the so-called canon of contemporary art to the americans ' advantage . " the americans who chose the selections are engaging in cultural politics , " he wrote .
" for them , the vatican of 20th century aesthetic , it is about establishing the canon of modern art … and the new york museum can in berlin - in an expansionist way - present american art as the culmination of that development . " in response to spies ' criticisms , peter raue , the director of the " friends of the national gallery , " which helped to bring the exhibition to berlin , told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the exhibit clearly shows the american view , which is just fine by him .
he said he could imagine that a berlin-curated show presenting the european perspective could possibly grace the galleries of moma in the future , thereby presenting a more balanced whole . numbers grow , opening hours extended in the meantime , the number of visitors hoping to gain entry continues to grow .
at times , the line wraps more than two times around the building .
and despite the museum 's decision to extend opening hours for the final weeks , the wait remains long . one industrious berlin-based engineer sent a four-page plan to the organizers detailing how to do away with the lines , which among other things , suggested the distribution of waiting numbers .
in response , according to newspaper reports , he was told that the lines were " necessary to create publicity . " according to a security official quoted in german papers , an ambulance has been called to the museum at least once a day to cart away would-be museum goers for whom the stress of contributing to the shows " publicity " has proven too much . some among them may be inclined to add their voices to the growing number of critics , though they are far more likely to bemoan practical considerations as opposed to the high-minded nature of the modern art canon .
others , however , will continue to view the chance to see this " once in a lifetime " exhibition as well worth the wait . editor 's note : while dw-tv is one of four media partners of moma in berlin , deutsche welle played no part in organizing or curating the exhibition . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de record year for berlin tourism expected the number of visitors to berlin may reach a postwar high in 2004 , berlin 's tourism organization revealed monday .

now , a notable art critic is accusing the new york curators of cultural colonialism . judging by the huge number of visitors - more than 800,000 at last count - some of whom have lined up for more than eight hours to gain entry into the special exhibition of the new york-based museum of modern art 's -lrb- moma -rrb- show at berlin 's national gallery , it has been a huge success . many even credit the mania surrounding the display of more than 200 paintings and sculptures from moma 's famous collection with helping to spur tourism to germany 's capital to a post-world war ii high , and there is no indication that the steady flow of visitors will slack off before it closes on sept .
19 . however , increasing numbers of art fans who have had to wait - sometimes in the hot summer sun - are less inclined to view the exhibition as a triumph , and some have even accused the organizers of deliberately keeping the lines long in order to stir up publicity .
the fact that those willing to pay € 27 -lrb- $ 33 -rrb- can avoid the long lines entirely does stink a bit of cultural elitism . now werner spies , a noted art historian , one time friend of pablo picasso and max ernst , and former director of the national museum of modern art at the georges pompidou center in paris , has joined the critics . but the nature of his criticism is different .
in an article in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday , spies accused the new york-based curators - who decided on the exhibition 's content with no input from their berlin hosts - of cultural colonialism . american art the culmination of modern development ? the crux of spies ' criticism centers around the portion of the exhibit looking at modern art in the second half of the last century , which , compared to the first half , includes almost no selections from european masters .
in short , spies accuses the new york-based curators of falsely claiming that the " new american painting , " which emerged in the postwar years , is the culmination of the 20th century 's modern art movement . for spies , the failure to include the works of matisse , max ernst , dubuffet and giacometti , is inexcusable and not merely an oversight but suggests that moma curators have an agenda to determine the so-called canon of contemporary art to the americans ' advantage . " the americans who chose the selections are engaging in cultural politics , " he wrote .
" for them , the vatican of 20th century aesthetic , it is about establishing the canon of modern art … and the new york museum can in berlin - in an expansionist way - present american art as the culmination of that development . " in response to spies ' criticisms , peter raue , the director of the " friends of the national gallery , " which helped to bring the exhibition to berlin , told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the exhibit clearly shows the american view , which is just fine by him .
he said he could imagine that a berlin-curated show presenting the european perspective could possibly grace the galleries of moma in the future , thereby presenting a more balanced whole . numbers grow , opening hours extended in the meantime , the number of visitors hoping to gain entry continues to grow .
at times , the line wraps more than two times around the building .
and despite the museum 's decision to extend opening hours for the final weeks , the wait remains long . one industrious berlin-based engineer sent a four-page plan to the organizers detailing how to do away with the lines , which among other things , suggested the distribution of waiting numbers .
in response , according to newspaper reports , he was told that the lines were " necessary to create publicity . " according to a security official quoted in german papers , an ambulance has been called to the museum at least once a day to cart away would-be museum goers for whom the stress of contributing to the shows " publicity " has proven too much . some among them may be inclined to add their voices to the growing number of critics , though they are far more likely to bemoan practical considerations as opposed to the high-minded nature of the modern art canon .
others , however , will continue to view the chance to see this " once in a lifetime " exhibition as well worth the wait . editor 's note : while dw-tv is one of four media partners of moma in berlin , deutsche welle played no part in organizing or curating the exhibition . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de record year for berlin tourism expected the number of visitors to berlin may reach a postwar high in 2004 , berlin 's tourism organization revealed monday .

" the americans who chose the selections are engaging in cultural politics , " he wrote .
" for them , the vatican of 20th century aesthetic , it is about establishing the canon of modern art … and the new york museum can in berlin - in an expansionist way - present american art as the culmination of that development . " in response to spies ' criticisms , peter raue , the director of the " friends of the national gallery , " which helped to bring the exhibition to berlin , told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the exhibit clearly shows the american view , which is just fine by him .
he said he could imagine that a berlin-curated show presenting the european perspective could possibly grace the galleries of moma in the future , thereby presenting a more balanced whole . numbers grow , opening hours extended in the meantime , the number of visitors hoping to gain entry continues to grow .
at times , the line wraps more than two times around the building .
and despite the museum 's decision to extend opening hours for the final weeks , the wait remains long . one industrious berlin-based engineer sent a four-page plan to the organizers detailing how to do away with the lines , which among other things , suggested the distribution of waiting numbers .
in response , according to newspaper reports , he was told that the lines were " necessary to create publicity . " according to a security official quoted in german papers , an ambulance has been called to the museum at least once a day to cart away would-be museum goers for whom the stress of contributing to the shows " publicity " has proven too much . some among them may be inclined to add their voices to the growing number of critics , though they are far more likely to bemoan practical considerations as opposed to the high-minded nature of the modern art canon .
others , however , will continue to view the chance to see this " once in a lifetime " exhibition as well worth the wait . editor 's note : while dw-tv is one of four media partners of moma in berlin , deutsche welle played no part in organizing or curating the exhibition . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de record year for berlin tourism expected the number of visitors to berlin may reach a postwar high in 2004 , berlin 's tourism organization revealed monday .

opposition voices have questioned his wisdom . german defense minister peter struck on tuesday set out for a summer tour of military bases to see how the current restructuring of the national armed forces is progressing .
in line with eu and nato defense policies , the bundeswehr is reshaping its troops to be better prepared for peacekeeping or peace-enforcing missions abroad . however , struck is facing a hard time explaining his decision to close numerous bundeswehr bases across the country , which will coincide with the large-scale withdrawal of us forces from western germany : struck had gained wide respect for starting to overhaul the national armed forces and handling out-of-area peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and the balkans .
while he has given up pipe smoking after the stroke he suffered in june , he has not reduced his ambitions to push through the biggest restructuring of the bundeswehr to date . troops to be cut down to 250,000 the emphasis will be on training mobile units to be employed quickly in crisis areas outside nato territory .
in the next couple of years , troop strength will be reduced by 30,000 to 250,000 - a measure long overdue after the end of the cold war .
the number of military bases will also be cut drastically .
details on the closures will be announced in november . opposition conservative defense spokesman christian schmidt warned about rushing into defense decisions now that it has been announced that the united states will be withdrawing a large contingent of their 70,000 troops now stationed in germany .
schmidt called on the defense minister on tuesday to ensure that the communities affected will receive some sort of compensation for the looming economic losses . " i myself come from a region which will be largely affected by the withdrawal of us troops with the bases in bamberg and würzburg soon to be deserted , " schmidt told dw-radio . looming economic and social problems " we ’ ve always come out in favor of providing financial help for restructuring programs after such a pull-out of troops .
but at present , there are no such means available , neither at federal , nor at community level .
we ’ ll see massive social and economic problems in the affected regions .
i ’ m optimistic that policy-makers will not leave these communities to their own devices and raise restructuring funds , probably also out of european union coffers . " schmidt , as well as bavaria ’ s christian social union leader edmund stoiber , is hoping that the defense minister will readjust his original plan to close down german military bases to the realities created by the us troop pull-out .
both theorized that a number of abandoned us bases may in the future be used by the bundeswehr instead . future planning is questioned “ i can only suggest thinking harder about harmonizing us and national defense policies , said schmidt .
" struck is expected to close down up to 100 bundeswehr bases over the next few years .
us bases will vanish too .
i ’ m not convinced that everything has been carefully coordinated yet .
i believe there ’ s a need to reconsider the planned scope of closures here . ” but the cash-strapped defense minister is unlikely to effect major changes .
many of germany 's military installations , struck argues , weren ’ t needed any longer 10 years ago , but the government was afforded the luxury of maintaining them anyway .
now , with a revamped defense strategy in place and all the budgetary constraints at hand , he says , that doesn ’ t make sense anymore . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us troop withdrawal raises concerns washington ’ s biggest military reorganization in 50 years has caused ripples around the world , but while the nations due to wave good-bye to us forces have issued muted regret , criticism is gaining pace in the us .

germany is the world ’ s leading producer of wind power .
but as land sites for wind parks become increasingly scarce , the future of the country ’ s wind industry lies on the open sea . in the northern german region of schleswig-holstein , you can ’ t miss them : the wind turbines sprinkled along the landscape are as prominent as the cattle grazing on the grass . but can these giant modern windmills be placed in the middle of the ocean ?
the residents of north frisia are willing to try .
for them , as well as many others living in the schleswig-holstein area , much of their livelihood depends on the presence of the wind turbines generating energy from the constant breeze coming off the north sea .
klaus rave , vice-president of the european wind energy association , says the region ’ s communities had a vision 15 years ago that they could produce 25 percent of their electricity through wind energy by 2010 .
and they succeeded .
“ we promoted discussions and expert reports , and we had the courage to openly say we were considering this , ” rave says .
“ we were able to achieve our goal in 2002 and we ’ re continuing to work with this in mind and concentrating on future possibilities . ”
a people ’ s project but the space on land is limited .
so the local residents designed and financed project butendiek , an offshore wind park some 20 miles off the coast in the north sea .
it will cost a total of 400 million euro -lrb- $ 475 million -rrb- to anchor the planned eighty wind turbines to the ocean floor .
“ our experiences led us to say , if wind parks have been so successful inland , why don ’ t we build them in the sea , ” says rave .
but they didn ’ t want to leave this undertaking to a large corporation , he adds .
“ we wanted to do it ourselves , with our own capabilities and know-how . ”

“ wind parks have been very successful in north frisia , so that creates an acceptance for the economic aspects of the offshore park , ” says hans feddersen , sales manager for project butendiek .
he says 8,500 north frisians have decided to finance the project - and not just for environmental reasons .
“ of course , there are also opponents , but the project sounds a lot better when you tie the whirring of the wind with your wallet , ” feddersen says .
the people in the region would rather grab this opportunity for investment rather than not be actively involved .
opposition remains there is , however , much controversy surrounding the building of offshore wind parks .
for one , many potential investors still see the project as a financial risk .
also , contractors have to gain permission to prohibit shipping in the wind park area .

even as health experts warn that german youngsters are getting fatter , obesity levels continue to climb among the country 's migrant children population .
television and fast food are n't the only culprits . on a sunny august day , ten-year-old murat -lrb- name changed -rrb- lies on his back on a grassy lawn at a public outdoor swimming pool in berlin 's wedding district , home to a large immigrant population . licking a chocolate ice cream , murat , who is of turkish origin , might sound like a normal youngster , but he does n't look like one .

that 's why i take him for a swim here , " his mother ayse -lrb- name changed -rrb- told dw-world .
the ice cream , she said , is a reward for him doing two laps in the pool .
" besides , it 's so hot , " she added . murat , who said his favorite food is nutella -lrb- a chocolate spread -rrb- , is not alone .
in past years , a rise in weight levels among children from germany 's immigrant families , a largely ignored group in obesity research until recently , has fuelled concern among health authorities . " sitting on a powder keg " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister renate künast is spearheading the drive for healthy nutrition to bring down obesity levels .
the german minister for consumer protection and agriculture , renate künast , estimated this year that every fifth child and every third teenager in germany is overweight .
the number of obese children signing up for school has risen three-fold compared to a decade ago .
" the country is sitting on a powder keg , " künast warned . though there are no country-wide studies on the prevalence of obesity among migrant children , statistics on the problem in cities with high foreign populations leave little room for doubt . in frankfurt , home to around 180,000 immigrants from 180 nations , research on the number of those children who joined school this year found that 12.5 percent were overweight . experts say that a six-year-old who has a body mass index of 15.4 is considered of normal weight .
the frankfurt statistics showed that moroccan and turkish children , in particular , had a body mass index of more than 18 percent , at 18.4 and 22 percent respectively .
among ten-year-olds , turkish children weighed the most at 34 percent , compared to 19 percent for german youngsters . eating to the point of disorder " it 's alarming , " holger meireis , head of frankfurt 's child and youth department told dw-world .
" if you interpret immigration in a broad sense , beyond borders of nationality , then almost 50 percent of frankfurt 's foreign population is overweight .
it ca n't be ignored any longer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neukölln is home to a large muslim population .
dr rainer moehl , a physician in neukölln , an immigrant-dominated berlin neighborhood , agreed that obesity was a widespread problem among his patients .
" by the time children in turkish and arab families reach school-going age , there 's usually a clear gender-specific difference : it 's mostly boys who develop obesity during puberty , while girls have eating disorders like bulimia , " moehl said . he warned that overweight children are likely to develop problems such as mobility and spinal and metabolic disorders , high blood pressure , diabetes and depression . filling the stomach cheaply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that low income and education levels can have disastrous consequences for obese people .
while experts point to the usual suspects - too much television , too little activity , fast food and sweets - they agree that the spread of obesity among migrant children is largely tied to their financial and social situation . jeffrey butler from the health department in berlin 's wedding district , which holds the dubious record of being home to berlin 's pudgiest kids -lrb- 20.7 percent body mass index -rrb- , points to the fact that the neighborhood is also one of the capital 's poorest . with an unemployment rate of around 24 percent , low education levels and around 26 percent of children and teenagers living on welfare , wedding has acquired notoriety as a social flashpoint . " most of the families here do n't have the means to buy healthy food , even if they wanted to , " butler said .
" it 's just easier to shop for packaged and fast food that fills you up . " calories and stress others caution that the problem has much more complex cultural reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations in a döner shop in berlin .
meat is a staple among turks .
" the common family meal is the focal point in a turkish home , and traditional turkish cuisine is actually healthy , " jutta kolletzki , a therapist who runs a counseling and treatment center for weight-loss and eating disorders in frankfurt , said .
" but meals are cooked with so much sugar and fat that it turns into a real calorie bomb , " she said . kolletzki added that many immigrants often are n't well-informed about what constitutes healthy nutrition .
differing perspectives of health also contribute to the problem , she said .
" in traditional families , a tubby child is usually considered well-fed and a sign of prosperity rather than as a problem , " kolletzki explained . she also warned that children straddling two cultures are often under a lot of emotional stress .
" separations or moving from one country to another is difficult for a child , " she said .
" eating more is a way of coping with it . " battle of the bulge bildunterschrift : children take part in a weight-loss program at germany 's baltic sea coast .
obesity among migrant children is now recognized as a serious problem , judging by the number of initiatives and projects springing up in several german cities to tackle it . most involve networking with kindergartens and schools to encourage them to introduce healthy breakfasts and impress upon the kids and parents the benefits of a healthy diet and exercise .
the emphasis is on prevention , taking into account cultural differences and using interpreters to reach the target groups . minister künast is kicking off a major nationwide project in september involving parents , health insurance companies and the food industry .
a spokeswoman at the ministry stressed that though this was n't a special programs for migrant children as yet , they were working on it . germany , it seems , is determined to win the battle of the bulge and avoid the rather drastic scenario predicted in a recent british survey , which suggested that the younger generation would be the first to die before their parents .

even as health experts warn that german youngsters are getting fatter , obesity levels continue to climb among the country 's migrant children population .
television and fast food are n't the only culprits . on a sunny august day , ten-year-old murat -lrb- name changed -rrb- lies on his back on a grassy lawn at a public outdoor swimming pool in berlin 's wedding district , home to a large immigrant population . licking a chocolate ice cream , murat , who is of turkish origin , might sound like a normal youngster , but he does n't look like one .
clad in an " l " size pair of swimming trunks , the porky fourth-grader tips the scales at nearly 44 kilos -lrb- 97 lbs . -rrb- . " the school authorities said he needs to exercise and lose weight .
that 's why i take him for a swim here , " his mother ayse -lrb- name changed -rrb- told dw-world .
the ice cream , she said , is a reward for him doing two laps in the pool .
" besides , it 's so hot , " she added . murat , who said his favorite food is nutella -lrb- a chocolate spread -rrb- , is not alone .
in past years , a rise in weight levels among children from germany 's immigrant families , a largely ignored group in obesity research until recently , has fuelled concern among health authorities . " sitting on a powder keg " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister renate künast is spearheading the drive for healthy nutrition to bring down obesity levels .
the german minister for consumer protection and agriculture , renate künast , estimated this year that every fifth child and every third teenager in germany is overweight .
the number of obese children signing up for school has risen three-fold compared to a decade ago .
" the country is sitting on a powder keg , " künast warned . though there are no country-wide studies on the prevalence of obesity among migrant children , statistics on the problem in cities with high foreign populations leave little room for doubt . in frankfurt , home to around 180,000 immigrants from 180 nations , research on the number of those children who joined school this year found that 12.5 percent were overweight . experts say that a six-year-old who has a body mass index of 15.4 is considered of normal weight .
the frankfurt statistics showed that moroccan and turkish children , in particular , had a body mass index of more than 18 percent , at 18.4 and 22 percent respectively .
among ten-year-olds , turkish children weighed the most at 34 percent , compared to 19 percent for german youngsters . eating to the point of disorder " it 's alarming , " holger meireis , head of frankfurt 's child and youth department told dw-world .
" if you interpret immigration in a broad sense , beyond borders of nationality , then almost 50 percent of frankfurt 's foreign population is overweight .
it ca n't be ignored any longer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neukölln is home to a large muslim population .
dr rainer moehl , a physician in neukölln , an immigrant-dominated berlin neighborhood , agreed that obesity was a widespread problem among his patients .
" by the time children in turkish and arab families reach school-going age , there 's usually a clear gender-specific difference : it 's mostly boys who develop obesity during puberty , while girls have eating disorders like bulimia , " moehl said . he warned that overweight children are likely to develop problems such as mobility and spinal and metabolic disorders , high blood pressure , diabetes and depression . filling the stomach cheaply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that low income and education levels can have disastrous consequences for obese people .
while experts point to the usual suspects - too much television , too little activity , fast food and sweets - they agree that the spread of obesity among migrant children is largely tied to their financial and social situation . jeffrey butler from the health department in berlin 's wedding district , which holds the dubious record of being home to berlin 's pudgiest kids -lrb- 20.7 percent body mass index -rrb- , points to the fact that the neighborhood is also one of the capital 's poorest . with an unemployment rate of around 24 percent , low education levels and around 26 percent of children and teenagers living on welfare , wedding has acquired notoriety as a social flashpoint . " most of the families here do n't have the means to buy healthy food , even if they wanted to , " butler said .
" it 's just easier to shop for packaged and fast food that fills you up . " calories and stress others caution that the problem has much more complex cultural reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations in a döner shop in berlin .
meat is a staple among turks .
" the common family meal is the focal point in a turkish home , and traditional turkish cuisine is actually healthy , " jutta kolletzki , a therapist who runs a counseling and treatment center for weight-loss and eating disorders in frankfurt , said .
" but meals are cooked with so much sugar and fat that it turns into a real calorie bomb , " she said . kolletzki added that many immigrants often are n't well-informed about what constitutes healthy nutrition .
differing perspectives of health also contribute to the problem , she said .
" in traditional families , a tubby child is usually considered well-fed and a sign of prosperity rather than as a problem , " kolletzki explained . she also warned that children straddling two cultures are often under a lot of emotional stress .
" separations or moving from one country to another is difficult for a child , " she said .
" eating more is a way of coping with it . " battle of the bulge bildunterschrift : children take part in a weight-loss program at germany 's baltic sea coast .
obesity among migrant children is now recognized as a serious problem , judging by the number of initiatives and projects springing up in several german cities to tackle it . most involve networking with kindergartens and schools to encourage them to introduce healthy breakfasts and impress upon the kids and parents the benefits of a healthy diet and exercise .
the emphasis is on prevention , taking into account cultural differences and using interpreters to reach the target groups . minister künast is kicking off a major nationwide project in september involving parents , health insurance companies and the food industry .
a spokeswoman at the ministry stressed that though this was n't a special programs for migrant children as yet , they were working on it . germany , it seems , is determined to win the battle of the bulge and avoid the rather drastic scenario predicted in a recent british survey , which suggested that the younger generation would be the first to die before their parents .

now , a notable art critic is accusing the new york curators of cultural colonialism . judging by the huge number of visitors - more than 800,000 at last count - some of whom have lined up for more than eight hours to gain entry into the special exhibition of the new york-based museum of modern art 's -lrb- moma -rrb- show at berlin 's national gallery , it has been a huge success . many even credit the mania surrounding the display of more than 200 paintings and sculptures from moma 's famous collection with helping to spur tourism to germany 's capital to a post-world war ii high , and there is no indication that the steady flow of visitors will slack off before it closes on sept .
19 . however , increasing numbers of art fans who have had to wait - sometimes in the hot summer sun - are less inclined to view the exhibition as a triumph , and some have even accused the organizers of deliberately keeping the lines long in order to stir up publicity .
the fact that those willing to pay € 27 -lrb- $ 33 -rrb- can avoid the long lines entirely does stink a bit of cultural elitism . now werner spies , a noted art historian , one time friend of pablo picasso and max ernst , and former director of the national museum of modern art at the georges pompidou center in paris , has joined the critics . but the nature of his criticism is different .
in an article in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday , spies accused the new york-based curators - who decided on the exhibition 's content with no input from their berlin hosts - of cultural colonialism . american art the culmination of modern development ? the crux of spies ' criticism centers around the portion of the exhibit looking at modern art in the second half of the last century , which , compared to the first half , includes almost no selections from european masters .
in short , spies accuses the new york-based curators of falsely claiming that the " new american painting , " which emerged in the postwar years , is the culmination of the 20th century 's modern art movement . for spies , the failure to include the works of matisse , max ernst , dubuffet and giacometti , is inexcusable and not merely an oversight but suggests that moma curators have an agenda to determine the so-called canon of contemporary art to the americans ' advantage . " the americans who chose the selections are engaging in cultural politics , " he wrote .
" for them , the vatican of 20th century aesthetic , it is about establishing the canon of modern art … and the new york museum can in berlin - in an expansionist way - present american art as the culmination of that development . " in response to spies ' criticisms , peter raue , the director of the " friends of the national gallery , " which helped to bring the exhibition to berlin , told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the exhibit clearly shows the american view , which is just fine by him .
he said he could imagine that a berlin-curated show presenting the european perspective could possibly grace the galleries of moma in the future , thereby presenting a more balanced whole . numbers grow , opening hours extended in the meantime , the number of visitors hoping to gain entry continues to grow .
at times , the line wraps more than two times around the building .
and despite the museum 's decision to extend opening hours for the final weeks , the wait remains long . one industrious berlin-based engineer sent a four-page plan to the organizers detailing how to do away with the lines , which among other things , suggested the distribution of waiting numbers .
in response , according to newspaper reports , he was told that the lines were " necessary to create publicity . " according to a security official quoted in german papers , an ambulance has been called to the museum at least once a day to cart away would-be museum goers for whom the stress of contributing to the shows " publicity " has proven too much . some among them may be inclined to add their voices to the growing number of critics , though they are far more likely to bemoan practical considerations as opposed to the high-minded nature of the modern art canon .
others , however , will continue to view the chance to see this " once in a lifetime " exhibition as well worth the wait . editor 's note : while dw-tv is one of four media partners of moma in berlin , deutsche welle played no part in organizing or curating the exhibition . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de record year for berlin tourism expected the number of visitors to berlin may reach a postwar high in 2004 , berlin 's tourism organization revealed monday .

now , a notable art critic is accusing the new york curators of cultural colonialism . judging by the huge number of visitors - more than 800,000 at last count - some of whom have lined up for more than eight hours to gain entry into the special exhibition of the new york-based museum of modern art 's -lrb- moma -rrb- show at berlin 's national gallery , it has been a huge success . many even credit the mania surrounding the display of more than 200 paintings and sculptures from moma 's famous collection with helping to spur tourism to germany 's capital to a post-world war ii high , and there is no indication that the steady flow of visitors will slack off before it closes on sept .
19 . however , increasing numbers of art fans who have had to wait - sometimes in the hot summer sun - are less inclined to view the exhibition as a triumph , and some have even accused the organizers of deliberately keeping the lines long in order to stir up publicity .
the fact that those willing to pay € 27 -lrb- $ 33 -rrb- can avoid the long lines entirely does stink a bit of cultural elitism . now werner spies , a noted art historian , one time friend of pablo picasso and max ernst , and former director of the national museum of modern art at the georges pompidou center in paris , has joined the critics . but the nature of his criticism is different .
in an article in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday , spies accused the new york-based curators - who decided on the exhibition 's content with no input from their berlin hosts - of cultural colonialism . american art the culmination of modern development ? the crux of spies ' criticism centers around the portion of the exhibit looking at modern art in the second half of the last century , which , compared to the first half , includes almost no selections from european masters .
in short , spies accuses the new york-based curators of falsely claiming that the " new american painting , " which emerged in the postwar years , is the culmination of the 20th century 's modern art movement . for spies , the failure to include the works of matisse , max ernst , dubuffet and giacometti , is inexcusable and not merely an oversight but suggests that moma curators have an agenda to determine the so-called canon of contemporary art to the americans ' advantage . " the americans who chose the selections are engaging in cultural politics , " he wrote .
" for them , the vatican of 20th century aesthetic , it is about establishing the canon of modern art … and the new york museum can in berlin - in an expansionist way - present american art as the culmination of that development . " in response to spies ' criticisms , peter raue , the director of the " friends of the national gallery , " which helped to bring the exhibition to berlin , told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the exhibit clearly shows the american view , which is just fine by him .
he said he could imagine that a berlin-curated show presenting the european perspective could possibly grace the galleries of moma in the future , thereby presenting a more balanced whole . numbers grow , opening hours extended in the meantime , the number of visitors hoping to gain entry continues to grow .
at times , the line wraps more than two times around the building .
and despite the museum 's decision to extend opening hours for the final weeks , the wait remains long . one industrious berlin-based engineer sent a four-page plan to the organizers detailing how to do away with the lines , which among other things , suggested the distribution of waiting numbers .
in response , according to newspaper reports , he was told that the lines were " necessary to create publicity . " according to a security official quoted in german papers , an ambulance has been called to the museum at least once a day to cart away would-be museum goers for whom the stress of contributing to the shows " publicity " has proven too much . some among them may be inclined to add their voices to the growing number of critics , though they are far more likely to bemoan practical considerations as opposed to the high-minded nature of the modern art canon .
others , however , will continue to view the chance to see this " once in a lifetime " exhibition as well worth the wait . editor 's note : while dw-tv is one of four media partners of moma in berlin , deutsche welle played no part in organizing or curating the exhibition . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de record year for berlin tourism expected the number of visitors to berlin may reach a postwar high in 2004 , berlin 's tourism organization revealed monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.08.2004 moma berlin exhibition slammed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some art fans are unhappy with the show unhappy with the long entrance lines , art fans are directing criticism at the organizers of berlin 's moma exhibition .
now , a notable art critic is accusing the new york curators of cultural colonialism . judging by the huge number of visitors - more than 800,000 at last count - some of whom have lined up for more than eight hours to gain entry into the special exhibition of the new york-based museum of modern art 's -lrb- moma -rrb- show at berlin 's national gallery , it has been a huge success . many even credit the mania surrounding the display of more than 200 paintings and sculptures from moma 's famous collection with helping to spur tourism to germany 's capital to a post-world war ii high , and there is no indication that the steady flow of visitors will slack off before it closes on sept .
19 . however , increasing numbers of art fans who have had to wait - sometimes in the hot summer sun - are less inclined to view the exhibition as a triumph , and some have even accused the organizers of deliberately keeping the lines long in order to stir up publicity .
the fact that those willing to pay € 27 -lrb- $ 33 -rrb- can avoid the long lines entirely does stink a bit of cultural elitism . now werner spies , a noted art historian , one time friend of pablo picasso and max ernst , and former director of the national museum of modern art at the georges pompidou center in paris , has joined the critics . but the nature of his criticism is different .
in an article in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday , spies accused the new york-based curators - who decided on the exhibition 's content with no input from their berlin hosts - of cultural colonialism . american art the culmination of modern development ? the crux of spies ' criticism centers around the portion of the exhibit looking at modern art in the second half of the last century , which , compared to the first half , includes almost no selections from european masters .
in short , spies accuses the new york-based curators of falsely claiming that the " new american painting , " which emerged in the postwar years , is the culmination of the 20th century 's modern art movement . for spies , the failure to include the works of matisse , max ernst , dubuffet and giacometti , is inexcusable and not merely an oversight but suggests that moma curators have an agenda to determine the so-called canon of contemporary art to the americans ' advantage . " the americans who chose the selections are engaging in cultural politics , " he wrote .
" for them , the vatican of 20th century aesthetic , it is about establishing the canon of modern art … and the new york museum can in berlin - in an expansionist way - present american art as the culmination of that development . " in response to spies ' criticisms , peter raue , the director of the " friends of the national gallery , " which helped to bring the exhibition to berlin , told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the exhibit clearly shows the american view , which is just fine by him .
he said he could imagine that a berlin-curated show presenting the european perspective could possibly grace the galleries of moma in the future , thereby presenting a more balanced whole . numbers grow , opening hours extended in the meantime , the number of visitors hoping to gain entry continues to grow .

opposition voices have questioned his wisdom . german defense minister peter struck on tuesday set out for a summer tour of military bases to see how the current restructuring of the national armed forces is progressing .
in line with eu and nato defense policies , the bundeswehr is reshaping its troops to be better prepared for peacekeeping or peace-enforcing missions abroad . however , struck is facing a hard time explaining his decision to close numerous bundeswehr bases across the country , which will coincide with the large-scale withdrawal of us forces from western germany : struck had gained wide respect for starting to overhaul the national armed forces and handling out-of-area peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and the balkans .
while he has given up pipe smoking after the stroke he suffered in june , he has not reduced his ambitions to push through the biggest restructuring of the bundeswehr to date . troops to be cut down to 250,000 the emphasis will be on training mobile units to be employed quickly in crisis areas outside nato territory .
in the next couple of years , troop strength will be reduced by 30,000 to 250,000 - a measure long overdue after the end of the cold war .
the number of military bases will also be cut drastically .
details on the closures will be announced in november . opposition conservative defense spokesman christian schmidt warned about rushing into defense decisions now that it has been announced that the united states will be withdrawing a large contingent of their 70,000 troops now stationed in germany .
schmidt called on the defense minister on tuesday to ensure that the communities affected will receive some sort of compensation for the looming economic losses . " i myself come from a region which will be largely affected by the withdrawal of us troops with the bases in bamberg and würzburg soon to be deserted , " schmidt told dw-radio . looming economic and social problems " we ’ ve always come out in favor of providing financial help for restructuring programs after such a pull-out of troops .
but at present , there are no such means available , neither at federal , nor at community level .
we ’ ll see massive social and economic problems in the affected regions .
i ’ m optimistic that policy-makers will not leave these communities to their own devices and raise restructuring funds , probably also out of european union coffers . " schmidt , as well as bavaria ’ s christian social union leader edmund stoiber , is hoping that the defense minister will readjust his original plan to close down german military bases to the realities created by the us troop pull-out .
both theorized that a number of abandoned us bases may in the future be used by the bundeswehr instead . future planning is questioned “ i can only suggest thinking harder about harmonizing us and national defense policies , said schmidt .
" struck is expected to close down up to 100 bundeswehr bases over the next few years .
us bases will vanish too .
i ’ m not convinced that everything has been carefully coordinated yet .
i believe there ’ s a need to reconsider the planned scope of closures here . ” but the cash-strapped defense minister is unlikely to effect major changes .
many of germany 's military installations , struck argues , weren ’ t needed any longer 10 years ago , but the government was afforded the luxury of maintaining them anyway .

while he has given up pipe smoking after the stroke he suffered in june , he has not reduced his ambitions to push through the biggest restructuring of the bundeswehr to date . troops to be cut down to 250,000 the emphasis will be on training mobile units to be employed quickly in crisis areas outside nato territory .
in the next couple of years , troop strength will be reduced by 30,000 to 250,000 - a measure long overdue after the end of the cold war .
the number of military bases will also be cut drastically .
details on the closures will be announced in november . opposition conservative defense spokesman christian schmidt warned about rushing into defense decisions now that it has been announced that the united states will be withdrawing a large contingent of their 70,000 troops now stationed in germany .
schmidt called on the defense minister on tuesday to ensure that the communities affected will receive some sort of compensation for the looming economic losses . " i myself come from a region which will be largely affected by the withdrawal of us troops with the bases in bamberg and würzburg soon to be deserted , " schmidt told dw-radio . looming economic and social problems " we ’ ve always come out in favor of providing financial help for restructuring programs after such a pull-out of troops .
but at present , there are no such means available , neither at federal , nor at community level .
we ’ ll see massive social and economic problems in the affected regions .
i ’ m optimistic that policy-makers will not leave these communities to their own devices and raise restructuring funds , probably also out of european union coffers . " schmidt , as well as bavaria ’ s christian social union leader edmund stoiber , is hoping that the defense minister will readjust his original plan to close down german military bases to the realities created by the us troop pull-out .
both theorized that a number of abandoned us bases may in the future be used by the bundeswehr instead . future planning is questioned “ i can only suggest thinking harder about harmonizing us and national defense policies , said schmidt .
" struck is expected to close down up to 100 bundeswehr bases over the next few years .
us bases will vanish too .
i ’ m not convinced that everything has been carefully coordinated yet .
i believe there ’ s a need to reconsider the planned scope of closures here . ” but the cash-strapped defense minister is unlikely to effect major changes .
many of germany 's military installations , struck argues , weren ’ t needed any longer 10 years ago , but the government was afforded the luxury of maintaining them anyway .
now , with a revamped defense strategy in place and all the budgetary constraints at hand , he says , that doesn ’ t make sense anymore . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us troop withdrawal raises concerns washington ’ s biggest military reorganization in 50 years has caused ripples around the world , but while the nations due to wave good-bye to us forces have issued muted regret , criticism is gaining pace in the us .

now eu reality has hit them - a disappointment for many . " some things were meant to become cheaper - german beer , for example , but it still costs as much as before , " one woman told german public broadcaster wdr .
" phoning people and using the internet was supposed to become cheaper , because there 's more competition .
but nothing 's happening , which is something that i 'm personally sad about , because i 've been waiting for things to change . " another woman agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : market square in warsaw " i 'm only hearing about the positive things in radio and tv and reading about it in the newspapers - that our exports are up and that it 's going to get better and better for us , " she said .
" but i 'm not seeing that happening . " she added that meat was a third more expensive now and prices for medicines had also increased .
pensions on the other hand had stayed the same , she said . beef and poultry prices have indeed increased by about 18 percent , according to a report by the national bank of poland .
on the other hand , few things have become cheaper : electronics , wine and beer have just gone down 0.5 percent in price . farming business is booming polish farmers on the other hand are more upbeat .
a few months ago , they were still considered the problem children of poland 's eu accession .
badly organized and working on small farms , officials worried that farmers would not be able to compete internationally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a farmer offering vegetables in warsaw but business is booming : asparagus , fruit , potatoes , wheat and mushrooms from poland have become bestsellers in the eu .
farmers also have overcome their initial hesitation to apply for financial help from brussels . " if 1.3 million farmers are able to apply for funds , that 's something that we can be proud of , " polish agriculture minister wojciech olejniczak told wdr .
" and we 'll convince those that are still hesitating - maybe not tomorrow , but definitely by the end of the year . " fishermen struggle to adjust the country 's fishermen , however , say they are suffering rather than benefiting from eu accession : they now have to deal with fishing limits imposed by the union and eu incentives not to fish at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists protested against the eu fishing policies in berlin as fishermen throw millions of fish back into the sea because they are too small " the only thing i can do is trample on the catch and throw it back into the sea , " one fisherman told wdr .
" but everyone wants to work .
i ca n't imaging giving up so quickly .
it 's horror for me .
i 'll be spending the -lrb- incentive -rrb- money and at some point there wo n't be any more .
and what happens then ? " it 's a problem polish used car sellers do n't face at the moment .
in may and june alone , they imported more than 160,000 cars from western europe - that 's five times as many as during the entire year of 2003 . thomas rautenberg -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro goes east the 10 new eu countries are expected to eventually adopt the euro as their currency .

this news has raised concerns in russia , which has called for a detailed explanation of the military re-organization .

moscow is concerned that as the nato alliance expands , the united states will station troops along its borders .
further , it continues to worry about the future presence of western troops in energy-rich centra asian , which russia once dominated .
the russian foreign ministry said in a statement that , “ our view of these plans will depend on the spelled-out details , and whether they pose a danger to russia ’ s national interests . ”
moscow ’ s statement stressed that it expected washington to adhere to previous agreements that , in moscow ’ s view , ban the united states from stationing its troops in the baltics or the caucasus . democrats seize on bush 's plan but while the germans were putting on a brave face and the russians remained edgy , opposition to the withdrawal in the united states was more vociferous .

it 's going to weaken our national security , " said richard holbrooke , a kerry foreign policy adviser and former ambassador to the un and germany under former president clinton , in a widely reported statement .
" it is not going to save us money .
it will cost billions of dollars to bring these troops home . " holbrooke also focused on the economic demands which the troop redeployment would shift from the host countries back to the united states .
" germany , south korea and japan , which will see the biggest cuts , all spend billions of dollars to support the troops .
and i am very concerned about this . " holbrooke also rejected president george w. bush 's assertion that bringing the troops home would make it easier to rapidly deploy them to global trouble spots .
he called bases in germany , south korea and okinawa " essential " along with other forward deployments . " even in the modern world , airplanes take time to get places , " holbrooke said .
" this is a weakening of our traditional ties to our closest allies just when we need them most . " ex-general clark warns of timing in terror war another kerry-supporter , retired army general wesley clark , warned of a military mistake in the making .
" as we face a global war on terror with al qaeda active in more than 60 countries , now is not the time to pull back our forces . " clark , who commanded nato and us forces in europe from 1997 to 2000 , added in his statement : " this ill-conceived move and its timing seem politically motivated rather than designed to strengthen our national security . " kerry to publicly address restructuring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential hopeful john kerry is expected to criticize the us troop plans .
kerry himself is expected to voice his own opposition to the bush administration 's plans when he gives a speech to the veterans of foreign wars in cincinnati on wednesday .
it will be a chance for the presidential candidate make clear one of the distinct strategic differences between himself and george w. bush .
kerry is preparing to argue that the withdrawal of troops from europe and asia threatens to undercut alliances and weakens america 's ability to project its power overseas , according to michael meehan , a senior adviser in the democratic party , quoted in the financial times .
meehan told the ft that kerry will make a " sweeping critique " of the realignment at the convention in cincinnati , the same venue where the president this week announced the planned withdrawal of a third of us forces from their foreign bases . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us troop pullout to hit local german economies the impact of us plans to pull some 70,000 troops out of europe and asia is likely to be felt most acutely in germany - especially in smaller towns whose economies depend on the us presence .

only two pds members now serve as parliamentarians because they were directly elected by their voting precinct . experts said the gains were to be expected as more and more people are unhappy with the government 's reforms . " during times of economic and social uncertainty , voters turn away from large parties , " everhard holtmann , a political scientist at martin luther university in halle-wittenberg , told focus money magazine . holtmann added that the greens , now a junior partner in germany 's governing coalition , experienced similar gains when they promoted environmental issues that had been widely neglected by other parties during the 1980s . pds could lead government in brandenburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and brandenburg premier matthias platezck -lrb- both spd -rrb- hope to regain voters ' support by the sept .

19 . latest surveys show the pds overtaking the spd to become the strongest political force in the state , which is currently governed by a spd-led coalition with the cdu .
so far , the pds is a junior coalition partner in the northeastern german state of mecklenburg-western pommerania as well as the city state of berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters during a demonstration in 2003 the extreme right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which the government has unsuccessfully tried to ban because of its neo-nazi platform , is also getting increasing support from voters . in the eastern german state of saxony , where elections will also take place sept .
19 , the npd could get 5 percent or more of the vote , according to surveys .
the npd also supports the reform protests . but holtmann said he did n't expect a major political upset . " protest voters do n't change their basic convictions , " he said .
" they mainly want to teach politicians a lesson . " chancellor : no further changes to reforms the chancellor , meanwhile , said wednesday that he did not support further changes to recently approved welfare reforms , which have led to demonstrations in mainly eastern german cities during the last weeks . responding to the protests , the government has made some minor changes to the reforms . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder fights off ex-communists in state election at a party conference in havel , chancellor gerhard schröder kicks off the campaign in the state of brandenburg , where unpopular reforms have pushed the former communists in the pds party to the top of polls .

the daimlerchrysler vehicle presented to him had something special under the hood : hydrogen fuel cell technology . the gleaming new model sitting in the car park outside schröder 's office in berlin is one of the prototype models fitted with the f-cell hydrogen technology that daimlerchrysler hopes will revolutionize motoring and help in the fight to reduce carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions from cars . the chancellor will have one year to test the car out as part of the company 's on-going research into greener fuel possibilities which has seen 60 cars enter production and deployed for testing around the world . the fuel cells which power the car use a combination of hydrogen and oxygen which makes them and the vehicle itself environmentally friendly . its only emission is water , which is so pure that daimlerchrysler claim its fit for human consumption .

the auto manufacturer hopes it will cost around the same as regular cars . daimlerchrysler has spent over € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- in the development process and already enjoys more success than initially hoped for this stage by producing vehicles fit for use . the german car giant first grabbed the headlines with its hydrogen fuel program with its necar 4 model in 1999 .

only two pds members now serve as parliamentarians because they were directly elected by their voting precinct . experts said the gains were to be expected as more and more people are unhappy with the government 's reforms . " during times of economic and social uncertainty , voters turn away from large parties , " everhard holtmann , a political scientist at martin luther university in halle-wittenberg , told focus money magazine . holtmann added that the greens , now a junior partner in germany 's governing coalition , experienced similar gains when they promoted environmental issues that had been widely neglected by other parties during the 1980s . pds could lead government in brandenburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and brandenburg premier matthias platezck -lrb- both spd -rrb- hope to regain voters ' support by the sept .

the russian foreign ministry said in a statement that , “ our view of these plans will depend on the spelled-out details , and whether they pose a danger to russia ’ s national interests . ”
moscow ’ s statement stressed that it expected washington to adhere to previous agreements that , in moscow ’ s view , ban the united states from stationing its troops in the baltics or the caucasus . democrats seize on bush 's plan but while the germans were putting on a brave face and the russians remained edgy , opposition to the withdrawal in the united states was more vociferous .

" germany , south korea and japan , which will see the biggest cuts , all spend billions of dollars to support the troops .

the russian foreign ministry said in a statement that , “ our view of these plans will depend on the spelled-out details , and whether they pose a danger to russia ’ s national interests . ”
moscow ’ s statement stressed that it expected washington to adhere to previous agreements that , in moscow ’ s view , ban the united states from stationing its troops in the baltics or the caucasus . democrats seize on bush 's plan but while the germans were putting on a brave face and the russians remained edgy , opposition to the withdrawal in the united states was more vociferous .

the politicians , however , have been doing their best to hide their displeasure . germany regrets decision but understands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary donald rumsfeld with german defense minister peter struck german defense minister peter struck said in a statement that he regretted the withdrawal , but washington had no choice .
" that 's a big loss to a lot of regions , " he said .
" but the decision of the us president is without alternative . " karsten voigt , berlin 's coordinator for german-american relations , said germany would remain the largest base for us troops in europe and security in europe was not at risk . " but , nevertheless , the withdrawal of troops is a loss , of course .
we regret it ; the american soldiers were welcome here .
but it is a sign of success at the same time - the success of having overcome the cold war and european division , " voigt told reporters . the us plans to move about half of its foreign-based troops , with many heading back to the states and others from european bases penciled in for deployment in the former soviet baltic republics .
this news has raised concerns in russia , which has called for a detailed explanation of the military re-organization .
russia suspicious of us intentions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. forces could be on russia 's doorstep .
moscow is concerned that as the nato alliance expands , the united states will station troops along its borders .
further , it continues to worry about the future presence of western troops in energy-rich centra asian , which russia once dominated .
the russian foreign ministry said in a statement that , “ our view of these plans will depend on the spelled-out details , and whether they pose a danger to russia ’ s national interests . ”
moscow ’ s statement stressed that it expected washington to adhere to previous agreements that , in moscow ’ s view , ban the united states from stationing its troops in the baltics or the caucasus . democrats seize on bush 's plan but while the germans were putting on a brave face and the russians remained edgy , opposition to the withdrawal in the united states was more vociferous .
unsurprisingly , the majority of criticism came from supporters of democratic presidential candidate john kerry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke " this is another example of the -lrb- bush -rrb- administration 's unilateralism .
it 's going to weaken our national security , " said richard holbrooke , a kerry foreign policy adviser and former ambassador to the un and germany under former president clinton , in a widely reported statement .
" it is not going to save us money .
it will cost billions of dollars to bring these troops home . " holbrooke also focused on the economic demands which the troop redeployment would shift from the host countries back to the united states .
" germany , south korea and japan , which will see the biggest cuts , all spend billions of dollars to support the troops .
and i am very concerned about this . " holbrooke also rejected president george w. bush 's assertion that bringing the troops home would make it easier to rapidly deploy them to global trouble spots .
he called bases in germany , south korea and okinawa " essential " along with other forward deployments . " even in the modern world , airplanes take time to get places , " holbrooke said .
" this is a weakening of our traditional ties to our closest allies just when we need them most . " ex-general clark warns of timing in terror war another kerry-supporter , retired army general wesley clark , warned of a military mistake in the making .
" as we face a global war on terror with al qaeda active in more than 60 countries , now is not the time to pull back our forces . " clark , who commanded nato and us forces in europe from 1997 to 2000 , added in his statement : " this ill-conceived move and its timing seem politically motivated rather than designed to strengthen our national security . " kerry to publicly address restructuring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential hopeful john kerry is expected to criticize the us troop plans .
kerry himself is expected to voice his own opposition to the bush administration 's plans when he gives a speech to the veterans of foreign wars in cincinnati on wednesday .
it will be a chance for the presidential candidate make clear one of the distinct strategic differences between himself and george w. bush .
kerry is preparing to argue that the withdrawal of troops from europe and asia threatens to undercut alliances and weakens america 's ability to project its power overseas , according to michael meehan , a senior adviser in the democratic party , quoted in the financial times .
meehan told the ft that kerry will make a " sweeping critique " of the realignment at the convention in cincinnati , the same venue where the president this week announced the planned withdrawal of a third of us forces from their foreign bases . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us troop pullout to hit local german economies the impact of us plans to pull some 70,000 troops out of europe and asia is likely to be felt most acutely in germany - especially in smaller towns whose economies depend on the us presence .

opposition voices have questioned his wisdom . german defense minister peter struck on tuesday set out for a summer tour of military bases to see how the current restructuring of the national armed forces is progressing .
in line with eu and nato defense policies , the bundeswehr is reshaping its troops to be better prepared for peacekeeping or peace-enforcing missions abroad . however , struck is facing a hard time explaining his decision to close numerous bundeswehr bases across the country , which will coincide with the large-scale withdrawal of us forces from western germany : struck had gained wide respect for starting to overhaul the national armed forces and handling out-of-area peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and the balkans .
while he has given up pipe smoking after the stroke he suffered in june , he has not reduced his ambitions to push through the biggest restructuring of the bundeswehr to date . troops to be cut down to 250,000 the emphasis will be on training mobile units to be employed quickly in crisis areas outside nato territory .
in the next couple of years , troop strength will be reduced by 30,000 to 250,000 - a measure long overdue after the end of the cold war .
the number of military bases will also be cut drastically .
details on the closures will be announced in november . opposition conservative defense spokesman christian schmidt warned about rushing into defense decisions now that it has been announced that the united states will be withdrawing a large contingent of their 70,000 troops now stationed in germany .
schmidt called on the defense minister on tuesday to ensure that the communities affected will receive some sort of compensation for the looming economic losses . " i myself come from a region which will be largely affected by the withdrawal of us troops with the bases in bamberg and würzburg soon to be deserted , " schmidt told dw-radio . looming economic and social problems " we ’ ve always come out in favor of providing financial help for restructuring programs after such a pull-out of troops .
but at present , there are no such means available , neither at federal , nor at community level .
we ’ ll see massive social and economic problems in the affected regions .
i ’ m optimistic that policy-makers will not leave these communities to their own devices and raise restructuring funds , probably also out of european union coffers . " schmidt , as well as bavaria ’ s christian social union leader edmund stoiber , is hoping that the defense minister will readjust his original plan to close down german military bases to the realities created by the us troop pull-out .
both theorized that a number of abandoned us bases may in the future be used by the bundeswehr instead . future planning is questioned “ i can only suggest thinking harder about harmonizing us and national defense policies , said schmidt .
" struck is expected to close down up to 100 bundeswehr bases over the next few years .
us bases will vanish too .
i ’ m not convinced that everything has been carefully coordinated yet .
i believe there ’ s a need to reconsider the planned scope of closures here . ” but the cash-strapped defense minister is unlikely to effect major changes .
many of germany 's military installations , struck argues , weren ’ t needed any longer 10 years ago , but the government was afforded the luxury of maintaining them anyway .
now , with a revamped defense strategy in place and all the budgetary constraints at hand , he says , that doesn ’ t make sense anymore . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us troop withdrawal raises concerns washington ’ s biggest military reorganization in 50 years has caused ripples around the world , but while the nations due to wave good-bye to us forces have issued muted regret , criticism is gaining pace in the us .

in line with eu and nato defense policies , the bundeswehr is reshaping its troops to be better prepared for peacekeeping or peace-enforcing missions abroad . however , struck is facing a hard time explaining his decision to close numerous bundeswehr bases across the country , which will coincide with the large-scale withdrawal of us forces from western germany : struck had gained wide respect for starting to overhaul the national armed forces and handling out-of-area peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and the balkans .
while he has given up pipe smoking after the stroke he suffered in june , he has not reduced his ambitions to push through the biggest restructuring of the bundeswehr to date . troops to be cut down to 250,000 the emphasis will be on training mobile units to be employed quickly in crisis areas outside nato territory .
in the next couple of years , troop strength will be reduced by 30,000 to 250,000 - a measure long overdue after the end of the cold war .
the number of military bases will also be cut drastically .
details on the closures will be announced in november . opposition conservative defense spokesman christian schmidt warned about rushing into defense decisions now that it has been announced that the united states will be withdrawing a large contingent of their 70,000 troops now stationed in germany .
schmidt called on the defense minister on tuesday to ensure that the communities affected will receive some sort of compensation for the looming economic losses . " i myself come from a region which will be largely affected by the withdrawal of us troops with the bases in bamberg and würzburg soon to be deserted , " schmidt told dw-radio . looming economic and social problems " we ’ ve always come out in favor of providing financial help for restructuring programs after such a pull-out of troops .
but at present , there are no such means available , neither at federal , nor at community level .
we ’ ll see massive social and economic problems in the affected regions .
i ’ m optimistic that policy-makers will not leave these communities to their own devices and raise restructuring funds , probably also out of european union coffers . " schmidt , as well as bavaria ’ s christian social union leader edmund stoiber , is hoping that the defense minister will readjust his original plan to close down german military bases to the realities created by the us troop pull-out .
both theorized that a number of abandoned us bases may in the future be used by the bundeswehr instead . future planning is questioned “ i can only suggest thinking harder about harmonizing us and national defense policies , said schmidt .
" struck is expected to close down up to 100 bundeswehr bases over the next few years .
us bases will vanish too .
i ’ m not convinced that everything has been carefully coordinated yet .
i believe there ’ s a need to reconsider the planned scope of closures here . ” but the cash-strapped defense minister is unlikely to effect major changes .
many of germany 's military installations , struck argues , weren ’ t needed any longer 10 years ago , but the government was afforded the luxury of maintaining them anyway .

while he has given up pipe smoking after the stroke he suffered in june , he has not reduced his ambitions to push through the biggest restructuring of the bundeswehr to date . troops to be cut down to 250,000 the emphasis will be on training mobile units to be employed quickly in crisis areas outside nato territory .
in the next couple of years , troop strength will be reduced by 30,000 to 250,000 - a measure long overdue after the end of the cold war .
the number of military bases will also be cut drastically .
details on the closures will be announced in november . opposition conservative defense spokesman christian schmidt warned about rushing into defense decisions now that it has been announced that the united states will be withdrawing a large contingent of their 70,000 troops now stationed in germany .
schmidt called on the defense minister on tuesday to ensure that the communities affected will receive some sort of compensation for the looming economic losses . " i myself come from a region which will be largely affected by the withdrawal of us troops with the bases in bamberg and würzburg soon to be deserted , " schmidt told dw-radio . looming economic and social problems " we ’ ve always come out in favor of providing financial help for restructuring programs after such a pull-out of troops .
but at present , there are no such means available , neither at federal , nor at community level .
we ’ ll see massive social and economic problems in the affected regions .
i ’ m optimistic that policy-makers will not leave these communities to their own devices and raise restructuring funds , probably also out of european union coffers . " schmidt , as well as bavaria ’ s christian social union leader edmund stoiber , is hoping that the defense minister will readjust his original plan to close down german military bases to the realities created by the us troop pull-out .
both theorized that a number of abandoned us bases may in the future be used by the bundeswehr instead . future planning is questioned “ i can only suggest thinking harder about harmonizing us and national defense policies , said schmidt .
" struck is expected to close down up to 100 bundeswehr bases over the next few years .
us bases will vanish too .
i ’ m not convinced that everything has been carefully coordinated yet .
i believe there ’ s a need to reconsider the planned scope of closures here . ” but the cash-strapped defense minister is unlikely to effect major changes .
many of germany 's military installations , struck argues , weren ’ t needed any longer 10 years ago , but the government was afforded the luxury of maintaining them anyway .
now , with a revamped defense strategy in place and all the budgetary constraints at hand , he says , that doesn ’ t make sense anymore . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us troop withdrawal raises concerns washington ’ s biggest military reorganization in 50 years has caused ripples around the world , but while the nations due to wave good-bye to us forces have issued muted regret , criticism is gaining pace in the us .
-lrb- august 18 , 2004 -rrb- us troop pullout to hit local german economies the impact of us plans to pull some 70,000 troops out of europe and asia is likely to be felt most acutely in germany - especially in smaller towns whose economies depend on the us presence .
-lrb- august 17 , 2004 -rrb- germany announces military cuts military bases will be closed and troops will be cut back in an effort to save € 26 billion .
but the future of the country 's compulsory military conscription remains uncertain .

now , a notable art critic is accusing the new york curators of cultural colonialism . judging by the huge number of visitors - more than 800,000 at last count - some of whom have lined up for more than eight hours to gain entry into the special exhibition of the new york-based museum of modern art 's -lrb- moma -rrb- show at berlin 's national gallery , it has been a huge success . many even credit the mania surrounding the display of more than 200 paintings and sculptures from moma 's famous collection with helping to spur tourism to germany 's capital to a post-world war ii high , and there is no indication that the steady flow of visitors will slack off before it closes on sept .
19 . however , increasing numbers of art fans who have had to wait - sometimes in the hot summer sun - are less inclined to view the exhibition as a triumph , and some have even accused the organizers of deliberately keeping the lines long in order to stir up publicity .
the fact that those willing to pay € 27 -lrb- $ 33 -rrb- can avoid the long lines entirely does stink a bit of cultural elitism . now werner spies , a noted art historian , one time friend of pablo picasso and max ernst , and former director of the national museum of modern art at the georges pompidou center in paris , has joined the critics . but the nature of his criticism is different .
in an article in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday , spies accused the new york-based curators - who decided on the exhibition 's content with no input from their berlin hosts - of cultural colonialism . american art the culmination of modern development ? the crux of spies ' criticism centers around the portion of the exhibit looking at modern art in the second half of the last century , which , compared to the first half , includes almost no selections from european masters .
in short , spies accuses the new york-based curators of falsely claiming that the " new american painting , " which emerged in the postwar years , is the culmination of the 20th century 's modern art movement . for spies , the failure to include the works of matisse , max ernst , dubuffet and giacometti , is inexcusable and not merely an oversight but suggests that moma curators have an agenda to determine the so-called canon of contemporary art to the americans ' advantage . " the americans who chose the selections are engaging in cultural politics , " he wrote .
" for them , the vatican of 20th century aesthetic , it is about establishing the canon of modern art … and the new york museum can in berlin - in an expansionist way - present american art as the culmination of that development . " in response to spies ' criticisms , peter raue , the director of the " friends of the national gallery , " which helped to bring the exhibition to berlin , told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the exhibit clearly shows the american view , which is just fine by him .
he said he could imagine that a berlin-curated show presenting the european perspective could possibly grace the galleries of moma in the future , thereby presenting a more balanced whole . numbers grow , opening hours extended in the meantime , the number of visitors hoping to gain entry continues to grow .
at times , the line wraps more than two times around the building .
and despite the museum 's decision to extend opening hours for the final weeks , the wait remains long . one industrious berlin-based engineer sent a four-page plan to the organizers detailing how to do away with the lines , which among other things , suggested the distribution of waiting numbers .
in response , according to newspaper reports , he was told that the lines were " necessary to create publicity . " according to a security official quoted in german papers , an ambulance has been called to the museum at least once a day to cart away would-be museum goers for whom the stress of contributing to the shows " publicity " has proven too much . some among them may be inclined to add their voices to the growing number of critics , though they are far more likely to bemoan practical considerations as opposed to the high-minded nature of the modern art canon .
others , however , will continue to view the chance to see this " once in a lifetime " exhibition as well worth the wait . editor 's note : while dw-tv is one of four media partners of moma in berlin , deutsche welle played no part in organizing or curating the exhibition . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de record year for berlin tourism expected the number of visitors to berlin may reach a postwar high in 2004 , berlin 's tourism organization revealed monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.08.2004 moma berlin exhibition slammed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some art fans are unhappy with the show unhappy with the long entrance lines , art fans are directing criticism at the organizers of berlin 's moma exhibition .
now , a notable art critic is accusing the new york curators of cultural colonialism . judging by the huge number of visitors - more than 800,000 at last count - some of whom have lined up for more than eight hours to gain entry into the special exhibition of the new york-based museum of modern art 's -lrb- moma -rrb- show at berlin 's national gallery , it has been a huge success . many even credit the mania surrounding the display of more than 200 paintings and sculptures from moma 's famous collection with helping to spur tourism to germany 's capital to a post-world war ii high , and there is no indication that the steady flow of visitors will slack off before it closes on sept .
19 . however , increasing numbers of art fans who have had to wait - sometimes in the hot summer sun - are less inclined to view the exhibition as a triumph , and some have even accused the organizers of deliberately keeping the lines long in order to stir up publicity .
the fact that those willing to pay € 27 -lrb- $ 33 -rrb- can avoid the long lines entirely does stink a bit of cultural elitism . now werner spies , a noted art historian , one time friend of pablo picasso and max ernst , and former director of the national museum of modern art at the georges pompidou center in paris , has joined the critics . but the nature of his criticism is different .
in an article in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday , spies accused the new york-based curators - who decided on the exhibition 's content with no input from their berlin hosts - of cultural colonialism . american art the culmination of modern development ? the crux of spies ' criticism centers around the portion of the exhibit looking at modern art in the second half of the last century , which , compared to the first half , includes almost no selections from european masters .
in short , spies accuses the new york-based curators of falsely claiming that the " new american painting , " which emerged in the postwar years , is the culmination of the 20th century 's modern art movement . for spies , the failure to include the works of matisse , max ernst , dubuffet and giacometti , is inexcusable and not merely an oversight but suggests that moma curators have an agenda to determine the so-called canon of contemporary art to the americans ' advantage . " the americans who chose the selections are engaging in cultural politics , " he wrote .
" for them , the vatican of 20th century aesthetic , it is about establishing the canon of modern art … and the new york museum can in berlin - in an expansionist way - present american art as the culmination of that development . " in response to spies ' criticisms , peter raue , the director of the " friends of the national gallery , " which helped to bring the exhibition to berlin , told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the exhibit clearly shows the american view , which is just fine by him .
he said he could imagine that a berlin-curated show presenting the european perspective could possibly grace the galleries of moma in the future , thereby presenting a more balanced whole . numbers grow , opening hours extended in the meantime , the number of visitors hoping to gain entry continues to grow .
at times , the line wraps more than two times around the building .
and despite the museum 's decision to extend opening hours for the final weeks , the wait remains long . one industrious berlin-based engineer sent a four-page plan to the organizers detailing how to do away with the lines , which among other things , suggested the distribution of waiting numbers .
in response , according to newspaper reports , he was told that the lines were " necessary to create publicity . " according to a security official quoted in german papers , an ambulance has been called to the museum at least once a day to cart away would-be museum goers for whom the stress of contributing to the shows " publicity " has proven too much . some among them may be inclined to add their voices to the growing number of critics , though they are far more likely to bemoan practical considerations as opposed to the high-minded nature of the modern art canon .
others , however , will continue to view the chance to see this " once in a lifetime " exhibition as well worth the wait . editor 's note : while dw-tv is one of four media partners of moma in berlin , deutsche welle played no part in organizing or curating the exhibition . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de record year for berlin tourism expected the number of visitors to berlin may reach a postwar high in 2004 , berlin 's tourism organization revealed monday .

even as health experts warn that german youngsters are getting fatter , obesity levels continue to climb among the country 's migrant children population .
television and fast food are n't the only culprits . on a sunny august day , ten-year-old murat -lrb- name changed -rrb- lies on his back on a grassy lawn at a public outdoor swimming pool in berlin 's wedding district , home to a large immigrant population . licking a chocolate ice cream , murat , who is of turkish origin , might sound like a normal youngster , but he does n't look like one .
clad in an " l " size pair of swimming trunks , the porky fourth-grader tips the scales at nearly 44 kilos -lrb- 97 lbs . -rrb- . " the school authorities said he needs to exercise and lose weight .
that 's why i take him for a swim here , " his mother ayse -lrb- name changed -rrb- told dw-world .
the ice cream , she said , is a reward for him doing two laps in the pool .
" besides , it 's so hot , " she added . murat , who said his favorite food is nutella -lrb- a chocolate spread -rrb- , is not alone .
in past years , a rise in weight levels among children from germany 's immigrant families , a largely ignored group in obesity research until recently , has fuelled concern among health authorities . " sitting on a powder keg " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister renate künast is spearheading the drive for healthy nutrition to bring down obesity levels .
the german minister for consumer protection and agriculture , renate künast , estimated this year that every fifth child and every third teenager in germany is overweight .
the number of obese children signing up for school has risen three-fold compared to a decade ago .
" the country is sitting on a powder keg , " künast warned . though there are no country-wide studies on the prevalence of obesity among migrant children , statistics on the problem in cities with high foreign populations leave little room for doubt . in frankfurt , home to around 180,000 immigrants from 180 nations , research on the number of those children who joined school this year found that 12.5 percent were overweight . experts say that a six-year-old who has a body mass index of 15.4 is considered of normal weight .
the frankfurt statistics showed that moroccan and turkish children , in particular , had a body mass index of more than 18 percent , at 18.4 and 22 percent respectively .

even as health experts warn that german youngsters are getting fatter , obesity levels continue to climb among the country 's migrant children population .
television and fast food are n't the only culprits . on a sunny august day , ten-year-old murat -lrb- name changed -rrb- lies on his back on a grassy lawn at a public outdoor swimming pool in berlin 's wedding district , home to a large immigrant population . licking a chocolate ice cream , murat , who is of turkish origin , might sound like a normal youngster , but he does n't look like one .

" besides , it 's so hot , " she added . murat , who said his favorite food is nutella -lrb- a chocolate spread -rrb- , is not alone .
in past years , a rise in weight levels among children from germany 's immigrant families , a largely ignored group in obesity research until recently , has fuelled concern among health authorities . " sitting on a powder keg " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister renate künast is spearheading the drive for healthy nutrition to bring down obesity levels .
the german minister for consumer protection and agriculture , renate künast , estimated this year that every fifth child and every third teenager in germany is overweight .
the number of obese children signing up for school has risen three-fold compared to a decade ago .
" the country is sitting on a powder keg , " künast warned . though there are no country-wide studies on the prevalence of obesity among migrant children , statistics on the problem in cities with high foreign populations leave little room for doubt . in frankfurt , home to around 180,000 immigrants from 180 nations , research on the number of those children who joined school this year found that 12.5 percent were overweight . experts say that a six-year-old who has a body mass index of 15.4 is considered of normal weight .
the frankfurt statistics showed that moroccan and turkish children , in particular , had a body mass index of more than 18 percent , at 18.4 and 22 percent respectively .
among ten-year-olds , turkish children weighed the most at 34 percent , compared to 19 percent for german youngsters . eating to the point of disorder " it 's alarming , " holger meireis , head of frankfurt 's child and youth department told dw-world .
" if you interpret immigration in a broad sense , beyond borders of nationality , then almost 50 percent of frankfurt 's foreign population is overweight .
it ca n't be ignored any longer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neukölln is home to a large muslim population .
dr rainer moehl , a physician in neukölln , an immigrant-dominated berlin neighborhood , agreed that obesity was a widespread problem among his patients .
" by the time children in turkish and arab families reach school-going age , there 's usually a clear gender-specific difference : it 's mostly boys who develop obesity during puberty , while girls have eating disorders like bulimia , " moehl said . he warned that overweight children are likely to develop problems such as mobility and spinal and metabolic disorders , high blood pressure , diabetes and depression . filling the stomach cheaply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that low income and education levels can have disastrous consequences for obese people .
while experts point to the usual suspects - too much television , too little activity , fast food and sweets - they agree that the spread of obesity among migrant children is largely tied to their financial and social situation . jeffrey butler from the health department in berlin 's wedding district , which holds the dubious record of being home to berlin 's pudgiest kids -lrb- 20.7 percent body mass index -rrb- , points to the fact that the neighborhood is also one of the capital 's poorest . with an unemployment rate of around 24 percent , low education levels and around 26 percent of children and teenagers living on welfare , wedding has acquired notoriety as a social flashpoint . " most of the families here do n't have the means to buy healthy food , even if they wanted to , " butler said .
" it 's just easier to shop for packaged and fast food that fills you up . " calories and stress others caution that the problem has much more complex cultural reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations in a döner shop in berlin .
meat is a staple among turks .
" the common family meal is the focal point in a turkish home , and traditional turkish cuisine is actually healthy , " jutta kolletzki , a therapist who runs a counseling and treatment center for weight-loss and eating disorders in frankfurt , said .
" but meals are cooked with so much sugar and fat that it turns into a real calorie bomb , " she said . kolletzki added that many immigrants often are n't well-informed about what constitutes healthy nutrition .
differing perspectives of health also contribute to the problem , she said .
" in traditional families , a tubby child is usually considered well-fed and a sign of prosperity rather than as a problem , " kolletzki explained . she also warned that children straddling two cultures are often under a lot of emotional stress .
" separations or moving from one country to another is difficult for a child , " she said .
" eating more is a way of coping with it . " battle of the bulge bildunterschrift : children take part in a weight-loss program at germany 's baltic sea coast .
obesity among migrant children is now recognized as a serious problem , judging by the number of initiatives and projects springing up in several german cities to tackle it . most involve networking with kindergartens and schools to encourage them to introduce healthy breakfasts and impress upon the kids and parents the benefits of a healthy diet and exercise .
the emphasis is on prevention , taking into account cultural differences and using interpreters to reach the target groups . minister künast is kicking off a major nationwide project in september involving parents , health insurance companies and the food industry .
a spokeswoman at the ministry stressed that though this was n't a special programs for migrant children as yet , they were working on it . germany , it seems , is determined to win the battle of the bulge and avoid the rather drastic scenario predicted in a recent british survey , which suggested that the younger generation would be the first to die before their parents .

but it was no ordinary auto .
the daimlerchrysler vehicle presented to him had something special under the hood : hydrogen fuel cell technology . the gleaming new model sitting in the car park outside schröder 's office in berlin is one of the prototype models fitted with the f-cell hydrogen technology that daimlerchrysler hopes will revolutionize motoring and help in the fight to reduce carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions from cars . the chancellor will have one year to test the car out as part of the company 's on-going research into greener fuel possibilities which has seen 60 cars enter production and deployed for testing around the world . the fuel cells which power the car use a combination of hydrogen and oxygen which makes them and the vehicle itself environmentally friendly . its only emission is water , which is so pure that daimlerchrysler claim its fit for human consumption .
the electric motor creates a maximum output of 65 kilowatts and will power the car for 160 kilometers -lrb- 100 miles -rrb- at a maximum speed of 140 kilometers per hour -lrb- kph -rrb- . here comes the science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fuel cell car 's motor the hydrogen fuel cell operates similar to a battery .
it has two electrodes , an anode and a cathode , separated by a membrane .
oxygen passes over one electrode and hydrogen over the other . the hydrogen reacts to a catalyst on the electrode anode that converts the hydrogen gas into negatively charged electrons and positively charged ions .
the electrons flow out of the cell to be used as electrical energy . the hydrogen ions move through the electrolyte membrane to the cathode electrode where they combine with oxygen and the electrons to produce water .
unlike batteries , fuel cells never run out . f-cell technology leading the way schröder received the car from daimlerchrysler board member jürgen hubbert and praised the efforts of the company to develop more environmentally friendly vehicles , especially at a time of increased oil prices and concerns over the effects of co2 emissions in relation to climate change .

now eu reality has hit them - a disappointment for many . " some things were meant to become cheaper - german beer , for example , but it still costs as much as before , " one woman told german public broadcaster wdr .
" phoning people and using the internet was supposed to become cheaper , because there 's more competition .
but nothing 's happening , which is something that i 'm personally sad about , because i 've been waiting for things to change . " another woman agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : market square in warsaw " i 'm only hearing about the positive things in radio and tv and reading about it in the newspapers - that our exports are up and that it 's going to get better and better for us , " she said .
" but i 'm not seeing that happening . " she added that meat was a third more expensive now and prices for medicines had also increased .
pensions on the other hand had stayed the same , she said . beef and poultry prices have indeed increased by about 18 percent , according to a report by the national bank of poland .
on the other hand , few things have become cheaper : electronics , wine and beer have just gone down 0.5 percent in price . farming business is booming polish farmers on the other hand are more upbeat .
a few months ago , they were still considered the problem children of poland 's eu accession .
badly organized and working on small farms , officials worried that farmers would not be able to compete internationally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a farmer offering vegetables in warsaw but business is booming : asparagus , fruit , potatoes , wheat and mushrooms from poland have become bestsellers in the eu .
farmers also have overcome their initial hesitation to apply for financial help from brussels . " if 1.3 million farmers are able to apply for funds , that 's something that we can be proud of , " polish agriculture minister wojciech olejniczak told wdr .
" and we 'll convince those that are still hesitating - maybe not tomorrow , but definitely by the end of the year . " fishermen struggle to adjust the country 's fishermen , however , say they are suffering rather than benefiting from eu accession : they now have to deal with fishing limits imposed by the union and eu incentives not to fish at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists protested against the eu fishing policies in berlin as fishermen throw millions of fish back into the sea because they are too small " the only thing i can do is trample on the catch and throw it back into the sea , " one fisherman told wdr .
" but everyone wants to work .
i ca n't imaging giving up so quickly .
it 's horror for me .
i 'll be spending the -lrb- incentive -rrb- money and at some point there wo n't be any more .
and what happens then ? " it 's a problem polish used car sellers do n't face at the moment .
in may and june alone , they imported more than 160,000 cars from western europe - that 's five times as many as during the entire year of 2003 . thomas rautenberg -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro goes east the 10 new eu countries are expected to eventually adopt the euro as their currency .

germany is the world ’ s leading producer of wind power .
but as land sites for wind parks become increasingly scarce , the future of the country ’ s wind industry lies on the open sea . in the northern german region of schleswig-holstein , you can ’ t miss them : the wind turbines sprinkled along the landscape are as prominent as the cattle grazing on the grass . but can these giant modern windmills be placed in the middle of the ocean ?
the residents of north frisia are willing to try .
for them , as well as many others living in the schleswig-holstein area , much of their livelihood depends on the presence of the wind turbines generating energy from the constant breeze coming off the north sea .
klaus rave , vice-president of the european wind energy association , says the region ’ s communities had a vision 15 years ago that they could produce 25 percent of their electricity through wind energy by 2010 .
and they succeeded .
“ we promoted discussions and expert reports , and we had the courage to openly say we were considering this , ” rave says .
“ we were able to achieve our goal in 2002 and we ’ re continuing to work with this in mind and concentrating on future possibilities . ”
a people ’ s project but the space on land is limited .
so the local residents designed and financed project butendiek , an offshore wind park some 20 miles off the coast in the north sea .
it will cost a total of 400 million euro -lrb- $ 475 million -rrb- to anchor the planned eighty wind turbines to the ocean floor .
“ our experiences led us to say , if wind parks have been so successful inland , why don ’ t we build them in the sea , ” says rave .
but they didn ’ t want to leave this undertaking to a large corporation , he adds .
“ we wanted to do it ourselves , with our own capabilities and know-how . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : offshore wind power is already successful in denmark .
the citizens of north frisia strongly advocate the use of clean energy .
but they also believe that with over 15 years of experience with wind power , they can make the offshore park work .
“ wind parks have been very successful in north frisia , so that creates an acceptance for the economic aspects of the offshore park , ” says hans feddersen , sales manager for project butendiek .
he says 8,500 north frisians have decided to finance the project - and not just for environmental reasons .
“ of course , there are also opponents , but the project sounds a lot better when you tie the whirring of the wind with your wallet , ” feddersen says .
the people in the region would rather grab this opportunity for investment rather than not be actively involved .
opposition remains there is , however , much controversy surrounding the building of offshore wind parks .
for one , many potential investors still see the project as a financial risk .
also , contractors have to gain permission to prohibit shipping in the wind park area .
and ironically , environmentalists are posing some of the staunchest opposition to project butendiek .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aerial view of sylt in the north sea .
the offshore wind park , which aims to get going in 2005 , still needs approval to run a cable through a national park and over the island of sylt -lrb- photo -rrb- .
and if this fails , due to complaints from nature organizations , the project won ’ t work .
environment minister jürgen trittin wants to increase germany ’ s power generation from renewable energy sources from 4.5 percent to 12.5 percent by 2010 .
but the country ’ s sluggish economy is leading many to question the value of wind energy versus the costs .

germany is the world ’ s leading producer of wind power .
but as land sites for wind parks become increasingly scarce , the future of the country ’ s wind industry lies on the open sea . in the northern german region of schleswig-holstein , you can ’ t miss them : the wind turbines sprinkled along the landscape are as prominent as the cattle grazing on the grass . but can these giant modern windmills be placed in the middle of the ocean ?
the residents of north frisia are willing to try .
for them , as well as many others living in the schleswig-holstein area , much of their livelihood depends on the presence of the wind turbines generating energy from the constant breeze coming off the north sea .
klaus rave , vice-president of the european wind energy association , says the region ’ s communities had a vision 15 years ago that they could produce 25 percent of their electricity through wind energy by 2010 .
and they succeeded .
“ we promoted discussions and expert reports , and we had the courage to openly say we were considering this , ” rave says .
“ we were able to achieve our goal in 2002 and we ’ re continuing to work with this in mind and concentrating on future possibilities . ”
a people ’ s project but the space on land is limited .
so the local residents designed and financed project butendiek , an offshore wind park some 20 miles off the coast in the north sea .
it will cost a total of 400 million euro -lrb- $ 475 million -rrb- to anchor the planned eighty wind turbines to the ocean floor .
“ our experiences led us to say , if wind parks have been so successful inland , why don ’ t we build them in the sea , ” says rave .
but they didn ’ t want to leave this undertaking to a large corporation , he adds .
“ we wanted to do it ourselves , with our own capabilities and know-how . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : offshore wind power is already successful in denmark .
the citizens of north frisia strongly advocate the use of clean energy .
but they also believe that with over 15 years of experience with wind power , they can make the offshore park work .
“ wind parks have been very successful in north frisia , so that creates an acceptance for the economic aspects of the offshore park , ” says hans feddersen , sales manager for project butendiek .
he says 8,500 north frisians have decided to finance the project - and not just for environmental reasons .
“ of course , there are also opponents , but the project sounds a lot better when you tie the whirring of the wind with your wallet , ” feddersen says .
the people in the region would rather grab this opportunity for investment rather than not be actively involved .
opposition remains there is , however , much controversy surrounding the building of offshore wind parks .
for one , many potential investors still see the project as a financial risk .
also , contractors have to gain permission to prohibit shipping in the wind park area .
and ironically , environmentalists are posing some of the staunchest opposition to project butendiek .

germany is the world ’ s leading producer of wind power .
but as land sites for wind parks become increasingly scarce , the future of the country ’ s wind industry lies on the open sea . in the northern german region of schleswig-holstein , you can ’ t miss them : the wind turbines sprinkled along the landscape are as prominent as the cattle grazing on the grass . but can these giant modern windmills be placed in the middle of the ocean ?
the residents of north frisia are willing to try .
for them , as well as many others living in the schleswig-holstein area , much of their livelihood depends on the presence of the wind turbines generating energy from the constant breeze coming off the north sea .
klaus rave , vice-president of the european wind energy association , says the region ’ s communities had a vision 15 years ago that they could produce 25 percent of their electricity through wind energy by 2010 .
and they succeeded .
“ we promoted discussions and expert reports , and we had the courage to openly say we were considering this , ” rave says .

a people ’ s project but the space on land is limited .

it will cost a total of 400 million euro -lrb- $ 475 million -rrb- to anchor the planned eighty wind turbines to the ocean floor .
“ our experiences led us to say , if wind parks have been so successful inland , why don ’ t we build them in the sea , ” says rave .

germany is the world ’ s leading producer of wind power .

klaus rave , vice-president of the european wind energy association , says the region ’ s communities had a vision 15 years ago that they could produce 25 percent of their electricity through wind energy by 2010 .
and they succeeded .

germany is the world ’ s leading producer of wind power .
but as land sites for wind parks become increasingly scarce , the future of the country ’ s wind industry lies on the open sea . in the northern german region of schleswig-holstein , you can ’ t miss them : the wind turbines sprinkled along the landscape are as prominent as the cattle grazing on the grass . but can these giant modern windmills be placed in the middle of the ocean ?
the residents of north frisia are willing to try .
for them , as well as many others living in the schleswig-holstein area , much of their livelihood depends on the presence of the wind turbines generating energy from the constant breeze coming off the north sea .
klaus rave , vice-president of the european wind energy association , says the region ’ s communities had a vision 15 years ago that they could produce 25 percent of their electricity through wind energy by 2010 .
and they succeeded .
“ we promoted discussions and expert reports , and we had the courage to openly say we were considering this , ” rave says .
“ we were able to achieve our goal in 2002 and we ’ re continuing to work with this in mind and concentrating on future possibilities . ”
a people ’ s project but the space on land is limited .
so the local residents designed and financed project butendiek , an offshore wind park some 20 miles off the coast in the north sea .
it will cost a total of 400 million euro -lrb- $ 475 million -rrb- to anchor the planned eighty wind turbines to the ocean floor .
“ our experiences led us to say , if wind parks have been so successful inland , why don ’ t we build them in the sea , ” says rave .
but they didn ’ t want to leave this undertaking to a large corporation , he adds .
“ we wanted to do it ourselves , with our own capabilities and know-how . ”

the citizens of north frisia strongly advocate the use of clean energy .
but they also believe that with over 15 years of experience with wind power , they can make the offshore park work .
“ wind parks have been very successful in north frisia , so that creates an acceptance for the economic aspects of the offshore park , ” says hans feddersen , sales manager for project butendiek .
he says 8,500 north frisians have decided to finance the project - and not just for environmental reasons .
“ of course , there are also opponents , but the project sounds a lot better when you tie the whirring of the wind with your wallet , ” feddersen says .
the people in the region would rather grab this opportunity for investment rather than not be actively involved .
opposition remains there is , however , much controversy surrounding the building of offshore wind parks .
for one , many potential investors still see the project as a financial risk .
also , contractors have to gain permission to prohibit shipping in the wind park area .

the politicians , however , have been doing their best to hide their displeasure . germany regrets decision but understands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary donald rumsfeld with german defense minister peter struck german defense minister peter struck said in a statement that he regretted the withdrawal , but washington had no choice .
" that 's a big loss to a lot of regions , " he said .
" but the decision of the us president is without alternative . " karsten voigt , berlin 's coordinator for german-american relations , said germany would remain the largest base for us troops in europe and security in europe was not at risk . " but , nevertheless , the withdrawal of troops is a loss , of course .
we regret it ; the american soldiers were welcome here .
but it is a sign of success at the same time - the success of having overcome the cold war and european division , " voigt told reporters . the us plans to move about half of its foreign-based troops , with many heading back to the states and others from european bases penciled in for deployment in the former soviet baltic republics .
this news has raised concerns in russia , which has called for a detailed explanation of the military re-organization .
russia suspicious of us intentions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. forces could be on russia 's doorstep .
moscow is concerned that as the nato alliance expands , the united states will station troops along its borders .
further , it continues to worry about the future presence of western troops in energy-rich centra asian , which russia once dominated .
the russian foreign ministry said in a statement that , “ our view of these plans will depend on the spelled-out details , and whether they pose a danger to russia ’ s national interests . ”
moscow ’ s statement stressed that it expected washington to adhere to previous agreements that , in moscow ’ s view , ban the united states from stationing its troops in the baltics or the caucasus . democrats seize on bush 's plan but while the germans were putting on a brave face and the russians remained edgy , opposition to the withdrawal in the united states was more vociferous .
unsurprisingly , the majority of criticism came from supporters of democratic presidential candidate john kerry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke " this is another example of the -lrb- bush -rrb- administration 's unilateralism .
it 's going to weaken our national security , " said richard holbrooke , a kerry foreign policy adviser and former ambassador to the un and germany under former president clinton , in a widely reported statement .
" it is not going to save us money .
it will cost billions of dollars to bring these troops home . " holbrooke also focused on the economic demands which the troop redeployment would shift from the host countries back to the united states .
" germany , south korea and japan , which will see the biggest cuts , all spend billions of dollars to support the troops .
and i am very concerned about this . " holbrooke also rejected president george w. bush 's assertion that bringing the troops home would make it easier to rapidly deploy them to global trouble spots .
he called bases in germany , south korea and okinawa " essential " along with other forward deployments . " even in the modern world , airplanes take time to get places , " holbrooke said .
" this is a weakening of our traditional ties to our closest allies just when we need them most . " ex-general clark warns of timing in terror war another kerry-supporter , retired army general wesley clark , warned of a military mistake in the making .
" as we face a global war on terror with al qaeda active in more than 60 countries , now is not the time to pull back our forces . " clark , who commanded nato and us forces in europe from 1997 to 2000 , added in his statement : " this ill-conceived move and its timing seem politically motivated rather than designed to strengthen our national security . " kerry to publicly address restructuring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential hopeful john kerry is expected to criticize the us troop plans .
kerry himself is expected to voice his own opposition to the bush administration 's plans when he gives a speech to the veterans of foreign wars in cincinnati on wednesday .
it will be a chance for the presidential candidate make clear one of the distinct strategic differences between himself and george w. bush .
kerry is preparing to argue that the withdrawal of troops from europe and asia threatens to undercut alliances and weakens america 's ability to project its power overseas , according to michael meehan , a senior adviser in the democratic party , quoted in the financial times .
meehan told the ft that kerry will make a " sweeping critique " of the realignment at the convention in cincinnati , the same venue where the president this week announced the planned withdrawal of a third of us forces from their foreign bases . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us troop pullout to hit local german economies the impact of us plans to pull some 70,000 troops out of europe and asia is likely to be felt most acutely in germany - especially in smaller towns whose economies depend on the us presence .

the politicians , however , have been doing their best to hide their displeasure . germany regrets decision but understands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary donald rumsfeld with german defense minister peter struck german defense minister peter struck said in a statement that he regretted the withdrawal , but washington had no choice .
" that 's a big loss to a lot of regions , " he said .
" but the decision of the us president is without alternative . " karsten voigt , berlin 's coordinator for german-american relations , said germany would remain the largest base for us troops in europe and security in europe was not at risk . " but , nevertheless , the withdrawal of troops is a loss , of course .
we regret it ; the american soldiers were welcome here .
but it is a sign of success at the same time - the success of having overcome the cold war and european division , " voigt told reporters . the us plans to move about half of its foreign-based troops , with many heading back to the states and others from european bases penciled in for deployment in the former soviet baltic republics .
this news has raised concerns in russia , which has called for a detailed explanation of the military re-organization .
russia suspicious of us intentions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. forces could be on russia 's doorstep .
moscow is concerned that as the nato alliance expands , the united states will station troops along its borders .
further , it continues to worry about the future presence of western troops in energy-rich centra asian , which russia once dominated .
the russian foreign ministry said in a statement that , “ our view of these plans will depend on the spelled-out details , and whether they pose a danger to russia ’ s national interests . ”
moscow ’ s statement stressed that it expected washington to adhere to previous agreements that , in moscow ’ s view , ban the united states from stationing its troops in the baltics or the caucasus . democrats seize on bush 's plan but while the germans were putting on a brave face and the russians remained edgy , opposition to the withdrawal in the united states was more vociferous .
unsurprisingly , the majority of criticism came from supporters of democratic presidential candidate john kerry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke " this is another example of the -lrb- bush -rrb- administration 's unilateralism .
it 's going to weaken our national security , " said richard holbrooke , a kerry foreign policy adviser and former ambassador to the un and germany under former president clinton , in a widely reported statement .
" it is not going to save us money .
it will cost billions of dollars to bring these troops home . " holbrooke also focused on the economic demands which the troop redeployment would shift from the host countries back to the united states .
" germany , south korea and japan , which will see the biggest cuts , all spend billions of dollars to support the troops .
and i am very concerned about this . " holbrooke also rejected president george w. bush 's assertion that bringing the troops home would make it easier to rapidly deploy them to global trouble spots .
he called bases in germany , south korea and okinawa " essential " along with other forward deployments . " even in the modern world , airplanes take time to get places , " holbrooke said .
" this is a weakening of our traditional ties to our closest allies just when we need them most . " ex-general clark warns of timing in terror war another kerry-supporter , retired army general wesley clark , warned of a military mistake in the making .
" as we face a global war on terror with al qaeda active in more than 60 countries , now is not the time to pull back our forces . " clark , who commanded nato and us forces in europe from 1997 to 2000 , added in his statement : " this ill-conceived move and its timing seem politically motivated rather than designed to strengthen our national security . " kerry to publicly address restructuring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential hopeful john kerry is expected to criticize the us troop plans .
kerry himself is expected to voice his own opposition to the bush administration 's plans when he gives a speech to the veterans of foreign wars in cincinnati on wednesday .
it will be a chance for the presidential candidate make clear one of the distinct strategic differences between himself and george w. bush .
kerry is preparing to argue that the withdrawal of troops from europe and asia threatens to undercut alliances and weakens america 's ability to project its power overseas , according to michael meehan , a senior adviser in the democratic party , quoted in the financial times .
meehan told the ft that kerry will make a " sweeping critique " of the realignment at the convention in cincinnati , the same venue where the president this week announced the planned withdrawal of a third of us forces from their foreign bases . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us troop pullout to hit local german economies the impact of us plans to pull some 70,000 troops out of europe and asia is likely to be felt most acutely in germany - especially in smaller towns whose economies depend on the us presence .

opposition voices have questioned his wisdom . german defense minister peter struck on tuesday set out for a summer tour of military bases to see how the current restructuring of the national armed forces is progressing .
in line with eu and nato defense policies , the bundeswehr is reshaping its troops to be better prepared for peacekeeping or peace-enforcing missions abroad . however , struck is facing a hard time explaining his decision to close numerous bundeswehr bases across the country , which will coincide with the large-scale withdrawal of us forces from western germany : struck had gained wide respect for starting to overhaul the national armed forces and handling out-of-area peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and the balkans .
while he has given up pipe smoking after the stroke he suffered in june , he has not reduced his ambitions to push through the biggest restructuring of the bundeswehr to date . troops to be cut down to 250,000 the emphasis will be on training mobile units to be employed quickly in crisis areas outside nato territory .
in the next couple of years , troop strength will be reduced by 30,000 to 250,000 - a measure long overdue after the end of the cold war .
the number of military bases will also be cut drastically .
details on the closures will be announced in november . opposition conservative defense spokesman christian schmidt warned about rushing into defense decisions now that it has been announced that the united states will be withdrawing a large contingent of their 70,000 troops now stationed in germany .
schmidt called on the defense minister on tuesday to ensure that the communities affected will receive some sort of compensation for the looming economic losses . " i myself come from a region which will be largely affected by the withdrawal of us troops with the bases in bamberg and würzburg soon to be deserted , " schmidt told dw-radio . looming economic and social problems " we ’ ve always come out in favor of providing financial help for restructuring programs after such a pull-out of troops .
but at present , there are no such means available , neither at federal , nor at community level .
we ’ ll see massive social and economic problems in the affected regions .
i ’ m optimistic that policy-makers will not leave these communities to their own devices and raise restructuring funds , probably also out of european union coffers . " schmidt , as well as bavaria ’ s christian social union leader edmund stoiber , is hoping that the defense minister will readjust his original plan to close down german military bases to the realities created by the us troop pull-out .
both theorized that a number of abandoned us bases may in the future be used by the bundeswehr instead . future planning is questioned “ i can only suggest thinking harder about harmonizing us and national defense policies , said schmidt .
" struck is expected to close down up to 100 bundeswehr bases over the next few years .
us bases will vanish too .
i ’ m not convinced that everything has been carefully coordinated yet .
i believe there ’ s a need to reconsider the planned scope of closures here . ” but the cash-strapped defense minister is unlikely to effect major changes .
many of germany 's military installations , struck argues , weren ’ t needed any longer 10 years ago , but the government was afforded the luxury of maintaining them anyway .
now , with a revamped defense strategy in place and all the budgetary constraints at hand , he says , that doesn ’ t make sense anymore . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us troop withdrawal raises concerns washington ’ s biggest military reorganization in 50 years has caused ripples around the world , but while the nations due to wave good-bye to us forces have issued muted regret , criticism is gaining pace in the us .

opposition voices have questioned his wisdom . german defense minister peter struck on tuesday set out for a summer tour of military bases to see how the current restructuring of the national armed forces is progressing .
in line with eu and nato defense policies , the bundeswehr is reshaping its troops to be better prepared for peacekeeping or peace-enforcing missions abroad . however , struck is facing a hard time explaining his decision to close numerous bundeswehr bases across the country , which will coincide with the large-scale withdrawal of us forces from western germany : struck had gained wide respect for starting to overhaul the national armed forces and handling out-of-area peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and the balkans .
while he has given up pipe smoking after the stroke he suffered in june , he has not reduced his ambitions to push through the biggest restructuring of the bundeswehr to date . troops to be cut down to 250,000 the emphasis will be on training mobile units to be employed quickly in crisis areas outside nato territory .
in the next couple of years , troop strength will be reduced by 30,000 to 250,000 - a measure long overdue after the end of the cold war .
the number of military bases will also be cut drastically .
details on the closures will be announced in november . opposition conservative defense spokesman christian schmidt warned about rushing into defense decisions now that it has been announced that the united states will be withdrawing a large contingent of their 70,000 troops now stationed in germany .
schmidt called on the defense minister on tuesday to ensure that the communities affected will receive some sort of compensation for the looming economic losses . " i myself come from a region which will be largely affected by the withdrawal of us troops with the bases in bamberg and würzburg soon to be deserted , " schmidt told dw-radio . looming economic and social problems " we ’ ve always come out in favor of providing financial help for restructuring programs after such a pull-out of troops .
but at present , there are no such means available , neither at federal , nor at community level .
we ’ ll see massive social and economic problems in the affected regions .
i ’ m optimistic that policy-makers will not leave these communities to their own devices and raise restructuring funds , probably also out of european union coffers . " schmidt , as well as bavaria ’ s christian social union leader edmund stoiber , is hoping that the defense minister will readjust his original plan to close down german military bases to the realities created by the us troop pull-out .
both theorized that a number of abandoned us bases may in the future be used by the bundeswehr instead . future planning is questioned “ i can only suggest thinking harder about harmonizing us and national defense policies , said schmidt .
" struck is expected to close down up to 100 bundeswehr bases over the next few years .
us bases will vanish too .
i ’ m not convinced that everything has been carefully coordinated yet .
i believe there ’ s a need to reconsider the planned scope of closures here . ” but the cash-strapped defense minister is unlikely to effect major changes .
many of germany 's military installations , struck argues , weren ’ t needed any longer 10 years ago , but the government was afforded the luxury of maintaining them anyway .
now , with a revamped defense strategy in place and all the budgetary constraints at hand , he says , that doesn ’ t make sense anymore . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us troop withdrawal raises concerns washington ’ s biggest military reorganization in 50 years has caused ripples around the world , but while the nations due to wave good-bye to us forces have issued muted regret , criticism is gaining pace in the us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.08.2004 moma berlin exhibition slammed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some art fans are unhappy with the show unhappy with the long entrance lines , art fans are directing criticism at the organizers of berlin 's moma exhibition .
now , a notable art critic is accusing the new york curators of cultural colonialism . judging by the huge number of visitors - more than 800,000 at last count - some of whom have lined up for more than eight hours to gain entry into the special exhibition of the new york-based museum of modern art 's -lrb- moma -rrb- show at berlin 's national gallery , it has been a huge success . many even credit the mania surrounding the display of more than 200 paintings and sculptures from moma 's famous collection with helping to spur tourism to germany 's capital to a post-world war ii high , and there is no indication that the steady flow of visitors will slack off before it closes on sept .
19 . however , increasing numbers of art fans who have had to wait - sometimes in the hot summer sun - are less inclined to view the exhibition as a triumph , and some have even accused the organizers of deliberately keeping the lines long in order to stir up publicity .
the fact that those willing to pay € 27 -lrb- $ 33 -rrb- can avoid the long lines entirely does stink a bit of cultural elitism . now werner spies , a noted art historian , one time friend of pablo picasso and max ernst , and former director of the national museum of modern art at the georges pompidou center in paris , has joined the critics . but the nature of his criticism is different .
in an article in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday , spies accused the new york-based curators - who decided on the exhibition 's content with no input from their berlin hosts - of cultural colonialism . american art the culmination of modern development ? the crux of spies ' criticism centers around the portion of the exhibit looking at modern art in the second half of the last century , which , compared to the first half , includes almost no selections from european masters .
in short , spies accuses the new york-based curators of falsely claiming that the " new american painting , " which emerged in the postwar years , is the culmination of the 20th century 's modern art movement . for spies , the failure to include the works of matisse , max ernst , dubuffet and giacometti , is inexcusable and not merely an oversight but suggests that moma curators have an agenda to determine the so-called canon of contemporary art to the americans ' advantage . " the americans who chose the selections are engaging in cultural politics , " he wrote .
" for them , the vatican of 20th century aesthetic , it is about establishing the canon of modern art … and the new york museum can in berlin - in an expansionist way - present american art as the culmination of that development . " in response to spies ' criticisms , peter raue , the director of the " friends of the national gallery , " which helped to bring the exhibition to berlin , told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the exhibit clearly shows the american view , which is just fine by him .
he said he could imagine that a berlin-curated show presenting the european perspective could possibly grace the galleries of moma in the future , thereby presenting a more balanced whole . numbers grow , opening hours extended in the meantime , the number of visitors hoping to gain entry continues to grow .
at times , the line wraps more than two times around the building .
and despite the museum 's decision to extend opening hours for the final weeks , the wait remains long . one industrious berlin-based engineer sent a four-page plan to the organizers detailing how to do away with the lines , which among other things , suggested the distribution of waiting numbers .
in response , according to newspaper reports , he was told that the lines were " necessary to create publicity . " according to a security official quoted in german papers , an ambulance has been called to the museum at least once a day to cart away would-be museum goers for whom the stress of contributing to the shows " publicity " has proven too much . some among them may be inclined to add their voices to the growing number of critics , though they are far more likely to bemoan practical considerations as opposed to the high-minded nature of the modern art canon .
others , however , will continue to view the chance to see this " once in a lifetime " exhibition as well worth the wait . editor 's note : while dw-tv is one of four media partners of moma in berlin , deutsche welle played no part in organizing or curating the exhibition . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de record year for berlin tourism expected the number of visitors to berlin may reach a postwar high in 2004 , berlin 's tourism organization revealed monday .

now , a notable art critic is accusing the new york curators of cultural colonialism . judging by the huge number of visitors - more than 800,000 at last count - some of whom have lined up for more than eight hours to gain entry into the special exhibition of the new york-based museum of modern art 's -lrb- moma -rrb- show at berlin 's national gallery , it has been a huge success . many even credit the mania surrounding the display of more than 200 paintings and sculptures from moma 's famous collection with helping to spur tourism to germany 's capital to a post-world war ii high , and there is no indication that the steady flow of visitors will slack off before it closes on sept .
19 . however , increasing numbers of art fans who have had to wait - sometimes in the hot summer sun - are less inclined to view the exhibition as a triumph , and some have even accused the organizers of deliberately keeping the lines long in order to stir up publicity .
the fact that those willing to pay € 27 -lrb- $ 33 -rrb- can avoid the long lines entirely does stink a bit of cultural elitism . now werner spies , a noted art historian , one time friend of pablo picasso and max ernst , and former director of the national museum of modern art at the georges pompidou center in paris , has joined the critics . but the nature of his criticism is different .
in an article in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday , spies accused the new york-based curators - who decided on the exhibition 's content with no input from their berlin hosts - of cultural colonialism . american art the culmination of modern development ? the crux of spies ' criticism centers around the portion of the exhibit looking at modern art in the second half of the last century , which , compared to the first half , includes almost no selections from european masters .
in short , spies accuses the new york-based curators of falsely claiming that the " new american painting , " which emerged in the postwar years , is the culmination of the 20th century 's modern art movement . for spies , the failure to include the works of matisse , max ernst , dubuffet and giacometti , is inexcusable and not merely an oversight but suggests that moma curators have an agenda to determine the so-called canon of contemporary art to the americans ' advantage . " the americans who chose the selections are engaging in cultural politics , " he wrote .
" for them , the vatican of 20th century aesthetic , it is about establishing the canon of modern art … and the new york museum can in berlin - in an expansionist way - present american art as the culmination of that development . " in response to spies ' criticisms , peter raue , the director of the " friends of the national gallery , " which helped to bring the exhibition to berlin , told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the exhibit clearly shows the american view , which is just fine by him .
he said he could imagine that a berlin-curated show presenting the european perspective could possibly grace the galleries of moma in the future , thereby presenting a more balanced whole . numbers grow , opening hours extended in the meantime , the number of visitors hoping to gain entry continues to grow .
at times , the line wraps more than two times around the building .
and despite the museum 's decision to extend opening hours for the final weeks , the wait remains long . one industrious berlin-based engineer sent a four-page plan to the organizers detailing how to do away with the lines , which among other things , suggested the distribution of waiting numbers .
in response , according to newspaper reports , he was told that the lines were " necessary to create publicity . " according to a security official quoted in german papers , an ambulance has been called to the museum at least once a day to cart away would-be museum goers for whom the stress of contributing to the shows " publicity " has proven too much . some among them may be inclined to add their voices to the growing number of critics , though they are far more likely to bemoan practical considerations as opposed to the high-minded nature of the modern art canon .
others , however , will continue to view the chance to see this " once in a lifetime " exhibition as well worth the wait . editor 's note : while dw-tv is one of four media partners of moma in berlin , deutsche welle played no part in organizing or curating the exhibition . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de record year for berlin tourism expected the number of visitors to berlin may reach a postwar high in 2004 , berlin 's tourism organization revealed monday .

he said he could imagine that a berlin-curated show presenting the european perspective could possibly grace the galleries of moma in the future , thereby presenting a more balanced whole . numbers grow , opening hours extended in the meantime , the number of visitors hoping to gain entry continues to grow .
at times , the line wraps more than two times around the building .
and despite the museum 's decision to extend opening hours for the final weeks , the wait remains long . one industrious berlin-based engineer sent a four-page plan to the organizers detailing how to do away with the lines , which among other things , suggested the distribution of waiting numbers .
in response , according to newspaper reports , he was told that the lines were " necessary to create publicity . " according to a security official quoted in german papers , an ambulance has been called to the museum at least once a day to cart away would-be museum goers for whom the stress of contributing to the shows " publicity " has proven too much . some among them may be inclined to add their voices to the growing number of critics , though they are far more likely to bemoan practical considerations as opposed to the high-minded nature of the modern art canon .
others , however , will continue to view the chance to see this " once in a lifetime " exhibition as well worth the wait . editor 's note : while dw-tv is one of four media partners of moma in berlin , deutsche welle played no part in organizing or curating the exhibition . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de record year for berlin tourism expected the number of visitors to berlin may reach a postwar high in 2004 , berlin 's tourism organization revealed monday .

in past years , a rise in weight levels among children from germany 's immigrant families , a largely ignored group in obesity research until recently , has fuelled concern among health authorities . " sitting on a powder keg " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister renate künast is spearheading the drive for healthy nutrition to bring down obesity levels .
the german minister for consumer protection and agriculture , renate künast , estimated this year that every fifth child and every third teenager in germany is overweight .
the number of obese children signing up for school has risen three-fold compared to a decade ago .
" the country is sitting on a powder keg , " künast warned . though there are no country-wide studies on the prevalence of obesity among migrant children , statistics on the problem in cities with high foreign populations leave little room for doubt . in frankfurt , home to around 180,000 immigrants from 180 nations , research on the number of those children who joined school this year found that 12.5 percent were overweight . experts say that a six-year-old who has a body mass index of 15.4 is considered of normal weight .
the frankfurt statistics showed that moroccan and turkish children , in particular , had a body mass index of more than 18 percent , at 18.4 and 22 percent respectively .
among ten-year-olds , turkish children weighed the most at 34 percent , compared to 19 percent for german youngsters . eating to the point of disorder " it 's alarming , " holger meireis , head of frankfurt 's child and youth department told dw-world .
" if you interpret immigration in a broad sense , beyond borders of nationality , then almost 50 percent of frankfurt 's foreign population is overweight .
it ca n't be ignored any longer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neukölln is home to a large muslim population .
dr rainer moehl , a physician in neukölln , an immigrant-dominated berlin neighborhood , agreed that obesity was a widespread problem among his patients .
" by the time children in turkish and arab families reach school-going age , there 's usually a clear gender-specific difference : it 's mostly boys who develop obesity during puberty , while girls have eating disorders like bulimia , " moehl said . he warned that overweight children are likely to develop problems such as mobility and spinal and metabolic disorders , high blood pressure , diabetes and depression . filling the stomach cheaply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that low income and education levels can have disastrous consequences for obese people .
while experts point to the usual suspects - too much television , too little activity , fast food and sweets - they agree that the spread of obesity among migrant children is largely tied to their financial and social situation . jeffrey butler from the health department in berlin 's wedding district , which holds the dubious record of being home to berlin 's pudgiest kids -lrb- 20.7 percent body mass index -rrb- , points to the fact that the neighborhood is also one of the capital 's poorest . with an unemployment rate of around 24 percent , low education levels and around 26 percent of children and teenagers living on welfare , wedding has acquired notoriety as a social flashpoint . " most of the families here do n't have the means to buy healthy food , even if they wanted to , " butler said .

meat is a staple among turks .
" the common family meal is the focal point in a turkish home , and traditional turkish cuisine is actually healthy , " jutta kolletzki , a therapist who runs a counseling and treatment center for weight-loss and eating disorders in frankfurt , said .
" but meals are cooked with so much sugar and fat that it turns into a real calorie bomb , " she said . kolletzki added that many immigrants often are n't well-informed about what constitutes healthy nutrition .
differing perspectives of health also contribute to the problem , she said .
" in traditional families , a tubby child is usually considered well-fed and a sign of prosperity rather than as a problem , " kolletzki explained . she also warned that children straddling two cultures are often under a lot of emotional stress .

obesity among migrant children is now recognized as a serious problem , judging by the number of initiatives and projects springing up in several german cities to tackle it . most involve networking with kindergartens and schools to encourage them to introduce healthy breakfasts and impress upon the kids and parents the benefits of a healthy diet and exercise .

in past years , a rise in weight levels among children from germany 's immigrant families , a largely ignored group in obesity research until recently , has fuelled concern among health authorities . " sitting on a powder keg " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister renate künast is spearheading the drive for healthy nutrition to bring down obesity levels .
the german minister for consumer protection and agriculture , renate künast , estimated this year that every fifth child and every third teenager in germany is overweight .
the number of obese children signing up for school has risen three-fold compared to a decade ago .
" the country is sitting on a powder keg , " künast warned . though there are no country-wide studies on the prevalence of obesity among migrant children , statistics on the problem in cities with high foreign populations leave little room for doubt . in frankfurt , home to around 180,000 immigrants from 180 nations , research on the number of those children who joined school this year found that 12.5 percent were overweight . experts say that a six-year-old who has a body mass index of 15.4 is considered of normal weight .
the frankfurt statistics showed that moroccan and turkish children , in particular , had a body mass index of more than 18 percent , at 18.4 and 22 percent respectively .
among ten-year-olds , turkish children weighed the most at 34 percent , compared to 19 percent for german youngsters . eating to the point of disorder " it 's alarming , " holger meireis , head of frankfurt 's child and youth department told dw-world .
" if you interpret immigration in a broad sense , beyond borders of nationality , then almost 50 percent of frankfurt 's foreign population is overweight .
it ca n't be ignored any longer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neukölln is home to a large muslim population .
dr rainer moehl , a physician in neukölln , an immigrant-dominated berlin neighborhood , agreed that obesity was a widespread problem among his patients .
" by the time children in turkish and arab families reach school-going age , there 's usually a clear gender-specific difference : it 's mostly boys who develop obesity during puberty , while girls have eating disorders like bulimia , " moehl said . he warned that overweight children are likely to develop problems such as mobility and spinal and metabolic disorders , high blood pressure , diabetes and depression . filling the stomach cheaply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that low income and education levels can have disastrous consequences for obese people .
while experts point to the usual suspects - too much television , too little activity , fast food and sweets - they agree that the spread of obesity among migrant children is largely tied to their financial and social situation . jeffrey butler from the health department in berlin 's wedding district , which holds the dubious record of being home to berlin 's pudgiest kids -lrb- 20.7 percent body mass index -rrb- , points to the fact that the neighborhood is also one of the capital 's poorest . with an unemployment rate of around 24 percent , low education levels and around 26 percent of children and teenagers living on welfare , wedding has acquired notoriety as a social flashpoint . " most of the families here do n't have the means to buy healthy food , even if they wanted to , " butler said .
" it 's just easier to shop for packaged and fast food that fills you up . " calories and stress others caution that the problem has much more complex cultural reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations in a döner shop in berlin .
meat is a staple among turks .
" the common family meal is the focal point in a turkish home , and traditional turkish cuisine is actually healthy , " jutta kolletzki , a therapist who runs a counseling and treatment center for weight-loss and eating disorders in frankfurt , said .
" but meals are cooked with so much sugar and fat that it turns into a real calorie bomb , " she said . kolletzki added that many immigrants often are n't well-informed about what constitutes healthy nutrition .
differing perspectives of health also contribute to the problem , she said .
" in traditional families , a tubby child is usually considered well-fed and a sign of prosperity rather than as a problem , " kolletzki explained . she also warned that children straddling two cultures are often under a lot of emotional stress .
" separations or moving from one country to another is difficult for a child , " she said .
" eating more is a way of coping with it . " battle of the bulge bildunterschrift : children take part in a weight-loss program at germany 's baltic sea coast .
obesity among migrant children is now recognized as a serious problem , judging by the number of initiatives and projects springing up in several german cities to tackle it . most involve networking with kindergartens and schools to encourage them to introduce healthy breakfasts and impress upon the kids and parents the benefits of a healthy diet and exercise .
the emphasis is on prevention , taking into account cultural differences and using interpreters to reach the target groups . minister künast is kicking off a major nationwide project in september involving parents , health insurance companies and the food industry .
a spokeswoman at the ministry stressed that though this was n't a special programs for migrant children as yet , they were working on it . germany , it seems , is determined to win the battle of the bulge and avoid the rather drastic scenario predicted in a recent british survey , which suggested that the younger generation would be the first to die before their parents .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.08.2004 us troop withdrawal raises concerns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-nato commander wesley clark warns of a military mistake washington ’ s biggest military reorganization in 50 years has caused ripples around the world , but while the nations due to wave good-bye to us forces have issued muted regret , criticism is gaining pace in the us . the decision by the united states to push through the biggest defense overhaul since world war ii has caused concern in those countries from which troops will be removed and raised critical voices at home and abroad . the us defense department 's plan to revolutionize the military by redeploying 70,000 soldiers currently serving in europe and asia has social and political implications for all those involved . in germany , where 30,000 u.s. troops are expected to wave good-bye in the re-deployment , many communities that will be hit by the decision have slammed the cuts , warning they would send many regions to the edge of economic disaster .
the politicians , however , have been doing their best to hide their displeasure . germany regrets decision but understands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary donald rumsfeld with german defense minister peter struck german defense minister peter struck said in a statement that he regretted the withdrawal , but washington had no choice .
" that 's a big loss to a lot of regions , " he said .
" but the decision of the us president is without alternative . " karsten voigt , berlin 's coordinator for german-american relations , said germany would remain the largest base for us troops in europe and security in europe was not at risk . " but , nevertheless , the withdrawal of troops is a loss , of course .
we regret it ; the american soldiers were welcome here .
but it is a sign of success at the same time - the success of having overcome the cold war and european division , " voigt told reporters . the us plans to move about half of its foreign-based troops , with many heading back to the states and others from european bases penciled in for deployment in the former soviet baltic republics .
this news has raised concerns in russia , which has called for a detailed explanation of the military re-organization .
russia suspicious of us intentions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. forces could be on russia 's doorstep .
moscow is concerned that as the nato alliance expands , the united states will station troops along its borders .
further , it continues to worry about the future presence of western troops in energy-rich centra asian , which russia once dominated .
the russian foreign ministry said in a statement that , “ our view of these plans will depend on the spelled-out details , and whether they pose a danger to russia ’ s national interests . ”
moscow ’ s statement stressed that it expected washington to adhere to previous agreements that , in moscow ’ s view , ban the united states from stationing its troops in the baltics or the caucasus . democrats seize on bush 's plan but while the germans were putting on a brave face and the russians remained edgy , opposition to the withdrawal in the united states was more vociferous .
unsurprisingly , the majority of criticism came from supporters of democratic presidential candidate john kerry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke " this is another example of the -lrb- bush -rrb- administration 's unilateralism .
it 's going to weaken our national security , " said richard holbrooke , a kerry foreign policy adviser and former ambassador to the un and germany under former president clinton , in a widely reported statement .
" it is not going to save us money .
it will cost billions of dollars to bring these troops home . " holbrooke also focused on the economic demands which the troop redeployment would shift from the host countries back to the united states .
" germany , south korea and japan , which will see the biggest cuts , all spend billions of dollars to support the troops .
and i am very concerned about this . " holbrooke also rejected president george w. bush 's assertion that bringing the troops home would make it easier to rapidly deploy them to global trouble spots .
he called bases in germany , south korea and okinawa " essential " along with other forward deployments . " even in the modern world , airplanes take time to get places , " holbrooke said .
" this is a weakening of our traditional ties to our closest allies just when we need them most . " ex-general clark warns of timing in terror war another kerry-supporter , retired army general wesley clark , warned of a military mistake in the making .
" as we face a global war on terror with al qaeda active in more than 60 countries , now is not the time to pull back our forces . " clark , who commanded nato and us forces in europe from 1997 to 2000 , added in his statement : " this ill-conceived move and its timing seem politically motivated rather than designed to strengthen our national security . " kerry to publicly address restructuring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential hopeful john kerry is expected to criticize the us troop plans .
kerry himself is expected to voice his own opposition to the bush administration 's plans when he gives a speech to the veterans of foreign wars in cincinnati on wednesday .
it will be a chance for the presidential candidate make clear one of the distinct strategic differences between himself and george w. bush .
kerry is preparing to argue that the withdrawal of troops from europe and asia threatens to undercut alliances and weakens america 's ability to project its power overseas , according to michael meehan , a senior adviser in the democratic party , quoted in the financial times .
meehan told the ft that kerry will make a " sweeping critique " of the realignment at the convention in cincinnati , the same venue where the president this week announced the planned withdrawal of a third of us forces from their foreign bases . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us troop pullout to hit local german economies the impact of us plans to pull some 70,000 troops out of europe and asia is likely to be felt most acutely in germany - especially in smaller towns whose economies depend on the us presence .
-lrb- august 17 , 2004 -rrb- bush : " our posture must change " us president george w. bush has announced plans to shift up to 70,000 us troops stationed in western europe and asia .
some of them are expected to be moved to posts in eastern europe while others will return home .

now eu reality has hit them - a disappointment for many . " some things were meant to become cheaper - german beer , for example , but it still costs as much as before , " one woman told german public broadcaster wdr .
" phoning people and using the internet was supposed to become cheaper , because there 's more competition .
but nothing 's happening , which is something that i 'm personally sad about , because i 've been waiting for things to change . " another woman agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : market square in warsaw " i 'm only hearing about the positive things in radio and tv and reading about it in the newspapers - that our exports are up and that it 's going to get better and better for us , " she said .
" but i 'm not seeing that happening . " she added that meat was a third more expensive now and prices for medicines had also increased .
pensions on the other hand had stayed the same , she said . beef and poultry prices have indeed increased by about 18 percent , according to a report by the national bank of poland .
on the other hand , few things have become cheaper : electronics , wine and beer have just gone down 0.5 percent in price . farming business is booming polish farmers on the other hand are more upbeat .
a few months ago , they were still considered the problem children of poland 's eu accession .
badly organized and working on small farms , officials worried that farmers would not be able to compete internationally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a farmer offering vegetables in warsaw but business is booming : asparagus , fruit , potatoes , wheat and mushrooms from poland have become bestsellers in the eu .
farmers also have overcome their initial hesitation to apply for financial help from brussels . " if 1.3 million farmers are able to apply for funds , that 's something that we can be proud of , " polish agriculture minister wojciech olejniczak told wdr .
" and we 'll convince those that are still hesitating - maybe not tomorrow , but definitely by the end of the year . " fishermen struggle to adjust the country 's fishermen , however , say they are suffering rather than benefiting from eu accession : they now have to deal with fishing limits imposed by the union and eu incentives not to fish at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists protested against the eu fishing policies in berlin as fishermen throw millions of fish back into the sea because they are too small " the only thing i can do is trample on the catch and throw it back into the sea , " one fisherman told wdr .
" but everyone wants to work .
i ca n't imaging giving up so quickly .
it 's horror for me .
i 'll be spending the -lrb- incentive -rrb- money and at some point there wo n't be any more .
and what happens then ? " it 's a problem polish used car sellers do n't face at the moment .
in may and june alone , they imported more than 160,000 cars from western europe - that 's five times as many as during the entire year of 2003 . thomas rautenberg -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro goes east the 10 new eu countries are expected to eventually adopt the euro as their currency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.08.2004 moma berlin exhibition slammed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some art fans are unhappy with the show unhappy with the long entrance lines , art fans are directing criticism at the organizers of berlin 's moma exhibition .
now , a notable art critic is accusing the new york curators of cultural colonialism . judging by the huge number of visitors - more than 800,000 at last count - some of whom have lined up for more than eight hours to gain entry into the special exhibition of the new york-based museum of modern art 's -lrb- moma -rrb- show at berlin 's national gallery , it has been a huge success . many even credit the mania surrounding the display of more than 200 paintings and sculptures from moma 's famous collection with helping to spur tourism to germany 's capital to a post-world war ii high , and there is no indication that the steady flow of visitors will slack off before it closes on sept .
19 . however , increasing numbers of art fans who have had to wait - sometimes in the hot summer sun - are less inclined to view the exhibition as a triumph , and some have even accused the organizers of deliberately keeping the lines long in order to stir up publicity .
the fact that those willing to pay € 27 -lrb- $ 33 -rrb- can avoid the long lines entirely does stink a bit of cultural elitism . now werner spies , a noted art historian , one time friend of pablo picasso and max ernst , and former director of the national museum of modern art at the georges pompidou center in paris , has joined the critics . but the nature of his criticism is different .
in an article in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday , spies accused the new york-based curators - who decided on the exhibition 's content with no input from their berlin hosts - of cultural colonialism . american art the culmination of modern development ? the crux of spies ' criticism centers around the portion of the exhibit looking at modern art in the second half of the last century , which , compared to the first half , includes almost no selections from european masters .
in short , spies accuses the new york-based curators of falsely claiming that the " new american painting , " which emerged in the postwar years , is the culmination of the 20th century 's modern art movement . for spies , the failure to include the works of matisse , max ernst , dubuffet and giacometti , is inexcusable and not merely an oversight but suggests that moma curators have an agenda to determine the so-called canon of contemporary art to the americans ' advantage . " the americans who chose the selections are engaging in cultural politics , " he wrote .
" for them , the vatican of 20th century aesthetic , it is about establishing the canon of modern art … and the new york museum can in berlin - in an expansionist way - present american art as the culmination of that development . " in response to spies ' criticisms , peter raue , the director of the " friends of the national gallery , " which helped to bring the exhibition to berlin , told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the exhibit clearly shows the american view , which is just fine by him .
he said he could imagine that a berlin-curated show presenting the european perspective could possibly grace the galleries of moma in the future , thereby presenting a more balanced whole . numbers grow , opening hours extended in the meantime , the number of visitors hoping to gain entry continues to grow .
at times , the line wraps more than two times around the building .
and despite the museum 's decision to extend opening hours for the final weeks , the wait remains long . one industrious berlin-based engineer sent a four-page plan to the organizers detailing how to do away with the lines , which among other things , suggested the distribution of waiting numbers .
in response , according to newspaper reports , he was told that the lines were " necessary to create publicity . " according to a security official quoted in german papers , an ambulance has been called to the museum at least once a day to cart away would-be museum goers for whom the stress of contributing to the shows " publicity " has proven too much . some among them may be inclined to add their voices to the growing number of critics , though they are far more likely to bemoan practical considerations as opposed to the high-minded nature of the modern art canon .
others , however , will continue to view the chance to see this " once in a lifetime " exhibition as well worth the wait . editor 's note : while dw-tv is one of four media partners of moma in berlin , deutsche welle played no part in organizing or curating the exhibition . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de record year for berlin tourism expected the number of visitors to berlin may reach a postwar high in 2004 , berlin 's tourism organization revealed monday .

now eu reality has hit them - a disappointment for many . " some things were meant to become cheaper - german beer , for example , but it still costs as much as before , " one woman told german public broadcaster wdr .
" phoning people and using the internet was supposed to become cheaper , because there 's more competition .
but nothing 's happening , which is something that i 'm personally sad about , because i 've been waiting for things to change . " another woman agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : market square in warsaw " i 'm only hearing about the positive things in radio and tv and reading about it in the newspapers - that our exports are up and that it 's going to get better and better for us , " she said .
" but i 'm not seeing that happening . " she added that meat was a third more expensive now and prices for medicines had also increased .
pensions on the other hand had stayed the same , she said . beef and poultry prices have indeed increased by about 18 percent , according to a report by the national bank of poland .
on the other hand , few things have become cheaper : electronics , wine and beer have just gone down 0.5 percent in price . farming business is booming polish farmers on the other hand are more upbeat .
a few months ago , they were still considered the problem children of poland 's eu accession .
badly organized and working on small farms , officials worried that farmers would not be able to compete internationally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a farmer offering vegetables in warsaw but business is booming : asparagus , fruit , potatoes , wheat and mushrooms from poland have become bestsellers in the eu .
farmers also have overcome their initial hesitation to apply for financial help from brussels . " if 1.3 million farmers are able to apply for funds , that 's something that we can be proud of , " polish agriculture minister wojciech olejniczak told wdr .
" and we 'll convince those that are still hesitating - maybe not tomorrow , but definitely by the end of the year . " fishermen struggle to adjust the country 's fishermen , however , say they are suffering rather than benefiting from eu accession : they now have to deal with fishing limits imposed by the union and eu incentives not to fish at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists protested against the eu fishing policies in berlin as fishermen throw millions of fish back into the sea because they are too small " the only thing i can do is trample on the catch and throw it back into the sea , " one fisherman told wdr .
" but everyone wants to work .
i ca n't imaging giving up so quickly .
it 's horror for me .
i 'll be spending the -lrb- incentive -rrb- money and at some point there wo n't be any more .
and what happens then ? " it 's a problem polish used car sellers do n't face at the moment .
in may and june alone , they imported more than 160,000 cars from western europe - that 's five times as many as during the entire year of 2003 . thomas rautenberg -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro goes east the 10 new eu countries are expected to eventually adopt the euro as their currency .

the politicians , however , have been doing their best to hide their displeasure . germany regrets decision but understands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary donald rumsfeld with german defense minister peter struck german defense minister peter struck said in a statement that he regretted the withdrawal , but washington had no choice .
" that 's a big loss to a lot of regions , " he said .
" but the decision of the us president is without alternative . " karsten voigt , berlin 's coordinator for german-american relations , said germany would remain the largest base for us troops in europe and security in europe was not at risk . " but , nevertheless , the withdrawal of troops is a loss , of course .
we regret it ; the american soldiers were welcome here .
but it is a sign of success at the same time - the success of having overcome the cold war and european division , " voigt told reporters . the us plans to move about half of its foreign-based troops , with many heading back to the states and others from european bases penciled in for deployment in the former soviet baltic republics .
this news has raised concerns in russia , which has called for a detailed explanation of the military re-organization .
russia suspicious of us intentions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. forces could be on russia 's doorstep .
moscow is concerned that as the nato alliance expands , the united states will station troops along its borders .
further , it continues to worry about the future presence of western troops in energy-rich centra asian , which russia once dominated .
the russian foreign ministry said in a statement that , “ our view of these plans will depend on the spelled-out details , and whether they pose a danger to russia ’ s national interests . ”
moscow ’ s statement stressed that it expected washington to adhere to previous agreements that , in moscow ’ s view , ban the united states from stationing its troops in the baltics or the caucasus . democrats seize on bush 's plan but while the germans were putting on a brave face and the russians remained edgy , opposition to the withdrawal in the united states was more vociferous .
unsurprisingly , the majority of criticism came from supporters of democratic presidential candidate john kerry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke " this is another example of the -lrb- bush -rrb- administration 's unilateralism .
it 's going to weaken our national security , " said richard holbrooke , a kerry foreign policy adviser and former ambassador to the un and germany under former president clinton , in a widely reported statement .
" it is not going to save us money .
it will cost billions of dollars to bring these troops home . " holbrooke also focused on the economic demands which the troop redeployment would shift from the host countries back to the united states .
" germany , south korea and japan , which will see the biggest cuts , all spend billions of dollars to support the troops .
and i am very concerned about this . " holbrooke also rejected president george w. bush 's assertion that bringing the troops home would make it easier to rapidly deploy them to global trouble spots .
he called bases in germany , south korea and okinawa " essential " along with other forward deployments . " even in the modern world , airplanes take time to get places , " holbrooke said .
" this is a weakening of our traditional ties to our closest allies just when we need them most . " ex-general clark warns of timing in terror war another kerry-supporter , retired army general wesley clark , warned of a military mistake in the making .
" as we face a global war on terror with al qaeda active in more than 60 countries , now is not the time to pull back our forces . " clark , who commanded nato and us forces in europe from 1997 to 2000 , added in his statement : " this ill-conceived move and its timing seem politically motivated rather than designed to strengthen our national security . " kerry to publicly address restructuring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential hopeful john kerry is expected to criticize the us troop plans .
kerry himself is expected to voice his own opposition to the bush administration 's plans when he gives a speech to the veterans of foreign wars in cincinnati on wednesday .
it will be a chance for the presidential candidate make clear one of the distinct strategic differences between himself and george w. bush .
kerry is preparing to argue that the withdrawal of troops from europe and asia threatens to undercut alliances and weakens america 's ability to project its power overseas , according to michael meehan , a senior adviser in the democratic party , quoted in the financial times .
meehan told the ft that kerry will make a " sweeping critique " of the realignment at the convention in cincinnati , the same venue where the president this week announced the planned withdrawal of a third of us forces from their foreign bases . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us troop pullout to hit local german economies the impact of us plans to pull some 70,000 troops out of europe and asia is likely to be felt most acutely in germany - especially in smaller towns whose economies depend on the us presence .

but it was no ordinary auto .
the daimlerchrysler vehicle presented to him had something special under the hood : hydrogen fuel cell technology . the gleaming new model sitting in the car park outside schröder 's office in berlin is one of the prototype models fitted with the f-cell hydrogen technology that daimlerchrysler hopes will revolutionize motoring and help in the fight to reduce carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions from cars . the chancellor will have one year to test the car out as part of the company 's on-going research into greener fuel possibilities which has seen 60 cars enter production and deployed for testing around the world . the fuel cells which power the car use a combination of hydrogen and oxygen which makes them and the vehicle itself environmentally friendly . its only emission is water , which is so pure that daimlerchrysler claim its fit for human consumption .
the electric motor creates a maximum output of 65 kilowatts and will power the car for 160 kilometers -lrb- 100 miles -rrb- at a maximum speed of 140 kilometers per hour -lrb- kph -rrb- . here comes the science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fuel cell car 's motor the hydrogen fuel cell operates similar to a battery .
it has two electrodes , an anode and a cathode , separated by a membrane .
oxygen passes over one electrode and hydrogen over the other . the hydrogen reacts to a catalyst on the electrode anode that converts the hydrogen gas into negatively charged electrons and positively charged ions .
the electrons flow out of the cell to be used as electrical energy . the hydrogen ions move through the electrolyte membrane to the cathode electrode where they combine with oxygen and the electrons to produce water .
unlike batteries , fuel cells never run out . f-cell technology leading the way schröder received the car from daimlerchrysler board member jürgen hubbert and praised the efforts of the company to develop more environmentally friendly vehicles , especially at a time of increased oil prices and concerns over the effects of co2 emissions in relation to climate change . " this shows that we are on the right track , " the chancellor said , running an impressed eye over his new loan car . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler is also testing the technology on buses experts from daimlerchrysler estimate that the first commercial fuel-cell car should be ready by 2010 .
the auto manufacturer hopes it will cost around the same as regular cars . daimlerchrysler has spent over € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- in the development process and already enjoys more success than initially hoped for this stage by producing vehicles fit for use . the german car giant first grabbed the headlines with its hydrogen fuel program with its necar 4 model in 1999 .
the necar 4 , based on a mercedes-benz a-class compact car , was a liquid hydrogen vehicle with a top speed of 144 kph and a 450 kilometer tank capacity . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans still think green despite pressing problems such as unemployment and a stagnant economy , the majority of germans are still concerned about environmental issues and award it a high priority according to the results of a new study .

now , a notable art critic is accusing the new york curators of cultural colonialism . judging by the huge number of visitors - more than 800,000 at last count - some of whom have lined up for more than eight hours to gain entry into the special exhibition of the new york-based museum of modern art 's -lrb- moma -rrb- show at berlin 's national gallery , it has been a huge success . many even credit the mania surrounding the display of more than 200 paintings and sculptures from moma 's famous collection with helping to spur tourism to germany 's capital to a post-world war ii high , and there is no indication that the steady flow of visitors will slack off before it closes on sept .
19 . however , increasing numbers of art fans who have had to wait - sometimes in the hot summer sun - are less inclined to view the exhibition as a triumph , and some have even accused the organizers of deliberately keeping the lines long in order to stir up publicity .
the fact that those willing to pay € 27 -lrb- $ 33 -rrb- can avoid the long lines entirely does stink a bit of cultural elitism . now werner spies , a noted art historian , one time friend of pablo picasso and max ernst , and former director of the national museum of modern art at the georges pompidou center in paris , has joined the critics . but the nature of his criticism is different .
in an article in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday , spies accused the new york-based curators - who decided on the exhibition 's content with no input from their berlin hosts - of cultural colonialism . american art the culmination of modern development ? the crux of spies ' criticism centers around the portion of the exhibit looking at modern art in the second half of the last century , which , compared to the first half , includes almost no selections from european masters .
in short , spies accuses the new york-based curators of falsely claiming that the " new american painting , " which emerged in the postwar years , is the culmination of the 20th century 's modern art movement . for spies , the failure to include the works of matisse , max ernst , dubuffet and giacometti , is inexcusable and not merely an oversight but suggests that moma curators have an agenda to determine the so-called canon of contemporary art to the americans ' advantage . " the americans who chose the selections are engaging in cultural politics , " he wrote .
" for them , the vatican of 20th century aesthetic , it is about establishing the canon of modern art … and the new york museum can in berlin - in an expansionist way - present american art as the culmination of that development . " in response to spies ' criticisms , peter raue , the director of the " friends of the national gallery , " which helped to bring the exhibition to berlin , told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the exhibit clearly shows the american view , which is just fine by him .
he said he could imagine that a berlin-curated show presenting the european perspective could possibly grace the galleries of moma in the future , thereby presenting a more balanced whole . numbers grow , opening hours extended in the meantime , the number of visitors hoping to gain entry continues to grow .
at times , the line wraps more than two times around the building .
and despite the museum 's decision to extend opening hours for the final weeks , the wait remains long . one industrious berlin-based engineer sent a four-page plan to the organizers detailing how to do away with the lines , which among other things , suggested the distribution of waiting numbers .
in response , according to newspaper reports , he was told that the lines were " necessary to create publicity . " according to a security official quoted in german papers , an ambulance has been called to the museum at least once a day to cart away would-be museum goers for whom the stress of contributing to the shows " publicity " has proven too much . some among them may be inclined to add their voices to the growing number of critics , though they are far more likely to bemoan practical considerations as opposed to the high-minded nature of the modern art canon .
others , however , will continue to view the chance to see this " once in a lifetime " exhibition as well worth the wait . editor 's note : while dw-tv is one of four media partners of moma in berlin , deutsche welle played no part in organizing or curating the exhibition . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de record year for berlin tourism expected the number of visitors to berlin may reach a postwar high in 2004 , berlin 's tourism organization revealed monday .

even as health experts warn that german youngsters are getting fatter , obesity levels continue to climb among the country 's migrant children population .
television and fast food are n't the only culprits . on a sunny august day , ten-year-old murat -lrb- name changed -rrb- lies on his back on a grassy lawn at a public outdoor swimming pool in berlin 's wedding district , home to a large immigrant population . licking a chocolate ice cream , murat , who is of turkish origin , might sound like a normal youngster , but he does n't look like one .
clad in an " l " size pair of swimming trunks , the porky fourth-grader tips the scales at nearly 44 kilos -lrb- 97 lbs . -rrb- . " the school authorities said he needs to exercise and lose weight .
that 's why i take him for a swim here , " his mother ayse -lrb- name changed -rrb- told dw-world .
the ice cream , she said , is a reward for him doing two laps in the pool .
" besides , it 's so hot , " she added . murat , who said his favorite food is nutella -lrb- a chocolate spread -rrb- , is not alone .
in past years , a rise in weight levels among children from germany 's immigrant families , a largely ignored group in obesity research until recently , has fuelled concern among health authorities . " sitting on a powder keg " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister renate künast is spearheading the drive for healthy nutrition to bring down obesity levels .
the german minister for consumer protection and agriculture , renate künast , estimated this year that every fifth child and every third teenager in germany is overweight .
the number of obese children signing up for school has risen three-fold compared to a decade ago .
" the country is sitting on a powder keg , " künast warned . though there are no country-wide studies on the prevalence of obesity among migrant children , statistics on the problem in cities with high foreign populations leave little room for doubt . in frankfurt , home to around 180,000 immigrants from 180 nations , research on the number of those children who joined school this year found that 12.5 percent were overweight . experts say that a six-year-old who has a body mass index of 15.4 is considered of normal weight .
the frankfurt statistics showed that moroccan and turkish children , in particular , had a body mass index of more than 18 percent , at 18.4 and 22 percent respectively .
among ten-year-olds , turkish children weighed the most at 34 percent , compared to 19 percent for german youngsters . eating to the point of disorder " it 's alarming , " holger meireis , head of frankfurt 's child and youth department told dw-world .
" if you interpret immigration in a broad sense , beyond borders of nationality , then almost 50 percent of frankfurt 's foreign population is overweight .
it ca n't be ignored any longer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neukölln is home to a large muslim population .
dr rainer moehl , a physician in neukölln , an immigrant-dominated berlin neighborhood , agreed that obesity was a widespread problem among his patients .
" by the time children in turkish and arab families reach school-going age , there 's usually a clear gender-specific difference : it 's mostly boys who develop obesity during puberty , while girls have eating disorders like bulimia , " moehl said . he warned that overweight children are likely to develop problems such as mobility and spinal and metabolic disorders , high blood pressure , diabetes and depression . filling the stomach cheaply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that low income and education levels can have disastrous consequences for obese people .
while experts point to the usual suspects - too much television , too little activity , fast food and sweets - they agree that the spread of obesity among migrant children is largely tied to their financial and social situation . jeffrey butler from the health department in berlin 's wedding district , which holds the dubious record of being home to berlin 's pudgiest kids -lrb- 20.7 percent body mass index -rrb- , points to the fact that the neighborhood is also one of the capital 's poorest . with an unemployment rate of around 24 percent , low education levels and around 26 percent of children and teenagers living on welfare , wedding has acquired notoriety as a social flashpoint . " most of the families here do n't have the means to buy healthy food , even if they wanted to , " butler said .
" it 's just easier to shop for packaged and fast food that fills you up . " calories and stress others caution that the problem has much more complex cultural reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations in a döner shop in berlin .
meat is a staple among turks .
" the common family meal is the focal point in a turkish home , and traditional turkish cuisine is actually healthy , " jutta kolletzki , a therapist who runs a counseling and treatment center for weight-loss and eating disorders in frankfurt , said .
" but meals are cooked with so much sugar and fat that it turns into a real calorie bomb , " she said . kolletzki added that many immigrants often are n't well-informed about what constitutes healthy nutrition .
differing perspectives of health also contribute to the problem , she said .
" in traditional families , a tubby child is usually considered well-fed and a sign of prosperity rather than as a problem , " kolletzki explained . she also warned that children straddling two cultures are often under a lot of emotional stress .
" separations or moving from one country to another is difficult for a child , " she said .
" eating more is a way of coping with it . " battle of the bulge bildunterschrift : children take part in a weight-loss program at germany 's baltic sea coast .
obesity among migrant children is now recognized as a serious problem , judging by the number of initiatives and projects springing up in several german cities to tackle it . most involve networking with kindergartens and schools to encourage them to introduce healthy breakfasts and impress upon the kids and parents the benefits of a healthy diet and exercise .
the emphasis is on prevention , taking into account cultural differences and using interpreters to reach the target groups . minister künast is kicking off a major nationwide project in september involving parents , health insurance companies and the food industry .
a spokeswoman at the ministry stressed that though this was n't a special programs for migrant children as yet , they were working on it . germany , it seems , is determined to win the battle of the bulge and avoid the rather drastic scenario predicted in a recent british survey , which suggested that the younger generation would be the first to die before their parents .

opposition voices have questioned his wisdom . german defense minister peter struck on tuesday set out for a summer tour of military bases to see how the current restructuring of the national armed forces is progressing .
in line with eu and nato defense policies , the bundeswehr is reshaping its troops to be better prepared for peacekeeping or peace-enforcing missions abroad . however , struck is facing a hard time explaining his decision to close numerous bundeswehr bases across the country , which will coincide with the large-scale withdrawal of us forces from western germany : struck had gained wide respect for starting to overhaul the national armed forces and handling out-of-area peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and the balkans .
while he has given up pipe smoking after the stroke he suffered in june , he has not reduced his ambitions to push through the biggest restructuring of the bundeswehr to date . troops to be cut down to 250,000 the emphasis will be on training mobile units to be employed quickly in crisis areas outside nato territory .
in the next couple of years , troop strength will be reduced by 30,000 to 250,000 - a measure long overdue after the end of the cold war .
the number of military bases will also be cut drastically .
details on the closures will be announced in november . opposition conservative defense spokesman christian schmidt warned about rushing into defense decisions now that it has been announced that the united states will be withdrawing a large contingent of their 70,000 troops now stationed in germany .
schmidt called on the defense minister on tuesday to ensure that the communities affected will receive some sort of compensation for the looming economic losses . " i myself come from a region which will be largely affected by the withdrawal of us troops with the bases in bamberg and würzburg soon to be deserted , " schmidt told dw-radio . looming economic and social problems " we ’ ve always come out in favor of providing financial help for restructuring programs after such a pull-out of troops .
but at present , there are no such means available , neither at federal , nor at community level .
we ’ ll see massive social and economic problems in the affected regions .
i ’ m optimistic that policy-makers will not leave these communities to their own devices and raise restructuring funds , probably also out of european union coffers . " schmidt , as well as bavaria ’ s christian social union leader edmund stoiber , is hoping that the defense minister will readjust his original plan to close down german military bases to the realities created by the us troop pull-out .
both theorized that a number of abandoned us bases may in the future be used by the bundeswehr instead . future planning is questioned “ i can only suggest thinking harder about harmonizing us and national defense policies , said schmidt .
" struck is expected to close down up to 100 bundeswehr bases over the next few years .
us bases will vanish too .
i ’ m not convinced that everything has been carefully coordinated yet .
i believe there ’ s a need to reconsider the planned scope of closures here . ” but the cash-strapped defense minister is unlikely to effect major changes .
many of germany 's military installations , struck argues , weren ’ t needed any longer 10 years ago , but the government was afforded the luxury of maintaining them anyway .
now , with a revamped defense strategy in place and all the budgetary constraints at hand , he says , that doesn ’ t make sense anymore . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us troop withdrawal raises concerns washington ’ s biggest military reorganization in 50 years has caused ripples around the world , but while the nations due to wave good-bye to us forces have issued muted regret , criticism is gaining pace in the us .

" but the decision of the us president is without alternative . " karsten voigt , berlin 's coordinator for german-american relations , said germany would remain the largest base for us troops in europe and security in europe was not at risk .

we regret it ; the american soldiers were welcome here .
but it is a sign of success at the same time - the success of having overcome the cold war and european division , " voigt told reporters . the us plans to move about half of its foreign-based troops , with many heading back to the states and others from european bases penciled in for deployment in the former soviet baltic republics .
this news has raised concerns in russia , which has called for a detailed explanation of the military re-organization .
russia suspicious of us intentions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. forces could be on russia 's doorstep .
moscow is concerned that as the nato alliance expands , the united states will station troops along its borders .
further , it continues to worry about the future presence of western troops in energy-rich centra asian , which russia once dominated .
the russian foreign ministry said in a statement that , “ our view of these plans will depend on the spelled-out details , and whether they pose a danger to russia ’ s national interests . ”
moscow ’ s statement stressed that it expected washington to adhere to previous agreements that , in moscow ’ s view , ban the united states from stationing its troops in the baltics or the caucasus . democrats seize on bush 's plan but while the germans were putting on a brave face and the russians remained edgy , opposition to the withdrawal in the united states was more vociferous .
unsurprisingly , the majority of criticism came from supporters of democratic presidential candidate john kerry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke " this is another example of the -lrb- bush -rrb- administration 's unilateralism .
it 's going to weaken our national security , " said richard holbrooke , a kerry foreign policy adviser and former ambassador to the un and germany under former president clinton , in a widely reported statement .
" it is not going to save us money .
it will cost billions of dollars to bring these troops home . " holbrooke also focused on the economic demands which the troop redeployment would shift from the host countries back to the united states .
" germany , south korea and japan , which will see the biggest cuts , all spend billions of dollars to support the troops .
and i am very concerned about this . " holbrooke also rejected president george w. bush 's assertion that bringing the troops home would make it easier to rapidly deploy them to global trouble spots .
he called bases in germany , south korea and okinawa " essential " along with other forward deployments . " even in the modern world , airplanes take time to get places , " holbrooke said .
" this is a weakening of our traditional ties to our closest allies just when we need them most . " ex-general clark warns of timing in terror war another kerry-supporter , retired army general wesley clark , warned of a military mistake in the making .
" as we face a global war on terror with al qaeda active in more than 60 countries , now is not the time to pull back our forces . " clark , who commanded nato and us forces in europe from 1997 to 2000 , added in his statement : " this ill-conceived move and its timing seem politically motivated rather than designed to strengthen our national security . " kerry to publicly address restructuring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential hopeful john kerry is expected to criticize the us troop plans .
kerry himself is expected to voice his own opposition to the bush administration 's plans when he gives a speech to the veterans of foreign wars in cincinnati on wednesday .
it will be a chance for the presidential candidate make clear one of the distinct strategic differences between himself and george w. bush .
kerry is preparing to argue that the withdrawal of troops from europe and asia threatens to undercut alliances and weakens america 's ability to project its power overseas , according to michael meehan , a senior adviser in the democratic party , quoted in the financial times .
meehan told the ft that kerry will make a " sweeping critique " of the realignment at the convention in cincinnati , the same venue where the president this week announced the planned withdrawal of a third of us forces from their foreign bases . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us troop pullout to hit local german economies the impact of us plans to pull some 70,000 troops out of europe and asia is likely to be felt most acutely in germany - especially in smaller towns whose economies depend on the us presence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.08.2004 moma berlin exhibition slammed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some art fans are unhappy with the show unhappy with the long entrance lines , art fans are directing criticism at the organizers of berlin 's moma exhibition .
now , a notable art critic is accusing the new york curators of cultural colonialism . judging by the huge number of visitors - more than 800,000 at last count - some of whom have lined up for more than eight hours to gain entry into the special exhibition of the new york-based museum of modern art 's -lrb- moma -rrb- show at berlin 's national gallery , it has been a huge success . many even credit the mania surrounding the display of more than 200 paintings and sculptures from moma 's famous collection with helping to spur tourism to germany 's capital to a post-world war ii high , and there is no indication that the steady flow of visitors will slack off before it closes on sept .
19 . however , increasing numbers of art fans who have had to wait - sometimes in the hot summer sun - are less inclined to view the exhibition as a triumph , and some have even accused the organizers of deliberately keeping the lines long in order to stir up publicity .
the fact that those willing to pay € 27 -lrb- $ 33 -rrb- can avoid the long lines entirely does stink a bit of cultural elitism . now werner spies , a noted art historian , one time friend of pablo picasso and max ernst , and former director of the national museum of modern art at the georges pompidou center in paris , has joined the critics . but the nature of his criticism is different .
in an article in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday , spies accused the new york-based curators - who decided on the exhibition 's content with no input from their berlin hosts - of cultural colonialism . american art the culmination of modern development ? the crux of spies ' criticism centers around the portion of the exhibit looking at modern art in the second half of the last century , which , compared to the first half , includes almost no selections from european masters .
in short , spies accuses the new york-based curators of falsely claiming that the " new american painting , " which emerged in the postwar years , is the culmination of the 20th century 's modern art movement . for spies , the failure to include the works of matisse , max ernst , dubuffet and giacometti , is inexcusable and not merely an oversight but suggests that moma curators have an agenda to determine the so-called canon of contemporary art to the americans ' advantage . " the americans who chose the selections are engaging in cultural politics , " he wrote .
" for them , the vatican of 20th century aesthetic , it is about establishing the canon of modern art … and the new york museum can in berlin - in an expansionist way - present american art as the culmination of that development . " in response to spies ' criticisms , peter raue , the director of the " friends of the national gallery , " which helped to bring the exhibition to berlin , told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the exhibit clearly shows the american view , which is just fine by him .
he said he could imagine that a berlin-curated show presenting the european perspective could possibly grace the galleries of moma in the future , thereby presenting a more balanced whole . numbers grow , opening hours extended in the meantime , the number of visitors hoping to gain entry continues to grow .
at times , the line wraps more than two times around the building .
and despite the museum 's decision to extend opening hours for the final weeks , the wait remains long . one industrious berlin-based engineer sent a four-page plan to the organizers detailing how to do away with the lines , which among other things , suggested the distribution of waiting numbers .
in response , according to newspaper reports , he was told that the lines were " necessary to create publicity . " according to a security official quoted in german papers , an ambulance has been called to the museum at least once a day to cart away would-be museum goers for whom the stress of contributing to the shows " publicity " has proven too much . some among them may be inclined to add their voices to the growing number of critics , though they are far more likely to bemoan practical considerations as opposed to the high-minded nature of the modern art canon .
others , however , will continue to view the chance to see this " once in a lifetime " exhibition as well worth the wait . editor 's note : while dw-tv is one of four media partners of moma in berlin , deutsche welle played no part in organizing or curating the exhibition . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de record year for berlin tourism expected the number of visitors to berlin may reach a postwar high in 2004 , berlin 's tourism organization revealed monday .

now , a notable art critic is accusing the new york curators of cultural colonialism . judging by the huge number of visitors - more than 800,000 at last count - some of whom have lined up for more than eight hours to gain entry into the special exhibition of the new york-based museum of modern art 's -lrb- moma -rrb- show at berlin 's national gallery , it has been a huge success . many even credit the mania surrounding the display of more than 200 paintings and sculptures from moma 's famous collection with helping to spur tourism to germany 's capital to a post-world war ii high , and there is no indication that the steady flow of visitors will slack off before it closes on sept .
19 . however , increasing numbers of art fans who have had to wait - sometimes in the hot summer sun - are less inclined to view the exhibition as a triumph , and some have even accused the organizers of deliberately keeping the lines long in order to stir up publicity .
the fact that those willing to pay € 27 -lrb- $ 33 -rrb- can avoid the long lines entirely does stink a bit of cultural elitism . now werner spies , a noted art historian , one time friend of pablo picasso and max ernst , and former director of the national museum of modern art at the georges pompidou center in paris , has joined the critics . but the nature of his criticism is different .
in an article in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday , spies accused the new york-based curators - who decided on the exhibition 's content with no input from their berlin hosts - of cultural colonialism . american art the culmination of modern development ? the crux of spies ' criticism centers around the portion of the exhibit looking at modern art in the second half of the last century , which , compared to the first half , includes almost no selections from european masters .
in short , spies accuses the new york-based curators of falsely claiming that the " new american painting , " which emerged in the postwar years , is the culmination of the 20th century 's modern art movement . for spies , the failure to include the works of matisse , max ernst , dubuffet and giacometti , is inexcusable and not merely an oversight but suggests that moma curators have an agenda to determine the so-called canon of contemporary art to the americans ' advantage . " the americans who chose the selections are engaging in cultural politics , " he wrote .
" for them , the vatican of 20th century aesthetic , it is about establishing the canon of modern art … and the new york museum can in berlin - in an expansionist way - present american art as the culmination of that development . " in response to spies ' criticisms , peter raue , the director of the " friends of the national gallery , " which helped to bring the exhibition to berlin , told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the exhibit clearly shows the american view , which is just fine by him .
he said he could imagine that a berlin-curated show presenting the european perspective could possibly grace the galleries of moma in the future , thereby presenting a more balanced whole . numbers grow , opening hours extended in the meantime , the number of visitors hoping to gain entry continues to grow .
at times , the line wraps more than two times around the building .
and despite the museum 's decision to extend opening hours for the final weeks , the wait remains long . one industrious berlin-based engineer sent a four-page plan to the organizers detailing how to do away with the lines , which among other things , suggested the distribution of waiting numbers .
in response , according to newspaper reports , he was told that the lines were " necessary to create publicity . " according to a security official quoted in german papers , an ambulance has been called to the museum at least once a day to cart away would-be museum goers for whom the stress of contributing to the shows " publicity " has proven too much . some among them may be inclined to add their voices to the growing number of critics , though they are far more likely to bemoan practical considerations as opposed to the high-minded nature of the modern art canon .
others , however , will continue to view the chance to see this " once in a lifetime " exhibition as well worth the wait . editor 's note : while dw-tv is one of four media partners of moma in berlin , deutsche welle played no part in organizing or curating the exhibition . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de record year for berlin tourism expected the number of visitors to berlin may reach a postwar high in 2004 , berlin 's tourism organization revealed monday .

the politicians , however , have been doing their best to hide their displeasure . germany regrets decision but understands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary donald rumsfeld with german defense minister peter struck german defense minister peter struck said in a statement that he regretted the withdrawal , but washington had no choice .
" that 's a big loss to a lot of regions , " he said .
" but the decision of the us president is without alternative . " karsten voigt , berlin 's coordinator for german-american relations , said germany would remain the largest base for us troops in europe and security in europe was not at risk . " but , nevertheless , the withdrawal of troops is a loss , of course .
we regret it ; the american soldiers were welcome here .
but it is a sign of success at the same time - the success of having overcome the cold war and european division , " voigt told reporters . the us plans to move about half of its foreign-based troops , with many heading back to the states and others from european bases penciled in for deployment in the former soviet baltic republics .
this news has raised concerns in russia , which has called for a detailed explanation of the military re-organization .
russia suspicious of us intentions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. forces could be on russia 's doorstep .
moscow is concerned that as the nato alliance expands , the united states will station troops along its borders .
further , it continues to worry about the future presence of western troops in energy-rich centra asian , which russia once dominated .
the russian foreign ministry said in a statement that , “ our view of these plans will depend on the spelled-out details , and whether they pose a danger to russia ’ s national interests . ”
moscow ’ s statement stressed that it expected washington to adhere to previous agreements that , in moscow ’ s view , ban the united states from stationing its troops in the baltics or the caucasus . democrats seize on bush 's plan but while the germans were putting on a brave face and the russians remained edgy , opposition to the withdrawal in the united states was more vociferous .
unsurprisingly , the majority of criticism came from supporters of democratic presidential candidate john kerry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke " this is another example of the -lrb- bush -rrb- administration 's unilateralism .
it 's going to weaken our national security , " said richard holbrooke , a kerry foreign policy adviser and former ambassador to the un and germany under former president clinton , in a widely reported statement .
" it is not going to save us money .
it will cost billions of dollars to bring these troops home . " holbrooke also focused on the economic demands which the troop redeployment would shift from the host countries back to the united states .
" germany , south korea and japan , which will see the biggest cuts , all spend billions of dollars to support the troops .
and i am very concerned about this . " holbrooke also rejected president george w. bush 's assertion that bringing the troops home would make it easier to rapidly deploy them to global trouble spots .
he called bases in germany , south korea and okinawa " essential " along with other forward deployments . " even in the modern world , airplanes take time to get places , " holbrooke said .
" this is a weakening of our traditional ties to our closest allies just when we need them most . " ex-general clark warns of timing in terror war another kerry-supporter , retired army general wesley clark , warned of a military mistake in the making .
" as we face a global war on terror with al qaeda active in more than 60 countries , now is not the time to pull back our forces . " clark , who commanded nato and us forces in europe from 1997 to 2000 , added in his statement : " this ill-conceived move and its timing seem politically motivated rather than designed to strengthen our national security . " kerry to publicly address restructuring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential hopeful john kerry is expected to criticize the us troop plans .
kerry himself is expected to voice his own opposition to the bush administration 's plans when he gives a speech to the veterans of foreign wars in cincinnati on wednesday .
it will be a chance for the presidential candidate make clear one of the distinct strategic differences between himself and george w. bush .
kerry is preparing to argue that the withdrawal of troops from europe and asia threatens to undercut alliances and weakens america 's ability to project its power overseas , according to michael meehan , a senior adviser in the democratic party , quoted in the financial times .
meehan told the ft that kerry will make a " sweeping critique " of the realignment at the convention in cincinnati , the same venue where the president this week announced the planned withdrawal of a third of us forces from their foreign bases . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us troop pullout to hit local german economies the impact of us plans to pull some 70,000 troops out of europe and asia is likely to be felt most acutely in germany - especially in smaller towns whose economies depend on the us presence .

only two pds members now serve as parliamentarians because they were directly elected by their voting precinct . experts said the gains were to be expected as more and more people are unhappy with the government 's reforms . " during times of economic and social uncertainty , voters turn away from large parties , " everhard holtmann , a political scientist at martin luther university in halle-wittenberg , told focus money magazine . holtmann added that the greens , now a junior partner in germany 's governing coalition , experienced similar gains when they promoted environmental issues that had been widely neglected by other parties during the 1980s . pds could lead government in brandenburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and brandenburg premier matthias platezck -lrb- both spd -rrb- hope to regain voters ' support by the sept .

19 . latest surveys show the pds overtaking the spd to become the strongest political force in the state , which is currently governed by a spd-led coalition with the cdu .
so far , the pds is a junior coalition partner in the northeastern german state of mecklenburg-western pommerania as well as the city state of berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters during a demonstration in 2003 the extreme right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which the government has unsuccessfully tried to ban because of its neo-nazi platform , is also getting increasing support from voters . in the eastern german state of saxony , where elections will also take place sept .
19 , the npd could get 5 percent or more of the vote , according to surveys .
the npd also supports the reform protests . but holtmann said he did n't expect a major political upset . " protest voters do n't change their basic convictions , " he said .
" they mainly want to teach politicians a lesson . " chancellor : no further changes to reforms the chancellor , meanwhile , said wednesday that he did not support further changes to recently approved welfare reforms , which have led to demonstrations in mainly eastern german cities during the last weeks . responding to the protests , the government has made some minor changes to the reforms . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder fights off ex-communists in state election at a party conference in havel , chancellor gerhard schröder kicks off the campaign in the state of brandenburg , where unpopular reforms have pushed the former communists in the pds party to the top of polls .

opposition voices have questioned his wisdom . german defense minister peter struck on tuesday set out for a summer tour of military bases to see how the current restructuring of the national armed forces is progressing .
in line with eu and nato defense policies , the bundeswehr is reshaping its troops to be better prepared for peacekeeping or peace-enforcing missions abroad . however , struck is facing a hard time explaining his decision to close numerous bundeswehr bases across the country , which will coincide with the large-scale withdrawal of us forces from western germany : struck had gained wide respect for starting to overhaul the national armed forces and handling out-of-area peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and the balkans .
while he has given up pipe smoking after the stroke he suffered in june , he has not reduced his ambitions to push through the biggest restructuring of the bundeswehr to date . troops to be cut down to 250,000 the emphasis will be on training mobile units to be employed quickly in crisis areas outside nato territory .
in the next couple of years , troop strength will be reduced by 30,000 to 250,000 - a measure long overdue after the end of the cold war .
the number of military bases will also be cut drastically .
details on the closures will be announced in november . opposition conservative defense spokesman christian schmidt warned about rushing into defense decisions now that it has been announced that the united states will be withdrawing a large contingent of their 70,000 troops now stationed in germany .
schmidt called on the defense minister on tuesday to ensure that the communities affected will receive some sort of compensation for the looming economic losses . " i myself come from a region which will be largely affected by the withdrawal of us troops with the bases in bamberg and würzburg soon to be deserted , " schmidt told dw-radio . looming economic and social problems " we ’ ve always come out in favor of providing financial help for restructuring programs after such a pull-out of troops .
but at present , there are no such means available , neither at federal , nor at community level .
we ’ ll see massive social and economic problems in the affected regions .
i ’ m optimistic that policy-makers will not leave these communities to their own devices and raise restructuring funds , probably also out of european union coffers . " schmidt , as well as bavaria ’ s christian social union leader edmund stoiber , is hoping that the defense minister will readjust his original plan to close down german military bases to the realities created by the us troop pull-out .
both theorized that a number of abandoned us bases may in the future be used by the bundeswehr instead . future planning is questioned “ i can only suggest thinking harder about harmonizing us and national defense policies , said schmidt .

us bases will vanish too .
i ’ m not convinced that everything has been carefully coordinated yet .
i believe there ’ s a need to reconsider the planned scope of closures here . ” but the cash-strapped defense minister is unlikely to effect major changes .

opposition voices have questioned his wisdom . german defense minister peter struck on tuesday set out for a summer tour of military bases to see how the current restructuring of the national armed forces is progressing .
in line with eu and nato defense policies , the bundeswehr is reshaping its troops to be better prepared for peacekeeping or peace-enforcing missions abroad . however , struck is facing a hard time explaining his decision to close numerous bundeswehr bases across the country , which will coincide with the large-scale withdrawal of us forces from western germany : struck had gained wide respect for starting to overhaul the national armed forces and handling out-of-area peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and the balkans .
while he has given up pipe smoking after the stroke he suffered in june , he has not reduced his ambitions to push through the biggest restructuring of the bundeswehr to date . troops to be cut down to 250,000 the emphasis will be on training mobile units to be employed quickly in crisis areas outside nato territory .
in the next couple of years , troop strength will be reduced by 30,000 to 250,000 - a measure long overdue after the end of the cold war .
the number of military bases will also be cut drastically .
details on the closures will be announced in november . opposition conservative defense spokesman christian schmidt warned about rushing into defense decisions now that it has been announced that the united states will be withdrawing a large contingent of their 70,000 troops now stationed in germany .
schmidt called on the defense minister on tuesday to ensure that the communities affected will receive some sort of compensation for the looming economic losses . " i myself come from a region which will be largely affected by the withdrawal of us troops with the bases in bamberg and würzburg soon to be deserted , " schmidt told dw-radio . looming economic and social problems " we ’ ve always come out in favor of providing financial help for restructuring programs after such a pull-out of troops .
but at present , there are no such means available , neither at federal , nor at community level .
we ’ ll see massive social and economic problems in the affected regions .
i ’ m optimistic that policy-makers will not leave these communities to their own devices and raise restructuring funds , probably also out of european union coffers . " schmidt , as well as bavaria ’ s christian social union leader edmund stoiber , is hoping that the defense minister will readjust his original plan to close down german military bases to the realities created by the us troop pull-out .
both theorized that a number of abandoned us bases may in the future be used by the bundeswehr instead . future planning is questioned “ i can only suggest thinking harder about harmonizing us and national defense policies , said schmidt .
" struck is expected to close down up to 100 bundeswehr bases over the next few years .
us bases will vanish too .
i ’ m not convinced that everything has been carefully coordinated yet .
i believe there ’ s a need to reconsider the planned scope of closures here . ” but the cash-strapped defense minister is unlikely to effect major changes .

now eu reality has hit them - a disappointment for many . " some things were meant to become cheaper - german beer , for example , but it still costs as much as before , " one woman told german public broadcaster wdr .
" phoning people and using the internet was supposed to become cheaper , because there 's more competition .
but nothing 's happening , which is something that i 'm personally sad about , because i 've been waiting for things to change . " another woman agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : market square in warsaw " i 'm only hearing about the positive things in radio and tv and reading about it in the newspapers - that our exports are up and that it 's going to get better and better for us , " she said .
" but i 'm not seeing that happening . " she added that meat was a third more expensive now and prices for medicines had also increased .
pensions on the other hand had stayed the same , she said . beef and poultry prices have indeed increased by about 18 percent , according to a report by the national bank of poland .
on the other hand , few things have become cheaper : electronics , wine and beer have just gone down 0.5 percent in price . farming business is booming polish farmers on the other hand are more upbeat .
a few months ago , they were still considered the problem children of poland 's eu accession .
badly organized and working on small farms , officials worried that farmers would not be able to compete internationally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a farmer offering vegetables in warsaw but business is booming : asparagus , fruit , potatoes , wheat and mushrooms from poland have become bestsellers in the eu .
farmers also have overcome their initial hesitation to apply for financial help from brussels . " if 1.3 million farmers are able to apply for funds , that 's something that we can be proud of , " polish agriculture minister wojciech olejniczak told wdr .
" and we 'll convince those that are still hesitating - maybe not tomorrow , but definitely by the end of the year . " fishermen struggle to adjust the country 's fishermen , however , say they are suffering rather than benefiting from eu accession : they now have to deal with fishing limits imposed by the union and eu incentives not to fish at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists protested against the eu fishing policies in berlin as fishermen throw millions of fish back into the sea because they are too small " the only thing i can do is trample on the catch and throw it back into the sea , " one fisherman told wdr .
" but everyone wants to work .
i ca n't imaging giving up so quickly .
it 's horror for me .
i 'll be spending the -lrb- incentive -rrb- money and at some point there wo n't be any more .
and what happens then ? " it 's a problem polish used car sellers do n't face at the moment .

even as health experts warn that german youngsters are getting fatter , obesity levels continue to climb among the country 's migrant children population .
television and fast food are n't the only culprits . on a sunny august day , ten-year-old murat -lrb- name changed -rrb- lies on his back on a grassy lawn at a public outdoor swimming pool in berlin 's wedding district , home to a large immigrant population . licking a chocolate ice cream , murat , who is of turkish origin , might sound like a normal youngster , but he does n't look like one .
clad in an " l " size pair of swimming trunks , the porky fourth-grader tips the scales at nearly 44 kilos -lrb- 97 lbs . -rrb- . " the school authorities said he needs to exercise and lose weight .
that 's why i take him for a swim here , " his mother ayse -lrb- name changed -rrb- told dw-world .
the ice cream , she said , is a reward for him doing two laps in the pool .
" besides , it 's so hot , " she added . murat , who said his favorite food is nutella -lrb- a chocolate spread -rrb- , is not alone .
in past years , a rise in weight levels among children from germany 's immigrant families , a largely ignored group in obesity research until recently , has fuelled concern among health authorities . " sitting on a powder keg " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister renate künast is spearheading the drive for healthy nutrition to bring down obesity levels .
the german minister for consumer protection and agriculture , renate künast , estimated this year that every fifth child and every third teenager in germany is overweight .
the number of obese children signing up for school has risen three-fold compared to a decade ago .
" the country is sitting on a powder keg , " künast warned . though there are no country-wide studies on the prevalence of obesity among migrant children , statistics on the problem in cities with high foreign populations leave little room for doubt . in frankfurt , home to around 180,000 immigrants from 180 nations , research on the number of those children who joined school this year found that 12.5 percent were overweight . experts say that a six-year-old who has a body mass index of 15.4 is considered of normal weight .
the frankfurt statistics showed that moroccan and turkish children , in particular , had a body mass index of more than 18 percent , at 18.4 and 22 percent respectively .
among ten-year-olds , turkish children weighed the most at 34 percent , compared to 19 percent for german youngsters . eating to the point of disorder " it 's alarming , " holger meireis , head of frankfurt 's child and youth department told dw-world .
" if you interpret immigration in a broad sense , beyond borders of nationality , then almost 50 percent of frankfurt 's foreign population is overweight .
it ca n't be ignored any longer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neukölln is home to a large muslim population .
dr rainer moehl , a physician in neukölln , an immigrant-dominated berlin neighborhood , agreed that obesity was a widespread problem among his patients .
" by the time children in turkish and arab families reach school-going age , there 's usually a clear gender-specific difference : it 's mostly boys who develop obesity during puberty , while girls have eating disorders like bulimia , " moehl said . he warned that overweight children are likely to develop problems such as mobility and spinal and metabolic disorders , high blood pressure , diabetes and depression . filling the stomach cheaply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that low income and education levels can have disastrous consequences for obese people .
while experts point to the usual suspects - too much television , too little activity , fast food and sweets - they agree that the spread of obesity among migrant children is largely tied to their financial and social situation . jeffrey butler from the health department in berlin 's wedding district , which holds the dubious record of being home to berlin 's pudgiest kids -lrb- 20.7 percent body mass index -rrb- , points to the fact that the neighborhood is also one of the capital 's poorest . with an unemployment rate of around 24 percent , low education levels and around 26 percent of children and teenagers living on welfare , wedding has acquired notoriety as a social flashpoint . " most of the families here do n't have the means to buy healthy food , even if they wanted to , " butler said .

even as health experts warn that german youngsters are getting fatter , obesity levels continue to climb among the country 's migrant children population .
television and fast food are n't the only culprits . on a sunny august day , ten-year-old murat -lrb- name changed -rrb- lies on his back on a grassy lawn at a public outdoor swimming pool in berlin 's wedding district , home to a large immigrant population . licking a chocolate ice cream , murat , who is of turkish origin , might sound like a normal youngster , but he does n't look like one .
clad in an " l " size pair of swimming trunks , the porky fourth-grader tips the scales at nearly 44 kilos -lrb- 97 lbs . -rrb- . " the school authorities said he needs to exercise and lose weight .
that 's why i take him for a swim here , " his mother ayse -lrb- name changed -rrb- told dw-world .
the ice cream , she said , is a reward for him doing two laps in the pool .
" besides , it 's so hot , " she added . murat , who said his favorite food is nutella -lrb- a chocolate spread -rrb- , is not alone .
in past years , a rise in weight levels among children from germany 's immigrant families , a largely ignored group in obesity research until recently , has fuelled concern among health authorities . " sitting on a powder keg " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister renate künast is spearheading the drive for healthy nutrition to bring down obesity levels .
the german minister for consumer protection and agriculture , renate künast , estimated this year that every fifth child and every third teenager in germany is overweight .
the number of obese children signing up for school has risen three-fold compared to a decade ago .
" the country is sitting on a powder keg , " künast warned . though there are no country-wide studies on the prevalence of obesity among migrant children , statistics on the problem in cities with high foreign populations leave little room for doubt . in frankfurt , home to around 180,000 immigrants from 180 nations , research on the number of those children who joined school this year found that 12.5 percent were overweight . experts say that a six-year-old who has a body mass index of 15.4 is considered of normal weight .
the frankfurt statistics showed that moroccan and turkish children , in particular , had a body mass index of more than 18 percent , at 18.4 and 22 percent respectively .
among ten-year-olds , turkish children weighed the most at 34 percent , compared to 19 percent for german youngsters . eating to the point of disorder " it 's alarming , " holger meireis , head of frankfurt 's child and youth department told dw-world .
" if you interpret immigration in a broad sense , beyond borders of nationality , then almost 50 percent of frankfurt 's foreign population is overweight .
it ca n't be ignored any longer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neukölln is home to a large muslim population .
dr rainer moehl , a physician in neukölln , an immigrant-dominated berlin neighborhood , agreed that obesity was a widespread problem among his patients .
" by the time children in turkish and arab families reach school-going age , there 's usually a clear gender-specific difference : it 's mostly boys who develop obesity during puberty , while girls have eating disorders like bulimia , " moehl said . he warned that overweight children are likely to develop problems such as mobility and spinal and metabolic disorders , high blood pressure , diabetes and depression . filling the stomach cheaply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that low income and education levels can have disastrous consequences for obese people .
while experts point to the usual suspects - too much television , too little activity , fast food and sweets - they agree that the spread of obesity among migrant children is largely tied to their financial and social situation . jeffrey butler from the health department in berlin 's wedding district , which holds the dubious record of being home to berlin 's pudgiest kids -lrb- 20.7 percent body mass index -rrb- , points to the fact that the neighborhood is also one of the capital 's poorest . with an unemployment rate of around 24 percent , low education levels and around 26 percent of children and teenagers living on welfare , wedding has acquired notoriety as a social flashpoint . " most of the families here do n't have the means to buy healthy food , even if they wanted to , " butler said .
" it 's just easier to shop for packaged and fast food that fills you up . " calories and stress others caution that the problem has much more complex cultural reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations in a döner shop in berlin .

new regulations will allow enlisted couples to bond in the balkans , get cosy in the hindu kush and horny around the horn of africa . german military officials have agreed to scrap a regulation preventing soldiers from having sex on military bases , allowing their troops to make love while preparing for war .
the decision comes after a review of existing guidelines which have now been deemed no longer compatible with societal norms . considering the 50 year , officially abstinent history of the bundeswehr , this can be seen as something of a sexual revolution .

even as health experts warn that german youngsters are getting fatter , obesity levels continue to climb among the country 's migrant children population .
television and fast food are n't the only culprits . on a sunny august day , ten-year-old murat -lrb- name changed -rrb- lies on his back on a grassy lawn at a public outdoor swimming pool in berlin 's wedding district , home to a large immigrant population . licking a chocolate ice cream , murat , who is of turkish origin , might sound like a normal youngster , but he does n't look like one .
clad in an " l " size pair of swimming trunks , the porky fourth-grader tips the scales at nearly 44 kilos -lrb- 97 lbs . -rrb- . " the school authorities said he needs to exercise and lose weight .
that 's why i take him for a swim here , " his mother ayse -lrb- name changed -rrb- told dw-world .
the ice cream , she said , is a reward for him doing two laps in the pool .
" besides , it 's so hot , " she added . murat , who said his favorite food is nutella -lrb- a chocolate spread -rrb- , is not alone .
in past years , a rise in weight levels among children from germany 's immigrant families , a largely ignored group in obesity research until recently , has fuelled concern among health authorities . " sitting on a powder keg " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister renate künast is spearheading the drive for healthy nutrition to bring down obesity levels .
the german minister for consumer protection and agriculture , renate künast , estimated this year that every fifth child and every third teenager in germany is overweight .
the number of obese children signing up for school has risen three-fold compared to a decade ago .
" the country is sitting on a powder keg , " künast warned . though there are no country-wide studies on the prevalence of obesity among migrant children , statistics on the problem in cities with high foreign populations leave little room for doubt . in frankfurt , home to around 180,000 immigrants from 180 nations , research on the number of those children who joined school this year found that 12.5 percent were overweight . experts say that a six-year-old who has a body mass index of 15.4 is considered of normal weight .
the frankfurt statistics showed that moroccan and turkish children , in particular , had a body mass index of more than 18 percent , at 18.4 and 22 percent respectively .
among ten-year-olds , turkish children weighed the most at 34 percent , compared to 19 percent for german youngsters . eating to the point of disorder " it 's alarming , " holger meireis , head of frankfurt 's child and youth department told dw-world .
" if you interpret immigration in a broad sense , beyond borders of nationality , then almost 50 percent of frankfurt 's foreign population is overweight .
it ca n't be ignored any longer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neukölln is home to a large muslim population .
dr rainer moehl , a physician in neukölln , an immigrant-dominated berlin neighborhood , agreed that obesity was a widespread problem among his patients .
" by the time children in turkish and arab families reach school-going age , there 's usually a clear gender-specific difference : it 's mostly boys who develop obesity during puberty , while girls have eating disorders like bulimia , " moehl said . he warned that overweight children are likely to develop problems such as mobility and spinal and metabolic disorders , high blood pressure , diabetes and depression . filling the stomach cheaply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that low income and education levels can have disastrous consequences for obese people .
while experts point to the usual suspects - too much television , too little activity , fast food and sweets - they agree that the spread of obesity among migrant children is largely tied to their financial and social situation . jeffrey butler from the health department in berlin 's wedding district , which holds the dubious record of being home to berlin 's pudgiest kids -lrb- 20.7 percent body mass index -rrb- , points to the fact that the neighborhood is also one of the capital 's poorest . with an unemployment rate of around 24 percent , low education levels and around 26 percent of children and teenagers living on welfare , wedding has acquired notoriety as a social flashpoint . " most of the families here do n't have the means to buy healthy food , even if they wanted to , " butler said .
" it 's just easier to shop for packaged and fast food that fills you up . " calories and stress others caution that the problem has much more complex cultural reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations in a döner shop in berlin .
meat is a staple among turks .
" the common family meal is the focal point in a turkish home , and traditional turkish cuisine is actually healthy , " jutta kolletzki , a therapist who runs a counseling and treatment center for weight-loss and eating disorders in frankfurt , said .
" but meals are cooked with so much sugar and fat that it turns into a real calorie bomb , " she said . kolletzki added that many immigrants often are n't well-informed about what constitutes healthy nutrition .
differing perspectives of health also contribute to the problem , she said .
" in traditional families , a tubby child is usually considered well-fed and a sign of prosperity rather than as a problem , " kolletzki explained . she also warned that children straddling two cultures are often under a lot of emotional stress .
" separations or moving from one country to another is difficult for a child , " she said .
" eating more is a way of coping with it . " battle of the bulge bildunterschrift : children take part in a weight-loss program at germany 's baltic sea coast .
obesity among migrant children is now recognized as a serious problem , judging by the number of initiatives and projects springing up in several german cities to tackle it . most involve networking with kindergartens and schools to encourage them to introduce healthy breakfasts and impress upon the kids and parents the benefits of a healthy diet and exercise .
the emphasis is on prevention , taking into account cultural differences and using interpreters to reach the target groups . minister künast is kicking off a major nationwide project in september involving parents , health insurance companies and the food industry .
a spokeswoman at the ministry stressed that though this was n't a special programs for migrant children as yet , they were working on it . germany , it seems , is determined to win the battle of the bulge and avoid the rather drastic scenario predicted in a recent british survey , which suggested that the younger generation would be the first to die before their parents .

now eu reality has hit them - a disappointment for many . " some things were meant to become cheaper - german beer , for example , but it still costs as much as before , " one woman told german public broadcaster wdr .
" phoning people and using the internet was supposed to become cheaper , because there 's more competition .
but nothing 's happening , which is something that i 'm personally sad about , because i 've been waiting for things to change . " another woman agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : market square in warsaw " i 'm only hearing about the positive things in radio and tv and reading about it in the newspapers - that our exports are up and that it 's going to get better and better for us , " she said .
" but i 'm not seeing that happening . " she added that meat was a third more expensive now and prices for medicines had also increased .
pensions on the other hand had stayed the same , she said . beef and poultry prices have indeed increased by about 18 percent , according to a report by the national bank of poland .
on the other hand , few things have become cheaper : electronics , wine and beer have just gone down 0.5 percent in price . farming business is booming polish farmers on the other hand are more upbeat .
a few months ago , they were still considered the problem children of poland 's eu accession .
badly organized and working on small farms , officials worried that farmers would not be able to compete internationally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a farmer offering vegetables in warsaw but business is booming : asparagus , fruit , potatoes , wheat and mushrooms from poland have become bestsellers in the eu .
farmers also have overcome their initial hesitation to apply for financial help from brussels . " if 1.3 million farmers are able to apply for funds , that 's something that we can be proud of , " polish agriculture minister wojciech olejniczak told wdr .
" and we 'll convince those that are still hesitating - maybe not tomorrow , but definitely by the end of the year . " fishermen struggle to adjust the country 's fishermen , however , say they are suffering rather than benefiting from eu accession : they now have to deal with fishing limits imposed by the union and eu incentives not to fish at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists protested against the eu fishing policies in berlin as fishermen throw millions of fish back into the sea because they are too small " the only thing i can do is trample on the catch and throw it back into the sea , " one fisherman told wdr .
" but everyone wants to work .
i ca n't imaging giving up so quickly .
it 's horror for me .
i 'll be spending the -lrb- incentive -rrb- money and at some point there wo n't be any more .
and what happens then ? " it 's a problem polish used car sellers do n't face at the moment .

but it was no ordinary auto .
the daimlerchrysler vehicle presented to him had something special under the hood : hydrogen fuel cell technology . the gleaming new model sitting in the car park outside schröder 's office in berlin is one of the prototype models fitted with the f-cell hydrogen technology that daimlerchrysler hopes will revolutionize motoring and help in the fight to reduce carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions from cars . the chancellor will have one year to test the car out as part of the company 's on-going research into greener fuel possibilities which has seen 60 cars enter production and deployed for testing around the world . the fuel cells which power the car use a combination of hydrogen and oxygen which makes them and the vehicle itself environmentally friendly . its only emission is water , which is so pure that daimlerchrysler claim its fit for human consumption .
the electric motor creates a maximum output of 65 kilowatts and will power the car for 160 kilometers -lrb- 100 miles -rrb- at a maximum speed of 140 kilometers per hour -lrb- kph -rrb- . here comes the science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fuel cell car 's motor the hydrogen fuel cell operates similar to a battery .
it has two electrodes , an anode and a cathode , separated by a membrane .
oxygen passes over one electrode and hydrogen over the other . the hydrogen reacts to a catalyst on the electrode anode that converts the hydrogen gas into negatively charged electrons and positively charged ions .
the electrons flow out of the cell to be used as electrical energy . the hydrogen ions move through the electrolyte membrane to the cathode electrode where they combine with oxygen and the electrons to produce water .
unlike batteries , fuel cells never run out . f-cell technology leading the way schröder received the car from daimlerchrysler board member jürgen hubbert and praised the efforts of the company to develop more environmentally friendly vehicles , especially at a time of increased oil prices and concerns over the effects of co2 emissions in relation to climate change . " this shows that we are on the right track , " the chancellor said , running an impressed eye over his new loan car . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler is also testing the technology on buses experts from daimlerchrysler estimate that the first commercial fuel-cell car should be ready by 2010 .
the auto manufacturer hopes it will cost around the same as regular cars . daimlerchrysler has spent over € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- in the development process and already enjoys more success than initially hoped for this stage by producing vehicles fit for use . the german car giant first grabbed the headlines with its hydrogen fuel program with its necar 4 model in 1999 .
the necar 4 , based on a mercedes-benz a-class compact car , was a liquid hydrogen vehicle with a top speed of 144 kph and a 450 kilometer tank capacity . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans still think green despite pressing problems such as unemployment and a stagnant economy , the majority of germans are still concerned about environmental issues and award it a high priority according to the results of a new study .

even as health experts warn that german youngsters are getting fatter , obesity levels continue to climb among the country 's migrant children population .
television and fast food are n't the only culprits . on a sunny august day , ten-year-old murat -lrb- name changed -rrb- lies on his back on a grassy lawn at a public outdoor swimming pool in berlin 's wedding district , home to a large immigrant population . licking a chocolate ice cream , murat , who is of turkish origin , might sound like a normal youngster , but he does n't look like one .
clad in an " l " size pair of swimming trunks , the porky fourth-grader tips the scales at nearly 44 kilos -lrb- 97 lbs . -rrb- . " the school authorities said he needs to exercise and lose weight .
that 's why i take him for a swim here , " his mother ayse -lrb- name changed -rrb- told dw-world .
the ice cream , she said , is a reward for him doing two laps in the pool .
" besides , it 's so hot , " she added . murat , who said his favorite food is nutella -lrb- a chocolate spread -rrb- , is not alone .
in past years , a rise in weight levels among children from germany 's immigrant families , a largely ignored group in obesity research until recently , has fuelled concern among health authorities . " sitting on a powder keg " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister renate künast is spearheading the drive for healthy nutrition to bring down obesity levels .
the german minister for consumer protection and agriculture , renate künast , estimated this year that every fifth child and every third teenager in germany is overweight .
the number of obese children signing up for school has risen three-fold compared to a decade ago .
" the country is sitting on a powder keg , " künast warned . though there are no country-wide studies on the prevalence of obesity among migrant children , statistics on the problem in cities with high foreign populations leave little room for doubt . in frankfurt , home to around 180,000 immigrants from 180 nations , research on the number of those children who joined school this year found that 12.5 percent were overweight . experts say that a six-year-old who has a body mass index of 15.4 is considered of normal weight .
the frankfurt statistics showed that moroccan and turkish children , in particular , had a body mass index of more than 18 percent , at 18.4 and 22 percent respectively .
among ten-year-olds , turkish children weighed the most at 34 percent , compared to 19 percent for german youngsters . eating to the point of disorder " it 's alarming , " holger meireis , head of frankfurt 's child and youth department told dw-world .
" if you interpret immigration in a broad sense , beyond borders of nationality , then almost 50 percent of frankfurt 's foreign population is overweight .
it ca n't be ignored any longer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neukölln is home to a large muslim population .
dr rainer moehl , a physician in neukölln , an immigrant-dominated berlin neighborhood , agreed that obesity was a widespread problem among his patients .
" by the time children in turkish and arab families reach school-going age , there 's usually a clear gender-specific difference : it 's mostly boys who develop obesity during puberty , while girls have eating disorders like bulimia , " moehl said . he warned that overweight children are likely to develop problems such as mobility and spinal and metabolic disorders , high blood pressure , diabetes and depression . filling the stomach cheaply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that low income and education levels can have disastrous consequences for obese people .
while experts point to the usual suspects - too much television , too little activity , fast food and sweets - they agree that the spread of obesity among migrant children is largely tied to their financial and social situation . jeffrey butler from the health department in berlin 's wedding district , which holds the dubious record of being home to berlin 's pudgiest kids -lrb- 20.7 percent body mass index -rrb- , points to the fact that the neighborhood is also one of the capital 's poorest . with an unemployment rate of around 24 percent , low education levels and around 26 percent of children and teenagers living on welfare , wedding has acquired notoriety as a social flashpoint . " most of the families here do n't have the means to buy healthy food , even if they wanted to , " butler said .
" it 's just easier to shop for packaged and fast food that fills you up . " calories and stress others caution that the problem has much more complex cultural reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations in a döner shop in berlin .
meat is a staple among turks .
" the common family meal is the focal point in a turkish home , and traditional turkish cuisine is actually healthy , " jutta kolletzki , a therapist who runs a counseling and treatment center for weight-loss and eating disorders in frankfurt , said .
" but meals are cooked with so much sugar and fat that it turns into a real calorie bomb , " she said . kolletzki added that many immigrants often are n't well-informed about what constitutes healthy nutrition .
differing perspectives of health also contribute to the problem , she said .
" in traditional families , a tubby child is usually considered well-fed and a sign of prosperity rather than as a problem , " kolletzki explained . she also warned that children straddling two cultures are often under a lot of emotional stress .
" separations or moving from one country to another is difficult for a child , " she said .
" eating more is a way of coping with it . " battle of the bulge bildunterschrift : children take part in a weight-loss program at germany 's baltic sea coast .
obesity among migrant children is now recognized as a serious problem , judging by the number of initiatives and projects springing up in several german cities to tackle it . most involve networking with kindergartens and schools to encourage them to introduce healthy breakfasts and impress upon the kids and parents the benefits of a healthy diet and exercise .
the emphasis is on prevention , taking into account cultural differences and using interpreters to reach the target groups . minister künast is kicking off a major nationwide project in september involving parents , health insurance companies and the food industry .
a spokeswoman at the ministry stressed that though this was n't a special programs for migrant children as yet , they were working on it . germany , it seems , is determined to win the battle of the bulge and avoid the rather drastic scenario predicted in a recent british survey , which suggested that the younger generation would be the first to die before their parents .
" it should n't go as far as that , " said künast . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mcdonald 's goes slim-line for europe responding to growing concern about obesity in europe , the u.s. fast food chain mcdonald 's prepares to launch a new , healthier menu in 16 european countries , offering customers fewer burgers , and more salads .

germany is the world ’ s leading producer of wind power .
but as land sites for wind parks become increasingly scarce , the future of the country ’ s wind industry lies on the open sea . in the northern german region of schleswig-holstein , you can ’ t miss them : the wind turbines sprinkled along the landscape are as prominent as the cattle grazing on the grass . but can these giant modern windmills be placed in the middle of the ocean ?
the residents of north frisia are willing to try .
for them , as well as many others living in the schleswig-holstein area , much of their livelihood depends on the presence of the wind turbines generating energy from the constant breeze coming off the north sea .
klaus rave , vice-president of the european wind energy association , says the region ’ s communities had a vision 15 years ago that they could produce 25 percent of their electricity through wind energy by 2010 .
and they succeeded .
“ we promoted discussions and expert reports , and we had the courage to openly say we were considering this , ” rave says .

“ wind parks have been very successful in north frisia , so that creates an acceptance for the economic aspects of the offshore park , ” says hans feddersen , sales manager for project butendiek .
he says 8,500 north frisians have decided to finance the project - and not just for environmental reasons .
“ of course , there are also opponents , but the project sounds a lot better when you tie the whirring of the wind with your wallet , ” feddersen says .
the people in the region would rather grab this opportunity for investment rather than not be actively involved .
opposition remains there is , however , much controversy surrounding the building of offshore wind parks .
for one , many potential investors still see the project as a financial risk .
also , contractors have to gain permission to prohibit shipping in the wind park area .

but as land sites for wind parks become increasingly scarce , the future of the country ’ s wind industry lies on the open sea . in the northern german region of schleswig-holstein , you can ’ t miss them : the wind turbines sprinkled along the landscape are as prominent as the cattle grazing on the grass . but can these giant modern windmills be placed in the middle of the ocean ?
the residents of north frisia are willing to try .
for them , as well as many others living in the schleswig-holstein area , much of their livelihood depends on the presence of the wind turbines generating energy from the constant breeze coming off the north sea .
klaus rave , vice-president of the european wind energy association , says the region ’ s communities had a vision 15 years ago that they could produce 25 percent of their electricity through wind energy by 2010 .
and they succeeded .
“ we promoted discussions and expert reports , and we had the courage to openly say we were considering this , ” rave says .
“ we were able to achieve our goal in 2002 and we ’ re continuing to work with this in mind and concentrating on future possibilities . ”
a people ’ s project but the space on land is limited .
so the local residents designed and financed project butendiek , an offshore wind park some 20 miles off the coast in the north sea .
it will cost a total of 400 million euro -lrb- $ 475 million -rrb- to anchor the planned eighty wind turbines to the ocean floor .
“ our experiences led us to say , if wind parks have been so successful inland , why don ’ t we build them in the sea , ” says rave .
but they didn ’ t want to leave this undertaking to a large corporation , he adds .
“ we wanted to do it ourselves , with our own capabilities and know-how . ”

the citizens of north frisia strongly advocate the use of clean energy .
but they also believe that with over 15 years of experience with wind power , they can make the offshore park work .
“ wind parks have been very successful in north frisia , so that creates an acceptance for the economic aspects of the offshore park , ” says hans feddersen , sales manager for project butendiek .
he says 8,500 north frisians have decided to finance the project - and not just for environmental reasons .
“ of course , there are also opponents , but the project sounds a lot better when you tie the whirring of the wind with your wallet , ” feddersen says .
the people in the region would rather grab this opportunity for investment rather than not be actively involved .
opposition remains there is , however , much controversy surrounding the building of offshore wind parks .
for one , many potential investors still see the project as a financial risk .

now eu reality has hit them - a disappointment for many . " some things were meant to become cheaper - german beer , for example , but it still costs as much as before , " one woman told german public broadcaster wdr .
" phoning people and using the internet was supposed to become cheaper , because there 's more competition .
but nothing 's happening , which is something that i 'm personally sad about , because i 've been waiting for things to change . " another woman agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : market square in warsaw " i 'm only hearing about the positive things in radio and tv and reading about it in the newspapers - that our exports are up and that it 's going to get better and better for us , " she said .
" but i 'm not seeing that happening . " she added that meat was a third more expensive now and prices for medicines had also increased .
pensions on the other hand had stayed the same , she said . beef and poultry prices have indeed increased by about 18 percent , according to a report by the national bank of poland .
on the other hand , few things have become cheaper : electronics , wine and beer have just gone down 0.5 percent in price . farming business is booming polish farmers on the other hand are more upbeat .
a few months ago , they were still considered the problem children of poland 's eu accession .
badly organized and working on small farms , officials worried that farmers would not be able to compete internationally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a farmer offering vegetables in warsaw but business is booming : asparagus , fruit , potatoes , wheat and mushrooms from poland have become bestsellers in the eu .
farmers also have overcome their initial hesitation to apply for financial help from brussels . " if 1.3 million farmers are able to apply for funds , that 's something that we can be proud of , " polish agriculture minister wojciech olejniczak told wdr .
" and we 'll convince those that are still hesitating - maybe not tomorrow , but definitely by the end of the year . " fishermen struggle to adjust the country 's fishermen , however , say they are suffering rather than benefiting from eu accession : they now have to deal with fishing limits imposed by the union and eu incentives not to fish at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists protested against the eu fishing policies in berlin as fishermen throw millions of fish back into the sea because they are too small " the only thing i can do is trample on the catch and throw it back into the sea , " one fisherman told wdr .
" but everyone wants to work .
i ca n't imaging giving up so quickly .
it 's horror for me .
i 'll be spending the -lrb- incentive -rrb- money and at some point there wo n't be any more .
and what happens then ? " it 's a problem polish used car sellers do n't face at the moment .
in may and june alone , they imported more than 160,000 cars from western europe - that 's five times as many as during the entire year of 2003 . thomas rautenberg -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro goes east the 10 new eu countries are expected to eventually adopt the euro as their currency .

new regulations will allow enlisted couples to bond in the balkans , get cosy in the hindu kush and horny around the horn of africa . german military officials have agreed to scrap a regulation preventing soldiers from having sex on military bases , allowing their troops to make love while preparing for war .
the decision comes after a review of existing guidelines which have now been deemed no longer compatible with societal norms . considering the 50 year , officially abstinent history of the bundeswehr , this can be seen as something of a sexual revolution .

the politicians , however , have been doing their best to hide their displeasure . germany regrets decision but understands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary donald rumsfeld with german defense minister peter struck german defense minister peter struck said in a statement that he regretted the withdrawal , but washington had no choice .
" that 's a big loss to a lot of regions , " he said .
" but the decision of the us president is without alternative . " karsten voigt , berlin 's coordinator for german-american relations , said germany would remain the largest base for us troops in europe and security in europe was not at risk . " but , nevertheless , the withdrawal of troops is a loss , of course .
we regret it ; the american soldiers were welcome here .
but it is a sign of success at the same time - the success of having overcome the cold war and european division , " voigt told reporters . the us plans to move about half of its foreign-based troops , with many heading back to the states and others from european bases penciled in for deployment in the former soviet baltic republics .
this news has raised concerns in russia , which has called for a detailed explanation of the military re-organization .
russia suspicious of us intentions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. forces could be on russia 's doorstep .
moscow is concerned that as the nato alliance expands , the united states will station troops along its borders .
further , it continues to worry about the future presence of western troops in energy-rich centra asian , which russia once dominated .
the russian foreign ministry said in a statement that , “ our view of these plans will depend on the spelled-out details , and whether they pose a danger to russia ’ s national interests . ”
moscow ’ s statement stressed that it expected washington to adhere to previous agreements that , in moscow ’ s view , ban the united states from stationing its troops in the baltics or the caucasus . democrats seize on bush 's plan but while the germans were putting on a brave face and the russians remained edgy , opposition to the withdrawal in the united states was more vociferous .
unsurprisingly , the majority of criticism came from supporters of democratic presidential candidate john kerry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke " this is another example of the -lrb- bush -rrb- administration 's unilateralism .
it 's going to weaken our national security , " said richard holbrooke , a kerry foreign policy adviser and former ambassador to the un and germany under former president clinton , in a widely reported statement .
" it is not going to save us money .
it will cost billions of dollars to bring these troops home . " holbrooke also focused on the economic demands which the troop redeployment would shift from the host countries back to the united states .
" germany , south korea and japan , which will see the biggest cuts , all spend billions of dollars to support the troops .
and i am very concerned about this . " holbrooke also rejected president george w. bush 's assertion that bringing the troops home would make it easier to rapidly deploy them to global trouble spots .
he called bases in germany , south korea and okinawa " essential " along with other forward deployments . " even in the modern world , airplanes take time to get places , " holbrooke said .
" this is a weakening of our traditional ties to our closest allies just when we need them most . " ex-general clark warns of timing in terror war another kerry-supporter , retired army general wesley clark , warned of a military mistake in the making .
" as we face a global war on terror with al qaeda active in more than 60 countries , now is not the time to pull back our forces . " clark , who commanded nato and us forces in europe from 1997 to 2000 , added in his statement : " this ill-conceived move and its timing seem politically motivated rather than designed to strengthen our national security .

but it was no ordinary auto .
the daimlerchrysler vehicle presented to him had something special under the hood : hydrogen fuel cell technology . the gleaming new model sitting in the car park outside schröder 's office in berlin is one of the prototype models fitted with the f-cell hydrogen technology that daimlerchrysler hopes will revolutionize motoring and help in the fight to reduce carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions from cars . the chancellor will have one year to test the car out as part of the company 's on-going research into greener fuel possibilities which has seen 60 cars enter production and deployed for testing around the world . the fuel cells which power the car use a combination of hydrogen and oxygen which makes them and the vehicle itself environmentally friendly . its only emission is water , which is so pure that daimlerchrysler claim its fit for human consumption .
the electric motor creates a maximum output of 65 kilowatts and will power the car for 160 kilometers -lrb- 100 miles -rrb- at a maximum speed of 140 kilometers per hour -lrb- kph -rrb- . here comes the science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fuel cell car 's motor the hydrogen fuel cell operates similar to a battery .
it has two electrodes , an anode and a cathode , separated by a membrane .
oxygen passes over one electrode and hydrogen over the other . the hydrogen reacts to a catalyst on the electrode anode that converts the hydrogen gas into negatively charged electrons and positively charged ions .
the electrons flow out of the cell to be used as electrical energy . the hydrogen ions move through the electrolyte membrane to the cathode electrode where they combine with oxygen and the electrons to produce water .
unlike batteries , fuel cells never run out . f-cell technology leading the way schröder received the car from daimlerchrysler board member jürgen hubbert and praised the efforts of the company to develop more environmentally friendly vehicles , especially at a time of increased oil prices and concerns over the effects of co2 emissions in relation to climate change . " this shows that we are on the right track , " the chancellor said , running an impressed eye over his new loan car . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler is also testing the technology on buses experts from daimlerchrysler estimate that the first commercial fuel-cell car should be ready by 2010 .
the auto manufacturer hopes it will cost around the same as regular cars . daimlerchrysler has spent over € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- in the development process and already enjoys more success than initially hoped for this stage by producing vehicles fit for use . the german car giant first grabbed the headlines with its hydrogen fuel program with its necar 4 model in 1999 .
the necar 4 , based on a mercedes-benz a-class compact car , was a liquid hydrogen vehicle with a top speed of 144 kph and a 450 kilometer tank capacity . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans still think green despite pressing problems such as unemployment and a stagnant economy , the majority of germans are still concerned about environmental issues and award it a high priority according to the results of a new study .

the politicians , however , have been doing their best to hide their displeasure . germany regrets decision but understands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary donald rumsfeld with german defense minister peter struck german defense minister peter struck said in a statement that he regretted the withdrawal , but washington had no choice .
" that 's a big loss to a lot of regions , " he said .
" but the decision of the us president is without alternative . " karsten voigt , berlin 's coordinator for german-american relations , said germany would remain the largest base for us troops in europe and security in europe was not at risk . " but , nevertheless , the withdrawal of troops is a loss , of course .
we regret it ; the american soldiers were welcome here .
but it is a sign of success at the same time - the success of having overcome the cold war and european division , " voigt told reporters . the us plans to move about half of its foreign-based troops , with many heading back to the states and others from european bases penciled in for deployment in the former soviet baltic republics .
this news has raised concerns in russia , which has called for a detailed explanation of the military re-organization .
russia suspicious of us intentions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. forces could be on russia 's doorstep .
moscow is concerned that as the nato alliance expands , the united states will station troops along its borders .
further , it continues to worry about the future presence of western troops in energy-rich centra asian , which russia once dominated .
the russian foreign ministry said in a statement that , “ our view of these plans will depend on the spelled-out details , and whether they pose a danger to russia ’ s national interests . ”
moscow ’ s statement stressed that it expected washington to adhere to previous agreements that , in moscow ’ s view , ban the united states from stationing its troops in the baltics or the caucasus . democrats seize on bush 's plan but while the germans were putting on a brave face and the russians remained edgy , opposition to the withdrawal in the united states was more vociferous .
unsurprisingly , the majority of criticism came from supporters of democratic presidential candidate john kerry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke " this is another example of the -lrb- bush -rrb- administration 's unilateralism .
it 's going to weaken our national security , " said richard holbrooke , a kerry foreign policy adviser and former ambassador to the un and germany under former president clinton , in a widely reported statement .
" it is not going to save us money .
it will cost billions of dollars to bring these troops home . " holbrooke also focused on the economic demands which the troop redeployment would shift from the host countries back to the united states .
" germany , south korea and japan , which will see the biggest cuts , all spend billions of dollars to support the troops .
and i am very concerned about this . " holbrooke also rejected president george w. bush 's assertion that bringing the troops home would make it easier to rapidly deploy them to global trouble spots .
he called bases in germany , south korea and okinawa " essential " along with other forward deployments . " even in the modern world , airplanes take time to get places , " holbrooke said .
" this is a weakening of our traditional ties to our closest allies just when we need them most . " ex-general clark warns of timing in terror war another kerry-supporter , retired army general wesley clark , warned of a military mistake in the making .
" as we face a global war on terror with al qaeda active in more than 60 countries , now is not the time to pull back our forces . " clark , who commanded nato and us forces in europe from 1997 to 2000 , added in his statement : " this ill-conceived move and its timing seem politically motivated rather than designed to strengthen our national security . " kerry to publicly address restructuring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential hopeful john kerry is expected to criticize the us troop plans .
kerry himself is expected to voice his own opposition to the bush administration 's plans when he gives a speech to the veterans of foreign wars in cincinnati on wednesday .
it will be a chance for the presidential candidate make clear one of the distinct strategic differences between himself and george w. bush .
kerry is preparing to argue that the withdrawal of troops from europe and asia threatens to undercut alliances and weakens america 's ability to project its power overseas , according to michael meehan , a senior adviser in the democratic party , quoted in the financial times .
meehan told the ft that kerry will make a " sweeping critique " of the realignment at the convention in cincinnati , the same venue where the president this week announced the planned withdrawal of a third of us forces from their foreign bases . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us troop pullout to hit local german economies the impact of us plans to pull some 70,000 troops out of europe and asia is likely to be felt most acutely in germany - especially in smaller towns whose economies depend on the us presence .

some of them are expected to be moved to posts in eastern europe while others will return home .

only two pds members now serve as parliamentarians because they were directly elected by their voting precinct . experts said the gains were to be expected as more and more people are unhappy with the government 's reforms . " during times of economic and social uncertainty , voters turn away from large parties , " everhard holtmann , a political scientist at martin luther university in halle-wittenberg , told focus money magazine . holtmann added that the greens , now a junior partner in germany 's governing coalition , experienced similar gains when they promoted environmental issues that had been widely neglected by other parties during the 1980s . pds could lead government in brandenburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and brandenburg premier matthias platezck -lrb- both spd -rrb- hope to regain voters ' support by the sept .

19 . latest surveys show the pds overtaking the spd to become the strongest political force in the state , which is currently governed by a spd-led coalition with the cdu .
so far , the pds is a junior coalition partner in the northeastern german state of mecklenburg-western pommerania as well as the city state of berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters during a demonstration in 2003 the extreme right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which the government has unsuccessfully tried to ban because of its neo-nazi platform , is also getting increasing support from voters . in the eastern german state of saxony , where elections will also take place sept .
19 , the npd could get 5 percent or more of the vote , according to surveys .
the npd also supports the reform protests . but holtmann said he did n't expect a major political upset . " protest voters do n't change their basic convictions , " he said .
" they mainly want to teach politicians a lesson . " chancellor : no further changes to reforms the chancellor , meanwhile , said wednesday that he did not support further changes to recently approved welfare reforms , which have led to demonstrations in mainly eastern german cities during the last weeks . responding to the protests , the government has made some minor changes to the reforms . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder fights off ex-communists in state election at a party conference in havel , chancellor gerhard schröder kicks off the campaign in the state of brandenburg , where unpopular reforms have pushed the former communists in the pds party to the top of polls .

now , a notable art critic is accusing the new york curators of cultural colonialism . judging by the huge number of visitors - more than 800,000 at last count - some of whom have lined up for more than eight hours to gain entry into the special exhibition of the new york-based museum of modern art 's -lrb- moma -rrb- show at berlin 's national gallery , it has been a huge success . many even credit the mania surrounding the display of more than 200 paintings and sculptures from moma 's famous collection with helping to spur tourism to germany 's capital to a post-world war ii high , and there is no indication that the steady flow of visitors will slack off before it closes on sept .
19 . however , increasing numbers of art fans who have had to wait - sometimes in the hot summer sun - are less inclined to view the exhibition as a triumph , and some have even accused the organizers of deliberately keeping the lines long in order to stir up publicity .
the fact that those willing to pay € 27 -lrb- $ 33 -rrb- can avoid the long lines entirely does stink a bit of cultural elitism . now werner spies , a noted art historian , one time friend of pablo picasso and max ernst , and former director of the national museum of modern art at the georges pompidou center in paris , has joined the critics . but the nature of his criticism is different .
in an article in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday , spies accused the new york-based curators - who decided on the exhibition 's content with no input from their berlin hosts - of cultural colonialism . american art the culmination of modern development ? the crux of spies ' criticism centers around the portion of the exhibit looking at modern art in the second half of the last century , which , compared to the first half , includes almost no selections from european masters .
in short , spies accuses the new york-based curators of falsely claiming that the " new american painting , " which emerged in the postwar years , is the culmination of the 20th century 's modern art movement . for spies , the failure to include the works of matisse , max ernst , dubuffet and giacometti , is inexcusable and not merely an oversight but suggests that moma curators have an agenda to determine the so-called canon of contemporary art to the americans ' advantage . " the americans who chose the selections are engaging in cultural politics , " he wrote .
" for them , the vatican of 20th century aesthetic , it is about establishing the canon of modern art … and the new york museum can in berlin - in an expansionist way - present american art as the culmination of that development . " in response to spies ' criticisms , peter raue , the director of the " friends of the national gallery , " which helped to bring the exhibition to berlin , told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the exhibit clearly shows the american view , which is just fine by him .
he said he could imagine that a berlin-curated show presenting the european perspective could possibly grace the galleries of moma in the future , thereby presenting a more balanced whole . numbers grow , opening hours extended in the meantime , the number of visitors hoping to gain entry continues to grow .
at times , the line wraps more than two times around the building .
and despite the museum 's decision to extend opening hours for the final weeks , the wait remains long . one industrious berlin-based engineer sent a four-page plan to the organizers detailing how to do away with the lines , which among other things , suggested the distribution of waiting numbers .
in response , according to newspaper reports , he was told that the lines were " necessary to create publicity . " according to a security official quoted in german papers , an ambulance has been called to the museum at least once a day to cart away would-be museum goers for whom the stress of contributing to the shows " publicity " has proven too much . some among them may be inclined to add their voices to the growing number of critics , though they are far more likely to bemoan practical considerations as opposed to the high-minded nature of the modern art canon .
others , however , will continue to view the chance to see this " once in a lifetime " exhibition as well worth the wait . editor 's note : while dw-tv is one of four media partners of moma in berlin , deutsche welle played no part in organizing or curating the exhibition . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de record year for berlin tourism expected the number of visitors to berlin may reach a postwar high in 2004 , berlin 's tourism organization revealed monday .

even as health experts warn that german youngsters are getting fatter , obesity levels continue to climb among the country 's migrant children population .
television and fast food are n't the only culprits . on a sunny august day , ten-year-old murat -lrb- name changed -rrb- lies on his back on a grassy lawn at a public outdoor swimming pool in berlin 's wedding district , home to a large immigrant population . licking a chocolate ice cream , murat , who is of turkish origin , might sound like a normal youngster , but he does n't look like one .
clad in an " l " size pair of swimming trunks , the porky fourth-grader tips the scales at nearly 44 kilos -lrb- 97 lbs . -rrb- . " the school authorities said he needs to exercise and lose weight .
that 's why i take him for a swim here , " his mother ayse -lrb- name changed -rrb- told dw-world .
the ice cream , she said , is a reward for him doing two laps in the pool .
" besides , it 's so hot , " she added . murat , who said his favorite food is nutella -lrb- a chocolate spread -rrb- , is not alone .
in past years , a rise in weight levels among children from germany 's immigrant families , a largely ignored group in obesity research until recently , has fuelled concern among health authorities . " sitting on a powder keg " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister renate künast is spearheading the drive for healthy nutrition to bring down obesity levels .
the german minister for consumer protection and agriculture , renate künast , estimated this year that every fifth child and every third teenager in germany is overweight .
the number of obese children signing up for school has risen three-fold compared to a decade ago .
" the country is sitting on a powder keg , " künast warned . though there are no country-wide studies on the prevalence of obesity among migrant children , statistics on the problem in cities with high foreign populations leave little room for doubt . in frankfurt , home to around 180,000 immigrants from 180 nations , research on the number of those children who joined school this year found that 12.5 percent were overweight . experts say that a six-year-old who has a body mass index of 15.4 is considered of normal weight .
the frankfurt statistics showed that moroccan and turkish children , in particular , had a body mass index of more than 18 percent , at 18.4 and 22 percent respectively .
among ten-year-olds , turkish children weighed the most at 34 percent , compared to 19 percent for german youngsters . eating to the point of disorder " it 's alarming , " holger meireis , head of frankfurt 's child and youth department told dw-world .
" if you interpret immigration in a broad sense , beyond borders of nationality , then almost 50 percent of frankfurt 's foreign population is overweight .
it ca n't be ignored any longer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neukölln is home to a large muslim population .
dr rainer moehl , a physician in neukölln , an immigrant-dominated berlin neighborhood , agreed that obesity was a widespread problem among his patients .
" by the time children in turkish and arab families reach school-going age , there 's usually a clear gender-specific difference : it 's mostly boys who develop obesity during puberty , while girls have eating disorders like bulimia , " moehl said . he warned that overweight children are likely to develop problems such as mobility and spinal and metabolic disorders , high blood pressure , diabetes and depression . filling the stomach cheaply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that low income and education levels can have disastrous consequences for obese people .
while experts point to the usual suspects - too much television , too little activity , fast food and sweets - they agree that the spread of obesity among migrant children is largely tied to their financial and social situation . jeffrey butler from the health department in berlin 's wedding district , which holds the dubious record of being home to berlin 's pudgiest kids -lrb- 20.7 percent body mass index -rrb- , points to the fact that the neighborhood is also one of the capital 's poorest . with an unemployment rate of around 24 percent , low education levels and around 26 percent of children and teenagers living on welfare , wedding has acquired notoriety as a social flashpoint . " most of the families here do n't have the means to buy healthy food , even if they wanted to , " butler said .
" it 's just easier to shop for packaged and fast food that fills you up . " calories and stress others caution that the problem has much more complex cultural reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations in a döner shop in berlin .
meat is a staple among turks .
" the common family meal is the focal point in a turkish home , and traditional turkish cuisine is actually healthy , " jutta kolletzki , a therapist who runs a counseling and treatment center for weight-loss and eating disorders in frankfurt , said .
" but meals are cooked with so much sugar and fat that it turns into a real calorie bomb , " she said . kolletzki added that many immigrants often are n't well-informed about what constitutes healthy nutrition .
differing perspectives of health also contribute to the problem , she said .
" in traditional families , a tubby child is usually considered well-fed and a sign of prosperity rather than as a problem , " kolletzki explained . she also warned that children straddling two cultures are often under a lot of emotional stress .
" separations or moving from one country to another is difficult for a child , " she said .
" eating more is a way of coping with it . " battle of the bulge bildunterschrift : children take part in a weight-loss program at germany 's baltic sea coast .
obesity among migrant children is now recognized as a serious problem , judging by the number of initiatives and projects springing up in several german cities to tackle it . most involve networking with kindergartens and schools to encourage them to introduce healthy breakfasts and impress upon the kids and parents the benefits of a healthy diet and exercise .
the emphasis is on prevention , taking into account cultural differences and using interpreters to reach the target groups . minister künast is kicking off a major nationwide project in september involving parents , health insurance companies and the food industry .
a spokeswoman at the ministry stressed that though this was n't a special programs for migrant children as yet , they were working on it . germany , it seems , is determined to win the battle of the bulge and avoid the rather drastic scenario predicted in a recent british survey , which suggested that the younger generation would be the first to die before their parents .
" it should n't go as far as that , " said künast . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mcdonald 's goes slim-line for europe responding to growing concern about obesity in europe , the u.s. fast food chain mcdonald 's prepares to launch a new , healthier menu in 16 european countries , offering customers fewer burgers , and more salads .

but it is a sign of success at the same time - the success of having overcome the cold war and european division , " voigt told reporters . the us plans to move about half of its foreign-based troops , with many heading back to the states and others from european bases penciled in for deployment in the former soviet baltic republics .
this news has raised concerns in russia , which has called for a detailed explanation of the military re-organization .
russia suspicious of us intentions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. forces could be on russia 's doorstep .
moscow is concerned that as the nato alliance expands , the united states will station troops along its borders .
further , it continues to worry about the future presence of western troops in energy-rich centra asian , which russia once dominated .
the russian foreign ministry said in a statement that , “ our view of these plans will depend on the spelled-out details , and whether they pose a danger to russia ’ s national interests . ”
moscow ’ s statement stressed that it expected washington to adhere to previous agreements that , in moscow ’ s view , ban the united states from stationing its troops in the baltics or the caucasus . democrats seize on bush 's plan but while the germans were putting on a brave face and the russians remained edgy , opposition to the withdrawal in the united states was more vociferous .
unsurprisingly , the majority of criticism came from supporters of democratic presidential candidate john kerry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke " this is another example of the -lrb- bush -rrb- administration 's unilateralism .
it 's going to weaken our national security , " said richard holbrooke , a kerry foreign policy adviser and former ambassador to the un and germany under former president clinton , in a widely reported statement .
" it is not going to save us money .
it will cost billions of dollars to bring these troops home . " holbrooke also focused on the economic demands which the troop redeployment would shift from the host countries back to the united states .
" germany , south korea and japan , which will see the biggest cuts , all spend billions of dollars to support the troops .
and i am very concerned about this . " holbrooke also rejected president george w. bush 's assertion that bringing the troops home would make it easier to rapidly deploy them to global trouble spots .
he called bases in germany , south korea and okinawa " essential " along with other forward deployments . " even in the modern world , airplanes take time to get places , " holbrooke said .
" this is a weakening of our traditional ties to our closest allies just when we need them most . " ex-general clark warns of timing in terror war another kerry-supporter , retired army general wesley clark , warned of a military mistake in the making .
" as we face a global war on terror with al qaeda active in more than 60 countries , now is not the time to pull back our forces . " clark , who commanded nato and us forces in europe from 1997 to 2000 , added in his statement : " this ill-conceived move and its timing seem politically motivated rather than designed to strengthen our national security . " kerry to publicly address restructuring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential hopeful john kerry is expected to criticize the us troop plans .
kerry himself is expected to voice his own opposition to the bush administration 's plans when he gives a speech to the veterans of foreign wars in cincinnati on wednesday .
it will be a chance for the presidential candidate make clear one of the distinct strategic differences between himself and george w. bush .
kerry is preparing to argue that the withdrawal of troops from europe and asia threatens to undercut alliances and weakens america 's ability to project its power overseas , according to michael meehan , a senior adviser in the democratic party , quoted in the financial times .
meehan told the ft that kerry will make a " sweeping critique " of the realignment at the convention in cincinnati , the same venue where the president this week announced the planned withdrawal of a third of us forces from their foreign bases . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us troop pullout to hit local german economies the impact of us plans to pull some 70,000 troops out of europe and asia is likely to be felt most acutely in germany - especially in smaller towns whose economies depend on the us presence .
-lrb- august 17 , 2004 -rrb- bush : " our posture must change " us president george w. bush has announced plans to shift up to 70,000 us troops stationed in western europe and asia .
some of them are expected to be moved to posts in eastern europe while others will return home .

even as health experts warn that german youngsters are getting fatter , obesity levels continue to climb among the country 's migrant children population .
television and fast food are n't the only culprits . on a sunny august day , ten-year-old murat -lrb- name changed -rrb- lies on his back on a grassy lawn at a public outdoor swimming pool in berlin 's wedding district , home to a large immigrant population . licking a chocolate ice cream , murat , who is of turkish origin , might sound like a normal youngster , but he does n't look like one .
clad in an " l " size pair of swimming trunks , the porky fourth-grader tips the scales at nearly 44 kilos -lrb- 97 lbs . -rrb- . " the school authorities said he needs to exercise and lose weight .
that 's why i take him for a swim here , " his mother ayse -lrb- name changed -rrb- told dw-world .
the ice cream , she said , is a reward for him doing two laps in the pool .
" besides , it 's so hot , " she added . murat , who said his favorite food is nutella -lrb- a chocolate spread -rrb- , is not alone .
in past years , a rise in weight levels among children from germany 's immigrant families , a largely ignored group in obesity research until recently , has fuelled concern among health authorities . " sitting on a powder keg " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister renate künast is spearheading the drive for healthy nutrition to bring down obesity levels .
the german minister for consumer protection and agriculture , renate künast , estimated this year that every fifth child and every third teenager in germany is overweight .
the number of obese children signing up for school has risen three-fold compared to a decade ago .
" the country is sitting on a powder keg , " künast warned . though there are no country-wide studies on the prevalence of obesity among migrant children , statistics on the problem in cities with high foreign populations leave little room for doubt . in frankfurt , home to around 180,000 immigrants from 180 nations , research on the number of those children who joined school this year found that 12.5 percent were overweight . experts say that a six-year-old who has a body mass index of 15.4 is considered of normal weight .
the frankfurt statistics showed that moroccan and turkish children , in particular , had a body mass index of more than 18 percent , at 18.4 and 22 percent respectively .
among ten-year-olds , turkish children weighed the most at 34 percent , compared to 19 percent for german youngsters . eating to the point of disorder " it 's alarming , " holger meireis , head of frankfurt 's child and youth department told dw-world .
" if you interpret immigration in a broad sense , beyond borders of nationality , then almost 50 percent of frankfurt 's foreign population is overweight .
it ca n't be ignored any longer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neukölln is home to a large muslim population .
dr rainer moehl , a physician in neukölln , an immigrant-dominated berlin neighborhood , agreed that obesity was a widespread problem among his patients .
" by the time children in turkish and arab families reach school-going age , there 's usually a clear gender-specific difference : it 's mostly boys who develop obesity during puberty , while girls have eating disorders like bulimia , " moehl said . he warned that overweight children are likely to develop problems such as mobility and spinal and metabolic disorders , high blood pressure , diabetes and depression . filling the stomach cheaply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that low income and education levels can have disastrous consequences for obese people .
while experts point to the usual suspects - too much television , too little activity , fast food and sweets - they agree that the spread of obesity among migrant children is largely tied to their financial and social situation . jeffrey butler from the health department in berlin 's wedding district , which holds the dubious record of being home to berlin 's pudgiest kids -lrb- 20.7 percent body mass index -rrb- , points to the fact that the neighborhood is also one of the capital 's poorest . with an unemployment rate of around 24 percent , low education levels and around 26 percent of children and teenagers living on welfare , wedding has acquired notoriety as a social flashpoint . " most of the families here do n't have the means to buy healthy food , even if they wanted to , " butler said .
" it 's just easier to shop for packaged and fast food that fills you up . " calories and stress others caution that the problem has much more complex cultural reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations in a döner shop in berlin .
meat is a staple among turks .
" the common family meal is the focal point in a turkish home , and traditional turkish cuisine is actually healthy , " jutta kolletzki , a therapist who runs a counseling and treatment center for weight-loss and eating disorders in frankfurt , said .
" but meals are cooked with so much sugar and fat that it turns into a real calorie bomb , " she said . kolletzki added that many immigrants often are n't well-informed about what constitutes healthy nutrition .
differing perspectives of health also contribute to the problem , she said .
" in traditional families , a tubby child is usually considered well-fed and a sign of prosperity rather than as a problem , " kolletzki explained . she also warned that children straddling two cultures are often under a lot of emotional stress .

in past years , a rise in weight levels among children from germany 's immigrant families , a largely ignored group in obesity research until recently , has fuelled concern among health authorities . " sitting on a powder keg " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister renate künast is spearheading the drive for healthy nutrition to bring down obesity levels .
the german minister for consumer protection and agriculture , renate künast , estimated this year that every fifth child and every third teenager in germany is overweight .
the number of obese children signing up for school has risen three-fold compared to a decade ago .
" the country is sitting on a powder keg , " künast warned . though there are no country-wide studies on the prevalence of obesity among migrant children , statistics on the problem in cities with high foreign populations leave little room for doubt . in frankfurt , home to around 180,000 immigrants from 180 nations , research on the number of those children who joined school this year found that 12.5 percent were overweight . experts say that a six-year-old who has a body mass index of 15.4 is considered of normal weight .
the frankfurt statistics showed that moroccan and turkish children , in particular , had a body mass index of more than 18 percent , at 18.4 and 22 percent respectively .
among ten-year-olds , turkish children weighed the most at 34 percent , compared to 19 percent for german youngsters . eating to the point of disorder " it 's alarming , " holger meireis , head of frankfurt 's child and youth department told dw-world .
" if you interpret immigration in a broad sense , beyond borders of nationality , then almost 50 percent of frankfurt 's foreign population is overweight .
it ca n't be ignored any longer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neukölln is home to a large muslim population .
dr rainer moehl , a physician in neukölln , an immigrant-dominated berlin neighborhood , agreed that obesity was a widespread problem among his patients .
" by the time children in turkish and arab families reach school-going age , there 's usually a clear gender-specific difference : it 's mostly boys who develop obesity during puberty , while girls have eating disorders like bulimia , " moehl said . he warned that overweight children are likely to develop problems such as mobility and spinal and metabolic disorders , high blood pressure , diabetes and depression . filling the stomach cheaply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that low income and education levels can have disastrous consequences for obese people .
while experts point to the usual suspects - too much television , too little activity , fast food and sweets - they agree that the spread of obesity among migrant children is largely tied to their financial and social situation . jeffrey butler from the health department in berlin 's wedding district , which holds the dubious record of being home to berlin 's pudgiest kids -lrb- 20.7 percent body mass index -rrb- , points to the fact that the neighborhood is also one of the capital 's poorest . with an unemployment rate of around 24 percent , low education levels and around 26 percent of children and teenagers living on welfare , wedding has acquired notoriety as a social flashpoint . " most of the families here do n't have the means to buy healthy food , even if they wanted to , " butler said .
" it 's just easier to shop for packaged and fast food that fills you up . " calories and stress others caution that the problem has much more complex cultural reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations in a döner shop in berlin .
meat is a staple among turks .
" the common family meal is the focal point in a turkish home , and traditional turkish cuisine is actually healthy , " jutta kolletzki , a therapist who runs a counseling and treatment center for weight-loss and eating disorders in frankfurt , said .
" but meals are cooked with so much sugar and fat that it turns into a real calorie bomb , " she said . kolletzki added that many immigrants often are n't well-informed about what constitutes healthy nutrition .
differing perspectives of health also contribute to the problem , she said .
" in traditional families , a tubby child is usually considered well-fed and a sign of prosperity rather than as a problem , " kolletzki explained . she also warned that children straddling two cultures are often under a lot of emotional stress .

now , a notable art critic is accusing the new york curators of cultural colonialism . judging by the huge number of visitors - more than 800,000 at last count - some of whom have lined up for more than eight hours to gain entry into the special exhibition of the new york-based museum of modern art 's -lrb- moma -rrb- show at berlin 's national gallery , it has been a huge success . many even credit the mania surrounding the display of more than 200 paintings and sculptures from moma 's famous collection with helping to spur tourism to germany 's capital to a post-world war ii high , and there is no indication that the steady flow of visitors will slack off before it closes on sept .
19 . however , increasing numbers of art fans who have had to wait - sometimes in the hot summer sun - are less inclined to view the exhibition as a triumph , and some have even accused the organizers of deliberately keeping the lines long in order to stir up publicity .
the fact that those willing to pay € 27 -lrb- $ 33 -rrb- can avoid the long lines entirely does stink a bit of cultural elitism . now werner spies , a noted art historian , one time friend of pablo picasso and max ernst , and former director of the national museum of modern art at the georges pompidou center in paris , has joined the critics . but the nature of his criticism is different .
in an article in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday , spies accused the new york-based curators - who decided on the exhibition 's content with no input from their berlin hosts - of cultural colonialism . american art the culmination of modern development ? the crux of spies ' criticism centers around the portion of the exhibit looking at modern art in the second half of the last century , which , compared to the first half , includes almost no selections from european masters .
in short , spies accuses the new york-based curators of falsely claiming that the " new american painting , " which emerged in the postwar years , is the culmination of the 20th century 's modern art movement . for spies , the failure to include the works of matisse , max ernst , dubuffet and giacometti , is inexcusable and not merely an oversight but suggests that moma curators have an agenda to determine the so-called canon of contemporary art to the americans ' advantage . " the americans who chose the selections are engaging in cultural politics , " he wrote .
" for them , the vatican of 20th century aesthetic , it is about establishing the canon of modern art … and the new york museum can in berlin - in an expansionist way - present american art as the culmination of that development . " in response to spies ' criticisms , peter raue , the director of the " friends of the national gallery , " which helped to bring the exhibition to berlin , told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the exhibit clearly shows the american view , which is just fine by him .
he said he could imagine that a berlin-curated show presenting the european perspective could possibly grace the galleries of moma in the future , thereby presenting a more balanced whole . numbers grow , opening hours extended in the meantime , the number of visitors hoping to gain entry continues to grow .
at times , the line wraps more than two times around the building .
and despite the museum 's decision to extend opening hours for the final weeks , the wait remains long . one industrious berlin-based engineer sent a four-page plan to the organizers detailing how to do away with the lines , which among other things , suggested the distribution of waiting numbers .
in response , according to newspaper reports , he was told that the lines were " necessary to create publicity . " according to a security official quoted in german papers , an ambulance has been called to the museum at least once a day to cart away would-be museum goers for whom the stress of contributing to the shows " publicity " has proven too much . some among them may be inclined to add their voices to the growing number of critics , though they are far more likely to bemoan practical considerations as opposed to the high-minded nature of the modern art canon .
others , however , will continue to view the chance to see this " once in a lifetime " exhibition as well worth the wait . editor 's note : while dw-tv is one of four media partners of moma in berlin , deutsche welle played no part in organizing or curating the exhibition . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de record year for berlin tourism expected the number of visitors to berlin may reach a postwar high in 2004 , berlin 's tourism organization revealed monday .

but it was no ordinary auto .
the daimlerchrysler vehicle presented to him had something special under the hood : hydrogen fuel cell technology . the gleaming new model sitting in the car park outside schröder 's office in berlin is one of the prototype models fitted with the f-cell hydrogen technology that daimlerchrysler hopes will revolutionize motoring and help in the fight to reduce carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions from cars . the chancellor will have one year to test the car out as part of the company 's on-going research into greener fuel possibilities which has seen 60 cars enter production and deployed for testing around the world . the fuel cells which power the car use a combination of hydrogen and oxygen which makes them and the vehicle itself environmentally friendly . its only emission is water , which is so pure that daimlerchrysler claim its fit for human consumption .
the electric motor creates a maximum output of 65 kilowatts and will power the car for 160 kilometers -lrb- 100 miles -rrb- at a maximum speed of 140 kilometers per hour -lrb- kph -rrb- . here comes the science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fuel cell car 's motor the hydrogen fuel cell operates similar to a battery .
it has two electrodes , an anode and a cathode , separated by a membrane .
oxygen passes over one electrode and hydrogen over the other . the hydrogen reacts to a catalyst on the electrode anode that converts the hydrogen gas into negatively charged electrons and positively charged ions .
the electrons flow out of the cell to be used as electrical energy . the hydrogen ions move through the electrolyte membrane to the cathode electrode where they combine with oxygen and the electrons to produce water .
unlike batteries , fuel cells never run out . f-cell technology leading the way schröder received the car from daimlerchrysler board member jürgen hubbert and praised the efforts of the company to develop more environmentally friendly vehicles , especially at a time of increased oil prices and concerns over the effects of co2 emissions in relation to climate change . " this shows that we are on the right track , " the chancellor said , running an impressed eye over his new loan car . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler is also testing the technology on buses experts from daimlerchrysler estimate that the first commercial fuel-cell car should be ready by 2010 .
the auto manufacturer hopes it will cost around the same as regular cars . daimlerchrysler has spent over € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- in the development process and already enjoys more success than initially hoped for this stage by producing vehicles fit for use . the german car giant first grabbed the headlines with its hydrogen fuel program with its necar 4 model in 1999 .

opposition voices have questioned his wisdom . german defense minister peter struck on tuesday set out for a summer tour of military bases to see how the current restructuring of the national armed forces is progressing .
in line with eu and nato defense policies , the bundeswehr is reshaping its troops to be better prepared for peacekeeping or peace-enforcing missions abroad . however , struck is facing a hard time explaining his decision to close numerous bundeswehr bases across the country , which will coincide with the large-scale withdrawal of us forces from western germany : struck had gained wide respect for starting to overhaul the national armed forces and handling out-of-area peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and the balkans .
while he has given up pipe smoking after the stroke he suffered in june , he has not reduced his ambitions to push through the biggest restructuring of the bundeswehr to date . troops to be cut down to 250,000 the emphasis will be on training mobile units to be employed quickly in crisis areas outside nato territory .
in the next couple of years , troop strength will be reduced by 30,000 to 250,000 - a measure long overdue after the end of the cold war .
the number of military bases will also be cut drastically .
details on the closures will be announced in november . opposition conservative defense spokesman christian schmidt warned about rushing into defense decisions now that it has been announced that the united states will be withdrawing a large contingent of their 70,000 troops now stationed in germany .
schmidt called on the defense minister on tuesday to ensure that the communities affected will receive some sort of compensation for the looming economic losses . " i myself come from a region which will be largely affected by the withdrawal of us troops with the bases in bamberg and würzburg soon to be deserted , " schmidt told dw-radio . looming economic and social problems " we ’ ve always come out in favor of providing financial help for restructuring programs after such a pull-out of troops .
but at present , there are no such means available , neither at federal , nor at community level .
we ’ ll see massive social and economic problems in the affected regions .
i ’ m optimistic that policy-makers will not leave these communities to their own devices and raise restructuring funds , probably also out of european union coffers . " schmidt , as well as bavaria ’ s christian social union leader edmund stoiber , is hoping that the defense minister will readjust his original plan to close down german military bases to the realities created by the us troop pull-out .
both theorized that a number of abandoned us bases may in the future be used by the bundeswehr instead . future planning is questioned “ i can only suggest thinking harder about harmonizing us and national defense policies , said schmidt .
" struck is expected to close down up to 100 bundeswehr bases over the next few years .
us bases will vanish too .
i ’ m not convinced that everything has been carefully coordinated yet .
i believe there ’ s a need to reconsider the planned scope of closures here . ” but the cash-strapped defense minister is unlikely to effect major changes .
many of germany 's military installations , struck argues , weren ’ t needed any longer 10 years ago , but the government was afforded the luxury of maintaining them anyway .
now , with a revamped defense strategy in place and all the budgetary constraints at hand , he says , that doesn ’ t make sense anymore . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us troop withdrawal raises concerns washington ’ s biggest military reorganization in 50 years has caused ripples around the world , but while the nations due to wave good-bye to us forces have issued muted regret , criticism is gaining pace in the us .
-lrb- august 18 , 2004 -rrb- us troop pullout to hit local german economies the impact of us plans to pull some 70,000 troops out of europe and asia is likely to be felt most acutely in germany - especially in smaller towns whose economies depend on the us presence .

even as health experts warn that german youngsters are getting fatter , obesity levels continue to climb among the country 's migrant children population .
television and fast food are n't the only culprits . on a sunny august day , ten-year-old murat -lrb- name changed -rrb- lies on his back on a grassy lawn at a public outdoor swimming pool in berlin 's wedding district , home to a large immigrant population . licking a chocolate ice cream , murat , who is of turkish origin , might sound like a normal youngster , but he does n't look like one .
clad in an " l " size pair of swimming trunks , the porky fourth-grader tips the scales at nearly 44 kilos -lrb- 97 lbs . -rrb- . " the school authorities said he needs to exercise and lose weight .
that 's why i take him for a swim here , " his mother ayse -lrb- name changed -rrb- told dw-world .

in past years , a rise in weight levels among children from germany 's immigrant families , a largely ignored group in obesity research until recently , has fuelled concern among health authorities . " sitting on a powder keg " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister renate künast is spearheading the drive for healthy nutrition to bring down obesity levels .
the german minister for consumer protection and agriculture , renate künast , estimated this year that every fifth child and every third teenager in germany is overweight .
the number of obese children signing up for school has risen three-fold compared to a decade ago .
" the country is sitting on a powder keg , " künast warned . though there are no country-wide studies on the prevalence of obesity among migrant children , statistics on the problem in cities with high foreign populations leave little room for doubt . in frankfurt , home to around 180,000 immigrants from 180 nations , research on the number of those children who joined school this year found that 12.5 percent were overweight . experts say that a six-year-old who has a body mass index of 15.4 is considered of normal weight .
the frankfurt statistics showed that moroccan and turkish children , in particular , had a body mass index of more than 18 percent , at 18.4 and 22 percent respectively .
among ten-year-olds , turkish children weighed the most at 34 percent , compared to 19 percent for german youngsters . eating to the point of disorder " it 's alarming , " holger meireis , head of frankfurt 's child and youth department told dw-world .
" if you interpret immigration in a broad sense , beyond borders of nationality , then almost 50 percent of frankfurt 's foreign population is overweight .
it ca n't be ignored any longer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neukölln is home to a large muslim population .
dr rainer moehl , a physician in neukölln , an immigrant-dominated berlin neighborhood , agreed that obesity was a widespread problem among his patients .
" by the time children in turkish and arab families reach school-going age , there 's usually a clear gender-specific difference : it 's mostly boys who develop obesity during puberty , while girls have eating disorders like bulimia , " moehl said . he warned that overweight children are likely to develop problems such as mobility and spinal and metabolic disorders , high blood pressure , diabetes and depression . filling the stomach cheaply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that low income and education levels can have disastrous consequences for obese people .
while experts point to the usual suspects - too much television , too little activity , fast food and sweets - they agree that the spread of obesity among migrant children is largely tied to their financial and social situation . jeffrey butler from the health department in berlin 's wedding district , which holds the dubious record of being home to berlin 's pudgiest kids -lrb- 20.7 percent body mass index -rrb- , points to the fact that the neighborhood is also one of the capital 's poorest . with an unemployment rate of around 24 percent , low education levels and around 26 percent of children and teenagers living on welfare , wedding has acquired notoriety as a social flashpoint . " most of the families here do n't have the means to buy healthy food , even if they wanted to , " butler said .
" it 's just easier to shop for packaged and fast food that fills you up . " calories and stress others caution that the problem has much more complex cultural reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations in a döner shop in berlin .
meat is a staple among turks .
" the common family meal is the focal point in a turkish home , and traditional turkish cuisine is actually healthy , " jutta kolletzki , a therapist who runs a counseling and treatment center for weight-loss and eating disorders in frankfurt , said .
" but meals are cooked with so much sugar and fat that it turns into a real calorie bomb , " she said . kolletzki added that many immigrants often are n't well-informed about what constitutes healthy nutrition .
differing perspectives of health also contribute to the problem , she said .
" in traditional families , a tubby child is usually considered well-fed and a sign of prosperity rather than as a problem , " kolletzki explained . she also warned that children straddling two cultures are often under a lot of emotional stress .
" separations or moving from one country to another is difficult for a child , " she said .
" eating more is a way of coping with it . " battle of the bulge bildunterschrift : children take part in a weight-loss program at germany 's baltic sea coast .
obesity among migrant children is now recognized as a serious problem , judging by the number of initiatives and projects springing up in several german cities to tackle it . most involve networking with kindergartens and schools to encourage them to introduce healthy breakfasts and impress upon the kids and parents the benefits of a healthy diet and exercise .
the emphasis is on prevention , taking into account cultural differences and using interpreters to reach the target groups . minister künast is kicking off a major nationwide project in september involving parents , health insurance companies and the food industry .
a spokeswoman at the ministry stressed that though this was n't a special programs for migrant children as yet , they were working on it . germany , it seems , is determined to win the battle of the bulge and avoid the rather drastic scenario predicted in a recent british survey , which suggested that the younger generation would be the first to die before their parents .
" it should n't go as far as that , " said künast . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mcdonald 's goes slim-line for europe responding to growing concern about obesity in europe , the u.s. fast food chain mcdonald 's prepares to launch a new , healthier menu in 16 european countries , offering customers fewer burgers , and more salads .

opposition voices have questioned his wisdom . german defense minister peter struck on tuesday set out for a summer tour of military bases to see how the current restructuring of the national armed forces is progressing .
in line with eu and nato defense policies , the bundeswehr is reshaping its troops to be better prepared for peacekeeping or peace-enforcing missions abroad . however , struck is facing a hard time explaining his decision to close numerous bundeswehr bases across the country , which will coincide with the large-scale withdrawal of us forces from western germany : struck had gained wide respect for starting to overhaul the national armed forces and handling out-of-area peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and the balkans .
while he has given up pipe smoking after the stroke he suffered in june , he has not reduced his ambitions to push through the biggest restructuring of the bundeswehr to date . troops to be cut down to 250,000 the emphasis will be on training mobile units to be employed quickly in crisis areas outside nato territory .
in the next couple of years , troop strength will be reduced by 30,000 to 250,000 - a measure long overdue after the end of the cold war .
the number of military bases will also be cut drastically .
details on the closures will be announced in november . opposition conservative defense spokesman christian schmidt warned about rushing into defense decisions now that it has been announced that the united states will be withdrawing a large contingent of their 70,000 troops now stationed in germany .
schmidt called on the defense minister on tuesday to ensure that the communities affected will receive some sort of compensation for the looming economic losses . " i myself come from a region which will be largely affected by the withdrawal of us troops with the bases in bamberg and würzburg soon to be deserted , " schmidt told dw-radio . looming economic and social problems " we ’ ve always come out in favor of providing financial help for restructuring programs after such a pull-out of troops .
but at present , there are no such means available , neither at federal , nor at community level .
we ’ ll see massive social and economic problems in the affected regions .
i ’ m optimistic that policy-makers will not leave these communities to their own devices and raise restructuring funds , probably also out of european union coffers . " schmidt , as well as bavaria ’ s christian social union leader edmund stoiber , is hoping that the defense minister will readjust his original plan to close down german military bases to the realities created by the us troop pull-out .
both theorized that a number of abandoned us bases may in the future be used by the bundeswehr instead . future planning is questioned “ i can only suggest thinking harder about harmonizing us and national defense policies , said schmidt .
" struck is expected to close down up to 100 bundeswehr bases over the next few years .
us bases will vanish too .
i ’ m not convinced that everything has been carefully coordinated yet .
i believe there ’ s a need to reconsider the planned scope of closures here . ” but the cash-strapped defense minister is unlikely to effect major changes .
many of germany 's military installations , struck argues , weren ’ t needed any longer 10 years ago , but the government was afforded the luxury of maintaining them anyway .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.08.2004 moma berlin exhibition slammed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some art fans are unhappy with the show unhappy with the long entrance lines , art fans are directing criticism at the organizers of berlin 's moma exhibition .
now , a notable art critic is accusing the new york curators of cultural colonialism . judging by the huge number of visitors - more than 800,000 at last count - some of whom have lined up for more than eight hours to gain entry into the special exhibition of the new york-based museum of modern art 's -lrb- moma -rrb- show at berlin 's national gallery , it has been a huge success . many even credit the mania surrounding the display of more than 200 paintings and sculptures from moma 's famous collection with helping to spur tourism to germany 's capital to a post-world war ii high , and there is no indication that the steady flow of visitors will slack off before it closes on sept .
19 . however , increasing numbers of art fans who have had to wait - sometimes in the hot summer sun - are less inclined to view the exhibition as a triumph , and some have even accused the organizers of deliberately keeping the lines long in order to stir up publicity .
the fact that those willing to pay € 27 -lrb- $ 33 -rrb- can avoid the long lines entirely does stink a bit of cultural elitism . now werner spies , a noted art historian , one time friend of pablo picasso and max ernst , and former director of the national museum of modern art at the georges pompidou center in paris , has joined the critics . but the nature of his criticism is different .
in an article in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday , spies accused the new york-based curators - who decided on the exhibition 's content with no input from their berlin hosts - of cultural colonialism . american art the culmination of modern development ? the crux of spies ' criticism centers around the portion of the exhibit looking at modern art in the second half of the last century , which , compared to the first half , includes almost no selections from european masters .
in short , spies accuses the new york-based curators of falsely claiming that the " new american painting , " which emerged in the postwar years , is the culmination of the 20th century 's modern art movement . for spies , the failure to include the works of matisse , max ernst , dubuffet and giacometti , is inexcusable and not merely an oversight but suggests that moma curators have an agenda to determine the so-called canon of contemporary art to the americans ' advantage . " the americans who chose the selections are engaging in cultural politics , " he wrote .
" for them , the vatican of 20th century aesthetic , it is about establishing the canon of modern art … and the new york museum can in berlin - in an expansionist way - present american art as the culmination of that development . " in response to spies ' criticisms , peter raue , the director of the " friends of the national gallery , " which helped to bring the exhibition to berlin , told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the exhibit clearly shows the american view , which is just fine by him .
he said he could imagine that a berlin-curated show presenting the european perspective could possibly grace the galleries of moma in the future , thereby presenting a more balanced whole . numbers grow , opening hours extended in the meantime , the number of visitors hoping to gain entry continues to grow .
at times , the line wraps more than two times around the building .
and despite the museum 's decision to extend opening hours for the final weeks , the wait remains long . one industrious berlin-based engineer sent a four-page plan to the organizers detailing how to do away with the lines , which among other things , suggested the distribution of waiting numbers .
in response , according to newspaper reports , he was told that the lines were " necessary to create publicity . " according to a security official quoted in german papers , an ambulance has been called to the museum at least once a day to cart away would-be museum goers for whom the stress of contributing to the shows " publicity " has proven too much . some among them may be inclined to add their voices to the growing number of critics , though they are far more likely to bemoan practical considerations as opposed to the high-minded nature of the modern art canon .
others , however , will continue to view the chance to see this " once in a lifetime " exhibition as well worth the wait . editor 's note : while dw-tv is one of four media partners of moma in berlin , deutsche welle played no part in organizing or curating the exhibition . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de record year for berlin tourism expected the number of visitors to berlin may reach a postwar high in 2004 , berlin 's tourism organization revealed monday .

now eu reality has hit them - a disappointment for many . " some things were meant to become cheaper - german beer , for example , but it still costs as much as before , " one woman told german public broadcaster wdr .
" phoning people and using the internet was supposed to become cheaper , because there 's more competition .
but nothing 's happening , which is something that i 'm personally sad about , because i 've been waiting for things to change . " another woman agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : market square in warsaw " i 'm only hearing about the positive things in radio and tv and reading about it in the newspapers - that our exports are up and that it 's going to get better and better for us , " she said .
" but i 'm not seeing that happening . " she added that meat was a third more expensive now and prices for medicines had also increased .
pensions on the other hand had stayed the same , she said . beef and poultry prices have indeed increased by about 18 percent , according to a report by the national bank of poland .
on the other hand , few things have become cheaper : electronics , wine and beer have just gone down 0.5 percent in price . farming business is booming polish farmers on the other hand are more upbeat .
a few months ago , they were still considered the problem children of poland 's eu accession .
badly organized and working on small farms , officials worried that farmers would not be able to compete internationally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a farmer offering vegetables in warsaw but business is booming : asparagus , fruit , potatoes , wheat and mushrooms from poland have become bestsellers in the eu .
farmers also have overcome their initial hesitation to apply for financial help from brussels . " if 1.3 million farmers are able to apply for funds , that 's something that we can be proud of , " polish agriculture minister wojciech olejniczak told wdr .
" and we 'll convince those that are still hesitating - maybe not tomorrow , but definitely by the end of the year .

new regulations will allow enlisted couples to bond in the balkans , get cosy in the hindu kush and horny around the horn of africa . german military officials have agreed to scrap a regulation preventing soldiers from having sex on military bases , allowing their troops to make love while preparing for war .
the decision comes after a review of existing guidelines which have now been deemed no longer compatible with societal norms . considering the 50 year , officially abstinent history of the bundeswehr , this can be seen as something of a sexual revolution .
with about 271,000 troops in the german army , about 9,300 of whom are women , the defense ministry has long had to deal with problems that arose from the strain put on couples , especially while on duty abroad , as soldiers are not allowed to leave military bases . now , the powers-that-be hope that changing the rules will bring an end to ' incidents ' involving lustful squaddies and help soldiers keep their minds on the defense of the nation . have sex but abide by the rules there are , however , conditions .
under the revised regulations , both heterosexual and homosexual relations are permitted as long as they take place between two consenting adults ; sexual relations can only take place between soldiers within the same camp , meaning conscripts can not simply take a lover onto the camp for the night , and sex while on duty will remain a taboo , while in the soldiers ' spare time , officials say " anything goes .

germany is the world ’ s leading producer of wind power .
but as land sites for wind parks become increasingly scarce , the future of the country ’ s wind industry lies on the open sea . in the northern german region of schleswig-holstein , you can ’ t miss them : the wind turbines sprinkled along the landscape are as prominent as the cattle grazing on the grass . but can these giant modern windmills be placed in the middle of the ocean ?
the residents of north frisia are willing to try .
for them , as well as many others living in the schleswig-holstein area , much of their livelihood depends on the presence of the wind turbines generating energy from the constant breeze coming off the north sea .
klaus rave , vice-president of the european wind energy association , says the region ’ s communities had a vision 15 years ago that they could produce 25 percent of their electricity through wind energy by 2010 .
and they succeeded .
“ we promoted discussions and expert reports , and we had the courage to openly say we were considering this , ” rave says .
“ we were able to achieve our goal in 2002 and we ’ re continuing to work with this in mind and concentrating on future possibilities . ”
a people ’ s project but the space on land is limited .
so the local residents designed and financed project butendiek , an offshore wind park some 20 miles off the coast in the north sea .
it will cost a total of 400 million euro -lrb- $ 475 million -rrb- to anchor the planned eighty wind turbines to the ocean floor .
“ our experiences led us to say , if wind parks have been so successful inland , why don ’ t we build them in the sea , ” says rave .
but they didn ’ t want to leave this undertaking to a large corporation , he adds .
“ we wanted to do it ourselves , with our own capabilities and know-how . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : offshore wind power is already successful in denmark .
the citizens of north frisia strongly advocate the use of clean energy .
but they also believe that with over 15 years of experience with wind power , they can make the offshore park work .
“ wind parks have been very successful in north frisia , so that creates an acceptance for the economic aspects of the offshore park , ” says hans feddersen , sales manager for project butendiek .
he says 8,500 north frisians have decided to finance the project - and not just for environmental reasons .
“ of course , there are also opponents , but the project sounds a lot better when you tie the whirring of the wind with your wallet , ” feddersen says .
the people in the region would rather grab this opportunity for investment rather than not be actively involved .
opposition remains there is , however , much controversy surrounding the building of offshore wind parks .
for one , many potential investors still see the project as a financial risk .
also , contractors have to gain permission to prohibit shipping in the wind park area .
and ironically , environmentalists are posing some of the staunchest opposition to project butendiek .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aerial view of sylt in the north sea .
the offshore wind park , which aims to get going in 2005 , still needs approval to run a cable through a national park and over the island of sylt -lrb- photo -rrb- .
and if this fails , due to complaints from nature organizations , the project won ’ t work .
environment minister jürgen trittin wants to increase germany ’ s power generation from renewable energy sources from 4.5 percent to 12.5 percent by 2010 .
but the country ’ s sluggish economy is leading many to question the value of wind energy versus the costs .
a lot rides on the success of project butendiek .
if it fails , it ’ s difficult to imagine that other offshore wind parks in germany will be built - and it could throw the future of wind energy into jeopardy . angela kappler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : wind energy : more than hot air ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.08.2004 moma berlin exhibition slammed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some art fans are unhappy with the show unhappy with the long entrance lines , art fans are directing criticism at the organizers of berlin 's moma exhibition .
now , a notable art critic is accusing the new york curators of cultural colonialism . judging by the huge number of visitors - more than 800,000 at last count - some of whom have lined up for more than eight hours to gain entry into the special exhibition of the new york-based museum of modern art 's -lrb- moma -rrb- show at berlin 's national gallery , it has been a huge success . many even credit the mania surrounding the display of more than 200 paintings and sculptures from moma 's famous collection with helping to spur tourism to germany 's capital to a post-world war ii high , and there is no indication that the steady flow of visitors will slack off before it closes on sept .
19 . however , increasing numbers of art fans who have had to wait - sometimes in the hot summer sun - are less inclined to view the exhibition as a triumph , and some have even accused the organizers of deliberately keeping the lines long in order to stir up publicity .
the fact that those willing to pay € 27 -lrb- $ 33 -rrb- can avoid the long lines entirely does stink a bit of cultural elitism . now werner spies , a noted art historian , one time friend of pablo picasso and max ernst , and former director of the national museum of modern art at the georges pompidou center in paris , has joined the critics . but the nature of his criticism is different .
in an article in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday , spies accused the new york-based curators - who decided on the exhibition 's content with no input from their berlin hosts - of cultural colonialism . american art the culmination of modern development ? the crux of spies ' criticism centers around the portion of the exhibit looking at modern art in the second half of the last century , which , compared to the first half , includes almost no selections from european masters .
in short , spies accuses the new york-based curators of falsely claiming that the " new american painting , " which emerged in the postwar years , is the culmination of the 20th century 's modern art movement . for spies , the failure to include the works of matisse , max ernst , dubuffet and giacometti , is inexcusable and not merely an oversight but suggests that moma curators have an agenda to determine the so-called canon of contemporary art to the americans ' advantage . " the americans who chose the selections are engaging in cultural politics , " he wrote .
" for them , the vatican of 20th century aesthetic , it is about establishing the canon of modern art … and the new york museum can in berlin - in an expansionist way - present american art as the culmination of that development . " in response to spies ' criticisms , peter raue , the director of the " friends of the national gallery , " which helped to bring the exhibition to berlin , told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the exhibit clearly shows the american view , which is just fine by him .
he said he could imagine that a berlin-curated show presenting the european perspective could possibly grace the galleries of moma in the future , thereby presenting a more balanced whole . numbers grow , opening hours extended in the meantime , the number of visitors hoping to gain entry continues to grow .
at times , the line wraps more than two times around the building .
and despite the museum 's decision to extend opening hours for the final weeks , the wait remains long . one industrious berlin-based engineer sent a four-page plan to the organizers detailing how to do away with the lines , which among other things , suggested the distribution of waiting numbers .
in response , according to newspaper reports , he was told that the lines were " necessary to create publicity . " according to a security official quoted in german papers , an ambulance has been called to the museum at least once a day to cart away would-be museum goers for whom the stress of contributing to the shows " publicity " has proven too much . some among them may be inclined to add their voices to the growing number of critics , though they are far more likely to bemoan practical considerations as opposed to the high-minded nature of the modern art canon .
others , however , will continue to view the chance to see this " once in a lifetime " exhibition as well worth the wait . editor 's note : while dw-tv is one of four media partners of moma in berlin , deutsche welle played no part in organizing or curating the exhibition . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : record year for berlin tourism expected the number of visitors to berlin may reach a postwar high in 2004 , berlin 's tourism organization revealed monday .

even as health experts warn that german youngsters are getting fatter , obesity levels continue to climb among the country 's migrant children population .
television and fast food are n't the only culprits . on a sunny august day , ten-year-old murat -lrb- name changed -rrb- lies on his back on a grassy lawn at a public outdoor swimming pool in berlin 's wedding district , home to a large immigrant population . licking a chocolate ice cream , murat , who is of turkish origin , might sound like a normal youngster , but he does n't look like one .
clad in an " l " size pair of swimming trunks , the porky fourth-grader tips the scales at nearly 44 kilos -lrb- 97 lbs . -rrb- . " the school authorities said he needs to exercise and lose weight .
that 's why i take him for a swim here , " his mother ayse -lrb- name changed -rrb- told dw-world .
the ice cream , she said , is a reward for him doing two laps in the pool .
" besides , it 's so hot , " she added . murat , who said his favorite food is nutella -lrb- a chocolate spread -rrb- , is not alone .
in past years , a rise in weight levels among children from germany 's immigrant families , a largely ignored group in obesity research until recently , has fuelled concern among health authorities . " sitting on a powder keg " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister renate künast is spearheading the drive for healthy nutrition to bring down obesity levels .
the german minister for consumer protection and agriculture , renate künast , estimated this year that every fifth child and every third teenager in germany is overweight .
the number of obese children signing up for school has risen three-fold compared to a decade ago .
" the country is sitting on a powder keg , " künast warned . though there are no country-wide studies on the prevalence of obesity among migrant children , statistics on the problem in cities with high foreign populations leave little room for doubt . in frankfurt , home to around 180,000 immigrants from 180 nations , research on the number of those children who joined school this year found that 12.5 percent were overweight . experts say that a six-year-old who has a body mass index of 15.4 is considered of normal weight .
the frankfurt statistics showed that moroccan and turkish children , in particular , had a body mass index of more than 18 percent , at 18.4 and 22 percent respectively .
among ten-year-olds , turkish children weighed the most at 34 percent , compared to 19 percent for german youngsters . eating to the point of disorder " it 's alarming , " holger meireis , head of frankfurt 's child and youth department told dw-world .
" if you interpret immigration in a broad sense , beyond borders of nationality , then almost 50 percent of frankfurt 's foreign population is overweight .
it ca n't be ignored any longer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neukölln is home to a large muslim population .
dr rainer moehl , a physician in neukölln , an immigrant-dominated berlin neighborhood , agreed that obesity was a widespread problem among his patients .
" by the time children in turkish and arab families reach school-going age , there 's usually a clear gender-specific difference : it 's mostly boys who develop obesity during puberty , while girls have eating disorders like bulimia , " moehl said . he warned that overweight children are likely to develop problems such as mobility and spinal and metabolic disorders , high blood pressure , diabetes and depression . filling the stomach cheaply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that low income and education levels can have disastrous consequences for obese people .
while experts point to the usual suspects - too much television , too little activity , fast food and sweets - they agree that the spread of obesity among migrant children is largely tied to their financial and social situation . jeffrey butler from the health department in berlin 's wedding district , which holds the dubious record of being home to berlin 's pudgiest kids -lrb- 20.7 percent body mass index -rrb- , points to the fact that the neighborhood is also one of the capital 's poorest . with an unemployment rate of around 24 percent , low education levels and around 26 percent of children and teenagers living on welfare , wedding has acquired notoriety as a social flashpoint . " most of the families here do n't have the means to buy healthy food , even if they wanted to , " butler said .
" it 's just easier to shop for packaged and fast food that fills you up . " calories and stress others caution that the problem has much more complex cultural reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations in a döner shop in berlin .
meat is a staple among turks .
" the common family meal is the focal point in a turkish home , and traditional turkish cuisine is actually healthy , " jutta kolletzki , a therapist who runs a counseling and treatment center for weight-loss and eating disorders in frankfurt , said .
" but meals are cooked with so much sugar and fat that it turns into a real calorie bomb , " she said . kolletzki added that many immigrants often are n't well-informed about what constitutes healthy nutrition .
differing perspectives of health also contribute to the problem , she said .
" in traditional families , a tubby child is usually considered well-fed and a sign of prosperity rather than as a problem , " kolletzki explained . she also warned that children straddling two cultures are often under a lot of emotional stress .
" separations or moving from one country to another is difficult for a child , " she said .
" eating more is a way of coping with it . " battle of the bulge bildunterschrift : children take part in a weight-loss program at germany 's baltic sea coast .
obesity among migrant children is now recognized as a serious problem , judging by the number of initiatives and projects springing up in several german cities to tackle it . most involve networking with kindergartens and schools to encourage them to introduce healthy breakfasts and impress upon the kids and parents the benefits of a healthy diet and exercise .
the emphasis is on prevention , taking into account cultural differences and using interpreters to reach the target groups . minister künast is kicking off a major nationwide project in september involving parents , health insurance companies and the food industry .
a spokeswoman at the ministry stressed that though this was n't a special programs for migrant children as yet , they were working on it . germany , it seems , is determined to win the battle of the bulge and avoid the rather drastic scenario predicted in a recent british survey , which suggested that the younger generation would be the first to die before their parents .
