namibia on sunday marked the 100th anniversary of the herero rebellion , remembering one of the darkest chapters of germany ’ s colonial past in what was once german southwest africa . on january 11 , 1904 , herero tribal leader samuel maharero called for his people to rise up and fight against their german colonial rulers in the southwestern part of africa that would one day become modern namibia . angered by encroaching german settlers , the dividing of their land by new railroads and the decimation of their herds of cattle , the herero violently heeded that call and killed 100 german civilians and 13 soldiers in just a few days .
however , those deaths would eventually elicit a response from the germans that many herero consider tantamount to genocide . completely unprepared for the unrest , governor general theodor leutwein was unable to keep the insurrection from quickly spreading throughout the entire colony and after an unsuccessful six-month bush war the government in berlin ordered 14,000 german soldiers to the region to put down the rebellion .
heading the force was lieutenant general lothar von trotha , a man who already had a infamous reputation from other conflicts . “ you can say the whole thing became more brutal at that point , ” larissa förster , a namibia expert at the museum for ethnology in cologne , told deutsche welle . no quarter from von trotha after a decisive battle for the germans on august 12 , 1904 near the waterberg , the surviving herero fled into the omaheke desert .
what happened next still continues to haunt many herero today .
confronted with the very real possibility of dying in the desert , many hoped to surrender to the germans and head back to their lands .
but on october 2 , von trotha ordered all herero , armed or unarmed and including women and children , to be shot if they attempted to return . although the german kaiser wilhelm ii and reichskanzler von bülow supposedly disagreed with this decision , they apparently also did little to stop von trotha , who was now determined to exterminate the herero , from carrying it out . those herero that were not killed where eventually put in camps that many namibians now compare to nazi concentration camps .
forced labor , disease and malnutrition took their toll .
by 1908 , when the camps were emptied , an estimated 50 to 80 percent of the entire herero population had died . like many modern historians , förster from the museum in cologne considers the herero rebellion the first genocide of the 20th century .
“ it was clearly a command to eliminate people belonging to a specific ethnic group and only because they were part of this ethnic group , ” förster said . looking for compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero woman . the herero never completely recovered from the conflict and of the around 100,000 that today live in namibia many live in poverty or work on the farms of white landowners . in 2001 , tribal leaders tried to sue germany for compensation in u.s. courts , but the claim for $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.12 billion -rrb- never went very far .
they also want reparations from deutsche bank , which allegedly profited from the forced labor in the camps . “ the war was a gruesome thing .
much blood flowed and there were many victims on both the german side and the side of the herero .
the german soldiers and settlers stole my land and my dignity and they killed my people .
something like that can never be forgotten , ” tjerimo veseevete , a 75 year-old herero man who lives not far from the waterberg near otumborombonga , told deutsche welle . germany has expressed its regret over the matter and professes it has a special responsibility is ensuring the future of namibia , but has so far stopped short of an official apology .
and since berlin is namibia ’ s single largest source of foreign aid , it also sees no need for specific financial compensation to the herero . the namibian government , which is dominated by the ovambo people , has shown little interest in backing the herero claims .

namibia on sunday marked the 100th anniversary of the herero rebellion , remembering one of the darkest chapters of germany ’ s colonial past in what was once german southwest africa . on january 11 , 1904 , herero tribal leader samuel maharero called for his people to rise up and fight against their german colonial rulers in the southwestern part of africa that would one day become modern namibia . angered by encroaching german settlers , the dividing of their land by new railroads and the decimation of their herds of cattle , the herero violently heeded that call and killed 100 german civilians and 13 soldiers in just a few days .
however , those deaths would eventually elicit a response from the germans that many herero consider tantamount to genocide . completely unprepared for the unrest , governor general theodor leutwein was unable to keep the insurrection from quickly spreading throughout the entire colony and after an unsuccessful six-month bush war the government in berlin ordered 14,000 german soldiers to the region to put down the rebellion .
heading the force was lieutenant general lothar von trotha , a man who already had a infamous reputation from other conflicts . “ you can say the whole thing became more brutal at that point , ” larissa förster , a namibia expert at the museum for ethnology in cologne , told deutsche welle . no quarter from von trotha after a decisive battle for the germans on august 12 , 1904 near the waterberg , the surviving herero fled into the omaheke desert .
what happened next still continues to haunt many herero today .
confronted with the very real possibility of dying in the desert , many hoped to surrender to the germans and head back to their lands .
but on october 2 , von trotha ordered all herero , armed or unarmed and including women and children , to be shot if they attempted to return . although the german kaiser wilhelm ii and reichskanzler von bülow supposedly disagreed with this decision , they apparently also did little to stop von trotha , who was now determined to exterminate the herero , from carrying it out . those herero that were not killed where eventually put in camps that many namibians now compare to nazi concentration camps .
forced labor , disease and malnutrition took their toll .
by 1908 , when the camps were emptied , an estimated 50 to 80 percent of the entire herero population had died . like many modern historians , förster from the museum in cologne considers the herero rebellion the first genocide of the 20th century .
“ it was clearly a command to eliminate people belonging to a specific ethnic group and only because they were part of this ethnic group , ” förster said . looking for compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero woman . the herero never completely recovered from the conflict and of the around 100,000 that today live in namibia many live in poverty or work on the farms of white landowners . in 2001 , tribal leaders tried to sue germany for compensation in u.s. courts , but the claim for $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.12 billion -rrb- never went very far .
they also want reparations from deutsche bank , which allegedly profited from the forced labor in the camps . “ the war was a gruesome thing .
much blood flowed and there were many victims on both the german side and the side of the herero .
the german soldiers and settlers stole my land and my dignity and they killed my people .
something like that can never be forgotten , ” tjerimo veseevete , a 75 year-old herero man who lives not far from the waterberg near otumborombonga , told deutsche welle . germany has expressed its regret over the matter and professes it has a special responsibility is ensuring the future of namibia , but has so far stopped short of an official apology .
and since berlin is namibia ’ s single largest source of foreign aid , it also sees no need for specific financial compensation to the herero . the namibian government , which is dominated by the ovambo people , has shown little interest in backing the herero claims .

heading the force was lieutenant general lothar von trotha , a man who already had a infamous reputation from other conflicts . “ you can say the whole thing became more brutal at that point , ” larissa förster , a namibia expert at the museum for ethnology in cologne , told deutsche welle . no quarter from von trotha after a decisive battle for the germans on august 12 , 1904 near the waterberg , the surviving herero fled into the omaheke desert .
what happened next still continues to haunt many herero today .
confronted with the very real possibility of dying in the desert , many hoped to surrender to the germans and head back to their lands .
but on october 2 , von trotha ordered all herero , armed or unarmed and including women and children , to be shot if they attempted to return . although the german kaiser wilhelm ii and reichskanzler von bülow supposedly disagreed with this decision , they apparently also did little to stop von trotha , who was now determined to exterminate the herero , from carrying it out . those herero that were not killed where eventually put in camps that many namibians now compare to nazi concentration camps .
forced labor , disease and malnutrition took their toll .
by 1908 , when the camps were emptied , an estimated 50 to 80 percent of the entire herero population had died . like many modern historians , förster from the museum in cologne considers the herero rebellion the first genocide of the 20th century .
“ it was clearly a command to eliminate people belonging to a specific ethnic group and only because they were part of this ethnic group , ” förster said . looking for compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero woman . the herero never completely recovered from the conflict and of the around 100,000 that today live in namibia many live in poverty or work on the farms of white landowners . in 2001 , tribal leaders tried to sue germany for compensation in u.s. courts , but the claim for $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.12 billion -rrb- never went very far .
they also want reparations from deutsche bank , which allegedly profited from the forced labor in the camps . “ the war was a gruesome thing .
much blood flowed and there were many victims on both the german side and the side of the herero .
the german soldiers and settlers stole my land and my dignity and they killed my people .
something like that can never be forgotten , ” tjerimo veseevete , a 75 year-old herero man who lives not far from the waterberg near otumborombonga , told deutsche welle . germany has expressed its regret over the matter and professes it has a special responsibility is ensuring the future of namibia , but has so far stopped short of an official apology .
and since berlin is namibia ’ s single largest source of foreign aid , it also sees no need for specific financial compensation to the herero . the namibian government , which is dominated by the ovambo people , has shown little interest in backing the herero claims .

however , those deaths would eventually elicit a response from the germans that many herero consider tantamount to genocide . completely unprepared for the unrest , governor general theodor leutwein was unable to keep the insurrection from quickly spreading throughout the entire colony and after an unsuccessful six-month bush war the government in berlin ordered 14,000 german soldiers to the region to put down the rebellion .

namibia on sunday marked the 100th anniversary of the herero rebellion , remembering one of the darkest chapters of germany ’ s colonial past in what was once german southwest africa . on january 11 , 1904 , herero tribal leader samuel maharero called for his people to rise up and fight against their german colonial rulers in the southwestern part of africa that would one day become modern namibia . angered by encroaching german settlers , the dividing of their land by new railroads and the decimation of their herds of cattle , the herero violently heeded that call and killed 100 german civilians and 13 soldiers in just a few days .
however , those deaths would eventually elicit a response from the germans that many herero consider tantamount to genocide . completely unprepared for the unrest , governor general theodor leutwein was unable to keep the insurrection from quickly spreading throughout the entire colony and after an unsuccessful six-month bush war the government in berlin ordered 14,000 german soldiers to the region to put down the rebellion .
heading the force was lieutenant general lothar von trotha , a man who already had a infamous reputation from other conflicts . “ you can say the whole thing became more brutal at that point , ” larissa förster , a namibia expert at the museum for ethnology in cologne , told deutsche welle . no quarter from von trotha after a decisive battle for the germans on august 12 , 1904 near the waterberg , the surviving herero fled into the omaheke desert .
what happened next still continues to haunt many herero today .
confronted with the very real possibility of dying in the desert , many hoped to surrender to the germans and head back to their lands .
but on october 2 , von trotha ordered all herero , armed or unarmed and including women and children , to be shot if they attempted to return . although the german kaiser wilhelm ii and reichskanzler von bülow supposedly disagreed with this decision , they apparently also did little to stop von trotha , who was now determined to exterminate the herero , from carrying it out . those herero that were not killed where eventually put in camps that many namibians now compare to nazi concentration camps .

namibia on sunday marked the 100th anniversary of the herero rebellion , remembering one of the darkest chapters of germany ’ s colonial past in what was once german southwest africa . on january 11 , 1904 , herero tribal leader samuel maharero called for his people to rise up and fight against their german colonial rulers in the southwestern part of africa that would one day become modern namibia . angered by encroaching german settlers , the dividing of their land by new railroads and the decimation of their herds of cattle , the herero violently heeded that call and killed 100 german civilians and 13 soldiers in just a few days .
however , those deaths would eventually elicit a response from the germans that many herero consider tantamount to genocide . completely unprepared for the unrest , governor general theodor leutwein was unable to keep the insurrection from quickly spreading throughout the entire colony and after an unsuccessful six-month bush war the government in berlin ordered 14,000 german soldiers to the region to put down the rebellion .
heading the force was lieutenant general lothar von trotha , a man who already had a infamous reputation from other conflicts . “ you can say the whole thing became more brutal at that point , ” larissa förster , a namibia expert at the museum for ethnology in cologne , told deutsche welle . no quarter from von trotha after a decisive battle for the germans on august 12 , 1904 near the waterberg , the surviving herero fled into the omaheke desert .
what happened next still continues to haunt many herero today .
confronted with the very real possibility of dying in the desert , many hoped to surrender to the germans and head back to their lands .
but on october 2 , von trotha ordered all herero , armed or unarmed and including women and children , to be shot if they attempted to return . although the german kaiser wilhelm ii and reichskanzler von bülow supposedly disagreed with this decision , they apparently also did little to stop von trotha , who was now determined to exterminate the herero , from carrying it out . those herero that were not killed where eventually put in camps that many namibians now compare to nazi concentration camps .
forced labor , disease and malnutrition took their toll .
by 1908 , when the camps were emptied , an estimated 50 to 80 percent of the entire herero population had died . like many modern historians , förster from the museum in cologne considers the herero rebellion the first genocide of the 20th century .
“ it was clearly a command to eliminate people belonging to a specific ethnic group and only because they were part of this ethnic group , ” förster said . looking for compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero woman . the herero never completely recovered from the conflict and of the around 100,000 that today live in namibia many live in poverty or work on the farms of white landowners . in 2001 , tribal leaders tried to sue germany for compensation in u.s. courts , but the claim for $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.12 billion -rrb- never went very far .
they also want reparations from deutsche bank , which allegedly profited from the forced labor in the camps . “ the war was a gruesome thing .

namibia on sunday marked the 100th anniversary of the herero rebellion , remembering one of the darkest chapters of germany ’ s colonial past in what was once german southwest africa . on january 11 , 1904 , herero tribal leader samuel maharero called for his people to rise up and fight against their german colonial rulers in the southwestern part of africa that would one day become modern namibia . angered by encroaching german settlers , the dividing of their land by new railroads and the decimation of their herds of cattle , the herero violently heeded that call and killed 100 german civilians and 13 soldiers in just a few days .
however , those deaths would eventually elicit a response from the germans that many herero consider tantamount to genocide . completely unprepared for the unrest , governor general theodor leutwein was unable to keep the insurrection from quickly spreading throughout the entire colony and after an unsuccessful six-month bush war the government in berlin ordered 14,000 german soldiers to the region to put down the rebellion .
heading the force was lieutenant general lothar von trotha , a man who already had a infamous reputation from other conflicts . “ you can say the whole thing became more brutal at that point , ” larissa förster , a namibia expert at the museum for ethnology in cologne , told deutsche welle . no quarter from von trotha after a decisive battle for the germans on august 12 , 1904 near the waterberg , the surviving herero fled into the omaheke desert .
what happened next still continues to haunt many herero today .
confronted with the very real possibility of dying in the desert , many hoped to surrender to the germans and head back to their lands .
but on october 2 , von trotha ordered all herero , armed or unarmed and including women and children , to be shot if they attempted to return . although the german kaiser wilhelm ii and reichskanzler von bülow supposedly disagreed with this decision , they apparently also did little to stop von trotha , who was now determined to exterminate the herero , from carrying it out . those herero that were not killed where eventually put in camps that many namibians now compare to nazi concentration camps .
forced labor , disease and malnutrition took their toll .
by 1908 , when the camps were emptied , an estimated 50 to 80 percent of the entire herero population had died . like many modern historians , förster from the museum in cologne considers the herero rebellion the first genocide of the 20th century .
“ it was clearly a command to eliminate people belonging to a specific ethnic group and only because they were part of this ethnic group , ” förster said . looking for compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero woman . the herero never completely recovered from the conflict and of the around 100,000 that today live in namibia many live in poverty or work on the farms of white landowners . in 2001 , tribal leaders tried to sue germany for compensation in u.s. courts , but the claim for $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.12 billion -rrb- never went very far .
they also want reparations from deutsche bank , which allegedly profited from the forced labor in the camps . “ the war was a gruesome thing .
much blood flowed and there were many victims on both the german side and the side of the herero .
the german soldiers and settlers stole my land and my dignity and they killed my people .
something like that can never be forgotten , ” tjerimo veseevete , a 75 year-old herero man who lives not far from the waterberg near otumborombonga , told deutsche welle . germany has expressed its regret over the matter and professes it has a special responsibility is ensuring the future of namibia , but has so far stopped short of an official apology .
and since berlin is namibia ’ s single largest source of foreign aid , it also sees no need for specific financial compensation to the herero . the namibian government , which is dominated by the ovambo people , has shown little interest in backing the herero claims .

namibia on sunday marked the 100th anniversary of the herero rebellion , remembering one of the darkest chapters of germany ’ s colonial past in what was once german southwest africa . on january 11 , 1904 , herero tribal leader samuel maharero called for his people to rise up and fight against their german colonial rulers in the southwestern part of africa that would one day become modern namibia . angered by encroaching german settlers , the dividing of their land by new railroads and the decimation of their herds of cattle , the herero violently heeded that call and killed 100 german civilians and 13 soldiers in just a few days .
however , those deaths would eventually elicit a response from the germans that many herero consider tantamount to genocide . completely unprepared for the unrest , governor general theodor leutwein was unable to keep the insurrection from quickly spreading throughout the entire colony and after an unsuccessful six-month bush war the government in berlin ordered 14,000 german soldiers to the region to put down the rebellion .
heading the force was lieutenant general lothar von trotha , a man who already had a infamous reputation from other conflicts . “ you can say the whole thing became more brutal at that point , ” larissa förster , a namibia expert at the museum for ethnology in cologne , told deutsche welle . no quarter from von trotha after a decisive battle for the germans on august 12 , 1904 near the waterberg , the surviving herero fled into the omaheke desert .
what happened next still continues to haunt many herero today .
confronted with the very real possibility of dying in the desert , many hoped to surrender to the germans and head back to their lands .
but on october 2 , von trotha ordered all herero , armed or unarmed and including women and children , to be shot if they attempted to return . although the german kaiser wilhelm ii and reichskanzler von bülow supposedly disagreed with this decision , they apparently also did little to stop von trotha , who was now determined to exterminate the herero , from carrying it out . those herero that were not killed where eventually put in camps that many namibians now compare to nazi concentration camps .
forced labor , disease and malnutrition took their toll .
by 1908 , when the camps were emptied , an estimated 50 to 80 percent of the entire herero population had died . like many modern historians , förster from the museum in cologne considers the herero rebellion the first genocide of the 20th century .
“ it was clearly a command to eliminate people belonging to a specific ethnic group and only because they were part of this ethnic group , ” förster said . looking for compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero woman . the herero never completely recovered from the conflict and of the around 100,000 that today live in namibia many live in poverty or work on the farms of white landowners . in 2001 , tribal leaders tried to sue germany for compensation in u.s. courts , but the claim for $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.12 billion -rrb- never went very far .
they also want reparations from deutsche bank , which allegedly profited from the forced labor in the camps . “ the war was a gruesome thing .
much blood flowed and there were many victims on both the german side and the side of the herero .
the german soldiers and settlers stole my land and my dignity and they killed my people .
something like that can never be forgotten , ” tjerimo veseevete , a 75 year-old herero man who lives not far from the waterberg near otumborombonga , told deutsche welle . germany has expressed its regret over the matter and professes it has a special responsibility is ensuring the future of namibia , but has so far stopped short of an official apology .
and since berlin is namibia ’ s single largest source of foreign aid , it also sees no need for specific financial compensation to the herero . the namibian government , which is dominated by the ovambo people , has shown little interest in backing the herero claims .

for the first time , people convicted of violent crimes will be placed alongside sex offenders on a national register , bbc radio five live has learned .
a trial is underway in wandsworth , south london , with lancashire police set to follow suit next month .
the violent and sex offenders register , known as visor , is hailed as a major advance in tightening controls on dangerous convicts .

only those authorised to use the internet from home like civil servants , party officials and doctors will be able to do so on a regular phone line .
the bill says the state telephone company etecsa will use technical means to detect and impede access .
correspondents say the law will affect thousands of cubans who access the worldwide web from their homes .
it took effect on saturday , according to a letter sent by etecsa internet service e-net to customers .
the government says the move is necessary to " regulate dial-up access to internet navigation services , adopting measures that help protect against the taking of passwords , malicious acts , and the fraudulent and unauthorised use of this service " .
black market the cuban government passed a decree last year that the internet could only be accessed using a more expensive telephone service charged in us dollars , not generally available to ordinary cubans .
e-net customers who do not have the dollar phone service can still access the internet legally by buying special cards at etecsa offices .
some cubans also can use international email and a government-controlled intranet at work and in schools .
but until now many people have been using computers and internet accounts borrowed or bought on the black market , and it is they who will be affected by the new law .
blackout the previous system allowing access to the web granted many cubans a rare opportunity to observe western media and news reports .
global television news channels are only available at luxury hotels which are off limits to cuban citizens .
it is feared that as well as " blacking out " this window on the world , the new move to further limit web access could also damage cuba 's main source of foreign revenue : the tourism industry .
thousands of ordinary cubans have relied on the internet to advertise private accommodation for foreign tourists .

only those authorised to use the internet from home like civil servants , party officials and doctors will be able to do so on a regular phone line .
the bill says the state telephone company etecsa will use technical means to detect and impede access .
correspondents say the law will affect thousands of cubans who access the worldwide web from their homes .
it took effect on saturday , according to a letter sent by etecsa internet service e-net to customers .
the government says the move is necessary to " regulate dial-up access to internet navigation services , adopting measures that help protect against the taking of passwords , malicious acts , and the fraudulent and unauthorised use of this service " .
black market the cuban government passed a decree last year that the internet could only be accessed using a more expensive telephone service charged in us dollars , not generally available to ordinary cubans .
e-net customers who do not have the dollar phone service can still access the internet legally by buying special cards at etecsa offices .
some cubans also can use international email and a government-controlled intranet at work and in schools .

arcangel de jesus henao montoya was seized along with a number of others near the border with colombia , said panamanian police chief carlos bares .
he is wanted in the us - and the us drugs enforcement agency was involved in his capture , the police chief said .
mr henao montoya is suspected of being a leader of the norte de valle cartel , based in the colombian city of cali .
last month , colombian police said they had arrested juan carlos montoya sanchez , another suspected senior member of the cartel who is also wanted in the united states .
police arrested mr henao montoya 's brother , diego leon montoya , at about the same time .
local newspapers reported that mr leon montoya , mr henao montoya and two other norte de valle kingpins had earlier offered to surrender to colombian authorities in exchange for a promise that they would not be extradited to the united states .
' difficult catch ' mr henao montoya was arrested in the southern panama city of torti early on saturday and taken by police to the capital , panama city , along with several others .
police chief carlos bares said his capture had been " difficult work " .
" this is a significant achievement in the fight against drug trafficking , " he said .
mr henao montoya 's norte de valle organisation is thought to have taken control of segments of the international cocaine market left open by the deaths of leaders in the dominant cali cartel in the mid-1990s .
the cali cartel rose to dominate the international cocaine and heroin market after the death of drugs kingpin pablo escobar in 1993 .
colombia remains the world 's largest producer of cocaine and a major supplier of heroin to the us .
