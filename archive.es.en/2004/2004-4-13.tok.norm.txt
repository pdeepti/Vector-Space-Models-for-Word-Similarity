a month and a half after the death of president boris trajkovski in a plane crash , macedonians are to elect a new head of state .
all four candidates say they 'll embrace trajkovski 's commitment to bury ethnic enmities . the four men vying to replace boris trajkovski in wednesday 's elections all have one important thing in common with the late macedonian president , analysts say .
like him , they want to bury past ethnic divisions that nearly led the country into civil war , and focus on bringing macedonia closer in line with the european union .
up until his death in a february plane crash , trajkovski had been one of the most energetic proponents of closer ties between macedonia and europe .
he was also well-practiced at balancing the demands of macedonian hard-liners and ethnic albanian politicians . so far , the 2001 peace deal he presided over has remained in place .
the deal laid out reforms to end tensions between the two ethnic groups , making it possible to turn politicians ' attention to the country 's pressing economic problems , including a 40 percent unemployment rate . crvenkovski favored to win the next macedonian president will inherit trajkovski 's legacy .
the favored candidate is the country 's prime minister , branko crvenkovski , who represents the macedonian majority .
the post of president is largely ceremonial , so it is seen as a testament to the importance of trajkovski 's successor that crvenkovski is willing to risk his more powerful role as prime minister . crvenkovski 's campaign posters show him at the side of world leaders such as u.s. president george w. bush and u.n. secretary-general kofi annan .
his slogan reads : " branko crvenkovski : the statesman . " " we need good interethnic relations , peace and security , " he told a rally on monday .
" it means membership in nato and the european union .
let 's grab the chance . " crvenkovski 's main rival in the election is another macedonian , sasko kedev of the opposition vmro party .
though he is largely unknown , analysts have not ruled out a surprise victory for kedev , who 's been positioning himself as the " new face of macedonia . " albanian candidates ' slim hopes two ethnic albanians are also in the race , though they are reported to have little chance of winning .
ethnic albanians make up only a quarter of the population , and macedonian voters are unlikely to cross ethnic lines . another possible outcome is no outcome - at least in the first round .
for the election to be valid , the winner has to receive over 50 percent of the vote .
with four candidates , it 's likely that there will be a second round runoff between the top two candidates . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de president 's death throws pall over macedonia 's eu drive macedonian president boris trajkovski died in a plane crash over bosnia on thursday .

the german foreign ministry issued a warning on tuesday for its citizens to leave iraq as the spate of foreign kidnappings continues .
at the same time , german aid organizations completed their withdrawal from iraq . as unsubstantiated reports are circulating about the possible deaths of the two german security officials abducted in iraq last wednesday , the german foreign ministry has advised its citizens to leave iraq .
the warning comes a day after what is thought to be the last group of german humanitarian workers in iraq were pulled out of the country on monday . " german citizens are advised to leave iraq , " the foreign ministry statement warned .
" in the face of developments in the region , be advised there is also a high security risk in kuwait .
because of the situation in iraq , people are again urgently warned against travel in the neighbouring country . " the statement was issued as unconfirmed reports suggested that the two security agents from the german embassy in baghdad who went missing last week when they disappeared during a routine exchange of staff are now dead .
the men , said to be members of germany 's elite gsg-9 special forces group , were travelling from baghdad to jordan when they were ambushed by unknown assailants . missing men feared dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobias ritrath , 25 , and thomas haffenker , 38 , have been missing since wednesday .

" every foreigner is now being seen as a prime target .

around 60 germans are thought to remain in the country , most of them either journalists or people with iraqi partners .
germany has no troops deployed in iraq . as the security situation deteriorates further in iraq , other foreign aid agencies have taken the decision to suspend operations .

following a damning report on germany 's efforts to rebuild its once communist east , transportation minister manfred stolpe has proposed setting up special low wage zones in the east .
labor unions are up in arms . also charged with rebuilding germany 's five former communist eastern states , german transportation minister manfred stolpe on tuesday weighed in on the furious debate sparked by the publication of a controversial government-commissioned report last week on germany 's disastrous bid to modernize its eastern states since 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said he was in favor of setting up special low wage sectors in the eastern states , where the state would pay out a part of the salaries .
" it 's a thought that one must seriously pursue , " stolpe said in an interview with business daily handelsblatt . the minister added that the so-called wage subsidies , which would amount to welfare benefits being rebundled as cash incentives instead of as entitlements , could be tied into a law for " regions for innovation " currently being drafted by economics minister wolfgang clement .
" we must examine , how far we can get it into the program of the economics minister , " stolpe said . the " regions for innovation " law , which clement is expected to introduce this year , aims at cutting red tape and repealing certain regulations in construction and planning laws in order to boost the depressed economy in the east . proposal takes up commission 's recommendation stolpe 's plan for wage subsidies for germany 's eastern states echoes a key proposal put forth by the government-commissioned panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi last week . the commission 's report - openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the former communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 - largely concluded that the € 90 billion -lrb- $ 107.9 billion -rrb- berlin spends annually on rebuilding the so-called new federal states is wasted and that stagnant eastern germany is now dragging the wealthier west into ruin . in addition to cash incentives for guaranteed jobs , the commission also suggested a new master reconstruction plan , long-term tax relief for eastern german companies , concentration of economic aid in specific growth centers and the inclusion of at least one eastern german firm in tenders for government contracts to counter years of flawed eastern policy . fears of eu expansion stolpe has defended his plan of special low wage zones in eastern germany by pointing towards the likely consequences of the european union 's expansion in may when it takes in ten new mainly former communist eastern european countries . the minister warned that enlargement would lead to a flood of workers from neighboring eastern european countries taking up most low wage jobs in eastern germany .
stolpe pointed out that it would be an unacceptable situation , particularly because long-term unemployment in eastern germany is on the rise from year to year .
the dohnanyi report pointed out that chronically high unemployment of almost 20 percent is exacerbating the region 's problems . the minister has argued that it 's thus all the more important that workers in low cost sectors in eastern germany have the possibility of a wage supplement in addition to welfare benefits . unions irked by plan however stolpe 's proposal is expected to run into stiff opposition from the country 's powerful labor unions , many of whom fear that it would water down hard negotiated wage agreements with industries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german federation of trade unions , shot down the suggestion on tuesday .
" if special economic zones were a successful model , then eastern germany should have been a flourishing landscape in the face of lower wages and longer working hours , " sommer told daily tagesspiegel . he added that the discussion was n't just wrong , but also dangerous .
" conservative politicians want to exploit the woes of the east , to first catapult the special economic zone and then the whole country into the past , " he thundered . criticism of the plan has also emanated from german industry , which is struggling to recover from a recession . " if something is right , why should it just take place in eastern germany , " asked klaus zimmermann , president of the german institute for economic research .
" now the whole of germany is a special economic zone . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de has rebuilding east germany failed ?

lured by warm climes , pristine beaches , a striking backdrop and german beer , an increasing number of germans - not necessarily equipped with a return ticket - are heading to cape town in south africa . a leisurely read of the tabloid newspaper bild while nursing a wheat beer and chomping on a fried sausage might sound like paradise to some germans .
but take the same scene and add a bright sun , warm surf and rugged mountains , and you 'll have light-starved germans drooling at the thought . the latter is precisely what more than 100,000 germans enjoy most of the year , every year , in cape town , one of south africa 's most beautiful and relaxed cities .
they are permanent refugees from northern europe 's cold and grey and they 're leaving their stamp on the city .
cape town now hosts a thriving array of german bookshops , car dealers , travel agencies , schools , bakeries and pubs . these immigrants joined each year by another 100,000 germans who regularly flee the teutonic winter to spend the summer soaking up the south african sun .
besides them , another 140,000 visit cape town for briefer periods throughout the year .
at times , south africa 's second city has more germans than mid-sized german municipalities like bielefeld or bonn . everything just round the corner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cape town is one of the world 's most scenic spots for paragliding , drawing enthusiasts from around the world .
ralf erdner , who came to cape town ten years ago , knows why he stayed on .
" you take one step out of your office and you 're practically on vacation .
20 minutes to the next vineyard , five minutes to the beach , ten minutes to the waterfront .
it does n't matter if i want to hike , dive , sail or play golf - everything is very affordable and just a stone 's throw away , without traffic snarls and with sun , " he told deutsche welle . in addition to cape town 's climatic and culinary charms , the city 's property prices are very affordable .
in the past six years , the number of german property owners in the region has continually risen , especially since a charming cape-dutch country house costs about the same as a fashionable apartment in hamburg . business and property interests erdner 's own company in cape town , international business network , advises german investors on legal , economic and tax issues . erdner said his work had changed over the past few years .
" we used to have a huge number of people who came from germany and wanted to buy a holiday home .
and then we had those , who said , ' i want to live for six months in germany and six months in south africa . '
they wanted to make the best of both summers , " he said . once one german decided to start a business in the country , the floodgates opened as others jumped on the bandwagon . " a whole new trend has actually stemmed from it now , so we now do n't have as many property buyers , but rather more middle-sized companies who come here , " he said . a city for romantics ? german migration to cape town has a long tradition .
germans , along with the dutch and british , have been flocking to south africa 's southern tip since the 17th century , a fact that 's reflected in names of local towns such as hamburg , frankfurt or heidelberg . many germans also fought alongside the boers , south africans of dutch or huguenot descent , against the british colonizers .
migration from germany slowed during south africa 's apartheid regime and only picked up again after president mandela was elected to office following democratic elections in 1994 . stefan hippler , the priest with the german-speaking catholic community in cape town , said many germans view the city romantically . " cape town somehow seems to be the dream of sleepless nights for many germans , even for many pensioners .
it 's become a bit like a promised city where people can be happy . " but happiness is n't all that cape town is about .
it may be largely insulated from the crippling poverty and misery seen elsewhere in africa , but the paradisaical atmosphere is occasionally shaken by reports of crime and burglary . warring street gangs can draw bystanders into their paths . bavarian sausage and sunny fun however germans working in the hospitality industry in cape town are n't that much bothered by the city 's darker side . " one gets used to it , " said susanne funk , a german immigrant who runs a bed and breakfast at the foot of the tafelsberg mountain .
" you get to grips with the feeling that it 's more dangerous here .
and for me personally , all the positive experiences are so overwhelming lovely that i do n't think about going to germany . " bayreuth-born wolfgang ködel , who ensures that his german guests get enough beer on tap in his pub , is proud that he 's been able to create a slice of bavaria in africa , complete with the region 's music and food , including grilled pig 's knuckles .
" i would say that our bavarian sausage here in cape town is at least as good as in munich , " he said .
" naturally most of the guests come because of the beer and we brew our own here . " with all that hearty german food topped with enough sunshine and surf to go around , it is n't hard to understand why cape town has become such a hot destination - either permanent or part-time - for germans . funk sums up the feeling : " i look forward to my vacation in germany .

now a christian democratic politician has proposed incentives for church tax payers , in the hopes that people will stop leaving in droves . christian böhr took advantage of the easter holiday , when the churches enjoy throngs of visitors , to announce that the growing number of people opting out of the christian churches was an ominous development that had to be stopped . " leaving the church should not be a scheme to save taxes , " the christian democratic party 's deputy chairman proclaimed monday .
böhr proposed that germans be offered tax incentives so they will stay in the church .
he said catholics and protestants should be allowed to deduct 20 percent of the church tax they pay from their income tax . the government should examine his proposal , which could save easily taxpayers around € 100 -lrb- $ 119 -rrb- per year , böhr said .
the state would profit from giving church taxpayers a break .
" the churches run numerous kindergartens , hospitals , schools or social stations . "
if the churches lost funding , they would be forced to close such institutions , böhr claimed . state collection plate church tax in germany means that germans fund the country 's christian churches whether they donate to the collection plate or not .
but taxpayers can already deduct the payments on their tax declarations as expenses . germans pay 8 to 9 percent of their income tax if they are members in one of the recognized religious communities .
most germans are born into the catholic or protestant church .
they start paying church tax as soon as they start working ; parents pay church tax on their children 's behalf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishops in the cologne cathedral in 2002 , the churches received € 3.35 billion -lrb- $ 4.02 billion -rrb- in church tax revenue . the german state agreed long ago with the catholic and protestant churches that it would collect the levy and pass it on to them , and the state 's right do so is even laid out in germany 's constitution .
other religious communities can also claim a piece of the pie , as long as they are registered as statutory bodies and recognized by the individual german states , which are responsible for collecting the tax . in berlin , the old catholic church , which split from roman catholicism in the late 19th century , also receives tax revenues from its members , and in other german states confessions such as judaism get church tax money , berlin senate spokesman matthias kolbeck told dw-world .
leaving the lap of the church the only way people can avoid paying the levy is by officially getting out of the church and that 's exactly what thousands of people do each year .
only 63.8 percent of the 82 million people in germany are members of the roman catholic or protestant church , and the numbers have been dropping dramatically for years .
in 2002 over 119,000 people got out of the roman catholic church .
the most recent figures from the protestant church show that nearly 172,000 members opted out in 2001 .
from 1992 to 2001 almost 1.4 million people became former catholics and nearly 2.4 million germans left protestantism . but not everyone who leaves the church is just out to save taxes .
the badische neueste nachrichten newspaper commented on böhr 's proposal : " the 300,000 christians who turned their back on the two big christian churches … did n't all leave because of church tax , but frequently for other reasons : many view the church , especially the catholic church , as strangely out-of-touch . " and for years , critics of the tax have said that it should be transformed into a levy to benefit culture in general .
" a culture tax that everyone had to pay would be fairer in every way - potentially with the requirement that the taxpayer can designate which statutory body should receive the money , " the nürnberger zeitung paper wrote . nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tax cuts leave germans cold a poll conducted by the forsa opinion research company shows that the majority of germans do not feel that the 2004 tax cuts of € 15 billion -lrb- $ 18.3 billion -rrb- are having much effect on their disposable income .

following a damning report on germany 's efforts to rebuild its once communist east , transportation minister manfred stolpe has proposed setting up special low wage zones in the east .
labor unions are up in arms . also charged with rebuilding germany 's five former communist eastern states , german transportation minister manfred stolpe on tuesday weighed in on the furious debate sparked by the publication of a controversial government-commissioned report last week on germany 's disastrous bid to modernize its eastern states since 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said he was in favor of setting up special low wage sectors in the eastern states , where the state would pay out a part of the salaries .
" it 's a thought that one must seriously pursue , " stolpe said in an interview with business daily handelsblatt . the minister added that the so-called wage subsidies , which would amount to welfare benefits being rebundled as cash incentives instead of as entitlements , could be tied into a law for " regions for innovation " currently being drafted by economics minister wolfgang clement .
" we must examine , how far we can get it into the program of the economics minister , " stolpe said . the " regions for innovation " law , which clement is expected to introduce this year , aims at cutting red tape and repealing certain regulations in construction and planning laws in order to boost the depressed economy in the east . proposal takes up commission 's recommendation stolpe 's plan for wage subsidies for germany 's eastern states echoes a key proposal put forth by the government-commissioned panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi last week . the commission 's report - openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the former communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 - largely concluded that the € 90 billion -lrb- $ 107.9 billion -rrb- berlin spends annually on rebuilding the so-called new federal states is wasted and that stagnant eastern germany is now dragging the wealthier west into ruin . in addition to cash incentives for guaranteed jobs , the commission also suggested a new master reconstruction plan , long-term tax relief for eastern german companies , concentration of economic aid in specific growth centers and the inclusion of at least one eastern german firm in tenders for government contracts to counter years of flawed eastern policy . fears of eu expansion stolpe has defended his plan of special low wage zones in eastern germany by pointing towards the likely consequences of the european union 's expansion in may when it takes in ten new mainly former communist eastern european countries . the minister warned that enlargement would lead to a flood of workers from neighboring eastern european countries taking up most low wage jobs in eastern germany .
stolpe pointed out that it would be an unacceptable situation , particularly because long-term unemployment in eastern germany is on the rise from year to year .
the dohnanyi report pointed out that chronically high unemployment of almost 20 percent is exacerbating the region 's problems . the minister has argued that it 's thus all the more important that workers in low cost sectors in eastern germany have the possibility of a wage supplement in addition to welfare benefits . unions irked by plan however stolpe 's proposal is expected to run into stiff opposition from the country 's powerful labor unions , many of whom fear that it would water down hard negotiated wage agreements with industries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german federation of trade unions , shot down the suggestion on tuesday .
" if special economic zones were a successful model , then eastern germany should have been a flourishing landscape in the face of lower wages and longer working hours , " sommer told daily tagesspiegel . he added that the discussion was n't just wrong , but also dangerous .
" conservative politicians want to exploit the woes of the east , to first catapult the special economic zone and then the whole country into the past , " he thundered . criticism of the plan has also emanated from german industry , which is struggling to recover from a recession .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.04.2004 german life under a south african sun großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life is good down south .
lured by warm climes , pristine beaches , a striking backdrop and german beer , an increasing number of germans - not necessarily equipped with a return ticket - are heading to cape town in south africa . a leisurely read of the tabloid newspaper bild while nursing a wheat beer and chomping on a fried sausage might sound like paradise to some germans .
but take the same scene and add a bright sun , warm surf and rugged mountains , and you 'll have light-starved germans drooling at the thought . the latter is precisely what more than 100,000 germans enjoy most of the year , every year , in cape town , one of south africa 's most beautiful and relaxed cities .
they are permanent refugees from northern europe 's cold and grey and they 're leaving their stamp on the city .
cape town now hosts a thriving array of german bookshops , car dealers , travel agencies , schools , bakeries and pubs . these immigrants joined each year by another 100,000 germans who regularly flee the teutonic winter to spend the summer soaking up the south african sun .
besides them , another 140,000 visit cape town for briefer periods throughout the year .
at times , south africa 's second city has more germans than mid-sized german municipalities like bielefeld or bonn . everything just round the corner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cape town is one of the world 's most scenic spots for paragliding , drawing enthusiasts from around the world .
ralf erdner , who came to cape town ten years ago , knows why he stayed on .
" you take one step out of your office and you 're practically on vacation .
20 minutes to the next vineyard , five minutes to the beach , ten minutes to the waterfront .
it does n't matter if i want to hike , dive , sail or play golf - everything is very affordable and just a stone 's throw away , without traffic snarls and with sun , " he told deutsche welle . in addition to cape town 's climatic and culinary charms , the city 's property prices are very affordable .
in the past six years , the number of german property owners in the region has continually risen , especially since a charming cape-dutch country house costs about the same as a fashionable apartment in hamburg . business and property interests erdner 's own company in cape town , international business network , advises german investors on legal , economic and tax issues . erdner said his work had changed over the past few years .
" we used to have a huge number of people who came from germany and wanted to buy a holiday home .
and then we had those , who said , ' i want to live for six months in germany and six months in south africa . '
they wanted to make the best of both summers , " he said . once one german decided to start a business in the country , the floodgates opened as others jumped on the bandwagon . " a whole new trend has actually stemmed from it now , so we now do n't have as many property buyers , but rather more middle-sized companies who come here , " he said . a city for romantics ? german migration to cape town has a long tradition .
germans , along with the dutch and british , have been flocking to south africa 's southern tip since the 17th century , a fact that 's reflected in names of local towns such as hamburg , frankfurt or heidelberg . many germans also fought alongside the boers , south africans of dutch or huguenot descent , against the british colonizers .
migration from germany slowed during south africa 's apartheid regime and only picked up again after president mandela was elected to office following democratic elections in 1994 . stefan hippler , the priest with the german-speaking catholic community in cape town , said many germans view the city romantically . " cape town somehow seems to be the dream of sleepless nights for many germans , even for many pensioners .
it 's become a bit like a promised city where people can be happy . " but happiness is n't all that cape town is about .
it may be largely insulated from the crippling poverty and misery seen elsewhere in africa , but the paradisaical atmosphere is occasionally shaken by reports of crime and burglary . warring street gangs can draw bystanders into their paths . bavarian sausage and sunny fun however germans working in the hospitality industry in cape town are n't that much bothered by the city 's darker side . " one gets used to it , " said susanne funk , a german immigrant who runs a bed and breakfast at the foot of the tafelsberg mountain .
" you get to grips with the feeling that it 's more dangerous here .
and for me personally , all the positive experiences are so overwhelming lovely that i do n't think about going to germany . " bayreuth-born wolfgang ködel , who ensures that his german guests get enough beer on tap in his pub , is proud that he 's been able to create a slice of bavaria in africa , complete with the region 's music and food , including grilled pig 's knuckles .
" i would say that our bavarian sausage here in cape town is at least as good as in munich , " he said .
" naturally most of the guests come because of the beer and we brew our own here . " with all that hearty german food topped with enough sunshine and surf to go around , it is n't hard to understand why cape town has become such a hot destination - either permanent or part-time - for germans . funk sums up the feeling : " i look forward to my vacation in germany .
i can really enjoy it because i know that my return ticket says ' cape town .

lured by warm climes , pristine beaches , a striking backdrop and german beer , an increasing number of germans - not necessarily equipped with a return ticket - are heading to cape town in south africa . a leisurely read of the tabloid newspaper bild while nursing a wheat beer and chomping on a fried sausage might sound like paradise to some germans .
but take the same scene and add a bright sun , warm surf and rugged mountains , and you 'll have light-starved germans drooling at the thought . the latter is precisely what more than 100,000 germans enjoy most of the year , every year , in cape town , one of south africa 's most beautiful and relaxed cities .
they are permanent refugees from northern europe 's cold and grey and they 're leaving their stamp on the city .
cape town now hosts a thriving array of german bookshops , car dealers , travel agencies , schools , bakeries and pubs . these immigrants joined each year by another 100,000 germans who regularly flee the teutonic winter to spend the summer soaking up the south african sun .
besides them , another 140,000 visit cape town for briefer periods throughout the year .
at times , south africa 's second city has more germans than mid-sized german municipalities like bielefeld or bonn . everything just round the corner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cape town is one of the world 's most scenic spots for paragliding , drawing enthusiasts from around the world .
ralf erdner , who came to cape town ten years ago , knows why he stayed on .
" you take one step out of your office and you 're practically on vacation .
20 minutes to the next vineyard , five minutes to the beach , ten minutes to the waterfront .
it does n't matter if i want to hike , dive , sail or play golf - everything is very affordable and just a stone 's throw away , without traffic snarls and with sun , " he told deutsche welle . in addition to cape town 's climatic and culinary charms , the city 's property prices are very affordable .
in the past six years , the number of german property owners in the region has continually risen , especially since a charming cape-dutch country house costs about the same as a fashionable apartment in hamburg . business and property interests erdner 's own company in cape town , international business network , advises german investors on legal , economic and tax issues . erdner said his work had changed over the past few years .
" we used to have a huge number of people who came from germany and wanted to buy a holiday home .
and then we had those , who said , ' i want to live for six months in germany and six months in south africa . '
they wanted to make the best of both summers , " he said . once one german decided to start a business in the country , the floodgates opened as others jumped on the bandwagon . " a whole new trend has actually stemmed from it now , so we now do n't have as many property buyers , but rather more middle-sized companies who come here , " he said . a city for romantics ? german migration to cape town has a long tradition .
germans , along with the dutch and british , have been flocking to south africa 's southern tip since the 17th century , a fact that 's reflected in names of local towns such as hamburg , frankfurt or heidelberg . many germans also fought alongside the boers , south africans of dutch or huguenot descent , against the british colonizers .
migration from germany slowed during south africa 's apartheid regime and only picked up again after president mandela was elected to office following democratic elections in 1994 . stefan hippler , the priest with the german-speaking catholic community in cape town , said many germans view the city romantically . " cape town somehow seems to be the dream of sleepless nights for many germans , even for many pensioners .
it 's become a bit like a promised city where people can be happy . " but happiness is n't all that cape town is about .
it may be largely insulated from the crippling poverty and misery seen elsewhere in africa , but the paradisaical atmosphere is occasionally shaken by reports of crime and burglary . warring street gangs can draw bystanders into their paths . bavarian sausage and sunny fun however germans working in the hospitality industry in cape town are n't that much bothered by the city 's darker side . " one gets used to it , " said susanne funk , a german immigrant who runs a bed and breakfast at the foot of the tafelsberg mountain .
" you get to grips with the feeling that it 's more dangerous here .
and for me personally , all the positive experiences are so overwhelming lovely that i do n't think about going to germany . " bayreuth-born wolfgang ködel , who ensures that his german guests get enough beer on tap in his pub , is proud that he 's been able to create a slice of bavaria in africa , complete with the region 's music and food , including grilled pig 's knuckles .
" i would say that our bavarian sausage here in cape town is at least as good as in munich , " he said .
" naturally most of the guests come because of the beer and we brew our own here . " with all that hearty german food topped with enough sunshine and surf to go around , it is n't hard to understand why cape town has become such a hot destination - either permanent or part-time - for germans . funk sums up the feeling : " i look forward to my vacation in germany .

the wherabouts of chinese and japanese hostages remain unknown . tobias ritrath , 25 , and thomas haffenker , 38 , went missing during a routine exchange of security personnel last wednesday . iraqi insurgents are believed to have attacked the security convoy carrying the men , who are part of the elite gsg-9 unit that protects the german embassy in baghdad , as it traveled through iraq on its way from amman , jordan , to the capital .
the convoy was traveling on a highway that skirts the cities of falluja and ramadi , flashpoints in the recent uprising against foreign troops .
the car carrying the men was surrounded , but the others managed to escape and complete their trip to baghdad .
brit : i saw their bodies germany 's foreign ministry said on sunday it was " highly likely " that the men were dead .
ard reported that a grave had been found , where the two men were thought to be buried .
officials at the german embassy in baghdad had reportedly seen video footage of the corpses and recognized the two men , according to ard .
a spokeswoman for the foreign ministry refused to comment on the information .
a reporter for the british daily telegraph said he had seen the bodies of two germans who had been killed in the area .
another witness told agence france presse that the toyota landcruiser the men were believed to be traveling in had been struck by a rocket .
more foreigners abducted meanwhile , the number of foreigners kidnapped in the region rose on sunday .
the chinese foreign ministry confirmed monday that seven of its nationals had been abducted .
the men , aged between 18 and 49 , were kidnapped west of baghdad after arriving in iraq by car from jordan on sunday morning .
it was unclear monday what had happened to three japanese hostages being held by insurgents .
their release was expected sunday , and they had been reported to be in safety .
but a japanese government spokesman said on monday that the reports remained unconfirmed . the captors had said they would kill the three if tokyo did n't remove its troops from iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : released british hostage gary teeley speaks to british service personnel on monday in shaibah , iraq on his first full day of freedom after being held hostage by iraqi militia .
a british man was released sunday from his kidnappers , the british foreign office announced .
gary teeley , 37 , -lrb- photo -rrb- was safely in the care of coalition troops , the ministry said .
no details of his release were given .
teeley had been abducted by an iraqi militia on april 5 in nassiriya .
he had been working for a company from qatar at the u.s. base in the southern iraqi city .
another group of iraqi rebels announced on a video tape broadcast by al jazeera that it would release eight foreign men - three pakistanis , two turks , an indian , a nepali and a filipino .
attacks worry germans in iraq if the reports of the german security agents ' deaths are confirmed , they wo n't be the first german nationals to be killed in iraq .
in mid-march , an employee of a bremen-based firm contracted with rebuilding water supply lines in iraq was shot and killed along with a dutch colleague and their iraqi companion .
currently , an estimated 50 germans are permanently stationed in iraq - employees of firms with reconstruction contracts , journalists , diplomats and representatives of german relief organizations .
among them is alexander christoph , who heads the german organization architects for people in need .
" the only way i can explain what 's happened here , if it turns out they were actually german , is that the -lrb- attackers -rrb- were confused , because most of the kidnappings up till now have always involved members of the coalition troops , " christoph told ard in a telephone interview from baghdad .
germany and china both opposed the war in iraq and have not provided troops to coalition forces .
speaking of the consequences the disappearances could have for other german workers is in the country , christoph said it was still too early to tell .
" i ca n't really judge that right now , " he said .
" our emergency assistance and medical programs are still operating right now , but we 're not starting any new projects .
we 're going to wait and see what develops .
we have n't ruled out the possibility that the situation could get much worse than it already is .

now a christian democratic politician has proposed incentives for church tax payers , in the hopes that people will stop leaving in droves . christian böhr took advantage of the easter holiday , when the churches enjoy throngs of visitors , to announce that the growing number of people opting out of the christian churches was an ominous development that had to be stopped . " leaving the church should not be a scheme to save taxes , " the christian democratic party 's deputy chairman proclaimed monday .
böhr proposed that germans be offered tax incentives so they will stay in the church .
he said catholics and protestants should be allowed to deduct 20 percent of the church tax they pay from their income tax . the government should examine his proposal , which could save easily taxpayers around € 100 -lrb- $ 119 -rrb- per year , böhr said .
the state would profit from giving church taxpayers a break .
" the churches run numerous kindergartens , hospitals , schools or social stations . "
if the churches lost funding , they would be forced to close such institutions , böhr claimed . state collection plate church tax in germany means that germans fund the country 's christian churches whether they donate to the collection plate or not .
but taxpayers can already deduct the payments on their tax declarations as expenses . germans pay 8 to 9 percent of their income tax if they are members in one of the recognized religious communities .
most germans are born into the catholic or protestant church .
they start paying church tax as soon as they start working ; parents pay church tax on their children 's behalf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishops in the cologne cathedral in 2002 , the churches received € 3.35 billion -lrb- $ 4.02 billion -rrb- in church tax revenue . the german state agreed long ago with the catholic and protestant churches that it would collect the levy and pass it on to them , and the state 's right do so is even laid out in germany 's constitution .
other religious communities can also claim a piece of the pie , as long as they are registered as statutory bodies and recognized by the individual german states , which are responsible for collecting the tax . in berlin , the old catholic church , which split from roman catholicism in the late 19th century , also receives tax revenues from its members , and in other german states confessions such as judaism get church tax money , berlin senate spokesman matthias kolbeck told dw-world .
leaving the lap of the church the only way people can avoid paying the levy is by officially getting out of the church and that 's exactly what thousands of people do each year .
only 63.8 percent of the 82 million people in germany are members of the roman catholic or protestant church , and the numbers have been dropping dramatically for years .
in 2002 over 119,000 people got out of the roman catholic church .
the most recent figures from the protestant church show that nearly 172,000 members opted out in 2001 .
from 1992 to 2001 almost 1.4 million people became former catholics and nearly 2.4 million germans left protestantism . but not everyone who leaves the church is just out to save taxes .
the badische neueste nachrichten newspaper commented on böhr 's proposal : " the 300,000 christians who turned their back on the two big christian churches … did n't all leave because of church tax , but frequently for other reasons : many view the church , especially the catholic church , as strangely out-of-touch . " and for years , critics of the tax have said that it should be transformed into a levy to benefit culture in general .
" a culture tax that everyone had to pay would be fairer in every way - potentially with the requirement that the taxpayer can designate which statutory body should receive the money , " the nürnberger zeitung paper wrote . nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tax cuts leave germans cold a poll conducted by the forsa opinion research company shows that the majority of germans do not feel that the 2004 tax cuts of € 15 billion -lrb- $ 18.3 billion -rrb- are having much effect on their disposable income .

lured by warm climes , pristine beaches , a striking backdrop and german beer , an increasing number of germans - not necessarily equipped with a return ticket - are heading to cape town in south africa . a leisurely read of the tabloid newspaper bild while nursing a wheat beer and chomping on a fried sausage might sound like paradise to some germans .
but take the same scene and add a bright sun , warm surf and rugged mountains , and you 'll have light-starved germans drooling at the thought . the latter is precisely what more than 100,000 germans enjoy most of the year , every year , in cape town , one of south africa 's most beautiful and relaxed cities .
they are permanent refugees from northern europe 's cold and grey and they 're leaving their stamp on the city .
cape town now hosts a thriving array of german bookshops , car dealers , travel agencies , schools , bakeries and pubs . these immigrants joined each year by another 100,000 germans who regularly flee the teutonic winter to spend the summer soaking up the south african sun .
besides them , another 140,000 visit cape town for briefer periods throughout the year .
at times , south africa 's second city has more germans than mid-sized german municipalities like bielefeld or bonn . everything just round the corner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cape town is one of the world 's most scenic spots for paragliding , drawing enthusiasts from around the world .

it does n't matter if i want to hike , dive , sail or play golf - everything is very affordable and just a stone 's throw away , without traffic snarls and with sun , " he told deutsche welle . in addition to cape town 's climatic and culinary charms , the city 's property prices are very affordable .
in the past six years , the number of german property owners in the region has continually risen , especially since a charming cape-dutch country house costs about the same as a fashionable apartment in hamburg . business and property interests erdner 's own company in cape town , international business network , advises german investors on legal , economic and tax issues . erdner said his work had changed over the past few years .
" we used to have a huge number of people who came from germany and wanted to buy a holiday home .
and then we had those , who said , ' i want to live for six months in germany and six months in south africa . '
they wanted to make the best of both summers , " he said . once one german decided to start a business in the country , the floodgates opened as others jumped on the bandwagon . " a whole new trend has actually stemmed from it now , so we now do n't have as many property buyers , but rather more middle-sized companies who come here , " he said . a city for romantics ? german migration to cape town has a long tradition .
germans , along with the dutch and british , have been flocking to south africa 's southern tip since the 17th century , a fact that 's reflected in names of local towns such as hamburg , frankfurt or heidelberg . many germans also fought alongside the boers , south africans of dutch or huguenot descent , against the british colonizers .
migration from germany slowed during south africa 's apartheid regime and only picked up again after president mandela was elected to office following democratic elections in 1994 . stefan hippler , the priest with the german-speaking catholic community in cape town , said many germans view the city romantically . " cape town somehow seems to be the dream of sleepless nights for many germans , even for many pensioners .
it 's become a bit like a promised city where people can be happy . " but happiness is n't all that cape town is about .
it may be largely insulated from the crippling poverty and misery seen elsewhere in africa , but the paradisaical atmosphere is occasionally shaken by reports of crime and burglary . warring street gangs can draw bystanders into their paths . bavarian sausage and sunny fun however germans working in the hospitality industry in cape town are n't that much bothered by the city 's darker side . " one gets used to it , " said susanne funk , a german immigrant who runs a bed and breakfast at the foot of the tafelsberg mountain .
" you get to grips with the feeling that it 's more dangerous here .
and for me personally , all the positive experiences are so overwhelming lovely that i do n't think about going to germany . " bayreuth-born wolfgang ködel , who ensures that his german guests get enough beer on tap in his pub , is proud that he 's been able to create a slice of bavaria in africa , complete with the region 's music and food , including grilled pig 's knuckles .
" i would say that our bavarian sausage here in cape town is at least as good as in munich , " he said .
" naturally most of the guests come because of the beer and we brew our own here . " with all that hearty german food topped with enough sunshine and surf to go around , it is n't hard to understand why cape town has become such a hot destination - either permanent or part-time - for germans . funk sums up the feeling : " i look forward to my vacation in germany .

following a damning report on germany 's efforts to rebuild its once communist east , transportation minister manfred stolpe has proposed setting up special low wage zones in the east .
labor unions are up in arms . also charged with rebuilding germany 's five former communist eastern states , german transportation minister manfred stolpe on tuesday weighed in on the furious debate sparked by the publication of a controversial government-commissioned report last week on germany 's disastrous bid to modernize its eastern states since 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said he was in favor of setting up special low wage sectors in the eastern states , where the state would pay out a part of the salaries .
" it 's a thought that one must seriously pursue , " stolpe said in an interview with business daily handelsblatt . the minister added that the so-called wage subsidies , which would amount to welfare benefits being rebundled as cash incentives instead of as entitlements , could be tied into a law for " regions for innovation " currently being drafted by economics minister wolfgang clement .
" we must examine , how far we can get it into the program of the economics minister , " stolpe said . the " regions for innovation " law , which clement is expected to introduce this year , aims at cutting red tape and repealing certain regulations in construction and planning laws in order to boost the depressed economy in the east . proposal takes up commission 's recommendation stolpe 's plan for wage subsidies for germany 's eastern states echoes a key proposal put forth by the government-commissioned panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi last week . the commission 's report - openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the former communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 - largely concluded that the € 90 billion -lrb- $ 107.9 billion -rrb- berlin spends annually on rebuilding the so-called new federal states is wasted and that stagnant eastern germany is now dragging the wealthier west into ruin . in addition to cash incentives for guaranteed jobs , the commission also suggested a new master reconstruction plan , long-term tax relief for eastern german companies , concentration of economic aid in specific growth centers and the inclusion of at least one eastern german firm in tenders for government contracts to counter years of flawed eastern policy . fears of eu expansion stolpe has defended his plan of special low wage zones in eastern germany by pointing towards the likely consequences of the european union 's expansion in may when it takes in ten new mainly former communist eastern european countries . the minister warned that enlargement would lead to a flood of workers from neighboring eastern european countries taking up most low wage jobs in eastern germany .
stolpe pointed out that it would be an unacceptable situation , particularly because long-term unemployment in eastern germany is on the rise from year to year .
the dohnanyi report pointed out that chronically high unemployment of almost 20 percent is exacerbating the region 's problems . the minister has argued that it 's thus all the more important that workers in low cost sectors in eastern germany have the possibility of a wage supplement in addition to welfare benefits . unions irked by plan however stolpe 's proposal is expected to run into stiff opposition from the country 's powerful labor unions , many of whom fear that it would water down hard negotiated wage agreements with industries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german federation of trade unions , shot down the suggestion on tuesday .
" if special economic zones were a successful model , then eastern germany should have been a flourishing landscape in the face of lower wages and longer working hours , " sommer told daily tagesspiegel . he added that the discussion was n't just wrong , but also dangerous .
" conservative politicians want to exploit the woes of the east , to first catapult the special economic zone and then the whole country into the past , " he thundered . criticism of the plan has also emanated from german industry , which is struggling to recover from a recession . " if something is right , why should it just take place in eastern germany , " asked klaus zimmermann , president of the german institute for economic research .
" now the whole of germany is a special economic zone . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de has rebuilding east germany failed ?

following a damning report on germany 's efforts to rebuild its once communist east , transportation minister manfred stolpe has proposed setting up special low wage zones in the east .
labor unions are up in arms . also charged with rebuilding germany 's five former communist eastern states , german transportation minister manfred stolpe on tuesday weighed in on the furious debate sparked by the publication of a controversial government-commissioned report last week on germany 's disastrous bid to modernize its eastern states since 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said he was in favor of setting up special low wage sectors in the eastern states , where the state would pay out a part of the salaries .
" it 's a thought that one must seriously pursue , " stolpe said in an interview with business daily handelsblatt . the minister added that the so-called wage subsidies , which would amount to welfare benefits being rebundled as cash incentives instead of as entitlements , could be tied into a law for " regions for innovation " currently being drafted by economics minister wolfgang clement .
" we must examine , how far we can get it into the program of the economics minister , " stolpe said . the " regions for innovation " law , which clement is expected to introduce this year , aims at cutting red tape and repealing certain regulations in construction and planning laws in order to boost the depressed economy in the east . proposal takes up commission 's recommendation stolpe 's plan for wage subsidies for germany 's eastern states echoes a key proposal put forth by the government-commissioned panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi last week . the commission 's report - openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the former communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 - largely concluded that the € 90 billion -lrb- $ 107.9 billion -rrb- berlin spends annually on rebuilding the so-called new federal states is wasted and that stagnant eastern germany is now dragging the wealthier west into ruin . in addition to cash incentives for guaranteed jobs , the commission also suggested a new master reconstruction plan , long-term tax relief for eastern german companies , concentration of economic aid in specific growth centers and the inclusion of at least one eastern german firm in tenders for government contracts to counter years of flawed eastern policy . fears of eu expansion stolpe has defended his plan of special low wage zones in eastern germany by pointing towards the likely consequences of the european union 's expansion in may when it takes in ten new mainly former communist eastern european countries . the minister warned that enlargement would lead to a flood of workers from neighboring eastern european countries taking up most low wage jobs in eastern germany .
stolpe pointed out that it would be an unacceptable situation , particularly because long-term unemployment in eastern germany is on the rise from year to year .
the dohnanyi report pointed out that chronically high unemployment of almost 20 percent is exacerbating the region 's problems . the minister has argued that it 's thus all the more important that workers in low cost sectors in eastern germany have the possibility of a wage supplement in addition to welfare benefits . unions irked by plan however stolpe 's proposal is expected to run into stiff opposition from the country 's powerful labor unions , many of whom fear that it would water down hard negotiated wage agreements with industries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german federation of trade unions , shot down the suggestion on tuesday .
" if special economic zones were a successful model , then eastern germany should have been a flourishing landscape in the face of lower wages and longer working hours , " sommer told daily tagesspiegel . he added that the discussion was n't just wrong , but also dangerous .
" conservative politicians want to exploit the woes of the east , to first catapult the special economic zone and then the whole country into the past , " he thundered . criticism of the plan has also emanated from german industry , which is struggling to recover from a recession . " if something is right , why should it just take place in eastern germany , " asked klaus zimmermann , president of the german institute for economic research .
" now the whole of germany is a special economic zone . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de has rebuilding east germany failed ?

lured by warm climes , pristine beaches , a striking backdrop and german beer , an increasing number of germans - not necessarily equipped with a return ticket - are heading to cape town in south africa . a leisurely read of the tabloid newspaper bild while nursing a wheat beer and chomping on a fried sausage might sound like paradise to some germans .
but take the same scene and add a bright sun , warm surf and rugged mountains , and you 'll have light-starved germans drooling at the thought . the latter is precisely what more than 100,000 germans enjoy most of the year , every year , in cape town , one of south africa 's most beautiful and relaxed cities .
they are permanent refugees from northern europe 's cold and grey and they 're leaving their stamp on the city .
cape town now hosts a thriving array of german bookshops , car dealers , travel agencies , schools , bakeries and pubs . these immigrants joined each year by another 100,000 germans who regularly flee the teutonic winter to spend the summer soaking up the south african sun .
besides them , another 140,000 visit cape town for briefer periods throughout the year .
at times , south africa 's second city has more germans than mid-sized german municipalities like bielefeld or bonn . everything just round the corner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cape town is one of the world 's most scenic spots for paragliding , drawing enthusiasts from around the world .
ralf erdner , who came to cape town ten years ago , knows why he stayed on .
" you take one step out of your office and you 're practically on vacation .
20 minutes to the next vineyard , five minutes to the beach , ten minutes to the waterfront .
it does n't matter if i want to hike , dive , sail or play golf - everything is very affordable and just a stone 's throw away , without traffic snarls and with sun , " he told deutsche welle . in addition to cape town 's climatic and culinary charms , the city 's property prices are very affordable .
in the past six years , the number of german property owners in the region has continually risen , especially since a charming cape-dutch country house costs about the same as a fashionable apartment in hamburg . business and property interests erdner 's own company in cape town , international business network , advises german investors on legal , economic and tax issues . erdner said his work had changed over the past few years .
" we used to have a huge number of people who came from germany and wanted to buy a holiday home .
and then we had those , who said , ' i want to live for six months in germany and six months in south africa . '
they wanted to make the best of both summers , " he said . once one german decided to start a business in the country , the floodgates opened as others jumped on the bandwagon . " a whole new trend has actually stemmed from it now , so we now do n't have as many property buyers , but rather more middle-sized companies who come here , " he said . a city for romantics ? german migration to cape town has a long tradition .
germans , along with the dutch and british , have been flocking to south africa 's southern tip since the 17th century , a fact that 's reflected in names of local towns such as hamburg , frankfurt or heidelberg . many germans also fought alongside the boers , south africans of dutch or huguenot descent , against the british colonizers .
migration from germany slowed during south africa 's apartheid regime and only picked up again after president mandela was elected to office following democratic elections in 1994 . stefan hippler , the priest with the german-speaking catholic community in cape town , said many germans view the city romantically . " cape town somehow seems to be the dream of sleepless nights for many germans , even for many pensioners .
it 's become a bit like a promised city where people can be happy . " but happiness is n't all that cape town is about .
it may be largely insulated from the crippling poverty and misery seen elsewhere in africa , but the paradisaical atmosphere is occasionally shaken by reports of crime and burglary . warring street gangs can draw bystanders into their paths . bavarian sausage and sunny fun however germans working in the hospitality industry in cape town are n't that much bothered by the city 's darker side . " one gets used to it , " said susanne funk , a german immigrant who runs a bed and breakfast at the foot of the tafelsberg mountain .
" you get to grips with the feeling that it 's more dangerous here .
and for me personally , all the positive experiences are so overwhelming lovely that i do n't think about going to germany . " bayreuth-born wolfgang ködel , who ensures that his german guests get enough beer on tap in his pub , is proud that he 's been able to create a slice of bavaria in africa , complete with the region 's music and food , including grilled pig 's knuckles .
" i would say that our bavarian sausage here in cape town is at least as good as in munich , " he said .
" naturally most of the guests come because of the beer and we brew our own here . " with all that hearty german food topped with enough sunshine and surf to go around , it is n't hard to understand why cape town has become such a hot destination - either permanent or part-time - for germans . funk sums up the feeling : " i look forward to my vacation in germany .

the german foreign ministry issued a warning on tuesday for its citizens to leave iraq as the spate of foreign kidnappings continues .
at the same time , german aid organizations completed their withdrawal from iraq . as unsubstantiated reports are circulating about the possible deaths of the two german security officials abducted in iraq last wednesday , the german foreign ministry has advised its citizens to leave iraq .
the warning comes a day after what is thought to be the last group of german humanitarian workers in iraq were pulled out of the country on monday . " german citizens are advised to leave iraq , " the foreign ministry statement warned .
" in the face of developments in the region , be advised there is also a high security risk in kuwait .
because of the situation in iraq , people are again urgently warned against travel in the neighbouring country .

" leaving the church should not be a scheme to save taxes , " the christian democratic party 's deputy chairman proclaimed monday .
böhr proposed that germans be offered tax incentives so they will stay in the church .
he said catholics and protestants should be allowed to deduct 20 percent of the church tax they pay from their income tax . the government should examine his proposal , which could save easily taxpayers around € 100 -lrb- $ 119 -rrb- per year , böhr said .
the state would profit from giving church taxpayers a break .

leaving the lap of the church the only way people can avoid paying the levy is by officially getting out of the church and that 's exactly what thousands of people do each year .
only 63.8 percent of the 82 million people in germany are members of the roman catholic or protestant church , and the numbers have been dropping dramatically for years .
in 2002 over 119,000 people got out of the roman catholic church .

from 1992 to 2001 almost 1.4 million people became former catholics and nearly 2.4 million germans left protestantism . but not everyone who leaves the church is just out to save taxes .

now a christian democratic politician has proposed incentives for church tax payers , in the hopes that people will stop leaving in droves . christian böhr took advantage of the easter holiday , when the churches enjoy throngs of visitors , to announce that the growing number of people opting out of the christian churches was an ominous development that had to be stopped . " leaving the church should not be a scheme to save taxes , " the christian democratic party 's deputy chairman proclaimed monday .
böhr proposed that germans be offered tax incentives so they will stay in the church .
he said catholics and protestants should be allowed to deduct 20 percent of the church tax they pay from their income tax . the government should examine his proposal , which could save easily taxpayers around € 100 -lrb- $ 119 -rrb- per year , böhr said .
the state would profit from giving church taxpayers a break .
" the churches run numerous kindergartens , hospitals , schools or social stations . "
if the churches lost funding , they would be forced to close such institutions , böhr claimed . state collection plate church tax in germany means that germans fund the country 's christian churches whether they donate to the collection plate or not .
but taxpayers can already deduct the payments on their tax declarations as expenses . germans pay 8 to 9 percent of their income tax if they are members in one of the recognized religious communities .
most germans are born into the catholic or protestant church .
they start paying church tax as soon as they start working ; parents pay church tax on their children 's behalf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishops in the cologne cathedral in 2002 , the churches received € 3.35 billion -lrb- $ 4.02 billion -rrb- in church tax revenue . the german state agreed long ago with the catholic and protestant churches that it would collect the levy and pass it on to them , and the state 's right do so is even laid out in germany 's constitution .
other religious communities can also claim a piece of the pie , as long as they are registered as statutory bodies and recognized by the individual german states , which are responsible for collecting the tax . in berlin , the old catholic church , which split from roman catholicism in the late 19th century , also receives tax revenues from its members , and in other german states confessions such as judaism get church tax money , berlin senate spokesman matthias kolbeck told dw-world .
leaving the lap of the church the only way people can avoid paying the levy is by officially getting out of the church and that 's exactly what thousands of people do each year .
only 63.8 percent of the 82 million people in germany are members of the roman catholic or protestant church , and the numbers have been dropping dramatically for years .
in 2002 over 119,000 people got out of the roman catholic church .
the most recent figures from the protestant church show that nearly 172,000 members opted out in 2001 .
from 1992 to 2001 almost 1.4 million people became former catholics and nearly 2.4 million germans left protestantism . but not everyone who leaves the church is just out to save taxes .
the badische neueste nachrichten newspaper commented on böhr 's proposal : " the 300,000 christians who turned their back on the two big christian churches … did n't all leave because of church tax , but frequently for other reasons : many view the church , especially the catholic church , as strangely out-of-touch . " and for years , critics of the tax have said that it should be transformed into a levy to benefit culture in general .
" a culture tax that everyone had to pay would be fairer in every way - potentially with the requirement that the taxpayer can designate which statutory body should receive the money , " the nürnberger zeitung paper wrote . nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tax cuts leave germans cold a poll conducted by the forsa opinion research company shows that the majority of germans do not feel that the 2004 tax cuts of € 15 billion -lrb- $ 18.3 billion -rrb- are having much effect on their disposable income .

following a damning report on germany 's efforts to rebuild its once communist east , transportation minister manfred stolpe has proposed setting up special low wage zones in the east .
labor unions are up in arms . also charged with rebuilding germany 's five former communist eastern states , german transportation minister manfred stolpe on tuesday weighed in on the furious debate sparked by the publication of a controversial government-commissioned report last week on germany 's disastrous bid to modernize its eastern states since 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said he was in favor of setting up special low wage sectors in the eastern states , where the state would pay out a part of the salaries .
" it 's a thought that one must seriously pursue , " stolpe said in an interview with business daily handelsblatt . the minister added that the so-called wage subsidies , which would amount to welfare benefits being rebundled as cash incentives instead of as entitlements , could be tied into a law for " regions for innovation " currently being drafted by economics minister wolfgang clement .
" we must examine , how far we can get it into the program of the economics minister , " stolpe said . the " regions for innovation " law , which clement is expected to introduce this year , aims at cutting red tape and repealing certain regulations in construction and planning laws in order to boost the depressed economy in the east . proposal takes up commission 's recommendation stolpe 's plan for wage subsidies for germany 's eastern states echoes a key proposal put forth by the government-commissioned panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi last week . the commission 's report - openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the former communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 - largely concluded that the € 90 billion -lrb- $ 107.9 billion -rrb- berlin spends annually on rebuilding the so-called new federal states is wasted and that stagnant eastern germany is now dragging the wealthier west into ruin . in addition to cash incentives for guaranteed jobs , the commission also suggested a new master reconstruction plan , long-term tax relief for eastern german companies , concentration of economic aid in specific growth centers and the inclusion of at least one eastern german firm in tenders for government contracts to counter years of flawed eastern policy . fears of eu expansion stolpe has defended his plan of special low wage zones in eastern germany by pointing towards the likely consequences of the european union 's expansion in may when it takes in ten new mainly former communist eastern european countries . the minister warned that enlargement would lead to a flood of workers from neighboring eastern european countries taking up most low wage jobs in eastern germany .
stolpe pointed out that it would be an unacceptable situation , particularly because long-term unemployment in eastern germany is on the rise from year to year .
the dohnanyi report pointed out that chronically high unemployment of almost 20 percent is exacerbating the region 's problems . the minister has argued that it 's thus all the more important that workers in low cost sectors in eastern germany have the possibility of a wage supplement in addition to welfare benefits . unions irked by plan however stolpe 's proposal is expected to run into stiff opposition from the country 's powerful labor unions , many of whom fear that it would water down hard negotiated wage agreements with industries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german federation of trade unions , shot down the suggestion on tuesday .
" if special economic zones were a successful model , then eastern germany should have been a flourishing landscape in the face of lower wages and longer working hours , " sommer told daily tagesspiegel . he added that the discussion was n't just wrong , but also dangerous .
" conservative politicians want to exploit the woes of the east , to first catapult the special economic zone and then the whole country into the past , " he thundered . criticism of the plan has also emanated from german industry , which is struggling to recover from a recession . " if something is right , why should it just take place in eastern germany , " asked klaus zimmermann , president of the german institute for economic research .

a month and a half after the death of president boris trajkovski in a plane crash , macedonians are to elect a new head of state .
all four candidates say they 'll embrace trajkovski 's commitment to bury ethnic enmities . the four men vying to replace boris trajkovski in wednesday 's elections all have one important thing in common with the late macedonian president , analysts say .
like him , they want to bury past ethnic divisions that nearly led the country into civil war , and focus on bringing macedonia closer in line with the european union .
up until his death in a february plane crash , trajkovski had been one of the most energetic proponents of closer ties between macedonia and europe .
he was also well-practiced at balancing the demands of macedonian hard-liners and ethnic albanian politicians . so far , the 2001 peace deal he presided over has remained in place .
the deal laid out reforms to end tensions between the two ethnic groups , making it possible to turn politicians ' attention to the country 's pressing economic problems , including a 40 percent unemployment rate . crvenkovski favored to win the next macedonian president will inherit trajkovski 's legacy .
the favored candidate is the country 's prime minister , branko crvenkovski , who represents the macedonian majority .
the post of president is largely ceremonial , so it is seen as a testament to the importance of trajkovski 's successor that crvenkovski is willing to risk his more powerful role as prime minister . crvenkovski 's campaign posters show him at the side of world leaders such as u.s. president george w. bush and u.n. secretary-general kofi annan .
his slogan reads : " branko crvenkovski : the statesman . " " we need good interethnic relations , peace and security , " he told a rally on monday .
" it means membership in nato and the european union .
let 's grab the chance . " crvenkovski 's main rival in the election is another macedonian , sasko kedev of the opposition vmro party .
though he is largely unknown , analysts have not ruled out a surprise victory for kedev , who 's been positioning himself as the " new face of macedonia . " albanian candidates ' slim hopes two ethnic albanians are also in the race , though they are reported to have little chance of winning .
ethnic albanians make up only a quarter of the population , and macedonian voters are unlikely to cross ethnic lines . another possible outcome is no outcome - at least in the first round .
for the election to be valid , the winner has to receive over 50 percent of the vote .
with four candidates , it 's likely that there will be a second round runoff between the top two candidates . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de president 's death throws pall over macedonia 's eu drive macedonian president boris trajkovski died in a plane crash over bosnia on thursday .

the german foreign ministry issued a warning on tuesday for its citizens to leave iraq as the spate of foreign kidnappings continues .
at the same time , german aid organizations completed their withdrawal from iraq . as unsubstantiated reports are circulating about the possible deaths of the two german security officials abducted in iraq last wednesday , the german foreign ministry has advised its citizens to leave iraq .
the warning comes a day after what is thought to be the last group of german humanitarian workers in iraq were pulled out of the country on monday . " german citizens are advised to leave iraq , " the foreign ministry statement warned .
" in the face of developments in the region , be advised there is also a high security risk in kuwait .
because of the situation in iraq , people are again urgently warned against travel in the neighbouring country . " the statement was issued as unconfirmed reports suggested that the two security agents from the german embassy in baghdad who went missing last week when they disappeared during a routine exchange of staff are now dead .
the men , said to be members of germany 's elite gsg-9 special forces group , were travelling from baghdad to jordan when they were ambushed by unknown assailants . missing men feared dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobias ritrath , 25 , and thomas haffenker , 38 , have been missing since wednesday .
since no kidnap claim has been issued , the german foreign ministry concluded that the men , identified in german media reports as tobias ritrath , 25 , and thomas haffenker , 38 , may have been killed during the attack near the sunni town of falluja , the scene of the recent uprising 's most violent escalations . a reporter for the london-based daily telegraph newspaper in the city has said he saw the bodies of two germans in the area while germany 's ard television reported on monday that the german embassy in baghdad had received a videotape showing the corpses of two men which staffers had identified as the missing security officials . aid agencies pull out last remaining staff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunni insurgents guard in fallujah .
meanwhile , german aid organizations evacuated their last four workers from iraq on monday due to the deteriorating security situation , a spokesman for " aktion deutschland hilft " told reporters .
wolfgang nierwetberg of the bonn-based agency said that the last four members of a 10-person team removing munitions from residential areas left baghdad on a u.n. aircraft for amman .
" every foreigner is now being seen as a prime target .
the danger has become too high , " nierwetberg said . forty-five iraqi workers assisting the group in its project to clear mines , reopen channels of food distribution and install water purification systems have stayed in place in an attempt to continue the german organization 's work in baghdad . all german charity workers are now thought to have pulled out of iraq .
around 60 germans are thought to remain in the country , most of them either journalists or people with iraqi partners .
germany has no troops deployed in iraq . as the security situation deteriorates further in iraq , other foreign aid agencies have taken the decision to suspend operations .
on friday , french group premiere urgence , one of the few charities still operating in iraq , also put its work on hold .
" premiere urgence is alarmed at the chaos into which iraq has plunged and is provisionally suspending its activities , " the organization said in a statement . abduction a growing threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrator holds a poster with pictures of the japanese hostages held by militants in iraq .
the growing unrest has increased the danger of the situation for foreigners in iraq .
several foreigners have been taken hostage on the dangerous route between baghdad and amman which passes by falluja , where a sunni insurgency against u.s. forces intensified this week .
fighting has been heavy in iraq in the past week , and several civilians have either been kidnapped or killed . there are fears for two czechs , reportedly television journalists , after a taxi firm told afp news agency they were abducted en route to jordan and also for the japanese hostages who were taken last week and whose fate remains unknown .
on tuesday , at least eight russian engineers were kidnapped as they relaxed in the courtyard of their house in the iraqi capital .
the men have since been released again , russian news agency interfax reported on tuesday . seven chinese men kidnapped on sunday near falluja were released on tuesday . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de missing germans believed dead the latest violence in iraq is thought to have claimed the lives of two germans , the foreign ministry said .

lured by warm climes , pristine beaches , a striking backdrop and german beer , an increasing number of germans - not necessarily equipped with a return ticket - are heading to cape town in south africa . a leisurely read of the tabloid newspaper bild while nursing a wheat beer and chomping on a fried sausage might sound like paradise to some germans .
but take the same scene and add a bright sun , warm surf and rugged mountains , and you 'll have light-starved germans drooling at the thought . the latter is precisely what more than 100,000 germans enjoy most of the year , every year , in cape town , one of south africa 's most beautiful and relaxed cities .
they are permanent refugees from northern europe 's cold and grey and they 're leaving their stamp on the city .
cape town now hosts a thriving array of german bookshops , car dealers , travel agencies , schools , bakeries and pubs . these immigrants joined each year by another 100,000 germans who regularly flee the teutonic winter to spend the summer soaking up the south african sun .
besides them , another 140,000 visit cape town for briefer periods throughout the year .
at times , south africa 's second city has more germans than mid-sized german municipalities like bielefeld or bonn . everything just round the corner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cape town is one of the world 's most scenic spots for paragliding , drawing enthusiasts from around the world .
ralf erdner , who came to cape town ten years ago , knows why he stayed on .
" you take one step out of your office and you 're practically on vacation .
20 minutes to the next vineyard , five minutes to the beach , ten minutes to the waterfront .
it does n't matter if i want to hike , dive , sail or play golf - everything is very affordable and just a stone 's throw away , without traffic snarls and with sun , " he told deutsche welle . in addition to cape town 's climatic and culinary charms , the city 's property prices are very affordable .
in the past six years , the number of german property owners in the region has continually risen , especially since a charming cape-dutch country house costs about the same as a fashionable apartment in hamburg . business and property interests erdner 's own company in cape town , international business network , advises german investors on legal , economic and tax issues . erdner said his work had changed over the past few years .
" we used to have a huge number of people who came from germany and wanted to buy a holiday home .
and then we had those , who said , ' i want to live for six months in germany and six months in south africa . '
they wanted to make the best of both summers , " he said . once one german decided to start a business in the country , the floodgates opened as others jumped on the bandwagon .

the german foreign ministry issued a warning on tuesday for its citizens to leave iraq as the spate of foreign kidnappings continues .
at the same time , german aid organizations completed their withdrawal from iraq . as unsubstantiated reports are circulating about the possible deaths of the two german security officials abducted in iraq last wednesday , the german foreign ministry has advised its citizens to leave iraq .
the warning comes a day after what is thought to be the last group of german humanitarian workers in iraq were pulled out of the country on monday . " german citizens are advised to leave iraq , " the foreign ministry statement warned .
" in the face of developments in the region , be advised there is also a high security risk in kuwait .
because of the situation in iraq , people are again urgently warned against travel in the neighbouring country . " the statement was issued as unconfirmed reports suggested that the two security agents from the german embassy in baghdad who went missing last week when they disappeared during a routine exchange of staff are now dead .
the men , said to be members of germany 's elite gsg-9 special forces group , were travelling from baghdad to jordan when they were ambushed by unknown assailants . missing men feared dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobias ritrath , 25 , and thomas haffenker , 38 , have been missing since wednesday .
since no kidnap claim has been issued , the german foreign ministry concluded that the men , identified in german media reports as tobias ritrath , 25 , and thomas haffenker , 38 , may have been killed during the attack near the sunni town of falluja , the scene of the recent uprising 's most violent escalations . a reporter for the london-based daily telegraph newspaper in the city has said he saw the bodies of two germans in the area while germany 's ard television reported on monday that the german embassy in baghdad had received a videotape showing the corpses of two men which staffers had identified as the missing security officials . aid agencies pull out last remaining staff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunni insurgents guard in fallujah .
meanwhile , german aid organizations evacuated their last four workers from iraq on monday due to the deteriorating security situation , a spokesman for " aktion deutschland hilft " told reporters .
wolfgang nierwetberg of the bonn-based agency said that the last four members of a 10-person team removing munitions from residential areas left baghdad on a u.n. aircraft for amman .
" every foreigner is now being seen as a prime target .
the danger has become too high , " nierwetberg said . forty-five iraqi workers assisting the group in its project to clear mines , reopen channels of food distribution and install water purification systems have stayed in place in an attempt to continue the german organization 's work in baghdad . all german charity workers are now thought to have pulled out of iraq .
around 60 germans are thought to remain in the country , most of them either journalists or people with iraqi partners .
germany has no troops deployed in iraq . as the security situation deteriorates further in iraq , other foreign aid agencies have taken the decision to suspend operations .
on friday , french group premiere urgence , one of the few charities still operating in iraq , also put its work on hold .
" premiere urgence is alarmed at the chaos into which iraq has plunged and is provisionally suspending its activities , " the organization said in a statement . abduction a growing threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrator holds a poster with pictures of the japanese hostages held by militants in iraq .
the growing unrest has increased the danger of the situation for foreigners in iraq .

fighting has been heavy in iraq in the past week , and several civilians have either been kidnapped or killed . there are fears for two czechs , reportedly television journalists , after a taxi firm told afp news agency they were abducted en route to jordan and also for the japanese hostages who were taken last week and whose fate remains unknown .

böhr proposed that germans be offered tax incentives so they will stay in the church .
he said catholics and protestants should be allowed to deduct 20 percent of the church tax they pay from their income tax . the government should examine his proposal , which could save easily taxpayers around € 100 -lrb- $ 119 -rrb- per year , böhr said .

now a christian democratic politician has proposed incentives for church tax payers , in the hopes that people will stop leaving in droves . christian böhr took advantage of the easter holiday , when the churches enjoy throngs of visitors , to announce that the growing number of people opting out of the christian churches was an ominous development that had to be stopped . " leaving the church should not be a scheme to save taxes , " the christian democratic party 's deputy chairman proclaimed monday .
böhr proposed that germans be offered tax incentives so they will stay in the church .
he said catholics and protestants should be allowed to deduct 20 percent of the church tax they pay from their income tax . the government should examine his proposal , which could save easily taxpayers around € 100 -lrb- $ 119 -rrb- per year , böhr said .
the state would profit from giving church taxpayers a break .
" the churches run numerous kindergartens , hospitals , schools or social stations . "
if the churches lost funding , they would be forced to close such institutions , böhr claimed . state collection plate church tax in germany means that germans fund the country 's christian churches whether they donate to the collection plate or not .
but taxpayers can already deduct the payments on their tax declarations as expenses . germans pay 8 to 9 percent of their income tax if they are members in one of the recognized religious communities .
most germans are born into the catholic or protestant church .
they start paying church tax as soon as they start working ; parents pay church tax on their children 's behalf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishops in the cologne cathedral in 2002 , the churches received € 3.35 billion -lrb- $ 4.02 billion -rrb- in church tax revenue . the german state agreed long ago with the catholic and protestant churches that it would collect the levy and pass it on to them , and the state 's right do so is even laid out in germany 's constitution .

only 63.8 percent of the 82 million people in germany are members of the roman catholic or protestant church , and the numbers have been dropping dramatically for years .
in 2002 over 119,000 people got out of the roman catholic church .
the most recent figures from the protestant church show that nearly 172,000 members opted out in 2001 .
from 1992 to 2001 almost 1.4 million people became former catholics and nearly 2.4 million germans left protestantism . but not everyone who leaves the church is just out to save taxes .
the badische neueste nachrichten newspaper commented on böhr 's proposal : " the 300,000 christians who turned their back on the two big christian churches … did n't all leave because of church tax , but frequently for other reasons : many view the church , especially the catholic church , as strangely out-of-touch . " and for years , critics of the tax have said that it should be transformed into a levy to benefit culture in general .

the wherabouts of chinese and japanese hostages remain unknown . tobias ritrath , 25 , and thomas haffenker , 38 , went missing during a routine exchange of security personnel last wednesday . iraqi insurgents are believed to have attacked the security convoy carrying the men , who are part of the elite gsg-9 unit that protects the german embassy in baghdad , as it traveled through iraq on its way from amman , jordan , to the capital .
the convoy was traveling on a highway that skirts the cities of falluja and ramadi , flashpoints in the recent uprising against foreign troops .
the car carrying the men was surrounded , but the others managed to escape and complete their trip to baghdad .
brit : i saw their bodies germany 's foreign ministry said on sunday it was " highly likely " that the men were dead .
ard reported that a grave had been found , where the two men were thought to be buried .
officials at the german embassy in baghdad had reportedly seen video footage of the corpses and recognized the two men , according to ard .
a spokeswoman for the foreign ministry refused to comment on the information .
a reporter for the british daily telegraph said he had seen the bodies of two germans who had been killed in the area .
another witness told agence france presse that the toyota landcruiser the men were believed to be traveling in had been struck by a rocket .
more foreigners abducted meanwhile , the number of foreigners kidnapped in the region rose on sunday .
the chinese foreign ministry confirmed monday that seven of its nationals had been abducted .
the men , aged between 18 and 49 , were kidnapped west of baghdad after arriving in iraq by car from jordan on sunday morning .
it was unclear monday what had happened to three japanese hostages being held by insurgents .
their release was expected sunday , and they had been reported to be in safety .
but a japanese government spokesman said on monday that the reports remained unconfirmed . the captors had said they would kill the three if tokyo did n't remove its troops from iraq .

currently , an estimated 50 germans are permanently stationed in iraq - employees of firms with reconstruction contracts , journalists , diplomats and representatives of german relief organizations .
among them is alexander christoph , who heads the german organization architects for people in need .
" the only way i can explain what 's happened here , if it turns out they were actually german , is that the -lrb- attackers -rrb- were confused , because most of the kidnappings up till now have always involved members of the coalition troops , " christoph told ard in a telephone interview from baghdad .
germany and china both opposed the war in iraq and have not provided troops to coalition forces .
speaking of the consequences the disappearances could have for other german workers is in the country , christoph said it was still too early to tell .
" i ca n't really judge that right now , " he said .
" our emergency assistance and medical programs are still operating right now , but we 're not starting any new projects .

following a damning report on germany 's efforts to rebuild its once communist east , transportation minister manfred stolpe has proposed setting up special low wage zones in the east .

" it 's a thought that one must seriously pursue , " stolpe said in an interview with business daily handelsblatt . the minister added that the so-called wage subsidies , which would amount to welfare benefits being rebundled as cash incentives instead of as entitlements , could be tied into a law for " regions for innovation " currently being drafted by economics minister wolfgang clement .
" we must examine , how far we can get it into the program of the economics minister , " stolpe said . the " regions for innovation " law , which clement is expected to introduce this year , aims at cutting red tape and repealing certain regulations in construction and planning laws in order to boost the depressed economy in the east . proposal takes up commission 's recommendation stolpe 's plan for wage subsidies for germany 's eastern states echoes a key proposal put forth by the government-commissioned panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi last week . the commission 's report - openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the former communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 - largely concluded that the € 90 billion -lrb- $ 107.9 billion -rrb- berlin spends annually on rebuilding the so-called new federal states is wasted and that stagnant eastern germany is now dragging the wealthier west into ruin . in addition to cash incentives for guaranteed jobs , the commission also suggested a new master reconstruction plan , long-term tax relief for eastern german companies , concentration of economic aid in specific growth centers and the inclusion of at least one eastern german firm in tenders for government contracts to counter years of flawed eastern policy . fears of eu expansion stolpe has defended his plan of special low wage zones in eastern germany by pointing towards the likely consequences of the european union 's expansion in may when it takes in ten new mainly former communist eastern european countries . the minister warned that enlargement would lead to a flood of workers from neighboring eastern european countries taking up most low wage jobs in eastern germany .
stolpe pointed out that it would be an unacceptable situation , particularly because long-term unemployment in eastern germany is on the rise from year to year .
the dohnanyi report pointed out that chronically high unemployment of almost 20 percent is exacerbating the region 's problems . the minister has argued that it 's thus all the more important that workers in low cost sectors in eastern germany have the possibility of a wage supplement in addition to welfare benefits . unions irked by plan however stolpe 's proposal is expected to run into stiff opposition from the country 's powerful labor unions , many of whom fear that it would water down hard negotiated wage agreements with industries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german federation of trade unions , shot down the suggestion on tuesday .

the wherabouts of chinese and japanese hostages remain unknown . tobias ritrath , 25 , and thomas haffenker , 38 , went missing during a routine exchange of security personnel last wednesday . iraqi insurgents are believed to have attacked the security convoy carrying the men , who are part of the elite gsg-9 unit that protects the german embassy in baghdad , as it traveled through iraq on its way from amman , jordan , to the capital .
the convoy was traveling on a highway that skirts the cities of falluja and ramadi , flashpoints in the recent uprising against foreign troops .
the car carrying the men was surrounded , but the others managed to escape and complete their trip to baghdad .
brit : i saw their bodies germany 's foreign ministry said on sunday it was " highly likely " that the men were dead .
ard reported that a grave had been found , where the two men were thought to be buried .
officials at the german embassy in baghdad had reportedly seen video footage of the corpses and recognized the two men , according to ard .
a spokeswoman for the foreign ministry refused to comment on the information .
a reporter for the british daily telegraph said he had seen the bodies of two germans who had been killed in the area .
another witness told agence france presse that the toyota landcruiser the men were believed to be traveling in had been struck by a rocket .
more foreigners abducted meanwhile , the number of foreigners kidnapped in the region rose on sunday .
the chinese foreign ministry confirmed monday that seven of its nationals had been abducted .
the men , aged between 18 and 49 , were kidnapped west of baghdad after arriving in iraq by car from jordan on sunday morning .
it was unclear monday what had happened to three japanese hostages being held by insurgents .
their release was expected sunday , and they had been reported to be in safety .
but a japanese government spokesman said on monday that the reports remained unconfirmed . the captors had said they would kill the three if tokyo did n't remove its troops from iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : released british hostage gary teeley speaks to british service personnel on monday in shaibah , iraq on his first full day of freedom after being held hostage by iraqi militia .
a british man was released sunday from his kidnappers , the british foreign office announced .
gary teeley , 37 , -lrb- photo -rrb- was safely in the care of coalition troops , the ministry said .
no details of his release were given .
teeley had been abducted by an iraqi militia on april 5 in nassiriya .
he had been working for a company from qatar at the u.s. base in the southern iraqi city .
another group of iraqi rebels announced on a video tape broadcast by al jazeera that it would release eight foreign men - three pakistanis , two turks , an indian , a nepali and a filipino .
attacks worry germans in iraq if the reports of the german security agents ' deaths are confirmed , they wo n't be the first german nationals to be killed in iraq .
in mid-march , an employee of a bremen-based firm contracted with rebuilding water supply lines in iraq was shot and killed along with a dutch colleague and their iraqi companion .
currently , an estimated 50 germans are permanently stationed in iraq - employees of firms with reconstruction contracts , journalists , diplomats and representatives of german relief organizations .
among them is alexander christoph , who heads the german organization architects for people in need .
" the only way i can explain what 's happened here , if it turns out they were actually german , is that the -lrb- attackers -rrb- were confused , because most of the kidnappings up till now have always involved members of the coalition troops , " christoph told ard in a telephone interview from baghdad .
germany and china both opposed the war in iraq and have not provided troops to coalition forces .
speaking of the consequences the disappearances could have for other german workers is in the country , christoph said it was still too early to tell .
" i ca n't really judge that right now , " he said .
" our emergency assistance and medical programs are still operating right now , but we 're not starting any new projects .
we 're going to wait and see what develops .
we have n't ruled out the possibility that the situation could get much worse than it already is .

following a damning report on germany 's efforts to rebuild its once communist east , transportation minister manfred stolpe has proposed setting up special low wage zones in the east .
labor unions are up in arms . also charged with rebuilding germany 's five former communist eastern states , german transportation minister manfred stolpe on tuesday weighed in on the furious debate sparked by the publication of a controversial government-commissioned report last week on germany 's disastrous bid to modernize its eastern states since 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said he was in favor of setting up special low wage sectors in the eastern states , where the state would pay out a part of the salaries .
" it 's a thought that one must seriously pursue , " stolpe said in an interview with business daily handelsblatt . the minister added that the so-called wage subsidies , which would amount to welfare benefits being rebundled as cash incentives instead of as entitlements , could be tied into a law for " regions for innovation " currently being drafted by economics minister wolfgang clement .
" we must examine , how far we can get it into the program of the economics minister , " stolpe said . the " regions for innovation " law , which clement is expected to introduce this year , aims at cutting red tape and repealing certain regulations in construction and planning laws in order to boost the depressed economy in the east . proposal takes up commission 's recommendation stolpe 's plan for wage subsidies for germany 's eastern states echoes a key proposal put forth by the government-commissioned panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi last week . the commission 's report - openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the former communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 - largely concluded that the € 90 billion -lrb- $ 107.9 billion -rrb- berlin spends annually on rebuilding the so-called new federal states is wasted and that stagnant eastern germany is now dragging the wealthier west into ruin . in addition to cash incentives for guaranteed jobs , the commission also suggested a new master reconstruction plan , long-term tax relief for eastern german companies , concentration of economic aid in specific growth centers and the inclusion of at least one eastern german firm in tenders for government contracts to counter years of flawed eastern policy . fears of eu expansion stolpe has defended his plan of special low wage zones in eastern germany by pointing towards the likely consequences of the european union 's expansion in may when it takes in ten new mainly former communist eastern european countries . the minister warned that enlargement would lead to a flood of workers from neighboring eastern european countries taking up most low wage jobs in eastern germany .
stolpe pointed out that it would be an unacceptable situation , particularly because long-term unemployment in eastern germany is on the rise from year to year .
the dohnanyi report pointed out that chronically high unemployment of almost 20 percent is exacerbating the region 's problems . the minister has argued that it 's thus all the more important that workers in low cost sectors in eastern germany have the possibility of a wage supplement in addition to welfare benefits . unions irked by plan however stolpe 's proposal is expected to run into stiff opposition from the country 's powerful labor unions , many of whom fear that it would water down hard negotiated wage agreements with industries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german federation of trade unions , shot down the suggestion on tuesday .
" if special economic zones were a successful model , then eastern germany should have been a flourishing landscape in the face of lower wages and longer working hours , " sommer told daily tagesspiegel . he added that the discussion was n't just wrong , but also dangerous .
" conservative politicians want to exploit the woes of the east , to first catapult the special economic zone and then the whole country into the past , " he thundered . criticism of the plan has also emanated from german industry , which is struggling to recover from a recession . " if something is right , why should it just take place in eastern germany , " asked klaus zimmermann , president of the german institute for economic research .

the dohnanyi report pointed out that chronically high unemployment of almost 20 percent is exacerbating the region 's problems . the minister has argued that it 's thus all the more important that workers in low cost sectors in eastern germany have the possibility of a wage supplement in addition to welfare benefits . unions irked by plan however stolpe 's proposal is expected to run into stiff opposition from the country 's powerful labor unions , many of whom fear that it would water down hard negotiated wage agreements with industries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german federation of trade unions , shot down the suggestion on tuesday .
" if special economic zones were a successful model , then eastern germany should have been a flourishing landscape in the face of lower wages and longer working hours , " sommer told daily tagesspiegel . he added that the discussion was n't just wrong , but also dangerous .
" conservative politicians want to exploit the woes of the east , to first catapult the special economic zone and then the whole country into the past , " he thundered . criticism of the plan has also emanated from german industry , which is struggling to recover from a recession . " if something is right , why should it just take place in eastern germany , " asked klaus zimmermann , president of the german institute for economic research .

now a christian democratic politician has proposed incentives for church tax payers , in the hopes that people will stop leaving in droves . christian böhr took advantage of the easter holiday , when the churches enjoy throngs of visitors , to announce that the growing number of people opting out of the christian churches was an ominous development that had to be stopped . " leaving the church should not be a scheme to save taxes , " the christian democratic party 's deputy chairman proclaimed monday .
böhr proposed that germans be offered tax incentives so they will stay in the church .
he said catholics and protestants should be allowed to deduct 20 percent of the church tax they pay from their income tax . the government should examine his proposal , which could save easily taxpayers around € 100 -lrb- $ 119 -rrb- per year , böhr said .
the state would profit from giving church taxpayers a break .
" the churches run numerous kindergartens , hospitals , schools or social stations . "
if the churches lost funding , they would be forced to close such institutions , böhr claimed . state collection plate church tax in germany means that germans fund the country 's christian churches whether they donate to the collection plate or not .
but taxpayers can already deduct the payments on their tax declarations as expenses . germans pay 8 to 9 percent of their income tax if they are members in one of the recognized religious communities .
most germans are born into the catholic or protestant church .
they start paying church tax as soon as they start working ; parents pay church tax on their children 's behalf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishops in the cologne cathedral in 2002 , the churches received € 3.35 billion -lrb- $ 4.02 billion -rrb- in church tax revenue . the german state agreed long ago with the catholic and protestant churches that it would collect the levy and pass it on to them , and the state 's right do so is even laid out in germany 's constitution .
other religious communities can also claim a piece of the pie , as long as they are registered as statutory bodies and recognized by the individual german states , which are responsible for collecting the tax . in berlin , the old catholic church , which split from roman catholicism in the late 19th century , also receives tax revenues from its members , and in other german states confessions such as judaism get church tax money , berlin senate spokesman matthias kolbeck told dw-world .
leaving the lap of the church the only way people can avoid paying the levy is by officially getting out of the church and that 's exactly what thousands of people do each year .
only 63.8 percent of the 82 million people in germany are members of the roman catholic or protestant church , and the numbers have been dropping dramatically for years .
in 2002 over 119,000 people got out of the roman catholic church .
the most recent figures from the protestant church show that nearly 172,000 members opted out in 2001 .
from 1992 to 2001 almost 1.4 million people became former catholics and nearly 2.4 million germans left protestantism . but not everyone who leaves the church is just out to save taxes .
the badische neueste nachrichten newspaper commented on böhr 's proposal : " the 300,000 christians who turned their back on the two big christian churches … did n't all leave because of church tax , but frequently for other reasons : many view the church , especially the catholic church , as strangely out-of-touch . " and for years , critics of the tax have said that it should be transformed into a levy to benefit culture in general .
" a culture tax that everyone had to pay would be fairer in every way - potentially with the requirement that the taxpayer can designate which statutory body should receive the money , " the nürnberger zeitung paper wrote . nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tax cuts leave germans cold a poll conducted by the forsa opinion research company shows that the majority of germans do not feel that the 2004 tax cuts of € 15 billion -lrb- $ 18.3 billion -rrb- are having much effect on their disposable income .

a month and a half after the death of president boris trajkovski in a plane crash , macedonians are to elect a new head of state .
all four candidates say they 'll embrace trajkovski 's commitment to bury ethnic enmities . the four men vying to replace boris trajkovski in wednesday 's elections all have one important thing in common with the late macedonian president , analysts say .
like him , they want to bury past ethnic divisions that nearly led the country into civil war , and focus on bringing macedonia closer in line with the european union .
up until his death in a february plane crash , trajkovski had been one of the most energetic proponents of closer ties between macedonia and europe .
he was also well-practiced at balancing the demands of macedonian hard-liners and ethnic albanian politicians . so far , the 2001 peace deal he presided over has remained in place .
the deal laid out reforms to end tensions between the two ethnic groups , making it possible to turn politicians ' attention to the country 's pressing economic problems , including a 40 percent unemployment rate . crvenkovski favored to win the next macedonian president will inherit trajkovski 's legacy .
the favored candidate is the country 's prime minister , branko crvenkovski , who represents the macedonian majority .
the post of president is largely ceremonial , so it is seen as a testament to the importance of trajkovski 's successor that crvenkovski is willing to risk his more powerful role as prime minister . crvenkovski 's campaign posters show him at the side of world leaders such as u.s. president george w. bush and u.n. secretary-general kofi annan .
his slogan reads : " branko crvenkovski : the statesman . " " we need good interethnic relations , peace and security , " he told a rally on monday .
" it means membership in nato and the european union .
let 's grab the chance . " crvenkovski 's main rival in the election is another macedonian , sasko kedev of the opposition vmro party .
though he is largely unknown , analysts have not ruled out a surprise victory for kedev , who 's been positioning himself as the " new face of macedonia . " albanian candidates ' slim hopes two ethnic albanians are also in the race , though they are reported to have little chance of winning .
ethnic albanians make up only a quarter of the population , and macedonian voters are unlikely to cross ethnic lines . another possible outcome is no outcome - at least in the first round .
for the election to be valid , the winner has to receive over 50 percent of the vote .

a month and a half after the death of president boris trajkovski in a plane crash , macedonians are to elect a new head of state .
all four candidates say they 'll embrace trajkovski 's commitment to bury ethnic enmities . the four men vying to replace boris trajkovski in wednesday 's elections all have one important thing in common with the late macedonian president , analysts say .
like him , they want to bury past ethnic divisions that nearly led the country into civil war , and focus on bringing macedonia closer in line with the european union .
up until his death in a february plane crash , trajkovski had been one of the most energetic proponents of closer ties between macedonia and europe .
he was also well-practiced at balancing the demands of macedonian hard-liners and ethnic albanian politicians . so far , the 2001 peace deal he presided over has remained in place .
the deal laid out reforms to end tensions between the two ethnic groups , making it possible to turn politicians ' attention to the country 's pressing economic problems , including a 40 percent unemployment rate . crvenkovski favored to win the next macedonian president will inherit trajkovski 's legacy .
the favored candidate is the country 's prime minister , branko crvenkovski , who represents the macedonian majority .
the post of president is largely ceremonial , so it is seen as a testament to the importance of trajkovski 's successor that crvenkovski is willing to risk his more powerful role as prime minister . crvenkovski 's campaign posters show him at the side of world leaders such as u.s. president george w. bush and u.n. secretary-general kofi annan .
his slogan reads : " branko crvenkovski : the statesman . " " we need good interethnic relations , peace and security , " he told a rally on monday .
" it means membership in nato and the european union .
let 's grab the chance . " crvenkovski 's main rival in the election is another macedonian , sasko kedev of the opposition vmro party .
though he is largely unknown , analysts have not ruled out a surprise victory for kedev , who 's been positioning himself as the " new face of macedonia . " albanian candidates ' slim hopes two ethnic albanians are also in the race , though they are reported to have little chance of winning .
ethnic albanians make up only a quarter of the population , and macedonian voters are unlikely to cross ethnic lines . another possible outcome is no outcome - at least in the first round .
for the election to be valid , the winner has to receive over 50 percent of the vote .

a month and a half after the death of president boris trajkovski in a plane crash , macedonians are to elect a new head of state .
all four candidates say they 'll embrace trajkovski 's commitment to bury ethnic enmities . the four men vying to replace boris trajkovski in wednesday 's elections all have one important thing in common with the late macedonian president , analysts say .
like him , they want to bury past ethnic divisions that nearly led the country into civil war , and focus on bringing macedonia closer in line with the european union .
up until his death in a february plane crash , trajkovski had been one of the most energetic proponents of closer ties between macedonia and europe .
he was also well-practiced at balancing the demands of macedonian hard-liners and ethnic albanian politicians . so far , the 2001 peace deal he presided over has remained in place .
the deal laid out reforms to end tensions between the two ethnic groups , making it possible to turn politicians ' attention to the country 's pressing economic problems , including a 40 percent unemployment rate . crvenkovski favored to win the next macedonian president will inherit trajkovski 's legacy .
the favored candidate is the country 's prime minister , branko crvenkovski , who represents the macedonian majority .
the post of president is largely ceremonial , so it is seen as a testament to the importance of trajkovski 's successor that crvenkovski is willing to risk his more powerful role as prime minister . crvenkovski 's campaign posters show him at the side of world leaders such as u.s. president george w. bush and u.n. secretary-general kofi annan .
his slogan reads : " branko crvenkovski : the statesman . " " we need good interethnic relations , peace and security , " he told a rally on monday .
" it means membership in nato and the european union .
let 's grab the chance . " crvenkovski 's main rival in the election is another macedonian , sasko kedev of the opposition vmro party .
though he is largely unknown , analysts have not ruled out a surprise victory for kedev , who 's been positioning himself as the " new face of macedonia . " albanian candidates ' slim hopes two ethnic albanians are also in the race , though they are reported to have little chance of winning .
ethnic albanians make up only a quarter of the population , and macedonian voters are unlikely to cross ethnic lines . another possible outcome is no outcome - at least in the first round .
for the election to be valid , the winner has to receive over 50 percent of the vote .
with four candidates , it 's likely that there will be a second round runoff between the top two candidates . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de president 's death throws pall over macedonia 's eu drive macedonian president boris trajkovski died in a plane crash over bosnia on thursday .

a month and a half after the death of president boris trajkovski in a plane crash , macedonians are to elect a new head of state .
all four candidates say they 'll embrace trajkovski 's commitment to bury ethnic enmities . the four men vying to replace boris trajkovski in wednesday 's elections all have one important thing in common with the late macedonian president , analysts say .
like him , they want to bury past ethnic divisions that nearly led the country into civil war , and focus on bringing macedonia closer in line with the european union .
up until his death in a february plane crash , trajkovski had been one of the most energetic proponents of closer ties between macedonia and europe .
he was also well-practiced at balancing the demands of macedonian hard-liners and ethnic albanian politicians . so far , the 2001 peace deal he presided over has remained in place .
the deal laid out reforms to end tensions between the two ethnic groups , making it possible to turn politicians ' attention to the country 's pressing economic problems , including a 40 percent unemployment rate . crvenkovski favored to win the next macedonian president will inherit trajkovski 's legacy .
the favored candidate is the country 's prime minister , branko crvenkovski , who represents the macedonian majority .
the post of president is largely ceremonial , so it is seen as a testament to the importance of trajkovski 's successor that crvenkovski is willing to risk his more powerful role as prime minister . crvenkovski 's campaign posters show him at the side of world leaders such as u.s. president george w. bush and u.n. secretary-general kofi annan .
his slogan reads : " branko crvenkovski : the statesman . " " we need good interethnic relations , peace and security , " he told a rally on monday .
" it means membership in nato and the european union .
let 's grab the chance . " crvenkovski 's main rival in the election is another macedonian , sasko kedev of the opposition vmro party .
though he is largely unknown , analysts have not ruled out a surprise victory for kedev , who 's been positioning himself as the " new face of macedonia . " albanian candidates ' slim hopes two ethnic albanians are also in the race , though they are reported to have little chance of winning .
ethnic albanians make up only a quarter of the population , and macedonian voters are unlikely to cross ethnic lines . another possible outcome is no outcome - at least in the first round .
for the election to be valid , the winner has to receive over 50 percent of the vote .
with four candidates , it 's likely that there will be a second round runoff between the top two candidates . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de president 's death throws pall over macedonia 's eu drive macedonian president boris trajkovski died in a plane crash over bosnia on thursday .

now a christian democratic politician has proposed incentives for church tax payers , in the hopes that people will stop leaving in droves . christian böhr took advantage of the easter holiday , when the churches enjoy throngs of visitors , to announce that the growing number of people opting out of the christian churches was an ominous development that had to be stopped . " leaving the church should not be a scheme to save taxes , " the christian democratic party 's deputy chairman proclaimed monday .
böhr proposed that germans be offered tax incentives so they will stay in the church .
he said catholics and protestants should be allowed to deduct 20 percent of the church tax they pay from their income tax . the government should examine his proposal , which could save easily taxpayers around € 100 -lrb- $ 119 -rrb- per year , böhr said .
the state would profit from giving church taxpayers a break .
" the churches run numerous kindergartens , hospitals , schools or social stations . "
if the churches lost funding , they would be forced to close such institutions , böhr claimed . state collection plate church tax in germany means that germans fund the country 's christian churches whether they donate to the collection plate or not .
but taxpayers can already deduct the payments on their tax declarations as expenses . germans pay 8 to 9 percent of their income tax if they are members in one of the recognized religious communities .
most germans are born into the catholic or protestant church .
they start paying church tax as soon as they start working ; parents pay church tax on their children 's behalf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishops in the cologne cathedral in 2002 , the churches received € 3.35 billion -lrb- $ 4.02 billion -rrb- in church tax revenue . the german state agreed long ago with the catholic and protestant churches that it would collect the levy and pass it on to them , and the state 's right do so is even laid out in germany 's constitution .
other religious communities can also claim a piece of the pie , as long as they are registered as statutory bodies and recognized by the individual german states , which are responsible for collecting the tax . in berlin , the old catholic church , which split from roman catholicism in the late 19th century , also receives tax revenues from its members , and in other german states confessions such as judaism get church tax money , berlin senate spokesman matthias kolbeck told dw-world .
leaving the lap of the church the only way people can avoid paying the levy is by officially getting out of the church and that 's exactly what thousands of people do each year .
only 63.8 percent of the 82 million people in germany are members of the roman catholic or protestant church , and the numbers have been dropping dramatically for years .
in 2002 over 119,000 people got out of the roman catholic church .
the most recent figures from the protestant church show that nearly 172,000 members opted out in 2001 .
from 1992 to 2001 almost 1.4 million people became former catholics and nearly 2.4 million germans left protestantism . but not everyone who leaves the church is just out to save taxes .
the badische neueste nachrichten newspaper commented on böhr 's proposal : " the 300,000 christians who turned their back on the two big christian churches … did n't all leave because of church tax , but frequently for other reasons : many view the church , especially the catholic church , as strangely out-of-touch . " and for years , critics of the tax have said that it should be transformed into a levy to benefit culture in general .
" a culture tax that everyone had to pay would be fairer in every way - potentially with the requirement that the taxpayer can designate which statutory body should receive the money , " the nürnberger zeitung paper wrote . nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tax cuts leave germans cold a poll conducted by the forsa opinion research company shows that the majority of germans do not feel that the 2004 tax cuts of € 15 billion -lrb- $ 18.3 billion -rrb- are having much effect on their disposable income .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.04.2004 minister proposes low-wage zones in eastern germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany 's moribund economy is in need of remedy .
following a damning report on germany 's efforts to rebuild its once communist east , transportation minister manfred stolpe has proposed setting up special low wage zones in the east .
labor unions are up in arms . also charged with rebuilding germany 's five former communist eastern states , german transportation minister manfred stolpe on tuesday weighed in on the furious debate sparked by the publication of a controversial government-commissioned report last week on germany 's disastrous bid to modernize its eastern states since 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said he was in favor of setting up special low wage sectors in the eastern states , where the state would pay out a part of the salaries .
" it 's a thought that one must seriously pursue , " stolpe said in an interview with business daily handelsblatt . the minister added that the so-called wage subsidies , which would amount to welfare benefits being rebundled as cash incentives instead of as entitlements , could be tied into a law for " regions for innovation " currently being drafted by economics minister wolfgang clement .
" we must examine , how far we can get it into the program of the economics minister , " stolpe said . the " regions for innovation " law , which clement is expected to introduce this year , aims at cutting red tape and repealing certain regulations in construction and planning laws in order to boost the depressed economy in the east . proposal takes up commission 's recommendation stolpe 's plan for wage subsidies for germany 's eastern states echoes a key proposal put forth by the government-commissioned panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi last week . the commission 's report - openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the former communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 - largely concluded that the € 90 billion -lrb- $ 107.9 billion -rrb- berlin spends annually on rebuilding the so-called new federal states is wasted and that stagnant eastern germany is now dragging the wealthier west into ruin . in addition to cash incentives for guaranteed jobs , the commission also suggested a new master reconstruction plan , long-term tax relief for eastern german companies , concentration of economic aid in specific growth centers and the inclusion of at least one eastern german firm in tenders for government contracts to counter years of flawed eastern policy . fears of eu expansion stolpe has defended his plan of special low wage zones in eastern germany by pointing towards the likely consequences of the european union 's expansion in may when it takes in ten new mainly former communist eastern european countries . the minister warned that enlargement would lead to a flood of workers from neighboring eastern european countries taking up most low wage jobs in eastern germany .
stolpe pointed out that it would be an unacceptable situation , particularly because long-term unemployment in eastern germany is on the rise from year to year .
the dohnanyi report pointed out that chronically high unemployment of almost 20 percent is exacerbating the region 's problems . the minister has argued that it 's thus all the more important that workers in low cost sectors in eastern germany have the possibility of a wage supplement in addition to welfare benefits . unions irked by plan however stolpe 's proposal is expected to run into stiff opposition from the country 's powerful labor unions , many of whom fear that it would water down hard negotiated wage agreements with industries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german federation of trade unions , shot down the suggestion on tuesday .
" if special economic zones were a successful model , then eastern germany should have been a flourishing landscape in the face of lower wages and longer working hours , " sommer told daily tagesspiegel . he added that the discussion was n't just wrong , but also dangerous .
" conservative politicians want to exploit the woes of the east , to first catapult the special economic zone and then the whole country into the past , " he thundered . criticism of the plan has also emanated from german industry , which is struggling to recover from a recession . " if something is right , why should it just take place in eastern germany , " asked klaus zimmermann , president of the german institute for economic research .
" now the whole of germany is a special economic zone . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de has rebuilding east germany failed ?
germany 's attempt to rebuild its once communist east has been an unmitigated disaster and the massive financial transfers from the west endanger the entire nation 's economy , according to a government-commissioned report .

following a damning report on germany 's efforts to rebuild its once communist east , transportation minister manfred stolpe has proposed setting up special low wage zones in the east .
labor unions are up in arms . also charged with rebuilding germany 's five former communist eastern states , german transportation minister manfred stolpe on tuesday weighed in on the furious debate sparked by the publication of a controversial government-commissioned report last week on germany 's disastrous bid to modernize its eastern states since 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said he was in favor of setting up special low wage sectors in the eastern states , where the state would pay out a part of the salaries .
" it 's a thought that one must seriously pursue , " stolpe said in an interview with business daily handelsblatt . the minister added that the so-called wage subsidies , which would amount to welfare benefits being rebundled as cash incentives instead of as entitlements , could be tied into a law for " regions for innovation " currently being drafted by economics minister wolfgang clement .
" we must examine , how far we can get it into the program of the economics minister , " stolpe said . the " regions for innovation " law , which clement is expected to introduce this year , aims at cutting red tape and repealing certain regulations in construction and planning laws in order to boost the depressed economy in the east . proposal takes up commission 's recommendation stolpe 's plan for wage subsidies for germany 's eastern states echoes a key proposal put forth by the government-commissioned panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi last week . the commission 's report - openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the former communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 - largely concluded that the € 90 billion -lrb- $ 107.9 billion -rrb- berlin spends annually on rebuilding the so-called new federal states is wasted and that stagnant eastern germany is now dragging the wealthier west into ruin . in addition to cash incentives for guaranteed jobs , the commission also suggested a new master reconstruction plan , long-term tax relief for eastern german companies , concentration of economic aid in specific growth centers and the inclusion of at least one eastern german firm in tenders for government contracts to counter years of flawed eastern policy . fears of eu expansion stolpe has defended his plan of special low wage zones in eastern germany by pointing towards the likely consequences of the european union 's expansion in may when it takes in ten new mainly former communist eastern european countries . the minister warned that enlargement would lead to a flood of workers from neighboring eastern european countries taking up most low wage jobs in eastern germany .
stolpe pointed out that it would be an unacceptable situation , particularly because long-term unemployment in eastern germany is on the rise from year to year .
the dohnanyi report pointed out that chronically high unemployment of almost 20 percent is exacerbating the region 's problems . the minister has argued that it 's thus all the more important that workers in low cost sectors in eastern germany have the possibility of a wage supplement in addition to welfare benefits . unions irked by plan however stolpe 's proposal is expected to run into stiff opposition from the country 's powerful labor unions , many of whom fear that it would water down hard negotiated wage agreements with industries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german federation of trade unions , shot down the suggestion on tuesday .
" if special economic zones were a successful model , then eastern germany should have been a flourishing landscape in the face of lower wages and longer working hours , " sommer told daily tagesspiegel . he added that the discussion was n't just wrong , but also dangerous .
" conservative politicians want to exploit the woes of the east , to first catapult the special economic zone and then the whole country into the past , " he thundered . criticism of the plan has also emanated from german industry , which is struggling to recover from a recession .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.04.2004 german life under a south african sun großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life is good down south .
lured by warm climes , pristine beaches , a striking backdrop and german beer , an increasing number of germans - not necessarily equipped with a return ticket - are heading to cape town in south africa . a leisurely read of the tabloid newspaper bild while nursing a wheat beer and chomping on a fried sausage might sound like paradise to some germans .
but take the same scene and add a bright sun , warm surf and rugged mountains , and you 'll have light-starved germans drooling at the thought . the latter is precisely what more than 100,000 germans enjoy most of the year , every year , in cape town , one of south africa 's most beautiful and relaxed cities .
they are permanent refugees from northern europe 's cold and grey and they 're leaving their stamp on the city .
cape town now hosts a thriving array of german bookshops , car dealers , travel agencies , schools , bakeries and pubs . these immigrants joined each year by another 100,000 germans who regularly flee the teutonic winter to spend the summer soaking up the south african sun .
besides them , another 140,000 visit cape town for briefer periods throughout the year .
at times , south africa 's second city has more germans than mid-sized german municipalities like bielefeld or bonn . everything just round the corner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cape town is one of the world 's most scenic spots for paragliding , drawing enthusiasts from around the world .
ralf erdner , who came to cape town ten years ago , knows why he stayed on .
" you take one step out of your office and you 're practically on vacation .
20 minutes to the next vineyard , five minutes to the beach , ten minutes to the waterfront .
it does n't matter if i want to hike , dive , sail or play golf - everything is very affordable and just a stone 's throw away , without traffic snarls and with sun , " he told deutsche welle . in addition to cape town 's climatic and culinary charms , the city 's property prices are very affordable .
in the past six years , the number of german property owners in the region has continually risen , especially since a charming cape-dutch country house costs about the same as a fashionable apartment in hamburg . business and property interests erdner 's own company in cape town , international business network , advises german investors on legal , economic and tax issues . erdner said his work had changed over the past few years .
" we used to have a huge number of people who came from germany and wanted to buy a holiday home .
and then we had those , who said , ' i want to live for six months in germany and six months in south africa . '
they wanted to make the best of both summers , " he said . once one german decided to start a business in the country , the floodgates opened as others jumped on the bandwagon . " a whole new trend has actually stemmed from it now , so we now do n't have as many property buyers , but rather more middle-sized companies who come here , " he said . a city for romantics ? german migration to cape town has a long tradition .
germans , along with the dutch and british , have been flocking to south africa 's southern tip since the 17th century , a fact that 's reflected in names of local towns such as hamburg , frankfurt or heidelberg . many germans also fought alongside the boers , south africans of dutch or huguenot descent , against the british colonizers .
migration from germany slowed during south africa 's apartheid regime and only picked up again after president mandela was elected to office following democratic elections in 1994 . stefan hippler , the priest with the german-speaking catholic community in cape town , said many germans view the city romantically . " cape town somehow seems to be the dream of sleepless nights for many germans , even for many pensioners .
it 's become a bit like a promised city where people can be happy . " but happiness is n't all that cape town is about .
it may be largely insulated from the crippling poverty and misery seen elsewhere in africa , but the paradisaical atmosphere is occasionally shaken by reports of crime and burglary . warring street gangs can draw bystanders into their paths . bavarian sausage and sunny fun however germans working in the hospitality industry in cape town are n't that much bothered by the city 's darker side . " one gets used to it , " said susanne funk , a german immigrant who runs a bed and breakfast at the foot of the tafelsberg mountain .
" you get to grips with the feeling that it 's more dangerous here .
and for me personally , all the positive experiences are so overwhelming lovely that i do n't think about going to germany . " bayreuth-born wolfgang ködel , who ensures that his german guests get enough beer on tap in his pub , is proud that he 's been able to create a slice of bavaria in africa , complete with the region 's music and food , including grilled pig 's knuckles .
" i would say that our bavarian sausage here in cape town is at least as good as in munich , " he said .
" naturally most of the guests come because of the beer and we brew our own here . " with all that hearty german food topped with enough sunshine and surf to go around , it is n't hard to understand why cape town has become such a hot destination - either permanent or part-time - for germans . funk sums up the feeling : " i look forward to my vacation in germany .
i can really enjoy it because i know that my return ticket says ' cape town .

following a damning report on germany 's efforts to rebuild its once communist east , transportation minister manfred stolpe has proposed setting up special low wage zones in the east .
labor unions are up in arms . also charged with rebuilding germany 's five former communist eastern states , german transportation minister manfred stolpe on tuesday weighed in on the furious debate sparked by the publication of a controversial government-commissioned report last week on germany 's disastrous bid to modernize its eastern states since 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said he was in favor of setting up special low wage sectors in the eastern states , where the state would pay out a part of the salaries .
" it 's a thought that one must seriously pursue , " stolpe said in an interview with business daily handelsblatt . the minister added that the so-called wage subsidies , which would amount to welfare benefits being rebundled as cash incentives instead of as entitlements , could be tied into a law for " regions for innovation " currently being drafted by economics minister wolfgang clement .
" we must examine , how far we can get it into the program of the economics minister , " stolpe said . the " regions for innovation " law , which clement is expected to introduce this year , aims at cutting red tape and repealing certain regulations in construction and planning laws in order to boost the depressed economy in the east . proposal takes up commission 's recommendation stolpe 's plan for wage subsidies for germany 's eastern states echoes a key proposal put forth by the government-commissioned panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi last week . the commission 's report - openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the former communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 - largely concluded that the € 90 billion -lrb- $ 107.9 billion -rrb- berlin spends annually on rebuilding the so-called new federal states is wasted and that stagnant eastern germany is now dragging the wealthier west into ruin . in addition to cash incentives for guaranteed jobs , the commission also suggested a new master reconstruction plan , long-term tax relief for eastern german companies , concentration of economic aid in specific growth centers and the inclusion of at least one eastern german firm in tenders for government contracts to counter years of flawed eastern policy . fears of eu expansion stolpe has defended his plan of special low wage zones in eastern germany by pointing towards the likely consequences of the european union 's expansion in may when it takes in ten new mainly former communist eastern european countries . the minister warned that enlargement would lead to a flood of workers from neighboring eastern european countries taking up most low wage jobs in eastern germany .
stolpe pointed out that it would be an unacceptable situation , particularly because long-term unemployment in eastern germany is on the rise from year to year .
the dohnanyi report pointed out that chronically high unemployment of almost 20 percent is exacerbating the region 's problems . the minister has argued that it 's thus all the more important that workers in low cost sectors in eastern germany have the possibility of a wage supplement in addition to welfare benefits . unions irked by plan however stolpe 's proposal is expected to run into stiff opposition from the country 's powerful labor unions , many of whom fear that it would water down hard negotiated wage agreements with industries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german federation of trade unions , shot down the suggestion on tuesday .
" if special economic zones were a successful model , then eastern germany should have been a flourishing landscape in the face of lower wages and longer working hours , " sommer told daily tagesspiegel . he added that the discussion was n't just wrong , but also dangerous .
" conservative politicians want to exploit the woes of the east , to first catapult the special economic zone and then the whole country into the past , " he thundered . criticism of the plan has also emanated from german industry , which is struggling to recover from a recession .

the german foreign ministry issued a warning on tuesday for its citizens to leave iraq as the spate of foreign kidnappings continues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.04.2004 voting for unity in macedonia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : branko crvenkovski is favored to succeed boris trajkovski as macedonian president .
a month and a half after the death of president boris trajkovski in a plane crash , macedonians are to elect a new head of state .
all four candidates say they 'll embrace trajkovski 's commitment to bury ethnic enmities . the four men vying to replace boris trajkovski in wednesday 's elections all have one important thing in common with the late macedonian president , analysts say .
like him , they want to bury past ethnic divisions that nearly led the country into civil war , and focus on bringing macedonia closer in line with the european union .
up until his death in a february plane crash , trajkovski had been one of the most energetic proponents of closer ties between macedonia and europe .
he was also well-practiced at balancing the demands of macedonian hard-liners and ethnic albanian politicians . so far , the 2001 peace deal he presided over has remained in place .
the deal laid out reforms to end tensions between the two ethnic groups , making it possible to turn politicians ' attention to the country 's pressing economic problems , including a 40 percent unemployment rate . crvenkovski favored to win the next macedonian president will inherit trajkovski 's legacy .
the favored candidate is the country 's prime minister , branko crvenkovski , who represents the macedonian majority .
the post of president is largely ceremonial , so it is seen as a testament to the importance of trajkovski 's successor that crvenkovski is willing to risk his more powerful role as prime minister . crvenkovski 's campaign posters show him at the side of world leaders such as u.s. president george w. bush and u.n. secretary-general kofi annan .
his slogan reads : " branko crvenkovski : the statesman . " " we need good interethnic relations , peace and security , " he told a rally on monday .
" it means membership in nato and the european union .
let 's grab the chance . " crvenkovski 's main rival in the election is another macedonian , sasko kedev of the opposition vmro party .
though he is largely unknown , analysts have not ruled out a surprise victory for kedev , who 's been positioning himself as the " new face of macedonia . " albanian candidates ' slim hopes two ethnic albanians are also in the race , though they are reported to have little chance of winning .
ethnic albanians make up only a quarter of the population , and macedonian voters are unlikely to cross ethnic lines . another possible outcome is no outcome - at least in the first round .
for the election to be valid , the winner has to receive over 50 percent of the vote .

a month and a half after the death of president boris trajkovski in a plane crash , macedonians are to elect a new head of state .
all four candidates say they 'll embrace trajkovski 's commitment to bury ethnic enmities . the four men vying to replace boris trajkovski in wednesday 's elections all have one important thing in common with the late macedonian president , analysts say .
like him , they want to bury past ethnic divisions that nearly led the country into civil war , and focus on bringing macedonia closer in line with the european union .
up until his death in a february plane crash , trajkovski had been one of the most energetic proponents of closer ties between macedonia and europe .
he was also well-practiced at balancing the demands of macedonian hard-liners and ethnic albanian politicians . so far , the 2001 peace deal he presided over has remained in place .
the deal laid out reforms to end tensions between the two ethnic groups , making it possible to turn politicians ' attention to the country 's pressing economic problems , including a 40 percent unemployment rate . crvenkovski favored to win the next macedonian president will inherit trajkovski 's legacy .
the favored candidate is the country 's prime minister , branko crvenkovski , who represents the macedonian majority .
the post of president is largely ceremonial , so it is seen as a testament to the importance of trajkovski 's successor that crvenkovski is willing to risk his more powerful role as prime minister . crvenkovski 's campaign posters show him at the side of world leaders such as u.s. president george w. bush and u.n. secretary-general kofi annan .
his slogan reads : " branko crvenkovski : the statesman . " " we need good interethnic relations , peace and security , " he told a rally on monday .
" it means membership in nato and the european union .
let 's grab the chance . " crvenkovski 's main rival in the election is another macedonian , sasko kedev of the opposition vmro party .
though he is largely unknown , analysts have not ruled out a surprise victory for kedev , who 's been positioning himself as the " new face of macedonia . " albanian candidates ' slim hopes two ethnic albanians are also in the race , though they are reported to have little chance of winning .
ethnic albanians make up only a quarter of the population , and macedonian voters are unlikely to cross ethnic lines . another possible outcome is no outcome - at least in the first round .
for the election to be valid , the winner has to receive over 50 percent of the vote .
with four candidates , it 's likely that there will be a second round runoff between the top two candidates . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de president 's death throws pall over macedonia 's eu drive macedonian president boris trajkovski died in a plane crash over bosnia on thursday .

" headscarves are the opposite of integration " europe 's integration challenge germany -pipe- 13.04.2004 " what 's in people 's heads is important " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth has been the commissioner of human rights and humanitarian aid since 2003 .
dw-world : opposition christian democrats say germany has n't been an immigrant country since it stopped recruiting foreigners in 1972 .
do you think germany is an immigrant country ? claudia roth : it ’ s one of the biggest lies of past decades to say that germany isn ’ t a real immigrant country .
we have been an immigrant country for over 50 years , and people have come here who have helped to build this country .
but what we are not is an immigrant country that has managed to regulate immigration , to protect the right to asylum and to foster integration . what is successful integration ? successful integration is much more than acquiring language skills .
integration must be related to legal integration , to education and work .
legal integration means , for example , eased naturalization , a citizenship right that we changed . successful integration means that the wealth people possess , who come here from other cultures , from other languages , from different religions is understood as wealth and not as a threat .
that we build on these abilities by providing native language opportunities and at the same time fostering the german language much more purposefully and much more consistently among the people who come here . successful integration is also an expression of the education opportunities that immigrants ' children have in our country .
if social origin remains the most decisive factor in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education access for immigrant children : " we have a lot of catching up to do . " when it comes to access and school problems - that children with immigrant backgrounds , above all , have - we have a lot of catching up to do .
in the areas of work , training , joblessness the numbers show that immigrants are much more frequently affected by unemployment , that young people have big difficulties advancing into higher spheres . we have big deficits , and that also arises from the ideological refusal to say we are an immigrant country .
people come here ; people should come here .
it makes our country richer , more multifaceted . has integration made progress in germany or has it regressed ? it hasn ’ t regressed .
at least there ’ s a consensus that integration is important .
there are certainly many very positive signals of successful integration , but there are also negative signals .
groups exist that withdraw into their alleged own cultures .
you have the feeling there are groups of immigrants who wall themselves into an alleged culture of their country of origin .
turkey , for example .
sometimes i have the feeling things are much more open in istanbul or izmir than in some areas of germany .
a similar problem : ethnic germans -lrb- from eastern europe -rrb- , who for decades in russia , in the other countries where they lived , holed themselves up in their alleged german culture and came to germany and noticed it ’ s somehow totally different , and then they aren ’ t able to cope . some have pointed to the muslim headscarf as a symbol of cultural isolation and social exclusion following a ruling by germany 's high court allowing a muslim teacher to wear her headscarf in class if there is no state law against it .
does it in fact signify the social exclusion of women ? i wouldn ’ t put it so simply .
we greens advocate throughout the world that there shouldn ’ t be constraints requiring wearing a headscarf .
why should i advocate constraints in germany not to wear a headscarf ? but the case that the issue is pegged on , a teacher who is german , who studied at german universities , who is everything but the exemplification of an oppressed woman , but rather lives highly emancipated and self-determined , to claim that she is the example of the greatest form of oppression is wrong . there are many reasons why women in our country wear headscarves .
i might like them or not .
i wouldn ’ t forcefully impose something in the german democracy that i fight in other countries : the constraint of self-determination .
i don ’ t believe in carrying out women ’ s liberation in the form of discrimination .
and women ’ s emancipation , women ’ s equality is definitely not expressed just by the headscarf . is wearing a headscarf compatible with integration ? i think so .
the headscarf issue isn ’ t an issue of the willingness to become integrated , rather it ’ s important what ’ s in people ’ s heads , what ’ s happening underneath the headscarf and how our democracy is interpreted and accepted . can a strictly devout muslim become an integrated german citizen ? a strictly devout muslim can be integrated into our society just as a strictly devout catholic can . does islam have a future in germany and europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " islam has a present and a future . "
it doesn ’ t only have a future , it has a present , whether we like it or not .
it ’ s a question of democracy .
even now islam is the second largest religious community in the european union .
islam per se isn ’ t an enemy just like christianity per se isn ’ t an enemy .
we would be wise to treat the religious practices of different religions in our society equally , with the greatest meticulousness , particularly by virtue of our own historical responsibility and democratic sensibilities . why has germany failed to pass an immigration law yet ? because the ideological barriers are infinitely high here .
because this issue is always an issue that surfaces in the maelstrom of populist politics here .
because problems are very easily diverted onto weak groups in out society that have little lobby , like immigrants .
because people refuse future-oriented modern policies despite knowing better . we need this immigration law .
we need it urgently , because we can ’ t compete anymore with other european countries .
but we only need an immigration law if immigration is truly regulated .

there are certainly many very positive signals of successful integration , but there are also negative signals .

you have the feeling there are groups of immigrants who wall themselves into an alleged culture of their country of origin .
turkey , for example .
sometimes i have the feeling things are much more open in istanbul or izmir than in some areas of germany .
a similar problem : ethnic germans -lrb- from eastern europe -rrb- , who for decades in russia , in the other countries where they lived , holed themselves up in their alleged german culture and came to germany and noticed it ’ s somehow totally different , and then they aren ’ t able to cope . some have pointed to the muslim headscarf as a symbol of cultural isolation and social exclusion following a ruling by germany 's high court allowing a muslim teacher to wear her headscarf in class if there is no state law against it .
does it in fact signify the social exclusion of women ? i wouldn ’ t put it so simply .
we greens advocate throughout the world that there shouldn ’ t be constraints requiring wearing a headscarf .
why should i advocate constraints in germany not to wear a headscarf ? but the case that the issue is pegged on , a teacher who is german , who studied at german universities , who is everything but the exemplification of an oppressed woman , but rather lives highly emancipated and self-determined , to claim that she is the example of the greatest form of oppression is wrong . there are many reasons why women in our country wear headscarves .

and women ’ s emancipation , women ’ s equality is definitely not expressed just by the headscarf . is wearing a headscarf compatible with integration ? i think so .
the headscarf issue isn ’ t an issue of the willingness to become integrated , rather it ’ s important what ’ s in people ’ s heads , what ’ s happening underneath the headscarf and how our democracy is interpreted and accepted . can a strictly devout muslim become an integrated german citizen ? a strictly devout muslim can be integrated into our society just as a strictly devout catholic can . does islam have a future in germany and europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " islam has a present and a future .

it doesn ’ t only have a future , it has a present , whether we like it or not .
it ’ s a question of democracy .
even now islam is the second largest religious community in the european union .
islam per se isn ’ t an enemy just like christianity per se isn ’ t an enemy .
we would be wise to treat the religious practices of different religions in our society equally , with the greatest meticulousness , particularly by virtue of our own historical responsibility and democratic sensibilities . why has germany failed to pass an immigration law yet ? because the ideological barriers are infinitely high here .

" headscarves are the opposite of integration " europe 's integration challenge germany -pipe- 13.04.2004 " what 's in people 's heads is important " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth has been the commissioner of human rights and humanitarian aid since 2003 .
dw-world : opposition christian democrats say germany has n't been an immigrant country since it stopped recruiting foreigners in 1972 .
do you think germany is an immigrant country ? claudia roth : it ’ s one of the biggest lies of past decades to say that germany isn ’ t a real immigrant country .
we have been an immigrant country for over 50 years , and people have come here who have helped to build this country .
but what we are not is an immigrant country that has managed to regulate immigration , to protect the right to asylum and to foster integration . what is successful integration ? successful integration is much more than acquiring language skills .
integration must be related to legal integration , to education and work .
legal integration means , for example , eased naturalization , a citizenship right that we changed . successful integration means that the wealth people possess , who come here from other cultures , from other languages , from different religions is understood as wealth and not as a threat .
that we build on these abilities by providing native language opportunities and at the same time fostering the german language much more purposefully and much more consistently among the people who come here . successful integration is also an expression of the education opportunities that immigrants ' children have in our country .
if social origin remains the most decisive factor in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education access for immigrant children : " we have a lot of catching up to do . " when it comes to access and school problems - that children with immigrant backgrounds , above all , have - we have a lot of catching up to do .
in the areas of work , training , joblessness the numbers show that immigrants are much more frequently affected by unemployment , that young people have big difficulties advancing into higher spheres . we have big deficits , and that also arises from the ideological refusal to say we are an immigrant country .
people come here ; people should come here .
it makes our country richer , more multifaceted . has integration made progress in germany or has it regressed ? it hasn ’ t regressed .
at least there ’ s a consensus that integration is important .
there are certainly many very positive signals of successful integration , but there are also negative signals .
groups exist that withdraw into their alleged own cultures .
you have the feeling there are groups of immigrants who wall themselves into an alleged culture of their country of origin .
turkey , for example .
sometimes i have the feeling things are much more open in istanbul or izmir than in some areas of germany .
a similar problem : ethnic germans -lrb- from eastern europe -rrb- , who for decades in russia , in the other countries where they lived , holed themselves up in their alleged german culture and came to germany and noticed it ’ s somehow totally different , and then they aren ’ t able to cope . some have pointed to the muslim headscarf as a symbol of cultural isolation and social exclusion following a ruling by germany 's high court allowing a muslim teacher to wear her headscarf in class if there is no state law against it .
does it in fact signify the social exclusion of women ? i wouldn ’ t put it so simply .
we greens advocate throughout the world that there shouldn ’ t be constraints requiring wearing a headscarf .
why should i advocate constraints in germany not to wear a headscarf ? but the case that the issue is pegged on , a teacher who is german , who studied at german universities , who is everything but the exemplification of an oppressed woman , but rather lives highly emancipated and self-determined , to claim that she is the example of the greatest form of oppression is wrong . there are many reasons why women in our country wear headscarves .
i might like them or not .
i wouldn ’ t forcefully impose something in the german democracy that i fight in other countries : the constraint of self-determination .

" headscarves are the opposite of integration " europe 's integration challenge germany -pipe- 13.04.2004 " what 's in people 's heads is important " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth has been the commissioner of human rights and humanitarian aid since 2003 .
dw-world : opposition christian democrats say germany has n't been an immigrant country since it stopped recruiting foreigners in 1972 .
do you think germany is an immigrant country ? claudia roth : it ’ s one of the biggest lies of past decades to say that germany isn ’ t a real immigrant country .
we have been an immigrant country for over 50 years , and people have come here who have helped to build this country .
but what we are not is an immigrant country that has managed to regulate immigration , to protect the right to asylum and to foster integration . what is successful integration ? successful integration is much more than acquiring language skills .
integration must be related to legal integration , to education and work .
legal integration means , for example , eased naturalization , a citizenship right that we changed . successful integration means that the wealth people possess , who come here from other cultures , from other languages , from different religions is understood as wealth and not as a threat .
that we build on these abilities by providing native language opportunities and at the same time fostering the german language much more purposefully and much more consistently among the people who come here . successful integration is also an expression of the education opportunities that immigrants ' children have in our country .
if social origin remains the most decisive factor in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education access for immigrant children : " we have a lot of catching up to do . " when it comes to access and school problems - that children with immigrant backgrounds , above all , have - we have a lot of catching up to do .
in the areas of work , training , joblessness the numbers show that immigrants are much more frequently affected by unemployment , that young people have big difficulties advancing into higher spheres . we have big deficits , and that also arises from the ideological refusal to say we are an immigrant country .
people come here ; people should come here .
it makes our country richer , more multifaceted . has integration made progress in germany or has it regressed ? it hasn ’ t regressed .
at least there ’ s a consensus that integration is important .
there are certainly many very positive signals of successful integration , but there are also negative signals .
groups exist that withdraw into their alleged own cultures .
you have the feeling there are groups of immigrants who wall themselves into an alleged culture of their country of origin .
turkey , for example .
sometimes i have the feeling things are much more open in istanbul or izmir than in some areas of germany .
a similar problem : ethnic germans -lrb- from eastern europe -rrb- , who for decades in russia , in the other countries where they lived , holed themselves up in their alleged german culture and came to germany and noticed it ’ s somehow totally different , and then they aren ’ t able to cope . some have pointed to the muslim headscarf as a symbol of cultural isolation and social exclusion following a ruling by germany 's high court allowing a muslim teacher to wear her headscarf in class if there is no state law against it .
does it in fact signify the social exclusion of women ? i wouldn ’ t put it so simply .
we greens advocate throughout the world that there shouldn ’ t be constraints requiring wearing a headscarf .
why should i advocate constraints in germany not to wear a headscarf ? but the case that the issue is pegged on , a teacher who is german , who studied at german universities , who is everything but the exemplification of an oppressed woman , but rather lives highly emancipated and self-determined , to claim that she is the example of the greatest form of oppression is wrong . there are many reasons why women in our country wear headscarves .
i might like them or not .
i wouldn ’ t forcefully impose something in the german democracy that i fight in other countries : the constraint of self-determination .
i don ’ t believe in carrying out women ’ s liberation in the form of discrimination .
and women ’ s emancipation , women ’ s equality is definitely not expressed just by the headscarf . is wearing a headscarf compatible with integration ? i think so .
the headscarf issue isn ’ t an issue of the willingness to become integrated , rather it ’ s important what ’ s in people ’ s heads , what ’ s happening underneath the headscarf and how our democracy is interpreted and accepted . can a strictly devout muslim become an integrated german citizen ? a strictly devout muslim can be integrated into our society just as a strictly devout catholic can . does islam have a future in germany and europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " islam has a present and a future . "
it doesn ’ t only have a future , it has a present , whether we like it or not .
it ’ s a question of democracy .
even now islam is the second largest religious community in the european union .
islam per se isn ’ t an enemy just like christianity per se isn ’ t an enemy .
we would be wise to treat the religious practices of different religions in our society equally , with the greatest meticulousness , particularly by virtue of our own historical responsibility and democratic sensibilities . why has germany failed to pass an immigration law yet ? because the ideological barriers are infinitely high here .
because this issue is always an issue that surfaces in the maelstrom of populist politics here .
because problems are very easily diverted onto weak groups in out society that have little lobby , like immigrants .
because people refuse future-oriented modern policies despite knowing better . we need this immigration law .
we need it urgently , because we can ’ t compete anymore with other european countries .
but we only need an immigration law if immigration is truly regulated .
what we don ’ t need is an immigration limitation law . nancy isenson interviewed claudia roth send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a month and a half after the death of president boris trajkovski in a plane crash , macedonians are to elect a new head of state .
all four candidates say they 'll embrace trajkovski 's commitment to bury ethnic enmities . the four men vying to replace boris trajkovski in wednesday 's elections all have one important thing in common with the late macedonian president , analysts say .
like him , they want to bury past ethnic divisions that nearly led the country into civil war , and focus on bringing macedonia closer in line with the european union .
up until his death in a february plane crash , trajkovski had been one of the most energetic proponents of closer ties between macedonia and europe .
he was also well-practiced at balancing the demands of macedonian hard-liners and ethnic albanian politicians . so far , the 2001 peace deal he presided over has remained in place .
the deal laid out reforms to end tensions between the two ethnic groups , making it possible to turn politicians ' attention to the country 's pressing economic problems , including a 40 percent unemployment rate . crvenkovski favored to win the next macedonian president will inherit trajkovski 's legacy .
the favored candidate is the country 's prime minister , branko crvenkovski , who represents the macedonian majority .
the post of president is largely ceremonial , so it is seen as a testament to the importance of trajkovski 's successor that crvenkovski is willing to risk his more powerful role as prime minister . crvenkovski 's campaign posters show him at the side of world leaders such as u.s. president george w. bush and u.n. secretary-general kofi annan .
his slogan reads : " branko crvenkovski : the statesman . " " we need good interethnic relations , peace and security , " he told a rally on monday .
" it means membership in nato and the european union .
let 's grab the chance . " crvenkovski 's main rival in the election is another macedonian , sasko kedev of the opposition vmro party .
though he is largely unknown , analysts have not ruled out a surprise victory for kedev , who 's been positioning himself as the " new face of macedonia . " albanian candidates ' slim hopes two ethnic albanians are also in the race , though they are reported to have little chance of winning .
ethnic albanians make up only a quarter of the population , and macedonian voters are unlikely to cross ethnic lines . another possible outcome is no outcome - at least in the first round .
for the election to be valid , the winner has to receive over 50 percent of the vote .
with four candidates , it 's likely that there will be a second round runoff between the top two candidates . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de president 's death throws pall over macedonia 's eu drive macedonian president boris trajkovski died in a plane crash over bosnia on thursday .

a month and a half after the death of president boris trajkovski in a plane crash , macedonians are to elect a new head of state .
all four candidates say they 'll embrace trajkovski 's commitment to bury ethnic enmities . the four men vying to replace boris trajkovski in wednesday 's elections all have one important thing in common with the late macedonian president , analysts say .
like him , they want to bury past ethnic divisions that nearly led the country into civil war , and focus on bringing macedonia closer in line with the european union .
up until his death in a february plane crash , trajkovski had been one of the most energetic proponents of closer ties between macedonia and europe .
he was also well-practiced at balancing the demands of macedonian hard-liners and ethnic albanian politicians . so far , the 2001 peace deal he presided over has remained in place .
the deal laid out reforms to end tensions between the two ethnic groups , making it possible to turn politicians ' attention to the country 's pressing economic problems , including a 40 percent unemployment rate . crvenkovski favored to win the next macedonian president will inherit trajkovski 's legacy .
the favored candidate is the country 's prime minister , branko crvenkovski , who represents the macedonian majority .
the post of president is largely ceremonial , so it is seen as a testament to the importance of trajkovski 's successor that crvenkovski is willing to risk his more powerful role as prime minister . crvenkovski 's campaign posters show him at the side of world leaders such as u.s. president george w. bush and u.n. secretary-general kofi annan .
his slogan reads : " branko crvenkovski : the statesman . " " we need good interethnic relations , peace and security , " he told a rally on monday .
" it means membership in nato and the european union .
let 's grab the chance . " crvenkovski 's main rival in the election is another macedonian , sasko kedev of the opposition vmro party .
though he is largely unknown , analysts have not ruled out a surprise victory for kedev , who 's been positioning himself as the " new face of macedonia . " albanian candidates ' slim hopes two ethnic albanians are also in the race , though they are reported to have little chance of winning .
ethnic albanians make up only a quarter of the population , and macedonian voters are unlikely to cross ethnic lines . another possible outcome is no outcome - at least in the first round .
for the election to be valid , the winner has to receive over 50 percent of the vote .

lured by warm climes , pristine beaches , a striking backdrop and german beer , an increasing number of germans - not necessarily equipped with a return ticket - are heading to cape town in south africa . a leisurely read of the tabloid newspaper bild while nursing a wheat beer and chomping on a fried sausage might sound like paradise to some germans .
but take the same scene and add a bright sun , warm surf and rugged mountains , and you 'll have light-starved germans drooling at the thought . the latter is precisely what more than 100,000 germans enjoy most of the year , every year , in cape town , one of south africa 's most beautiful and relaxed cities .
they are permanent refugees from northern europe 's cold and grey and they 're leaving their stamp on the city .
cape town now hosts a thriving array of german bookshops , car dealers , travel agencies , schools , bakeries and pubs . these immigrants joined each year by another 100,000 germans who regularly flee the teutonic winter to spend the summer soaking up the south african sun .
besides them , another 140,000 visit cape town for briefer periods throughout the year .
at times , south africa 's second city has more germans than mid-sized german municipalities like bielefeld or bonn . everything just round the corner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cape town is one of the world 's most scenic spots for paragliding , drawing enthusiasts from around the world .
ralf erdner , who came to cape town ten years ago , knows why he stayed on .
" you take one step out of your office and you 're practically on vacation .
20 minutes to the next vineyard , five minutes to the beach , ten minutes to the waterfront .
it does n't matter if i want to hike , dive , sail or play golf - everything is very affordable and just a stone 's throw away , without traffic snarls and with sun , " he told deutsche welle . in addition to cape town 's climatic and culinary charms , the city 's property prices are very affordable .
in the past six years , the number of german property owners in the region has continually risen , especially since a charming cape-dutch country house costs about the same as a fashionable apartment in hamburg . business and property interests erdner 's own company in cape town , international business network , advises german investors on legal , economic and tax issues . erdner said his work had changed over the past few years .
" we used to have a huge number of people who came from germany and wanted to buy a holiday home .
and then we had those , who said , ' i want to live for six months in germany and six months in south africa . '
they wanted to make the best of both summers , " he said . once one german decided to start a business in the country , the floodgates opened as others jumped on the bandwagon . " a whole new trend has actually stemmed from it now , so we now do n't have as many property buyers , but rather more middle-sized companies who come here , " he said . a city for romantics ? german migration to cape town has a long tradition .
germans , along with the dutch and british , have been flocking to south africa 's southern tip since the 17th century , a fact that 's reflected in names of local towns such as hamburg , frankfurt or heidelberg . many germans also fought alongside the boers , south africans of dutch or huguenot descent , against the british colonizers .
migration from germany slowed during south africa 's apartheid regime and only picked up again after president mandela was elected to office following democratic elections in 1994 . stefan hippler , the priest with the german-speaking catholic community in cape town , said many germans view the city romantically . " cape town somehow seems to be the dream of sleepless nights for many germans , even for many pensioners .
it 's become a bit like a promised city where people can be happy . " but happiness is n't all that cape town is about .
it may be largely insulated from the crippling poverty and misery seen elsewhere in africa , but the paradisaical atmosphere is occasionally shaken by reports of crime and burglary . warring street gangs can draw bystanders into their paths . bavarian sausage and sunny fun however germans working in the hospitality industry in cape town are n't that much bothered by the city 's darker side . " one gets used to it , " said susanne funk , a german immigrant who runs a bed and breakfast at the foot of the tafelsberg mountain .
" you get to grips with the feeling that it 's more dangerous here .
and for me personally , all the positive experiences are so overwhelming lovely that i do n't think about going to germany . " bayreuth-born wolfgang ködel , who ensures that his german guests get enough beer on tap in his pub , is proud that he 's been able to create a slice of bavaria in africa , complete with the region 's music and food , including grilled pig 's knuckles .
" i would say that our bavarian sausage here in cape town is at least as good as in munich , " he said .
" naturally most of the guests come because of the beer and we brew our own here . " with all that hearty german food topped with enough sunshine and surf to go around , it is n't hard to understand why cape town has become such a hot destination - either permanent or part-time - for germans . funk sums up the feeling : " i look forward to my vacation in germany .

following a damning report on germany 's efforts to rebuild its once communist east , transportation minister manfred stolpe has proposed setting up special low wage zones in the east .
labor unions are up in arms . also charged with rebuilding germany 's five former communist eastern states , german transportation minister manfred stolpe on tuesday weighed in on the furious debate sparked by the publication of a controversial government-commissioned report last week on germany 's disastrous bid to modernize its eastern states since 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said he was in favor of setting up special low wage sectors in the eastern states , where the state would pay out a part of the salaries .
" it 's a thought that one must seriously pursue , " stolpe said in an interview with business daily handelsblatt . the minister added that the so-called wage subsidies , which would amount to welfare benefits being rebundled as cash incentives instead of as entitlements , could be tied into a law for " regions for innovation " currently being drafted by economics minister wolfgang clement .
" we must examine , how far we can get it into the program of the economics minister , " stolpe said . the " regions for innovation " law , which clement is expected to introduce this year , aims at cutting red tape and repealing certain regulations in construction and planning laws in order to boost the depressed economy in the east . proposal takes up commission 's recommendation stolpe 's plan for wage subsidies for germany 's eastern states echoes a key proposal put forth by the government-commissioned panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi last week . the commission 's report - openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the former communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 - largely concluded that the € 90 billion -lrb- $ 107.9 billion -rrb- berlin spends annually on rebuilding the so-called new federal states is wasted and that stagnant eastern germany is now dragging the wealthier west into ruin . in addition to cash incentives for guaranteed jobs , the commission also suggested a new master reconstruction plan , long-term tax relief for eastern german companies , concentration of economic aid in specific growth centers and the inclusion of at least one eastern german firm in tenders for government contracts to counter years of flawed eastern policy . fears of eu expansion stolpe has defended his plan of special low wage zones in eastern germany by pointing towards the likely consequences of the european union 's expansion in may when it takes in ten new mainly former communist eastern european countries . the minister warned that enlargement would lead to a flood of workers from neighboring eastern european countries taking up most low wage jobs in eastern germany .
stolpe pointed out that it would be an unacceptable situation , particularly because long-term unemployment in eastern germany is on the rise from year to year .
the dohnanyi report pointed out that chronically high unemployment of almost 20 percent is exacerbating the region 's problems . the minister has argued that it 's thus all the more important that workers in low cost sectors in eastern germany have the possibility of a wage supplement in addition to welfare benefits . unions irked by plan however stolpe 's proposal is expected to run into stiff opposition from the country 's powerful labor unions , many of whom fear that it would water down hard negotiated wage agreements with industries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german federation of trade unions , shot down the suggestion on tuesday .
" if special economic zones were a successful model , then eastern germany should have been a flourishing landscape in the face of lower wages and longer working hours , " sommer told daily tagesspiegel . he added that the discussion was n't just wrong , but also dangerous .
" conservative politicians want to exploit the woes of the east , to first catapult the special economic zone and then the whole country into the past , " he thundered . criticism of the plan has also emanated from german industry , which is struggling to recover from a recession .

labor unions are up in arms . also charged with rebuilding germany 's five former communist eastern states , german transportation minister manfred stolpe on tuesday weighed in on the furious debate sparked by the publication of a controversial government-commissioned report last week on germany 's disastrous bid to modernize its eastern states since 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said he was in favor of setting up special low wage sectors in the eastern states , where the state would pay out a part of the salaries .
" it 's a thought that one must seriously pursue , " stolpe said in an interview with business daily handelsblatt . the minister added that the so-called wage subsidies , which would amount to welfare benefits being rebundled as cash incentives instead of as entitlements , could be tied into a law for " regions for innovation " currently being drafted by economics minister wolfgang clement .
" we must examine , how far we can get it into the program of the economics minister , " stolpe said . the " regions for innovation " law , which clement is expected to introduce this year , aims at cutting red tape and repealing certain regulations in construction and planning laws in order to boost the depressed economy in the east . proposal takes up commission 's recommendation stolpe 's plan for wage subsidies for germany 's eastern states echoes a key proposal put forth by the government-commissioned panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi last week . the commission 's report - openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the former communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 - largely concluded that the € 90 billion -lrb- $ 107.9 billion -rrb- berlin spends annually on rebuilding the so-called new federal states is wasted and that stagnant eastern germany is now dragging the wealthier west into ruin . in addition to cash incentives for guaranteed jobs , the commission also suggested a new master reconstruction plan , long-term tax relief for eastern german companies , concentration of economic aid in specific growth centers and the inclusion of at least one eastern german firm in tenders for government contracts to counter years of flawed eastern policy . fears of eu expansion stolpe has defended his plan of special low wage zones in eastern germany by pointing towards the likely consequences of the european union 's expansion in may when it takes in ten new mainly former communist eastern european countries . the minister warned that enlargement would lead to a flood of workers from neighboring eastern european countries taking up most low wage jobs in eastern germany .
stolpe pointed out that it would be an unacceptable situation , particularly because long-term unemployment in eastern germany is on the rise from year to year .
the dohnanyi report pointed out that chronically high unemployment of almost 20 percent is exacerbating the region 's problems . the minister has argued that it 's thus all the more important that workers in low cost sectors in eastern germany have the possibility of a wage supplement in addition to welfare benefits . unions irked by plan however stolpe 's proposal is expected to run into stiff opposition from the country 's powerful labor unions , many of whom fear that it would water down hard negotiated wage agreements with industries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german federation of trade unions , shot down the suggestion on tuesday .
" if special economic zones were a successful model , then eastern germany should have been a flourishing landscape in the face of lower wages and longer working hours , " sommer told daily tagesspiegel . he added that the discussion was n't just wrong , but also dangerous .
" conservative politicians want to exploit the woes of the east , to first catapult the special economic zone and then the whole country into the past , " he thundered . criticism of the plan has also emanated from german industry , which is struggling to recover from a recession . " if something is right , why should it just take place in eastern germany , " asked klaus zimmermann , president of the german institute for economic research .
" now the whole of germany is a special economic zone . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de has rebuilding east germany failed ?
germany 's attempt to rebuild its once communist east has been an unmitigated disaster and the massive financial transfers from the west endanger the entire nation 's economy , according to a government-commissioned report .

a month and a half after the death of president boris trajkovski in a plane crash , macedonians are to elect a new head of state .
all four candidates say they 'll embrace trajkovski 's commitment to bury ethnic enmities . the four men vying to replace boris trajkovski in wednesday 's elections all have one important thing in common with the late macedonian president , analysts say .
like him , they want to bury past ethnic divisions that nearly led the country into civil war , and focus on bringing macedonia closer in line with the european union .
up until his death in a february plane crash , trajkovski had been one of the most energetic proponents of closer ties between macedonia and europe .
he was also well-practiced at balancing the demands of macedonian hard-liners and ethnic albanian politicians . so far , the 2001 peace deal he presided over has remained in place .
the deal laid out reforms to end tensions between the two ethnic groups , making it possible to turn politicians ' attention to the country 's pressing economic problems , including a 40 percent unemployment rate . crvenkovski favored to win the next macedonian president will inherit trajkovski 's legacy .
the favored candidate is the country 's prime minister , branko crvenkovski , who represents the macedonian majority .
the post of president is largely ceremonial , so it is seen as a testament to the importance of trajkovski 's successor that crvenkovski is willing to risk his more powerful role as prime minister . crvenkovski 's campaign posters show him at the side of world leaders such as u.s. president george w. bush and u.n. secretary-general kofi annan .
his slogan reads : " branko crvenkovski : the statesman . " " we need good interethnic relations , peace and security , " he told a rally on monday .
" it means membership in nato and the european union .
let 's grab the chance . " crvenkovski 's main rival in the election is another macedonian , sasko kedev of the opposition vmro party .
though he is largely unknown , analysts have not ruled out a surprise victory for kedev , who 's been positioning himself as the " new face of macedonia . " albanian candidates ' slim hopes two ethnic albanians are also in the race , though they are reported to have little chance of winning .
ethnic albanians make up only a quarter of the population , and macedonian voters are unlikely to cross ethnic lines . another possible outcome is no outcome - at least in the first round .
for the election to be valid , the winner has to receive over 50 percent of the vote .
with four candidates , it 's likely that there will be a second round runoff between the top two candidates . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de president 's death throws pall over macedonia 's eu drive macedonian president boris trajkovski died in a plane crash over bosnia on thursday .

a month and a half after the death of president boris trajkovski in a plane crash , macedonians are to elect a new head of state .
all four candidates say they 'll embrace trajkovski 's commitment to bury ethnic enmities . the four men vying to replace boris trajkovski in wednesday 's elections all have one important thing in common with the late macedonian president , analysts say .
like him , they want to bury past ethnic divisions that nearly led the country into civil war , and focus on bringing macedonia closer in line with the european union .
up until his death in a february plane crash , trajkovski had been one of the most energetic proponents of closer ties between macedonia and europe .
he was also well-practiced at balancing the demands of macedonian hard-liners and ethnic albanian politicians . so far , the 2001 peace deal he presided over has remained in place .
the deal laid out reforms to end tensions between the two ethnic groups , making it possible to turn politicians ' attention to the country 's pressing economic problems , including a 40 percent unemployment rate . crvenkovski favored to win the next macedonian president will inherit trajkovski 's legacy .
the favored candidate is the country 's prime minister , branko crvenkovski , who represents the macedonian majority .
the post of president is largely ceremonial , so it is seen as a testament to the importance of trajkovski 's successor that crvenkovski is willing to risk his more powerful role as prime minister . crvenkovski 's campaign posters show him at the side of world leaders such as u.s. president george w. bush and u.n. secretary-general kofi annan .
his slogan reads : " branko crvenkovski : the statesman . " " we need good interethnic relations , peace and security , " he told a rally on monday .
" it means membership in nato and the european union .
let 's grab the chance . " crvenkovski 's main rival in the election is another macedonian , sasko kedev of the opposition vmro party .
though he is largely unknown , analysts have not ruled out a surprise victory for kedev , who 's been positioning himself as the " new face of macedonia . " albanian candidates ' slim hopes two ethnic albanians are also in the race , though they are reported to have little chance of winning .
ethnic albanians make up only a quarter of the population , and macedonian voters are unlikely to cross ethnic lines . another possible outcome is no outcome - at least in the first round .
for the election to be valid , the winner has to receive over 50 percent of the vote .
with four candidates , it 's likely that there will be a second round runoff between the top two candidates . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de president 's death throws pall over macedonia 's eu drive macedonian president boris trajkovski died in a plane crash over bosnia on thursday .

now a christian democratic politician has proposed incentives for church tax payers , in the hopes that people will stop leaving in droves . christian böhr took advantage of the easter holiday , when the churches enjoy throngs of visitors , to announce that the growing number of people opting out of the christian churches was an ominous development that had to be stopped . " leaving the church should not be a scheme to save taxes , " the christian democratic party 's deputy chairman proclaimed monday .
böhr proposed that germans be offered tax incentives so they will stay in the church .
he said catholics and protestants should be allowed to deduct 20 percent of the church tax they pay from their income tax . the government should examine his proposal , which could save easily taxpayers around € 100 -lrb- $ 119 -rrb- per year , böhr said .
the state would profit from giving church taxpayers a break .
" the churches run numerous kindergartens , hospitals , schools or social stations . "
if the churches lost funding , they would be forced to close such institutions , böhr claimed . state collection plate church tax in germany means that germans fund the country 's christian churches whether they donate to the collection plate or not .
but taxpayers can already deduct the payments on their tax declarations as expenses . germans pay 8 to 9 percent of their income tax if they are members in one of the recognized religious communities .
most germans are born into the catholic or protestant church .
they start paying church tax as soon as they start working ; parents pay church tax on their children 's behalf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishops in the cologne cathedral in 2002 , the churches received € 3.35 billion -lrb- $ 4.02 billion -rrb- in church tax revenue . the german state agreed long ago with the catholic and protestant churches that it would collect the levy and pass it on to them , and the state 's right do so is even laid out in germany 's constitution .
other religious communities can also claim a piece of the pie , as long as they are registered as statutory bodies and recognized by the individual german states , which are responsible for collecting the tax . in berlin , the old catholic church , which split from roman catholicism in the late 19th century , also receives tax revenues from its members , and in other german states confessions such as judaism get church tax money , berlin senate spokesman matthias kolbeck told dw-world .
leaving the lap of the church the only way people can avoid paying the levy is by officially getting out of the church and that 's exactly what thousands of people do each year .
only 63.8 percent of the 82 million people in germany are members of the roman catholic or protestant church , and the numbers have been dropping dramatically for years .
in 2002 over 119,000 people got out of the roman catholic church .
the most recent figures from the protestant church show that nearly 172,000 members opted out in 2001 .
from 1992 to 2001 almost 1.4 million people became former catholics and nearly 2.4 million germans left protestantism . but not everyone who leaves the church is just out to save taxes .

now a christian democratic politician has proposed incentives for church tax payers , in the hopes that people will stop leaving in droves . christian böhr took advantage of the easter holiday , when the churches enjoy throngs of visitors , to announce that the growing number of people opting out of the christian churches was an ominous development that had to be stopped . " leaving the church should not be a scheme to save taxes , " the christian democratic party 's deputy chairman proclaimed monday .
böhr proposed that germans be offered tax incentives so they will stay in the church .
he said catholics and protestants should be allowed to deduct 20 percent of the church tax they pay from their income tax . the government should examine his proposal , which could save easily taxpayers around € 100 -lrb- $ 119 -rrb- per year , böhr said .
the state would profit from giving church taxpayers a break .
" the churches run numerous kindergartens , hospitals , schools or social stations . "
if the churches lost funding , they would be forced to close such institutions , böhr claimed . state collection plate church tax in germany means that germans fund the country 's christian churches whether they donate to the collection plate or not .
but taxpayers can already deduct the payments on their tax declarations as expenses . germans pay 8 to 9 percent of their income tax if they are members in one of the recognized religious communities .
most germans are born into the catholic or protestant church .
they start paying church tax as soon as they start working ; parents pay church tax on their children 's behalf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishops in the cologne cathedral in 2002 , the churches received € 3.35 billion -lrb- $ 4.02 billion -rrb- in church tax revenue . the german state agreed long ago with the catholic and protestant churches that it would collect the levy and pass it on to them , and the state 's right do so is even laid out in germany 's constitution .
other religious communities can also claim a piece of the pie , as long as they are registered as statutory bodies and recognized by the individual german states , which are responsible for collecting the tax . in berlin , the old catholic church , which split from roman catholicism in the late 19th century , also receives tax revenues from its members , and in other german states confessions such as judaism get church tax money , berlin senate spokesman matthias kolbeck told dw-world .
leaving the lap of the church the only way people can avoid paying the levy is by officially getting out of the church and that 's exactly what thousands of people do each year .
only 63.8 percent of the 82 million people in germany are members of the roman catholic or protestant church , and the numbers have been dropping dramatically for years .
in 2002 over 119,000 people got out of the roman catholic church .
the most recent figures from the protestant church show that nearly 172,000 members opted out in 2001 .
from 1992 to 2001 almost 1.4 million people became former catholics and nearly 2.4 million germans left protestantism . but not everyone who leaves the church is just out to save taxes .

at the same time , german aid organizations completed their withdrawal from iraq . as unsubstantiated reports are circulating about the possible deaths of the two german security officials abducted in iraq last wednesday , the german foreign ministry has advised its citizens to leave iraq .
the warning comes a day after what is thought to be the last group of german humanitarian workers in iraq were pulled out of the country on monday . " german citizens are advised to leave iraq , " the foreign ministry statement warned .
" in the face of developments in the region , be advised there is also a high security risk in kuwait .

the german foreign ministry issued a warning on tuesday for its citizens to leave iraq as the spate of foreign kidnappings continues .
at the same time , german aid organizations completed their withdrawal from iraq . as unsubstantiated reports are circulating about the possible deaths of the two german security officials abducted in iraq last wednesday , the german foreign ministry has advised its citizens to leave iraq .
the warning comes a day after what is thought to be the last group of german humanitarian workers in iraq were pulled out of the country on monday . " german citizens are advised to leave iraq , " the foreign ministry statement warned .
" in the face of developments in the region , be advised there is also a high security risk in kuwait .
because of the situation in iraq , people are again urgently warned against travel in the neighbouring country . " the statement was issued as unconfirmed reports suggested that the two security agents from the german embassy in baghdad who went missing last week when they disappeared during a routine exchange of staff are now dead .
the men , said to be members of germany 's elite gsg-9 special forces group , were travelling from baghdad to jordan when they were ambushed by unknown assailants . missing men feared dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobias ritrath , 25 , and thomas haffenker , 38 , have been missing since wednesday .
since no kidnap claim has been issued , the german foreign ministry concluded that the men , identified in german media reports as tobias ritrath , 25 , and thomas haffenker , 38 , may have been killed during the attack near the sunni town of falluja , the scene of the recent uprising 's most violent escalations . a reporter for the london-based daily telegraph newspaper in the city has said he saw the bodies of two germans in the area while germany 's ard television reported on monday that the german embassy in baghdad had received a videotape showing the corpses of two men which staffers had identified as the missing security officials . aid agencies pull out last remaining staff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunni insurgents guard in fallujah .
meanwhile , german aid organizations evacuated their last four workers from iraq on monday due to the deteriorating security situation , a spokesman for " aktion deutschland hilft " told reporters .
wolfgang nierwetberg of the bonn-based agency said that the last four members of a 10-person team removing munitions from residential areas left baghdad on a u.n. aircraft for amman .
" every foreigner is now being seen as a prime target .
the danger has become too high , " nierwetberg said . forty-five iraqi workers assisting the group in its project to clear mines , reopen channels of food distribution and install water purification systems have stayed in place in an attempt to continue the german organization 's work in baghdad . all german charity workers are now thought to have pulled out of iraq .
around 60 germans are thought to remain in the country , most of them either journalists or people with iraqi partners .
germany has no troops deployed in iraq . as the security situation deteriorates further in iraq , other foreign aid agencies have taken the decision to suspend operations .
on friday , french group premiere urgence , one of the few charities still operating in iraq , also put its work on hold .
" premiere urgence is alarmed at the chaos into which iraq has plunged and is provisionally suspending its activities , " the organization said in a statement . abduction a growing threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrator holds a poster with pictures of the japanese hostages held by militants in iraq .
the growing unrest has increased the danger of the situation for foreigners in iraq .
several foreigners have been taken hostage on the dangerous route between baghdad and amman which passes by falluja , where a sunni insurgency against u.s. forces intensified this week .
fighting has been heavy in iraq in the past week , and several civilians have either been kidnapped or killed . there are fears for two czechs , reportedly television journalists , after a taxi firm told afp news agency they were abducted en route to jordan and also for the japanese hostages who were taken last week and whose fate remains unknown .
on tuesday , at least eight russian engineers were kidnapped as they relaxed in the courtyard of their house in the iraqi capital .
the men have since been released again , russian news agency interfax reported on tuesday . seven chinese men kidnapped on sunday near falluja were released on tuesday . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de missing germans believed dead the latest violence in iraq is thought to have claimed the lives of two germans , the foreign ministry said .

following a damning report on germany 's efforts to rebuild its once communist east , transportation minister manfred stolpe has proposed setting up special low wage zones in the east .
labor unions are up in arms . also charged with rebuilding germany 's five former communist eastern states , german transportation minister manfred stolpe on tuesday weighed in on the furious debate sparked by the publication of a controversial government-commissioned report last week on germany 's disastrous bid to modernize its eastern states since 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said he was in favor of setting up special low wage sectors in the eastern states , where the state would pay out a part of the salaries .
" it 's a thought that one must seriously pursue , " stolpe said in an interview with business daily handelsblatt . the minister added that the so-called wage subsidies , which would amount to welfare benefits being rebundled as cash incentives instead of as entitlements , could be tied into a law for " regions for innovation " currently being drafted by economics minister wolfgang clement .
" we must examine , how far we can get it into the program of the economics minister , " stolpe said . the " regions for innovation " law , which clement is expected to introduce this year , aims at cutting red tape and repealing certain regulations in construction and planning laws in order to boost the depressed economy in the east . proposal takes up commission 's recommendation stolpe 's plan for wage subsidies for germany 's eastern states echoes a key proposal put forth by the government-commissioned panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi last week . the commission 's report - openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the former communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 - largely concluded that the € 90 billion -lrb- $ 107.9 billion -rrb- berlin spends annually on rebuilding the so-called new federal states is wasted and that stagnant eastern germany is now dragging the wealthier west into ruin . in addition to cash incentives for guaranteed jobs , the commission also suggested a new master reconstruction plan , long-term tax relief for eastern german companies , concentration of economic aid in specific growth centers and the inclusion of at least one eastern german firm in tenders for government contracts to counter years of flawed eastern policy . fears of eu expansion stolpe has defended his plan of special low wage zones in eastern germany by pointing towards the likely consequences of the european union 's expansion in may when it takes in ten new mainly former communist eastern european countries . the minister warned that enlargement would lead to a flood of workers from neighboring eastern european countries taking up most low wage jobs in eastern germany .
stolpe pointed out that it would be an unacceptable situation , particularly because long-term unemployment in eastern germany is on the rise from year to year .
the dohnanyi report pointed out that chronically high unemployment of almost 20 percent is exacerbating the region 's problems . the minister has argued that it 's thus all the more important that workers in low cost sectors in eastern germany have the possibility of a wage supplement in addition to welfare benefits . unions irked by plan however stolpe 's proposal is expected to run into stiff opposition from the country 's powerful labor unions , many of whom fear that it would water down hard negotiated wage agreements with industries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german federation of trade unions , shot down the suggestion on tuesday .
" if special economic zones were a successful model , then eastern germany should have been a flourishing landscape in the face of lower wages and longer working hours , " sommer told daily tagesspiegel . he added that the discussion was n't just wrong , but also dangerous .
" conservative politicians want to exploit the woes of the east , to first catapult the special economic zone and then the whole country into the past , " he thundered . criticism of the plan has also emanated from german industry , which is struggling to recover from a recession .

the dohnanyi report pointed out that chronically high unemployment of almost 20 percent is exacerbating the region 's problems . the minister has argued that it 's thus all the more important that workers in low cost sectors in eastern germany have the possibility of a wage supplement in addition to welfare benefits . unions irked by plan however stolpe 's proposal is expected to run into stiff opposition from the country 's powerful labor unions , many of whom fear that it would water down hard negotiated wage agreements with industries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german federation of trade unions , shot down the suggestion on tuesday .
" if special economic zones were a successful model , then eastern germany should have been a flourishing landscape in the face of lower wages and longer working hours , " sommer told daily tagesspiegel . he added that the discussion was n't just wrong , but also dangerous .
" conservative politicians want to exploit the woes of the east , to first catapult the special economic zone and then the whole country into the past , " he thundered . criticism of the plan has also emanated from german industry , which is struggling to recover from a recession . " if something is right , why should it just take place in eastern germany , " asked klaus zimmermann , president of the german institute for economic research .
" now the whole of germany is a special economic zone . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de has rebuilding east germany failed ?
germany 's attempt to rebuild its once communist east has been an unmitigated disaster and the massive financial transfers from the west endanger the entire nation 's economy , according to a government-commissioned report .

" headscarves are the opposite of integration " europe 's integration challenge germany -pipe- 13.04.2004 " what 's in people 's heads is important " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth has been the commissioner of human rights and humanitarian aid since 2003 .
dw-world : opposition christian democrats say germany has n't been an immigrant country since it stopped recruiting foreigners in 1972 .
do you think germany is an immigrant country ? claudia roth : it ’ s one of the biggest lies of past decades to say that germany isn ’ t a real immigrant country .
we have been an immigrant country for over 50 years , and people have come here who have helped to build this country .
but what we are not is an immigrant country that has managed to regulate immigration , to protect the right to asylum and to foster integration . what is successful integration ? successful integration is much more than acquiring language skills .
integration must be related to legal integration , to education and work .
legal integration means , for example , eased naturalization , a citizenship right that we changed . successful integration means that the wealth people possess , who come here from other cultures , from other languages , from different religions is understood as wealth and not as a threat .
that we build on these abilities by providing native language opportunities and at the same time fostering the german language much more purposefully and much more consistently among the people who come here . successful integration is also an expression of the education opportunities that immigrants ' children have in our country .
if social origin remains the most decisive factor in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education access for immigrant children : " we have a lot of catching up to do . " when it comes to access and school problems - that children with immigrant backgrounds , above all , have - we have a lot of catching up to do .
in the areas of work , training , joblessness the numbers show that immigrants are much more frequently affected by unemployment , that young people have big difficulties advancing into higher spheres . we have big deficits , and that also arises from the ideological refusal to say we are an immigrant country .
people come here ; people should come here .
it makes our country richer , more multifaceted . has integration made progress in germany or has it regressed ? it hasn ’ t regressed .
at least there ’ s a consensus that integration is important .
there are certainly many very positive signals of successful integration , but there are also negative signals .
groups exist that withdraw into their alleged own cultures .
you have the feeling there are groups of immigrants who wall themselves into an alleged culture of their country of origin .
turkey , for example .
sometimes i have the feeling things are much more open in istanbul or izmir than in some areas of germany .
a similar problem : ethnic germans -lrb- from eastern europe -rrb- , who for decades in russia , in the other countries where they lived , holed themselves up in their alleged german culture and came to germany and noticed it ’ s somehow totally different , and then they aren ’ t able to cope . some have pointed to the muslim headscarf as a symbol of cultural isolation and social exclusion following a ruling by germany 's high court allowing a muslim teacher to wear her headscarf in class if there is no state law against it .
does it in fact signify the social exclusion of women ? i wouldn ’ t put it so simply .
we greens advocate throughout the world that there shouldn ’ t be constraints requiring wearing a headscarf .
why should i advocate constraints in germany not to wear a headscarf ? but the case that the issue is pegged on , a teacher who is german , who studied at german universities , who is everything but the exemplification of an oppressed woman , but rather lives highly emancipated and self-determined , to claim that she is the example of the greatest form of oppression is wrong . there are many reasons why women in our country wear headscarves .
i might like them or not .
i wouldn ’ t forcefully impose something in the german democracy that i fight in other countries : the constraint of self-determination .
i don ’ t believe in carrying out women ’ s liberation in the form of discrimination .
and women ’ s emancipation , women ’ s equality is definitely not expressed just by the headscarf . is wearing a headscarf compatible with integration ? i think so .
the headscarf issue isn ’ t an issue of the willingness to become integrated , rather it ’ s important what ’ s in people ’ s heads , what ’ s happening underneath the headscarf and how our democracy is interpreted and accepted . can a strictly devout muslim become an integrated german citizen ? a strictly devout muslim can be integrated into our society just as a strictly devout catholic can . does islam have a future in germany and europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " islam has a present and a future . "
it doesn ’ t only have a future , it has a present , whether we like it or not .
it ’ s a question of democracy .
even now islam is the second largest religious community in the european union .
islam per se isn ’ t an enemy just like christianity per se isn ’ t an enemy .
we would be wise to treat the religious practices of different religions in our society equally , with the greatest meticulousness , particularly by virtue of our own historical responsibility and democratic sensibilities . why has germany failed to pass an immigration law yet ? because the ideological barriers are infinitely high here .
because this issue is always an issue that surfaces in the maelstrom of populist politics here .
because problems are very easily diverted onto weak groups in out society that have little lobby , like immigrants .
because people refuse future-oriented modern policies despite knowing better . we need this immigration law .
we need it urgently , because we can ’ t compete anymore with other european countries .
but we only need an immigration law if immigration is truly regulated .
what we don ’ t need is an immigration limitation law . nancy isenson interviewed claudia roth send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" headscarves are the opposite of integration " europe 's integration challenge germany -pipe- 13.04.2004 " what 's in people 's heads is important " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth has been the commissioner of human rights and humanitarian aid since 2003 .
dw-world : opposition christian democrats say germany has n't been an immigrant country since it stopped recruiting foreigners in 1972 .
do you think germany is an immigrant country ? claudia roth : it ’ s one of the biggest lies of past decades to say that germany isn ’ t a real immigrant country .
we have been an immigrant country for over 50 years , and people have come here who have helped to build this country .
but what we are not is an immigrant country that has managed to regulate immigration , to protect the right to asylum and to foster integration . what is successful integration ? successful integration is much more than acquiring language skills .
integration must be related to legal integration , to education and work .
legal integration means , for example , eased naturalization , a citizenship right that we changed . successful integration means that the wealth people possess , who come here from other cultures , from other languages , from different religions is understood as wealth and not as a threat .
that we build on these abilities by providing native language opportunities and at the same time fostering the german language much more purposefully and much more consistently among the people who come here . successful integration is also an expression of the education opportunities that immigrants ' children have in our country .
if social origin remains the most decisive factor in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education access for immigrant children : " we have a lot of catching up to do . " when it comes to access and school problems - that children with immigrant backgrounds , above all , have - we have a lot of catching up to do .
in the areas of work , training , joblessness the numbers show that immigrants are much more frequently affected by unemployment , that young people have big difficulties advancing into higher spheres . we have big deficits , and that also arises from the ideological refusal to say we are an immigrant country .
people come here ; people should come here .
it makes our country richer , more multifaceted . has integration made progress in germany or has it regressed ? it hasn ’ t regressed .
at least there ’ s a consensus that integration is important .
there are certainly many very positive signals of successful integration , but there are also negative signals .
groups exist that withdraw into their alleged own cultures .
you have the feeling there are groups of immigrants who wall themselves into an alleged culture of their country of origin .
turkey , for example .
sometimes i have the feeling things are much more open in istanbul or izmir than in some areas of germany .
a similar problem : ethnic germans -lrb- from eastern europe -rrb- , who for decades in russia , in the other countries where they lived , holed themselves up in their alleged german culture and came to germany and noticed it ’ s somehow totally different , and then they aren ’ t able to cope . some have pointed to the muslim headscarf as a symbol of cultural isolation and social exclusion following a ruling by germany 's high court allowing a muslim teacher to wear her headscarf in class if there is no state law against it .
does it in fact signify the social exclusion of women ? i wouldn ’ t put it so simply .
we greens advocate throughout the world that there shouldn ’ t be constraints requiring wearing a headscarf .
why should i advocate constraints in germany not to wear a headscarf ? but the case that the issue is pegged on , a teacher who is german , who studied at german universities , who is everything but the exemplification of an oppressed woman , but rather lives highly emancipated and self-determined , to claim that she is the example of the greatest form of oppression is wrong . there are many reasons why women in our country wear headscarves .
i might like them or not .
i wouldn ’ t forcefully impose something in the german democracy that i fight in other countries : the constraint of self-determination .
i don ’ t believe in carrying out women ’ s liberation in the form of discrimination .

" headscarves are the opposite of integration " europe 's integration challenge germany -pipe- 13.04.2004 " what 's in people 's heads is important " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth has been the commissioner of human rights and humanitarian aid since 2003 .
dw-world : opposition christian democrats say germany has n't been an immigrant country since it stopped recruiting foreigners in 1972 .
do you think germany is an immigrant country ? claudia roth : it ’ s one of the biggest lies of past decades to say that germany isn ’ t a real immigrant country .
we have been an immigrant country for over 50 years , and people have come here who have helped to build this country .
but what we are not is an immigrant country that has managed to regulate immigration , to protect the right to asylum and to foster integration . what is successful integration ? successful integration is much more than acquiring language skills .
integration must be related to legal integration , to education and work .
legal integration means , for example , eased naturalization , a citizenship right that we changed . successful integration means that the wealth people possess , who come here from other cultures , from other languages , from different religions is understood as wealth and not as a threat .
that we build on these abilities by providing native language opportunities and at the same time fostering the german language much more purposefully and much more consistently among the people who come here . successful integration is also an expression of the education opportunities that immigrants ' children have in our country .
if social origin remains the most decisive factor in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education access for immigrant children : " we have a lot of catching up to do . " when it comes to access and school problems - that children with immigrant backgrounds , above all , have - we have a lot of catching up to do .
in the areas of work , training , joblessness the numbers show that immigrants are much more frequently affected by unemployment , that young people have big difficulties advancing into higher spheres . we have big deficits , and that also arises from the ideological refusal to say we are an immigrant country .
people come here ; people should come here .
it makes our country richer , more multifaceted . has integration made progress in germany or has it regressed ? it hasn ’ t regressed .
at least there ’ s a consensus that integration is important .
there are certainly many very positive signals of successful integration , but there are also negative signals .
groups exist that withdraw into their alleged own cultures .
you have the feeling there are groups of immigrants who wall themselves into an alleged culture of their country of origin .
turkey , for example .
sometimes i have the feeling things are much more open in istanbul or izmir than in some areas of germany .
a similar problem : ethnic germans -lrb- from eastern europe -rrb- , who for decades in russia , in the other countries where they lived , holed themselves up in their alleged german culture and came to germany and noticed it ’ s somehow totally different , and then they aren ’ t able to cope . some have pointed to the muslim headscarf as a symbol of cultural isolation and social exclusion following a ruling by germany 's high court allowing a muslim teacher to wear her headscarf in class if there is no state law against it .
does it in fact signify the social exclusion of women ? i wouldn ’ t put it so simply .
we greens advocate throughout the world that there shouldn ’ t be constraints requiring wearing a headscarf .
why should i advocate constraints in germany not to wear a headscarf ? but the case that the issue is pegged on , a teacher who is german , who studied at german universities , who is everything but the exemplification of an oppressed woman , but rather lives highly emancipated and self-determined , to claim that she is the example of the greatest form of oppression is wrong . there are many reasons why women in our country wear headscarves .
i might like them or not .
i wouldn ’ t forcefully impose something in the german democracy that i fight in other countries : the constraint of self-determination .
i don ’ t believe in carrying out women ’ s liberation in the form of discrimination .
and women ’ s emancipation , women ’ s equality is definitely not expressed just by the headscarf . is wearing a headscarf compatible with integration ? i think so .
the headscarf issue isn ’ t an issue of the willingness to become integrated , rather it ’ s important what ’ s in people ’ s heads , what ’ s happening underneath the headscarf and how our democracy is interpreted and accepted . can a strictly devout muslim become an integrated german citizen ? a strictly devout muslim can be integrated into our society just as a strictly devout catholic can . does islam have a future in germany and europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " islam has a present and a future . "
it doesn ’ t only have a future , it has a present , whether we like it or not .
it ’ s a question of democracy .
even now islam is the second largest religious community in the european union .
islam per se isn ’ t an enemy just like christianity per se isn ’ t an enemy .
we would be wise to treat the religious practices of different religions in our society equally , with the greatest meticulousness , particularly by virtue of our own historical responsibility and democratic sensibilities . why has germany failed to pass an immigration law yet ? because the ideological barriers are infinitely high here .
because this issue is always an issue that surfaces in the maelstrom of populist politics here .
because problems are very easily diverted onto weak groups in out society that have little lobby , like immigrants .
because people refuse future-oriented modern policies despite knowing better . we need this immigration law .
we need it urgently , because we can ’ t compete anymore with other european countries .
but we only need an immigration law if immigration is truly regulated .
what we don ’ t need is an immigration limitation law . nancy isenson interviewed claudia roth send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" what 's in people 's heads is important " europe 's integration challenge germany -pipe- 13.04.2004 " headscarves are the opposite of integration " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach is the conservatives ' point man on integration and immigration .
dw-world : foreigners make up nearly one-tenth of germany 's population .
is germany an immigrant country ? wolfgang bosbach : that 's purely a question of definition .
one can say a country is an immigrant country when there 's a noteworthy amount of immigration .
of course , germany is an immigrant country , like all countries .
however , one can also say - and this definition seems the right one to me - a country only becomes an immigrant country when it recruits immigrants .
that 's something we stopped doing in 1973 . we recruited immigrants for 18 years , from 1954 to 1973 .
then we recruited guest workers to come and work and then to leave again .
what we experienced was that they came , they worked here , but many of them stayed and brought over their families . in recent years , we have all come to the conclusion that we need a systematic integration policy under the heading " encourage but also demand . " what is successful integration ? integration is a success when you say , " i did n't just come to germany to work , to live , to have a better life than i did at home .
instead , i have found a new home in germany . "
that thought describes the situation better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " germans have to learn to approach immigrants . "
more than just learning the language is necessary , including being oriented in social relations , the country 's history .
on the one side , immigrants must be prepared to put effort into becoming integrated and to adapt to the germans .
on the other side , germans have to learn to approach immigrants .
we have to approach each other . has integration made progress in germany or has it regressed ? we have done both at the same time .
on the one hand , there 's no doubt that millions of immigrants have become superbly integrated , that they are our neighbors in the best sense of the word , that we do n't view them as foreigners ' in quotation marks ' anymore .
they are our colleagues , our teammates .
they play a role in local organizations and in church communities . on the other hand , especially in the big cities , where we have a high concentration of foreigners , parallel societies have developed .
that 's not good for integration .
if my neighbor , my baker , my butcher , my doctor , my lawyer are foreigners like me , why should i make an effort to become integrated , since i already get along fine . is wearing a headscarf compatible with integration ? no , the headscarf is the opposite of integration . it 's not for me to comment on - and certainly not to criticize - whether someone wears a headscarf as an expression of her religious convictions .
that is the individual 's decision .
just as you probably can not force someone to become integrated . but we have to differentiate between wearing a headscarf in public and wearing a headscarf when working as a civil servant .
it 's different , for example , with a teacher , who the children can not avoid .
we ca n't tolerate that .
that is no longer an issue of private convictions . but , the headscarf is not only an expression of religious conviction .
rather , it is also a symbol of social separation .
in a judeo-christian culture , one consciously dissociates oneself from the majority society with a headscarf . can a devout muslim become an integrated german citizen ? i do n't doubt that at all .
in a country marked by judeo-christianity there 's no question about which faith is more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in a country marked by judeo-christianity there 's no question about which faith is more important . " important .
we have freedom of religion .
we do n't have a state religion .
we have the separation between church and state .
i have respect for every devout muslim .
why should n't they apply for german citizenship ? does islam have a future in germany and europe ? islam is advancing and not just in europe .
no one questions islam 's right to exist .
we are a very tolerant country .
but tolerance must end , where religious convictions lead to totalitarian pretenses , where people aim to demolish our state and legal system to establish a theocracy based on islam . why has germany failed to pass an immigration law yet ? people sometimes get the impression we do n't have any legislation on foreigners in germany .
we do have a foreigners law , asylum laws , a multitude of regulations .
now the question is whether the new social democratic-green immigration bill is in the country 's interest , whether it will create more problems or solve more problems . if we agree , we will have an entirely new immigration law .
for the social democratic-green bill is not an amendment to the existing foreigner legislation .

" what 's in people 's heads is important " europe 's integration challenge germany -pipe- 13.04.2004 " headscarves are the opposite of integration " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach is the conservatives ' point man on integration and immigration .
dw-world : foreigners make up nearly one-tenth of germany 's population .
is germany an immigrant country ? wolfgang bosbach : that 's purely a question of definition .
one can say a country is an immigrant country when there 's a noteworthy amount of immigration .
of course , germany is an immigrant country , like all countries .
however , one can also say - and this definition seems the right one to me - a country only becomes an immigrant country when it recruits immigrants .
that 's something we stopped doing in 1973 . we recruited immigrants for 18 years , from 1954 to 1973 .
then we recruited guest workers to come and work and then to leave again .
what we experienced was that they came , they worked here , but many of them stayed and brought over their families . in recent years , we have all come to the conclusion that we need a systematic integration policy under the heading " encourage but also demand . " what is successful integration ? integration is a success when you say , " i did n't just come to germany to work , to live , to have a better life than i did at home .
instead , i have found a new home in germany . "
that thought describes the situation better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " germans have to learn to approach immigrants . "
more than just learning the language is necessary , including being oriented in social relations , the country 's history .
on the one side , immigrants must be prepared to put effort into becoming integrated and to adapt to the germans .
on the other side , germans have to learn to approach immigrants .
we have to approach each other . has integration made progress in germany or has it regressed ? we have done both at the same time .
on the one hand , there 's no doubt that millions of immigrants have become superbly integrated , that they are our neighbors in the best sense of the word , that we do n't view them as foreigners ' in quotation marks ' anymore .

" what 's in people 's heads is important " europe 's integration challenge germany -pipe- 13.04.2004 " headscarves are the opposite of integration " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach is the conservatives ' point man on integration and immigration .
dw-world : foreigners make up nearly one-tenth of germany 's population .
is germany an immigrant country ? wolfgang bosbach : that 's purely a question of definition .
one can say a country is an immigrant country when there 's a noteworthy amount of immigration .
of course , germany is an immigrant country , like all countries .
however , one can also say - and this definition seems the right one to me - a country only becomes an immigrant country when it recruits immigrants .
that 's something we stopped doing in 1973 . we recruited immigrants for 18 years , from 1954 to 1973 .
then we recruited guest workers to come and work and then to leave again .
what we experienced was that they came , they worked here , but many of them stayed and brought over their families . in recent years , we have all come to the conclusion that we need a systematic integration policy under the heading " encourage but also demand . " what is successful integration ? integration is a success when you say , " i did n't just come to germany to work , to live , to have a better life than i did at home .
instead , i have found a new home in germany . "
that thought describes the situation better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " germans have to learn to approach immigrants . "
more than just learning the language is necessary , including being oriented in social relations , the country 's history .
on the one side , immigrants must be prepared to put effort into becoming integrated and to adapt to the germans .
on the other side , germans have to learn to approach immigrants .
we have to approach each other . has integration made progress in germany or has it regressed ? we have done both at the same time .
on the one hand , there 's no doubt that millions of immigrants have become superbly integrated , that they are our neighbors in the best sense of the word , that we do n't view them as foreigners ' in quotation marks ' anymore .
they are our colleagues , our teammates .
they play a role in local organizations and in church communities . on the other hand , especially in the big cities , where we have a high concentration of foreigners , parallel societies have developed .
that 's not good for integration .
if my neighbor , my baker , my butcher , my doctor , my lawyer are foreigners like me , why should i make an effort to become integrated , since i already get along fine . is wearing a headscarf compatible with integration ? no , the headscarf is the opposite of integration . it 's not for me to comment on - and certainly not to criticize - whether someone wears a headscarf as an expression of her religious convictions .
that is the individual 's decision .
just as you probably can not force someone to become integrated . but we have to differentiate between wearing a headscarf in public and wearing a headscarf when working as a civil servant .
it 's different , for example , with a teacher , who the children can not avoid .
we ca n't tolerate that .
that is no longer an issue of private convictions . but , the headscarf is not only an expression of religious conviction .
rather , it is also a symbol of social separation .
in a judeo-christian culture , one consciously dissociates oneself from the majority society with a headscarf . can a devout muslim become an integrated german citizen ? i do n't doubt that at all .
in a country marked by judeo-christianity there 's no question about which faith is more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in a country marked by judeo-christianity there 's no question about which faith is more important . " important .
we have freedom of religion .
we do n't have a state religion .
we have the separation between church and state .
i have respect for every devout muslim .
why should n't they apply for german citizenship ? does islam have a future in germany and europe ? islam is advancing and not just in europe .
no one questions islam 's right to exist .
we are a very tolerant country .
but tolerance must end , where religious convictions lead to totalitarian pretenses , where people aim to demolish our state and legal system to establish a theocracy based on islam . why has germany failed to pass an immigration law yet ? people sometimes get the impression we do n't have any legislation on foreigners in germany .
we do have a foreigners law , asylum laws , a multitude of regulations .
now the question is whether the new social democratic-green immigration bill is in the country 's interest , whether it will create more problems or solve more problems . if we agree , we will have an entirely new immigration law .
for the social democratic-green bill is not an amendment to the existing foreigner legislation .
rather , it is an entirely new law .
if we do n't agree the existing legislation will remain . nancy isenson interviewed wolfgang bosbach send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" what 's in people 's heads is important " europe 's integration challenge germany -pipe- 13.04.2004 " headscarves are the opposite of integration " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach is the conservatives ' point man on integration and immigration .
dw-world : foreigners make up nearly one-tenth of germany 's population .
is germany an immigrant country ? wolfgang bosbach : that 's purely a question of definition .
one can say a country is an immigrant country when there 's a noteworthy amount of immigration .
of course , germany is an immigrant country , like all countries .
however , one can also say - and this definition seems the right one to me - a country only becomes an immigrant country when it recruits immigrants .
that 's something we stopped doing in 1973 . we recruited immigrants for 18 years , from 1954 to 1973 .
then we recruited guest workers to come and work and then to leave again .
what we experienced was that they came , they worked here , but many of them stayed and brought over their families . in recent years , we have all come to the conclusion that we need a systematic integration policy under the heading " encourage but also demand . " what is successful integration ? integration is a success when you say , " i did n't just come to germany to work , to live , to have a better life than i did at home .
instead , i have found a new home in germany . "
that thought describes the situation better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " germans have to learn to approach immigrants . "
more than just learning the language is necessary , including being oriented in social relations , the country 's history .
on the one side , immigrants must be prepared to put effort into becoming integrated and to adapt to the germans .
on the other side , germans have to learn to approach immigrants .
we have to approach each other . has integration made progress in germany or has it regressed ? we have done both at the same time .
on the one hand , there 's no doubt that millions of immigrants have become superbly integrated , that they are our neighbors in the best sense of the word , that we do n't view them as foreigners ' in quotation marks ' anymore .
they are our colleagues , our teammates .
they play a role in local organizations and in church communities . on the other hand , especially in the big cities , where we have a high concentration of foreigners , parallel societies have developed .
that 's not good for integration .
if my neighbor , my baker , my butcher , my doctor , my lawyer are foreigners like me , why should i make an effort to become integrated , since i already get along fine . is wearing a headscarf compatible with integration ? no , the headscarf is the opposite of integration . it 's not for me to comment on - and certainly not to criticize - whether someone wears a headscarf as an expression of her religious convictions .
that is the individual 's decision .
just as you probably can not force someone to become integrated . but we have to differentiate between wearing a headscarf in public and wearing a headscarf when working as a civil servant .
it 's different , for example , with a teacher , who the children can not avoid .
we ca n't tolerate that .
that is no longer an issue of private convictions . but , the headscarf is not only an expression of religious conviction .
rather , it is also a symbol of social separation .
in a judeo-christian culture , one consciously dissociates oneself from the majority society with a headscarf . can a devout muslim become an integrated german citizen ? i do n't doubt that at all .
in a country marked by judeo-christianity there 's no question about which faith is more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in a country marked by judeo-christianity there 's no question about which faith is more important . " important .
we have freedom of religion .
we do n't have a state religion .
we have the separation between church and state .
i have respect for every devout muslim .
why should n't they apply for german citizenship ? does islam have a future in germany and europe ? islam is advancing and not just in europe .
no one questions islam 's right to exist .
we are a very tolerant country .
but tolerance must end , where religious convictions lead to totalitarian pretenses , where people aim to demolish our state and legal system to establish a theocracy based on islam . why has germany failed to pass an immigration law yet ? people sometimes get the impression we do n't have any legislation on foreigners in germany .
we do have a foreigners law , asylum laws , a multitude of regulations .
now the question is whether the new social democratic-green immigration bill is in the country 's interest , whether it will create more problems or solve more problems . if we agree , we will have an entirely new immigration law .

" headscarves are the opposite of integration " europe 's integration challenge germany -pipe- 13.04.2004 " what 's in people 's heads is important " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth has been the commissioner of human rights and humanitarian aid since 2003 .
dw-world : opposition christian democrats say germany has n't been an immigrant country since it stopped recruiting foreigners in 1972 .
do you think germany is an immigrant country ? claudia roth : it ’ s one of the biggest lies of past decades to say that germany isn ’ t a real immigrant country .
we have been an immigrant country for over 50 years , and people have come here who have helped to build this country .
but what we are not is an immigrant country that has managed to regulate immigration , to protect the right to asylum and to foster integration . what is successful integration ? successful integration is much more than acquiring language skills .
integration must be related to legal integration , to education and work .
legal integration means , for example , eased naturalization , a citizenship right that we changed . successful integration means that the wealth people possess , who come here from other cultures , from other languages , from different religions is understood as wealth and not as a threat .
that we build on these abilities by providing native language opportunities and at the same time fostering the german language much more purposefully and much more consistently among the people who come here . successful integration is also an expression of the education opportunities that immigrants ' children have in our country .
if social origin remains the most decisive factor in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education access for immigrant children : " we have a lot of catching up to do . " when it comes to access and school problems - that children with immigrant backgrounds , above all , have - we have a lot of catching up to do .
in the areas of work , training , joblessness the numbers show that immigrants are much more frequently affected by unemployment , that young people have big difficulties advancing into higher spheres . we have big deficits , and that also arises from the ideological refusal to say we are an immigrant country .
people come here ; people should come here .
it makes our country richer , more multifaceted . has integration made progress in germany or has it regressed ? it hasn ’ t regressed .
at least there ’ s a consensus that integration is important .
there are certainly many very positive signals of successful integration , but there are also negative signals .
groups exist that withdraw into their alleged own cultures .
you have the feeling there are groups of immigrants who wall themselves into an alleged culture of their country of origin .
turkey , for example .
sometimes i have the feeling things are much more open in istanbul or izmir than in some areas of germany .
a similar problem : ethnic germans -lrb- from eastern europe -rrb- , who for decades in russia , in the other countries where they lived , holed themselves up in their alleged german culture and came to germany and noticed it ’ s somehow totally different , and then they aren ’ t able to cope . some have pointed to the muslim headscarf as a symbol of cultural isolation and social exclusion following a ruling by germany 's high court allowing a muslim teacher to wear her headscarf in class if there is no state law against it .
does it in fact signify the social exclusion of women ? i wouldn ’ t put it so simply .
we greens advocate throughout the world that there shouldn ’ t be constraints requiring wearing a headscarf .
why should i advocate constraints in germany not to wear a headscarf ? but the case that the issue is pegged on , a teacher who is german , who studied at german universities , who is everything but the exemplification of an oppressed woman , but rather lives highly emancipated and self-determined , to claim that she is the example of the greatest form of oppression is wrong . there are many reasons why women in our country wear headscarves .
i might like them or not .
i wouldn ’ t forcefully impose something in the german democracy that i fight in other countries : the constraint of self-determination .
i don ’ t believe in carrying out women ’ s liberation in the form of discrimination .
and women ’ s emancipation , women ’ s equality is definitely not expressed just by the headscarf . is wearing a headscarf compatible with integration ? i think so .
the headscarf issue isn ’ t an issue of the willingness to become integrated , rather it ’ s important what ’ s in people ’ s heads , what ’ s happening underneath the headscarf and how our democracy is interpreted and accepted . can a strictly devout muslim become an integrated german citizen ? a strictly devout muslim can be integrated into our society just as a strictly devout catholic can . does islam have a future in germany and europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " islam has a present and a future . "
it doesn ’ t only have a future , it has a present , whether we like it or not .
it ’ s a question of democracy .
even now islam is the second largest religious community in the european union .
islam per se isn ’ t an enemy just like christianity per se isn ’ t an enemy .
we would be wise to treat the religious practices of different religions in our society equally , with the greatest meticulousness , particularly by virtue of our own historical responsibility and democratic sensibilities . why has germany failed to pass an immigration law yet ? because the ideological barriers are infinitely high here .
because this issue is always an issue that surfaces in the maelstrom of populist politics here .
because problems are very easily diverted onto weak groups in out society that have little lobby , like immigrants .
because people refuse future-oriented modern policies despite knowing better . we need this immigration law .
we need it urgently , because we can ’ t compete anymore with other european countries .
but we only need an immigration law if immigration is truly regulated .
what we don ’ t need is an immigration limitation law . nancy isenson interviewed claudia roth send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

that we build on these abilities by providing native language opportunities and at the same time fostering the german language much more purposefully and much more consistently among the people who come here . successful integration is also an expression of the education opportunities that immigrants ' children have in our country .
if social origin remains the most decisive factor in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education access for immigrant children : " we have a lot of catching up to do . " when it comes to access and school problems - that children with immigrant backgrounds , above all , have - we have a lot of catching up to do .
in the areas of work , training , joblessness the numbers show that immigrants are much more frequently affected by unemployment , that young people have big difficulties advancing into higher spheres . we have big deficits , and that also arises from the ideological refusal to say we are an immigrant country .
people come here ; people should come here .
it makes our country richer , more multifaceted . has integration made progress in germany or has it regressed ? it hasn ’ t regressed .
at least there ’ s a consensus that integration is important .
there are certainly many very positive signals of successful integration , but there are also negative signals .
groups exist that withdraw into their alleged own cultures .
you have the feeling there are groups of immigrants who wall themselves into an alleged culture of their country of origin .
turkey , for example .
sometimes i have the feeling things are much more open in istanbul or izmir than in some areas of germany .
a similar problem : ethnic germans -lrb- from eastern europe -rrb- , who for decades in russia , in the other countries where they lived , holed themselves up in their alleged german culture and came to germany and noticed it ’ s somehow totally different , and then they aren ’ t able to cope . some have pointed to the muslim headscarf as a symbol of cultural isolation and social exclusion following a ruling by germany 's high court allowing a muslim teacher to wear her headscarf in class if there is no state law against it .
does it in fact signify the social exclusion of women ? i wouldn ’ t put it so simply .
we greens advocate throughout the world that there shouldn ’ t be constraints requiring wearing a headscarf .
why should i advocate constraints in germany not to wear a headscarf ? but the case that the issue is pegged on , a teacher who is german , who studied at german universities , who is everything but the exemplification of an oppressed woman , but rather lives highly emancipated and self-determined , to claim that she is the example of the greatest form of oppression is wrong . there are many reasons why women in our country wear headscarves .
i might like them or not .
i wouldn ’ t forcefully impose something in the german democracy that i fight in other countries : the constraint of self-determination .
i don ’ t believe in carrying out women ’ s liberation in the form of discrimination .
and women ’ s emancipation , women ’ s equality is definitely not expressed just by the headscarf . is wearing a headscarf compatible with integration ? i think so .
the headscarf issue isn ’ t an issue of the willingness to become integrated , rather it ’ s important what ’ s in people ’ s heads , what ’ s happening underneath the headscarf and how our democracy is interpreted and accepted . can a strictly devout muslim become an integrated german citizen ? a strictly devout muslim can be integrated into our society just as a strictly devout catholic can . does islam have a future in germany and europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " islam has a present and a future . "
it doesn ’ t only have a future , it has a present , whether we like it or not .
it ’ s a question of democracy .
even now islam is the second largest religious community in the european union .
islam per se isn ’ t an enemy just like christianity per se isn ’ t an enemy .
we would be wise to treat the religious practices of different religions in our society equally , with the greatest meticulousness , particularly by virtue of our own historical responsibility and democratic sensibilities . why has germany failed to pass an immigration law yet ? because the ideological barriers are infinitely high here .
because this issue is always an issue that surfaces in the maelstrom of populist politics here .
because problems are very easily diverted onto weak groups in out society that have little lobby , like immigrants .
because people refuse future-oriented modern policies despite knowing better . we need this immigration law .
we need it urgently , because we can ’ t compete anymore with other european countries .

why should i advocate constraints in germany not to wear a headscarf ? but the case that the issue is pegged on , a teacher who is german , who studied at german universities , who is everything but the exemplification of an oppressed woman , but rather lives highly emancipated and self-determined , to claim that she is the example of the greatest form of oppression is wrong . there are many reasons why women in our country wear headscarves .
i might like them or not .
i wouldn ’ t forcefully impose something in the german democracy that i fight in other countries : the constraint of self-determination .
i don ’ t believe in carrying out women ’ s liberation in the form of discrimination .
and women ’ s emancipation , women ’ s equality is definitely not expressed just by the headscarf . is wearing a headscarf compatible with integration ? i think so .
the headscarf issue isn ’ t an issue of the willingness to become integrated , rather it ’ s important what ’ s in people ’ s heads , what ’ s happening underneath the headscarf and how our democracy is interpreted and accepted . can a strictly devout muslim become an integrated german citizen ? a strictly devout muslim can be integrated into our society just as a strictly devout catholic can . does islam have a future in germany and europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " islam has a present and a future . "
it doesn ’ t only have a future , it has a present , whether we like it or not .
it ’ s a question of democracy .
even now islam is the second largest religious community in the european union .
islam per se isn ’ t an enemy just like christianity per se isn ’ t an enemy .
we would be wise to treat the religious practices of different religions in our society equally , with the greatest meticulousness , particularly by virtue of our own historical responsibility and democratic sensibilities . why has germany failed to pass an immigration law yet ? because the ideological barriers are infinitely high here .
because this issue is always an issue that surfaces in the maelstrom of populist politics here .
because problems are very easily diverted onto weak groups in out society that have little lobby , like immigrants .
because people refuse future-oriented modern policies despite knowing better . we need this immigration law .
we need it urgently , because we can ’ t compete anymore with other european countries .
but we only need an immigration law if immigration is truly regulated .
what we don ’ t need is an immigration limitation law . nancy isenson interviewed claudia roth send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" what 's in people 's heads is important " europe 's integration challenge germany -pipe- 13.04.2004 " headscarves are the opposite of integration " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach is the conservatives ' point man on integration and immigration .
dw-world : foreigners make up nearly one-tenth of germany 's population .
is germany an immigrant country ? wolfgang bosbach : that 's purely a question of definition .
one can say a country is an immigrant country when there 's a noteworthy amount of immigration .
of course , germany is an immigrant country , like all countries .
however , one can also say - and this definition seems the right one to me - a country only becomes an immigrant country when it recruits immigrants .
that 's something we stopped doing in 1973 . we recruited immigrants for 18 years , from 1954 to 1973 .
then we recruited guest workers to come and work and then to leave again .
what we experienced was that they came , they worked here , but many of them stayed and brought over their families . in recent years , we have all come to the conclusion that we need a systematic integration policy under the heading " encourage but also demand . " what is successful integration ? integration is a success when you say , " i did n't just come to germany to work , to live , to have a better life than i did at home .
instead , i have found a new home in germany . "
that thought describes the situation better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " germans have to learn to approach immigrants . "
more than just learning the language is necessary , including being oriented in social relations , the country 's history .
on the one side , immigrants must be prepared to put effort into becoming integrated and to adapt to the germans .
on the other side , germans have to learn to approach immigrants .
we have to approach each other . has integration made progress in germany or has it regressed ? we have done both at the same time .
on the one hand , there 's no doubt that millions of immigrants have become superbly integrated , that they are our neighbors in the best sense of the word , that we do n't view them as foreigners ' in quotation marks ' anymore .
they are our colleagues , our teammates .
they play a role in local organizations and in church communities . on the other hand , especially in the big cities , where we have a high concentration of foreigners , parallel societies have developed .
that 's not good for integration .
if my neighbor , my baker , my butcher , my doctor , my lawyer are foreigners like me , why should i make an effort to become integrated , since i already get along fine . is wearing a headscarf compatible with integration ? no , the headscarf is the opposite of integration . it 's not for me to comment on - and certainly not to criticize - whether someone wears a headscarf as an expression of her religious convictions .
that is the individual 's decision .
just as you probably can not force someone to become integrated . but we have to differentiate between wearing a headscarf in public and wearing a headscarf when working as a civil servant .
it 's different , for example , with a teacher , who the children can not avoid .
we ca n't tolerate that .
that is no longer an issue of private convictions . but , the headscarf is not only an expression of religious conviction .
rather , it is also a symbol of social separation .
in a judeo-christian culture , one consciously dissociates oneself from the majority society with a headscarf . can a devout muslim become an integrated german citizen ? i do n't doubt that at all .
in a country marked by judeo-christianity there 's no question about which faith is more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in a country marked by judeo-christianity there 's no question about which faith is more important . " important .
we have freedom of religion .
we do n't have a state religion .
we have the separation between church and state .
i have respect for every devout muslim .
why should n't they apply for german citizenship ? does islam have a future in germany and europe ? islam is advancing and not just in europe .
no one questions islam 's right to exist .
we are a very tolerant country .
but tolerance must end , where religious convictions lead to totalitarian pretenses , where people aim to demolish our state and legal system to establish a theocracy based on islam . why has germany failed to pass an immigration law yet ? people sometimes get the impression we do n't have any legislation on foreigners in germany .
we do have a foreigners law , asylum laws , a multitude of regulations .
now the question is whether the new social democratic-green immigration bill is in the country 's interest , whether it will create more problems or solve more problems . if we agree , we will have an entirely new immigration law .
for the social democratic-green bill is not an amendment to the existing foreigner legislation .
rather , it is an entirely new law .

" what 's in people 's heads is important " europe 's integration challenge germany -pipe- 13.04.2004 " headscarves are the opposite of integration " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach is the conservatives ' point man on integration and immigration .
dw-world : foreigners make up nearly one-tenth of germany 's population .
is germany an immigrant country ? wolfgang bosbach : that 's purely a question of definition .
one can say a country is an immigrant country when there 's a noteworthy amount of immigration .
of course , germany is an immigrant country , like all countries .
however , one can also say - and this definition seems the right one to me - a country only becomes an immigrant country when it recruits immigrants .
that 's something we stopped doing in 1973 . we recruited immigrants for 18 years , from 1954 to 1973 .
then we recruited guest workers to come and work and then to leave again .
what we experienced was that they came , they worked here , but many of them stayed and brought over their families . in recent years , we have all come to the conclusion that we need a systematic integration policy under the heading " encourage but also demand . " what is successful integration ? integration is a success when you say , " i did n't just come to germany to work , to live , to have a better life than i did at home .
instead , i have found a new home in germany . "
that thought describes the situation better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " germans have to learn to approach immigrants . "
more than just learning the language is necessary , including being oriented in social relations , the country 's history .
on the one side , immigrants must be prepared to put effort into becoming integrated and to adapt to the germans .
on the other side , germans have to learn to approach immigrants .
we have to approach each other . has integration made progress in germany or has it regressed ? we have done both at the same time .
on the one hand , there 's no doubt that millions of immigrants have become superbly integrated , that they are our neighbors in the best sense of the word , that we do n't view them as foreigners ' in quotation marks ' anymore .
they are our colleagues , our teammates .
they play a role in local organizations and in church communities . on the other hand , especially in the big cities , where we have a high concentration of foreigners , parallel societies have developed .
that 's not good for integration .
if my neighbor , my baker , my butcher , my doctor , my lawyer are foreigners like me , why should i make an effort to become integrated , since i already get along fine . is wearing a headscarf compatible with integration ? no , the headscarf is the opposite of integration . it 's not for me to comment on - and certainly not to criticize - whether someone wears a headscarf as an expression of her religious convictions .
that is the individual 's decision .
just as you probably can not force someone to become integrated . but we have to differentiate between wearing a headscarf in public and wearing a headscarf when working as a civil servant .
it 's different , for example , with a teacher , who the children can not avoid .
we ca n't tolerate that .
that is no longer an issue of private convictions . but , the headscarf is not only an expression of religious conviction .
rather , it is also a symbol of social separation .
in a judeo-christian culture , one consciously dissociates oneself from the majority society with a headscarf . can a devout muslim become an integrated german citizen ? i do n't doubt that at all .
in a country marked by judeo-christianity there 's no question about which faith is more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in a country marked by judeo-christianity there 's no question about which faith is more important . " important .
we have freedom of religion .
we do n't have a state religion .
we have the separation between church and state .
i have respect for every devout muslim .
why should n't they apply for german citizenship ? does islam have a future in germany and europe ? islam is advancing and not just in europe .
no one questions islam 's right to exist .
we are a very tolerant country .
but tolerance must end , where religious convictions lead to totalitarian pretenses , where people aim to demolish our state and legal system to establish a theocracy based on islam . why has germany failed to pass an immigration law yet ? people sometimes get the impression we do n't have any legislation on foreigners in germany .
we do have a foreigners law , asylum laws , a multitude of regulations .
now the question is whether the new social democratic-green immigration bill is in the country 's interest , whether it will create more problems or solve more problems . if we agree , we will have an entirely new immigration law .
for the social democratic-green bill is not an amendment to the existing foreigner legislation .
rather , it is an entirely new law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.04.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc eu parliament quizzes new commissioners each of the new eu commissioners will go through a hearing of over an hour and a quarter by members of parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- to determine their commitment , qualifications and plans for the job which sees them as ' trainee commissioners ' until end of october .
running from tuesday to thursday , the hearings likely to attract most media attention are those of estonia 's siim kallas and the czech republic 's pavel telicka .
a former prime minister and finance minister of the small baltic state , kallas was a member of the communist party of the soviet union from 1972 to 1990 while telicka was a member of the communist party before the fall of communism in the former czechoslovakia in 1989 .
telicka 's case is compounded by the fact that he did not have full support by the coalition government for his nomination .
the issue came to the headlines in february when the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- passed a resolution calling on those looking for political posts in the eu to " disclose their professional and political activities in former communist states . "
after this week 's hearing , the european parliament as a whole will vote on whether to approve the new enlarged commission on may 5 .
this interim commission , with 30 members , will be in place until the end of october .
from 1 november , the number will sink to 25 again as france , the uk , germany , spain and italy each give up their right to a second commissioner .
-lrb- euobserver.com -rrb- dw-world.de candidates for eu commission put to the test european commission candidates from the accession states are currently shadowing officials in brussels , learning the ropes .
but they must still face a confirmation process that could uncover skeletons in the closet .

running from tuesday to thursday , the hearings likely to attract most media attention are those of estonia 's siim kallas and the czech republic 's pavel telicka .
a former prime minister and finance minister of the small baltic state , kallas was a member of the communist party of the soviet union from 1972 to 1990 while telicka was a member of the communist party before the fall of communism in the former czechoslovakia in 1989 .

after this week 's hearing , the european parliament as a whole will vote on whether to approve the new enlarged commission on may 5 .

running from tuesday to thursday , the hearings likely to attract most media attention are those of estonia 's siim kallas and the czech republic 's pavel telicka .
a former prime minister and finance minister of the small baltic state , kallas was a member of the communist party of the soviet union from 1972 to 1990 while telicka was a member of the communist party before the fall of communism in the former czechoslovakia in 1989 .
telicka 's case is compounded by the fact that he did not have full support by the coalition government for his nomination .
the issue came to the headlines in february when the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- passed a resolution calling on those looking for political posts in the eu to " disclose their professional and political activities in former communist states . "
after this week 's hearing , the european parliament as a whole will vote on whether to approve the new enlarged commission on may 5 .
this interim commission , with 30 members , will be in place until the end of october .
from 1 november , the number will sink to 25 again as france , the uk , germany , spain and italy each give up their right to a second commissioner .

the pressure to rationalize must be shifted from work to energy use , loske said .
developing the so-called " ecology tax " levied on gasoline , electricity and energy would encourage businesses to cut down on energy use rather than employees .
loske said the ecology tax had been a success , leading to a nearly 10 percent drop in gas consumption .
he added that as a result of the tax , germans still only had to pay 19.5 percent of wages in social security payments .
without the tax , which is used to pay for social security , the amount would have climbed to 21.2 percent by now , according to loske .

the pressure to rationalize must be shifted from work to energy use , loske said .
developing the so-called " ecology tax " levied on gasoline , electricity and energy would encourage businesses to cut down on energy use rather than employees .
loske said the ecology tax had been a success , leading to a nearly 10 percent drop in gas consumption .
he added that as a result of the tax , germans still only had to pay 19.5 percent of wages in social security payments .
without the tax , which is used to pay for social security , the amount would have climbed to 21.2 percent by now , according to loske .

now a christian democratic politician has proposed incentives for church tax payers , in the hopes that people will stop leaving in droves . christian böhr took advantage of the easter holiday , when the churches enjoy throngs of visitors , to announce that the growing number of people opting out of the christian churches was an ominous development that had to be stopped . " leaving the church should not be a scheme to save taxes , " the christian democratic party 's deputy chairman proclaimed monday .
böhr proposed that germans be offered tax incentives so they will stay in the church .
he said catholics and protestants should be allowed to deduct 20 percent of the church tax they pay from their income tax . the government should examine his proposal , which could save easily taxpayers around € 100 -lrb- $ 119 -rrb- per year , böhr said .
the state would profit from giving church taxpayers a break .
" the churches run numerous kindergartens , hospitals , schools or social stations . "
if the churches lost funding , they would be forced to close such institutions , böhr claimed . state collection plate church tax in germany means that germans fund the country 's christian churches whether they donate to the collection plate or not .
but taxpayers can already deduct the payments on their tax declarations as expenses . germans pay 8 to 9 percent of their income tax if they are members in one of the recognized religious communities .
most germans are born into the catholic or protestant church .
they start paying church tax as soon as they start working ; parents pay church tax on their children 's behalf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishops in the cologne cathedral in 2002 , the churches received € 3.35 billion -lrb- $ 4.02 billion -rrb- in church tax revenue . the german state agreed long ago with the catholic and protestant churches that it would collect the levy and pass it on to them , and the state 's right do so is even laid out in germany 's constitution .
other religious communities can also claim a piece of the pie , as long as they are registered as statutory bodies and recognized by the individual german states , which are responsible for collecting the tax . in berlin , the old catholic church , which split from roman catholicism in the late 19th century , also receives tax revenues from its members , and in other german states confessions such as judaism get church tax money , berlin senate spokesman matthias kolbeck told dw-world .
leaving the lap of the church the only way people can avoid paying the levy is by officially getting out of the church and that 's exactly what thousands of people do each year .
only 63.8 percent of the 82 million people in germany are members of the roman catholic or protestant church , and the numbers have been dropping dramatically for years .
in 2002 over 119,000 people got out of the roman catholic church .
the most recent figures from the protestant church show that nearly 172,000 members opted out in 2001 .
from 1992 to 2001 almost 1.4 million people became former catholics and nearly 2.4 million germans left protestantism . but not everyone who leaves the church is just out to save taxes .
the badische neueste nachrichten newspaper commented on böhr 's proposal : " the 300,000 christians who turned their back on the two big christian churches … did n't all leave because of church tax , but frequently for other reasons : many view the church , especially the catholic church , as strangely out-of-touch . " and for years , critics of the tax have said that it should be transformed into a levy to benefit culture in general .
" a culture tax that everyone had to pay would be fairer in every way - potentially with the requirement that the taxpayer can designate which statutory body should receive the money , " the nürnberger zeitung paper wrote . nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tax cuts leave germans cold a poll conducted by the forsa opinion research company shows that the majority of germans do not feel that the 2004 tax cuts of € 15 billion -lrb- $ 18.3 billion -rrb- are having much effect on their disposable income .

now a christian democratic politician has proposed incentives for church tax payers , in the hopes that people will stop leaving in droves . christian böhr took advantage of the easter holiday , when the churches enjoy throngs of visitors , to announce that the growing number of people opting out of the christian churches was an ominous development that had to be stopped . " leaving the church should not be a scheme to save taxes , " the christian democratic party 's deputy chairman proclaimed monday .
böhr proposed that germans be offered tax incentives so they will stay in the church .
he said catholics and protestants should be allowed to deduct 20 percent of the church tax they pay from their income tax . the government should examine his proposal , which could save easily taxpayers around € 100 -lrb- $ 119 -rrb- per year , böhr said .
the state would profit from giving church taxpayers a break .
" the churches run numerous kindergartens , hospitals , schools or social stations . "
if the churches lost funding , they would be forced to close such institutions , böhr claimed . state collection plate church tax in germany means that germans fund the country 's christian churches whether they donate to the collection plate or not .
but taxpayers can already deduct the payments on their tax declarations as expenses . germans pay 8 to 9 percent of their income tax if they are members in one of the recognized religious communities .
most germans are born into the catholic or protestant church .
they start paying church tax as soon as they start working ; parents pay church tax on their children 's behalf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishops in the cologne cathedral in 2002 , the churches received € 3.35 billion -lrb- $ 4.02 billion -rrb- in church tax revenue . the german state agreed long ago with the catholic and protestant churches that it would collect the levy and pass it on to them , and the state 's right do so is even laid out in germany 's constitution .
other religious communities can also claim a piece of the pie , as long as they are registered as statutory bodies and recognized by the individual german states , which are responsible for collecting the tax . in berlin , the old catholic church , which split from roman catholicism in the late 19th century , also receives tax revenues from its members , and in other german states confessions such as judaism get church tax money , berlin senate spokesman matthias kolbeck told dw-world .
leaving the lap of the church the only way people can avoid paying the levy is by officially getting out of the church and that 's exactly what thousands of people do each year .
only 63.8 percent of the 82 million people in germany are members of the roman catholic or protestant church , and the numbers have been dropping dramatically for years .
in 2002 over 119,000 people got out of the roman catholic church .
the most recent figures from the protestant church show that nearly 172,000 members opted out in 2001 .
from 1992 to 2001 almost 1.4 million people became former catholics and nearly 2.4 million germans left protestantism . but not everyone who leaves the church is just out to save taxes .

following a damning report on germany 's efforts to rebuild its once communist east , transportation minister manfred stolpe has proposed setting up special low wage zones in the east .
labor unions are up in arms . also charged with rebuilding germany 's five former communist eastern states , german transportation minister manfred stolpe on tuesday weighed in on the furious debate sparked by the publication of a controversial government-commissioned report last week on germany 's disastrous bid to modernize its eastern states since 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said he was in favor of setting up special low wage sectors in the eastern states , where the state would pay out a part of the salaries .
" it 's a thought that one must seriously pursue , " stolpe said in an interview with business daily handelsblatt . the minister added that the so-called wage subsidies , which would amount to welfare benefits being rebundled as cash incentives instead of as entitlements , could be tied into a law for " regions for innovation " currently being drafted by economics minister wolfgang clement .
" we must examine , how far we can get it into the program of the economics minister , " stolpe said . the " regions for innovation " law , which clement is expected to introduce this year , aims at cutting red tape and repealing certain regulations in construction and planning laws in order to boost the depressed economy in the east . proposal takes up commission 's recommendation stolpe 's plan for wage subsidies for germany 's eastern states echoes a key proposal put forth by the government-commissioned panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi last week . the commission 's report - openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the former communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 - largely concluded that the € 90 billion -lrb- $ 107.9 billion -rrb- berlin spends annually on rebuilding the so-called new federal states is wasted and that stagnant eastern germany is now dragging the wealthier west into ruin . in addition to cash incentives for guaranteed jobs , the commission also suggested a new master reconstruction plan , long-term tax relief for eastern german companies , concentration of economic aid in specific growth centers and the inclusion of at least one eastern german firm in tenders for government contracts to counter years of flawed eastern policy . fears of eu expansion stolpe has defended his plan of special low wage zones in eastern germany by pointing towards the likely consequences of the european union 's expansion in may when it takes in ten new mainly former communist eastern european countries . the minister warned that enlargement would lead to a flood of workers from neighboring eastern european countries taking up most low wage jobs in eastern germany .
stolpe pointed out that it would be an unacceptable situation , particularly because long-term unemployment in eastern germany is on the rise from year to year .
the dohnanyi report pointed out that chronically high unemployment of almost 20 percent is exacerbating the region 's problems . the minister has argued that it 's thus all the more important that workers in low cost sectors in eastern germany have the possibility of a wage supplement in addition to welfare benefits . unions irked by plan however stolpe 's proposal is expected to run into stiff opposition from the country 's powerful labor unions , many of whom fear that it would water down hard negotiated wage agreements with industries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german federation of trade unions , shot down the suggestion on tuesday .
" if special economic zones were a successful model , then eastern germany should have been a flourishing landscape in the face of lower wages and longer working hours , " sommer told daily tagesspiegel . he added that the discussion was n't just wrong , but also dangerous .
" conservative politicians want to exploit the woes of the east , to first catapult the special economic zone and then the whole country into the past , " he thundered . criticism of the plan has also emanated from german industry , which is struggling to recover from a recession . " if something is right , why should it just take place in eastern germany , " asked klaus zimmermann , president of the german institute for economic research .
" now the whole of germany is a special economic zone . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de has rebuilding east germany failed ?
germany 's attempt to rebuild its once communist east has been an unmitigated disaster and the massive financial transfers from the west endanger the entire nation 's economy , according to a government-commissioned report .

following a damning report on germany 's efforts to rebuild its once communist east , transportation minister manfred stolpe has proposed setting up special low wage zones in the east .
labor unions are up in arms . also charged with rebuilding germany 's five former communist eastern states , german transportation minister manfred stolpe on tuesday weighed in on the furious debate sparked by the publication of a controversial government-commissioned report last week on germany 's disastrous bid to modernize its eastern states since 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said he was in favor of setting up special low wage sectors in the eastern states , where the state would pay out a part of the salaries .
" it 's a thought that one must seriously pursue , " stolpe said in an interview with business daily handelsblatt . the minister added that the so-called wage subsidies , which would amount to welfare benefits being rebundled as cash incentives instead of as entitlements , could be tied into a law for " regions for innovation " currently being drafted by economics minister wolfgang clement .
" we must examine , how far we can get it into the program of the economics minister , " stolpe said . the " regions for innovation " law , which clement is expected to introduce this year , aims at cutting red tape and repealing certain regulations in construction and planning laws in order to boost the depressed economy in the east . proposal takes up commission 's recommendation stolpe 's plan for wage subsidies for germany 's eastern states echoes a key proposal put forth by the government-commissioned panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi last week . the commission 's report - openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the former communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 - largely concluded that the € 90 billion -lrb- $ 107.9 billion -rrb- berlin spends annually on rebuilding the so-called new federal states is wasted and that stagnant eastern germany is now dragging the wealthier west into ruin . in addition to cash incentives for guaranteed jobs , the commission also suggested a new master reconstruction plan , long-term tax relief for eastern german companies , concentration of economic aid in specific growth centers and the inclusion of at least one eastern german firm in tenders for government contracts to counter years of flawed eastern policy . fears of eu expansion stolpe has defended his plan of special low wage zones in eastern germany by pointing towards the likely consequences of the european union 's expansion in may when it takes in ten new mainly former communist eastern european countries . the minister warned that enlargement would lead to a flood of workers from neighboring eastern european countries taking up most low wage jobs in eastern germany .
stolpe pointed out that it would be an unacceptable situation , particularly because long-term unemployment in eastern germany is on the rise from year to year .
the dohnanyi report pointed out that chronically high unemployment of almost 20 percent is exacerbating the region 's problems . the minister has argued that it 's thus all the more important that workers in low cost sectors in eastern germany have the possibility of a wage supplement in addition to welfare benefits . unions irked by plan however stolpe 's proposal is expected to run into stiff opposition from the country 's powerful labor unions , many of whom fear that it would water down hard negotiated wage agreements with industries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german federation of trade unions , shot down the suggestion on tuesday .
" if special economic zones were a successful model , then eastern germany should have been a flourishing landscape in the face of lower wages and longer working hours , " sommer told daily tagesspiegel . he added that the discussion was n't just wrong , but also dangerous .
" conservative politicians want to exploit the woes of the east , to first catapult the special economic zone and then the whole country into the past , " he thundered . criticism of the plan has also emanated from german industry , which is struggling to recover from a recession .

" what 's in people 's heads is important " europe 's integration challenge germany -pipe- 13.04.2004 " headscarves are the opposite of integration " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach is the conservatives ' point man on integration and immigration .
dw-world : foreigners make up nearly one-tenth of germany 's population .
is germany an immigrant country ? wolfgang bosbach : that 's purely a question of definition .
one can say a country is an immigrant country when there 's a noteworthy amount of immigration .
of course , germany is an immigrant country , like all countries .
however , one can also say - and this definition seems the right one to me - a country only becomes an immigrant country when it recruits immigrants .
that 's something we stopped doing in 1973 . we recruited immigrants for 18 years , from 1954 to 1973 .
then we recruited guest workers to come and work and then to leave again .
what we experienced was that they came , they worked here , but many of them stayed and brought over their families . in recent years , we have all come to the conclusion that we need a systematic integration policy under the heading " encourage but also demand . " what is successful integration ? integration is a success when you say , " i did n't just come to germany to work , to live , to have a better life than i did at home .
instead , i have found a new home in germany . "
that thought describes the situation better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " germans have to learn to approach immigrants . "
more than just learning the language is necessary , including being oriented in social relations , the country 's history .
on the one side , immigrants must be prepared to put effort into becoming integrated and to adapt to the germans .
on the other side , germans have to learn to approach immigrants .
we have to approach each other . has integration made progress in germany or has it regressed ? we have done both at the same time .
on the one hand , there 's no doubt that millions of immigrants have become superbly integrated , that they are our neighbors in the best sense of the word , that we do n't view them as foreigners ' in quotation marks ' anymore .
they are our colleagues , our teammates .
they play a role in local organizations and in church communities . on the other hand , especially in the big cities , where we have a high concentration of foreigners , parallel societies have developed .
that 's not good for integration .
if my neighbor , my baker , my butcher , my doctor , my lawyer are foreigners like me , why should i make an effort to become integrated , since i already get along fine . is wearing a headscarf compatible with integration ? no , the headscarf is the opposite of integration . it 's not for me to comment on - and certainly not to criticize - whether someone wears a headscarf as an expression of her religious convictions .
that is the individual 's decision .
just as you probably can not force someone to become integrated . but we have to differentiate between wearing a headscarf in public and wearing a headscarf when working as a civil servant .
it 's different , for example , with a teacher , who the children can not avoid .
we ca n't tolerate that .
that is no longer an issue of private convictions . but , the headscarf is not only an expression of religious conviction .
rather , it is also a symbol of social separation .
in a judeo-christian culture , one consciously dissociates oneself from the majority society with a headscarf . can a devout muslim become an integrated german citizen ? i do n't doubt that at all .
in a country marked by judeo-christianity there 's no question about which faith is more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in a country marked by judeo-christianity there 's no question about which faith is more important . " important .
we have freedom of religion .
we do n't have a state religion .
we have the separation between church and state .
i have respect for every devout muslim .
why should n't they apply for german citizenship ? does islam have a future in germany and europe ? islam is advancing and not just in europe .
no one questions islam 's right to exist .
we are a very tolerant country .
but tolerance must end , where religious convictions lead to totalitarian pretenses , where people aim to demolish our state and legal system to establish a theocracy based on islam . why has germany failed to pass an immigration law yet ? people sometimes get the impression we do n't have any legislation on foreigners in germany .
we do have a foreigners law , asylum laws , a multitude of regulations .
now the question is whether the new social democratic-green immigration bill is in the country 's interest , whether it will create more problems or solve more problems . if we agree , we will have an entirely new immigration law .
for the social democratic-green bill is not an amendment to the existing foreigner legislation .

" what 's in people 's heads is important " europe 's integration challenge germany -pipe- 13.04.2004 " headscarves are the opposite of integration " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach is the conservatives ' point man on integration and immigration .
dw-world : foreigners make up nearly one-tenth of germany 's population .
is germany an immigrant country ? wolfgang bosbach : that 's purely a question of definition .
one can say a country is an immigrant country when there 's a noteworthy amount of immigration .
of course , germany is an immigrant country , like all countries .
however , one can also say - and this definition seems the right one to me - a country only becomes an immigrant country when it recruits immigrants .
that 's something we stopped doing in 1973 . we recruited immigrants for 18 years , from 1954 to 1973 .
then we recruited guest workers to come and work and then to leave again .
what we experienced was that they came , they worked here , but many of them stayed and brought over their families . in recent years , we have all come to the conclusion that we need a systematic integration policy under the heading " encourage but also demand . " what is successful integration ? integration is a success when you say , " i did n't just come to germany to work , to live , to have a better life than i did at home .
instead , i have found a new home in germany . "
that thought describes the situation better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " germans have to learn to approach immigrants . "
more than just learning the language is necessary , including being oriented in social relations , the country 's history .
on the one side , immigrants must be prepared to put effort into becoming integrated and to adapt to the germans .
on the other side , germans have to learn to approach immigrants .
we have to approach each other . has integration made progress in germany or has it regressed ? we have done both at the same time .
on the one hand , there 's no doubt that millions of immigrants have become superbly integrated , that they are our neighbors in the best sense of the word , that we do n't view them as foreigners ' in quotation marks ' anymore .
they are our colleagues , our teammates .
they play a role in local organizations and in church communities . on the other hand , especially in the big cities , where we have a high concentration of foreigners , parallel societies have developed .
that 's not good for integration .
if my neighbor , my baker , my butcher , my doctor , my lawyer are foreigners like me , why should i make an effort to become integrated , since i already get along fine . is wearing a headscarf compatible with integration ? no , the headscarf is the opposite of integration . it 's not for me to comment on - and certainly not to criticize - whether someone wears a headscarf as an expression of her religious convictions .
that is the individual 's decision .
just as you probably can not force someone to become integrated . but we have to differentiate between wearing a headscarf in public and wearing a headscarf when working as a civil servant .
it 's different , for example , with a teacher , who the children can not avoid .
we ca n't tolerate that .
that is no longer an issue of private convictions . but , the headscarf is not only an expression of religious conviction .
rather , it is also a symbol of social separation .
in a judeo-christian culture , one consciously dissociates oneself from the majority society with a headscarf . can a devout muslim become an integrated german citizen ? i do n't doubt that at all .
in a country marked by judeo-christianity there 's no question about which faith is more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in a country marked by judeo-christianity there 's no question about which faith is more important . " important .
we have freedom of religion .
we do n't have a state religion .
we have the separation between church and state .
i have respect for every devout muslim .
why should n't they apply for german citizenship ? does islam have a future in germany and europe ? islam is advancing and not just in europe .
no one questions islam 's right to exist .
we are a very tolerant country .
but tolerance must end , where religious convictions lead to totalitarian pretenses , where people aim to demolish our state and legal system to establish a theocracy based on islam . why has germany failed to pass an immigration law yet ? people sometimes get the impression we do n't have any legislation on foreigners in germany .
we do have a foreigners law , asylum laws , a multitude of regulations .
now the question is whether the new social democratic-green immigration bill is in the country 's interest , whether it will create more problems or solve more problems . if we agree , we will have an entirely new immigration law .
for the social democratic-green bill is not an amendment to the existing foreigner legislation .
rather , it is an entirely new law .

" what 's in people 's heads is important " europe 's integration challenge germany -pipe- 13.04.2004 " headscarves are the opposite of integration " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach is the conservatives ' point man on integration and immigration .
dw-world : foreigners make up nearly one-tenth of germany 's population .
is germany an immigrant country ? wolfgang bosbach : that 's purely a question of definition .
one can say a country is an immigrant country when there 's a noteworthy amount of immigration .
of course , germany is an immigrant country , like all countries .
however , one can also say - and this definition seems the right one to me - a country only becomes an immigrant country when it recruits immigrants .
that 's something we stopped doing in 1973 . we recruited immigrants for 18 years , from 1954 to 1973 .
then we recruited guest workers to come and work and then to leave again .
what we experienced was that they came , they worked here , but many of them stayed and brought over their families . in recent years , we have all come to the conclusion that we need a systematic integration policy under the heading " encourage but also demand . " what is successful integration ? integration is a success when you say , " i did n't just come to germany to work , to live , to have a better life than i did at home .
instead , i have found a new home in germany . "
that thought describes the situation better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " germans have to learn to approach immigrants . "
more than just learning the language is necessary , including being oriented in social relations , the country 's history .
on the one side , immigrants must be prepared to put effort into becoming integrated and to adapt to the germans .
on the other side , germans have to learn to approach immigrants .
we have to approach each other . has integration made progress in germany or has it regressed ? we have done both at the same time .
on the one hand , there 's no doubt that millions of immigrants have become superbly integrated , that they are our neighbors in the best sense of the word , that we do n't view them as foreigners ' in quotation marks ' anymore .
they are our colleagues , our teammates .
they play a role in local organizations and in church communities . on the other hand , especially in the big cities , where we have a high concentration of foreigners , parallel societies have developed .
that 's not good for integration .
if my neighbor , my baker , my butcher , my doctor , my lawyer are foreigners like me , why should i make an effort to become integrated , since i already get along fine . is wearing a headscarf compatible with integration ? no , the headscarf is the opposite of integration . it 's not for me to comment on - and certainly not to criticize - whether someone wears a headscarf as an expression of her religious convictions .
that is the individual 's decision .
just as you probably can not force someone to become integrated . but we have to differentiate between wearing a headscarf in public and wearing a headscarf when working as a civil servant .
it 's different , for example , with a teacher , who the children can not avoid .
we ca n't tolerate that .

that 's something we stopped doing in 1973 . we recruited immigrants for 18 years , from 1954 to 1973 .
then we recruited guest workers to come and work and then to leave again .
what we experienced was that they came , they worked here , but many of them stayed and brought over their families . in recent years , we have all come to the conclusion that we need a systematic integration policy under the heading " encourage but also demand .

instead , i have found a new home in germany . "

on the one side , immigrants must be prepared to put effort into becoming integrated and to adapt to the germans .
on the other side , germans have to learn to approach immigrants .
we have to approach each other . has integration made progress in germany or has it regressed ? we have done both at the same time .
on the one hand , there 's no doubt that millions of immigrants have become superbly integrated , that they are our neighbors in the best sense of the word , that we do n't view them as foreigners ' in quotation marks ' anymore .
they are our colleagues , our teammates .
they play a role in local organizations and in church communities . on the other hand , especially in the big cities , where we have a high concentration of foreigners , parallel societies have developed .
that 's not good for integration .
if my neighbor , my baker , my butcher , my doctor , my lawyer are foreigners like me , why should i make an effort to become integrated , since i already get along fine . is wearing a headscarf compatible with integration ? no , the headscarf is the opposite of integration . it 's not for me to comment on - and certainly not to criticize - whether someone wears a headscarf as an expression of her religious convictions .
that is the individual 's decision .
just as you probably can not force someone to become integrated . but we have to differentiate between wearing a headscarf in public and wearing a headscarf when working as a civil servant .
it 's different , for example , with a teacher , who the children can not avoid .
we ca n't tolerate that .
that is no longer an issue of private convictions . but , the headscarf is not only an expression of religious conviction .
rather , it is also a symbol of social separation .
in a judeo-christian culture , one consciously dissociates oneself from the majority society with a headscarf . can a devout muslim become an integrated german citizen ? i do n't doubt that at all .

the wherabouts of chinese and japanese hostages remain unknown . tobias ritrath , 25 , and thomas haffenker , 38 , went missing during a routine exchange of security personnel last wednesday . iraqi insurgents are believed to have attacked the security convoy carrying the men , who are part of the elite gsg-9 unit that protects the german embassy in baghdad , as it traveled through iraq on its way from amman , jordan , to the capital .
the convoy was traveling on a highway that skirts the cities of falluja and ramadi , flashpoints in the recent uprising against foreign troops .
the car carrying the men was surrounded , but the others managed to escape and complete their trip to baghdad .
brit : i saw their bodies germany 's foreign ministry said on sunday it was " highly likely " that the men were dead .
ard reported that a grave had been found , where the two men were thought to be buried .
officials at the german embassy in baghdad had reportedly seen video footage of the corpses and recognized the two men , according to ard .
a spokeswoman for the foreign ministry refused to comment on the information .
a reporter for the british daily telegraph said he had seen the bodies of two germans who had been killed in the area .
another witness told agence france presse that the toyota landcruiser the men were believed to be traveling in had been struck by a rocket .
more foreigners abducted meanwhile , the number of foreigners kidnapped in the region rose on sunday .
the chinese foreign ministry confirmed monday that seven of its nationals had been abducted .
the men , aged between 18 and 49 , were kidnapped west of baghdad after arriving in iraq by car from jordan on sunday morning .
it was unclear monday what had happened to three japanese hostages being held by insurgents .
their release was expected sunday , and they had been reported to be in safety .
but a japanese government spokesman said on monday that the reports remained unconfirmed . the captors had said they would kill the three if tokyo did n't remove its troops from iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : released british hostage gary teeley speaks to british service personnel on monday in shaibah , iraq on his first full day of freedom after being held hostage by iraqi militia .
a british man was released sunday from his kidnappers , the british foreign office announced .
gary teeley , 37 , -lrb- photo -rrb- was safely in the care of coalition troops , the ministry said .
no details of his release were given .
teeley had been abducted by an iraqi militia on april 5 in nassiriya .
he had been working for a company from qatar at the u.s. base in the southern iraqi city .
another group of iraqi rebels announced on a video tape broadcast by al jazeera that it would release eight foreign men - three pakistanis , two turks , an indian , a nepali and a filipino .
attacks worry germans in iraq if the reports of the german security agents ' deaths are confirmed , they wo n't be the first german nationals to be killed in iraq .
in mid-march , an employee of a bremen-based firm contracted with rebuilding water supply lines in iraq was shot and killed along with a dutch colleague and their iraqi companion .
currently , an estimated 50 germans are permanently stationed in iraq - employees of firms with reconstruction contracts , journalists , diplomats and representatives of german relief organizations .
among them is alexander christoph , who heads the german organization architects for people in need .
" the only way i can explain what 's happened here , if it turns out they were actually german , is that the -lrb- attackers -rrb- were confused , because most of the kidnappings up till now have always involved members of the coalition troops , " christoph told ard in a telephone interview from baghdad .
germany and china both opposed the war in iraq and have not provided troops to coalition forces .
speaking of the consequences the disappearances could have for other german workers is in the country , christoph said it was still too early to tell .
" i ca n't really judge that right now , " he said .
" our emergency assistance and medical programs are still operating right now , but we 're not starting any new projects .
we 're going to wait and see what develops .
we have n't ruled out the possibility that the situation could get much worse than it already is .

dw-world : opposition christian democrats say germany has n't been an immigrant country since it stopped recruiting foreigners in 1972 .
do you think germany is an immigrant country ? claudia roth : it ’ s one of the biggest lies of past decades to say that germany isn ’ t a real immigrant country .
we have been an immigrant country for over 50 years , and people have come here who have helped to build this country .
but what we are not is an immigrant country that has managed to regulate immigration , to protect the right to asylum and to foster integration . what is successful integration ? successful integration is much more than acquiring language skills .
integration must be related to legal integration , to education and work .
legal integration means , for example , eased naturalization , a citizenship right that we changed . successful integration means that the wealth people possess , who come here from other cultures , from other languages , from different religions is understood as wealth and not as a threat .
that we build on these abilities by providing native language opportunities and at the same time fostering the german language much more purposefully and much more consistently among the people who come here . successful integration is also an expression of the education opportunities that immigrants ' children have in our country .
if social origin remains the most decisive factor in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education access for immigrant children : " we have a lot of catching up to do . " when it comes to access and school problems - that children with immigrant backgrounds , above all , have - we have a lot of catching up to do .
in the areas of work , training , joblessness the numbers show that immigrants are much more frequently affected by unemployment , that young people have big difficulties advancing into higher spheres . we have big deficits , and that also arises from the ideological refusal to say we are an immigrant country .
people come here ; people should come here .
it makes our country richer , more multifaceted . has integration made progress in germany or has it regressed ? it hasn ’ t regressed .
at least there ’ s a consensus that integration is important .
there are certainly many very positive signals of successful integration , but there are also negative signals .
groups exist that withdraw into their alleged own cultures .
you have the feeling there are groups of immigrants who wall themselves into an alleged culture of their country of origin .
turkey , for example .
sometimes i have the feeling things are much more open in istanbul or izmir than in some areas of germany .
a similar problem : ethnic germans -lrb- from eastern europe -rrb- , who for decades in russia , in the other countries where they lived , holed themselves up in their alleged german culture and came to germany and noticed it ’ s somehow totally different , and then they aren ’ t able to cope . some have pointed to the muslim headscarf as a symbol of cultural isolation and social exclusion following a ruling by germany 's high court allowing a muslim teacher to wear her headscarf in class if there is no state law against it .
does it in fact signify the social exclusion of women ? i wouldn ’ t put it so simply .
we greens advocate throughout the world that there shouldn ’ t be constraints requiring wearing a headscarf .
why should i advocate constraints in germany not to wear a headscarf ? but the case that the issue is pegged on , a teacher who is german , who studied at german universities , who is everything but the exemplification of an oppressed woman , but rather lives highly emancipated and self-determined , to claim that she is the example of the greatest form of oppression is wrong . there are many reasons why women in our country wear headscarves .
i might like them or not .
i wouldn ’ t forcefully impose something in the german democracy that i fight in other countries : the constraint of self-determination .
i don ’ t believe in carrying out women ’ s liberation in the form of discrimination .
and women ’ s emancipation , women ’ s equality is definitely not expressed just by the headscarf . is wearing a headscarf compatible with integration ? i think so .
the headscarf issue isn ’ t an issue of the willingness to become integrated , rather it ’ s important what ’ s in people ’ s heads , what ’ s happening underneath the headscarf and how our democracy is interpreted and accepted . can a strictly devout muslim become an integrated german citizen ? a strictly devout muslim can be integrated into our society just as a strictly devout catholic can . does islam have a future in germany and europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " islam has a present and a future . "
it doesn ’ t only have a future , it has a present , whether we like it or not .
it ’ s a question of democracy .
even now islam is the second largest religious community in the european union .
islam per se isn ’ t an enemy just like christianity per se isn ’ t an enemy .
we would be wise to treat the religious practices of different religions in our society equally , with the greatest meticulousness , particularly by virtue of our own historical responsibility and democratic sensibilities . why has germany failed to pass an immigration law yet ? because the ideological barriers are infinitely high here .
because this issue is always an issue that surfaces in the maelstrom of populist politics here .
because problems are very easily diverted onto weak groups in out society that have little lobby , like immigrants .
because people refuse future-oriented modern policies despite knowing better . we need this immigration law .
we need it urgently , because we can ’ t compete anymore with other european countries .
but we only need an immigration law if immigration is truly regulated .

" headscarves are the opposite of integration " europe 's integration challenge germany -pipe- 13.04.2004 " what 's in people 's heads is important " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth has been the commissioner of human rights and humanitarian aid since 2003 .
dw-world : opposition christian democrats say germany has n't been an immigrant country since it stopped recruiting foreigners in 1972 .
do you think germany is an immigrant country ? claudia roth : it ’ s one of the biggest lies of past decades to say that germany isn ’ t a real immigrant country .
we have been an immigrant country for over 50 years , and people have come here who have helped to build this country .
but what we are not is an immigrant country that has managed to regulate immigration , to protect the right to asylum and to foster integration . what is successful integration ? successful integration is much more than acquiring language skills .
integration must be related to legal integration , to education and work .
legal integration means , for example , eased naturalization , a citizenship right that we changed . successful integration means that the wealth people possess , who come here from other cultures , from other languages , from different religions is understood as wealth and not as a threat .
that we build on these abilities by providing native language opportunities and at the same time fostering the german language much more purposefully and much more consistently among the people who come here . successful integration is also an expression of the education opportunities that immigrants ' children have in our country .
if social origin remains the most decisive factor in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education access for immigrant children : " we have a lot of catching up to do . " when it comes to access and school problems - that children with immigrant backgrounds , above all , have - we have a lot of catching up to do .
in the areas of work , training , joblessness the numbers show that immigrants are much more frequently affected by unemployment , that young people have big difficulties advancing into higher spheres . we have big deficits , and that also arises from the ideological refusal to say we are an immigrant country .
people come here ; people should come here .
it makes our country richer , more multifaceted . has integration made progress in germany or has it regressed ? it hasn ’ t regressed .
at least there ’ s a consensus that integration is important .
there are certainly many very positive signals of successful integration , but there are also negative signals .
groups exist that withdraw into their alleged own cultures .
you have the feeling there are groups of immigrants who wall themselves into an alleged culture of their country of origin .
turkey , for example .
sometimes i have the feeling things are much more open in istanbul or izmir than in some areas of germany .
a similar problem : ethnic germans -lrb- from eastern europe -rrb- , who for decades in russia , in the other countries where they lived , holed themselves up in their alleged german culture and came to germany and noticed it ’ s somehow totally different , and then they aren ’ t able to cope . some have pointed to the muslim headscarf as a symbol of cultural isolation and social exclusion following a ruling by germany 's high court allowing a muslim teacher to wear her headscarf in class if there is no state law against it .
does it in fact signify the social exclusion of women ? i wouldn ’ t put it so simply .
we greens advocate throughout the world that there shouldn ’ t be constraints requiring wearing a headscarf .
why should i advocate constraints in germany not to wear a headscarf ? but the case that the issue is pegged on , a teacher who is german , who studied at german universities , who is everything but the exemplification of an oppressed woman , but rather lives highly emancipated and self-determined , to claim that she is the example of the greatest form of oppression is wrong . there are many reasons why women in our country wear headscarves .

i wouldn ’ t forcefully impose something in the german democracy that i fight in other countries : the constraint of self-determination .
i don ’ t believe in carrying out women ’ s liberation in the form of discrimination .
and women ’ s emancipation , women ’ s equality is definitely not expressed just by the headscarf . is wearing a headscarf compatible with integration ? i think so .
the headscarf issue isn ’ t an issue of the willingness to become integrated , rather it ’ s important what ’ s in people ’ s heads , what ’ s happening underneath the headscarf and how our democracy is interpreted and accepted . can a strictly devout muslim become an integrated german citizen ? a strictly devout muslim can be integrated into our society just as a strictly devout catholic can . does islam have a future in germany and europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " islam has a present and a future .

the wherabouts of chinese and japanese hostages remain unknown . tobias ritrath , 25 , and thomas haffenker , 38 , went missing during a routine exchange of security personnel last wednesday . iraqi insurgents are believed to have attacked the security convoy carrying the men , who are part of the elite gsg-9 unit that protects the german embassy in baghdad , as it traveled through iraq on its way from amman , jordan , to the capital .
the convoy was traveling on a highway that skirts the cities of falluja and ramadi , flashpoints in the recent uprising against foreign troops .
the car carrying the men was surrounded , but the others managed to escape and complete their trip to baghdad .
brit : i saw their bodies germany 's foreign ministry said on sunday it was " highly likely " that the men were dead .
ard reported that a grave had been found , where the two men were thought to be buried .
officials at the german embassy in baghdad had reportedly seen video footage of the corpses and recognized the two men , according to ard .
a spokeswoman for the foreign ministry refused to comment on the information .
a reporter for the british daily telegraph said he had seen the bodies of two germans who had been killed in the area .
another witness told agence france presse that the toyota landcruiser the men were believed to be traveling in had been struck by a rocket .
more foreigners abducted meanwhile , the number of foreigners kidnapped in the region rose on sunday .
the chinese foreign ministry confirmed monday that seven of its nationals had been abducted .
the men , aged between 18 and 49 , were kidnapped west of baghdad after arriving in iraq by car from jordan on sunday morning .
it was unclear monday what had happened to three japanese hostages being held by insurgents .
their release was expected sunday , and they had been reported to be in safety .
but a japanese government spokesman said on monday that the reports remained unconfirmed . the captors had said they would kill the three if tokyo did n't remove its troops from iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : released british hostage gary teeley speaks to british service personnel on monday in shaibah , iraq on his first full day of freedom after being held hostage by iraqi militia .
a british man was released sunday from his kidnappers , the british foreign office announced .
gary teeley , 37 , -lrb- photo -rrb- was safely in the care of coalition troops , the ministry said .
no details of his release were given .
teeley had been abducted by an iraqi militia on april 5 in nassiriya .
he had been working for a company from qatar at the u.s. base in the southern iraqi city .
another group of iraqi rebels announced on a video tape broadcast by al jazeera that it would release eight foreign men - three pakistanis , two turks , an indian , a nepali and a filipino .
attacks worry germans in iraq if the reports of the german security agents ' deaths are confirmed , they wo n't be the first german nationals to be killed in iraq .
in mid-march , an employee of a bremen-based firm contracted with rebuilding water supply lines in iraq was shot and killed along with a dutch colleague and their iraqi companion .
currently , an estimated 50 germans are permanently stationed in iraq - employees of firms with reconstruction contracts , journalists , diplomats and representatives of german relief organizations .
among them is alexander christoph , who heads the german organization architects for people in need .
" the only way i can explain what 's happened here , if it turns out they were actually german , is that the -lrb- attackers -rrb- were confused , because most of the kidnappings up till now have always involved members of the coalition troops , " christoph told ard in a telephone interview from baghdad .
germany and china both opposed the war in iraq and have not provided troops to coalition forces .
speaking of the consequences the disappearances could have for other german workers is in the country , christoph said it was still too early to tell .
" i ca n't really judge that right now , " he said .
" our emergency assistance and medical programs are still operating right now , but we 're not starting any new projects .
we 're going to wait and see what develops .
we have n't ruled out the possibility that the situation could get much worse than it already is .

" headscarves are the opposite of integration " europe 's integration challenge germany -pipe- 13.04.2004 " what 's in people 's heads is important " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth has been the commissioner of human rights and humanitarian aid since 2003 .
dw-world : opposition christian democrats say germany has n't been an immigrant country since it stopped recruiting foreigners in 1972 .
do you think germany is an immigrant country ? claudia roth : it ’ s one of the biggest lies of past decades to say that germany isn ’ t a real immigrant country .
we have been an immigrant country for over 50 years , and people have come here who have helped to build this country .
but what we are not is an immigrant country that has managed to regulate immigration , to protect the right to asylum and to foster integration . what is successful integration ? successful integration is much more than acquiring language skills .
integration must be related to legal integration , to education and work .
legal integration means , for example , eased naturalization , a citizenship right that we changed . successful integration means that the wealth people possess , who come here from other cultures , from other languages , from different religions is understood as wealth and not as a threat .
that we build on these abilities by providing native language opportunities and at the same time fostering the german language much more purposefully and much more consistently among the people who come here . successful integration is also an expression of the education opportunities that immigrants ' children have in our country .
if social origin remains the most decisive factor in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education access for immigrant children : " we have a lot of catching up to do . " when it comes to access and school problems - that children with immigrant backgrounds , above all , have - we have a lot of catching up to do .
in the areas of work , training , joblessness the numbers show that immigrants are much more frequently affected by unemployment , that young people have big difficulties advancing into higher spheres . we have big deficits , and that also arises from the ideological refusal to say we are an immigrant country .
people come here ; people should come here .
it makes our country richer , more multifaceted . has integration made progress in germany or has it regressed ? it hasn ’ t regressed .
at least there ’ s a consensus that integration is important .
there are certainly many very positive signals of successful integration , but there are also negative signals .
groups exist that withdraw into their alleged own cultures .
you have the feeling there are groups of immigrants who wall themselves into an alleged culture of their country of origin .
turkey , for example .
sometimes i have the feeling things are much more open in istanbul or izmir than in some areas of germany .
a similar problem : ethnic germans -lrb- from eastern europe -rrb- , who for decades in russia , in the other countries where they lived , holed themselves up in their alleged german culture and came to germany and noticed it ’ s somehow totally different , and then they aren ’ t able to cope . some have pointed to the muslim headscarf as a symbol of cultural isolation and social exclusion following a ruling by germany 's high court allowing a muslim teacher to wear her headscarf in class if there is no state law against it .
does it in fact signify the social exclusion of women ? i wouldn ’ t put it so simply .
we greens advocate throughout the world that there shouldn ’ t be constraints requiring wearing a headscarf .
why should i advocate constraints in germany not to wear a headscarf ? but the case that the issue is pegged on , a teacher who is german , who studied at german universities , who is everything but the exemplification of an oppressed woman , but rather lives highly emancipated and self-determined , to claim that she is the example of the greatest form of oppression is wrong . there are many reasons why women in our country wear headscarves .
i might like them or not .
i wouldn ’ t forcefully impose something in the german democracy that i fight in other countries : the constraint of self-determination .
i don ’ t believe in carrying out women ’ s liberation in the form of discrimination .
and women ’ s emancipation , women ’ s equality is definitely not expressed just by the headscarf . is wearing a headscarf compatible with integration ? i think so .
the headscarf issue isn ’ t an issue of the willingness to become integrated , rather it ’ s important what ’ s in people ’ s heads , what ’ s happening underneath the headscarf and how our democracy is interpreted and accepted . can a strictly devout muslim become an integrated german citizen ? a strictly devout muslim can be integrated into our society just as a strictly devout catholic can . does islam have a future in germany and europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " islam has a present and a future . "
it doesn ’ t only have a future , it has a present , whether we like it or not .
it ’ s a question of democracy .
even now islam is the second largest religious community in the european union .
islam per se isn ’ t an enemy just like christianity per se isn ’ t an enemy .
we would be wise to treat the religious practices of different religions in our society equally , with the greatest meticulousness , particularly by virtue of our own historical responsibility and democratic sensibilities . why has germany failed to pass an immigration law yet ? because the ideological barriers are infinitely high here .
because this issue is always an issue that surfaces in the maelstrom of populist politics here .
because problems are very easily diverted onto weak groups in out society that have little lobby , like immigrants .
because people refuse future-oriented modern policies despite knowing better . we need this immigration law .
we need it urgently , because we can ’ t compete anymore with other european countries .
but we only need an immigration law if immigration is truly regulated .
what we don ’ t need is an immigration limitation law . nancy isenson interviewed claudia roth send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" headscarves are the opposite of integration " europe 's integration challenge germany -pipe- 13.04.2004 " what 's in people 's heads is important " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth has been the commissioner of human rights and humanitarian aid since 2003 .

do you think germany is an immigrant country ? claudia roth : it ’ s one of the biggest lies of past decades to say that germany isn ’ t a real immigrant country .

you have the feeling there are groups of immigrants who wall themselves into an alleged culture of their country of origin .
turkey , for example .
sometimes i have the feeling things are much more open in istanbul or izmir than in some areas of germany .
a similar problem : ethnic germans -lrb- from eastern europe -rrb- , who for decades in russia , in the other countries where they lived , holed themselves up in their alleged german culture and came to germany and noticed it ’ s somehow totally different , and then they aren ’ t able to cope . some have pointed to the muslim headscarf as a symbol of cultural isolation and social exclusion following a ruling by germany 's high court allowing a muslim teacher to wear her headscarf in class if there is no state law against it .

i don ’ t believe in carrying out women ’ s liberation in the form of discrimination .
and women ’ s emancipation , women ’ s equality is definitely not expressed just by the headscarf . is wearing a headscarf compatible with integration ? i think so .
the headscarf issue isn ’ t an issue of the willingness to become integrated , rather it ’ s important what ’ s in people ’ s heads , what ’ s happening underneath the headscarf and how our democracy is interpreted and accepted . can a strictly devout muslim become an integrated german citizen ? a strictly devout muslim can be integrated into our society just as a strictly devout catholic can . does islam have a future in germany and europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " islam has a present and a future . "

" headscarves are the opposite of integration " europe 's integration challenge germany -pipe- 13.04.2004 " what 's in people 's heads is important " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth has been the commissioner of human rights and humanitarian aid since 2003 .
dw-world : opposition christian democrats say germany has n't been an immigrant country since it stopped recruiting foreigners in 1972 .
do you think germany is an immigrant country ? claudia roth : it ’ s one of the biggest lies of past decades to say that germany isn ’ t a real immigrant country .
we have been an immigrant country for over 50 years , and people have come here who have helped to build this country .
but what we are not is an immigrant country that has managed to regulate immigration , to protect the right to asylum and to foster integration . what is successful integration ? successful integration is much more than acquiring language skills .
integration must be related to legal integration , to education and work .
legal integration means , for example , eased naturalization , a citizenship right that we changed . successful integration means that the wealth people possess , who come here from other cultures , from other languages , from different religions is understood as wealth and not as a threat .
that we build on these abilities by providing native language opportunities and at the same time fostering the german language much more purposefully and much more consistently among the people who come here . successful integration is also an expression of the education opportunities that immigrants ' children have in our country .
if social origin remains the most decisive factor in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education access for immigrant children : " we have a lot of catching up to do . " when it comes to access and school problems - that children with immigrant backgrounds , above all , have - we have a lot of catching up to do .
in the areas of work , training , joblessness the numbers show that immigrants are much more frequently affected by unemployment , that young people have big difficulties advancing into higher spheres . we have big deficits , and that also arises from the ideological refusal to say we are an immigrant country .
people come here ; people should come here .
it makes our country richer , more multifaceted . has integration made progress in germany or has it regressed ? it hasn ’ t regressed .
at least there ’ s a consensus that integration is important .
there are certainly many very positive signals of successful integration , but there are also negative signals .
groups exist that withdraw into their alleged own cultures .
you have the feeling there are groups of immigrants who wall themselves into an alleged culture of their country of origin .
turkey , for example .
sometimes i have the feeling things are much more open in istanbul or izmir than in some areas of germany .
a similar problem : ethnic germans -lrb- from eastern europe -rrb- , who for decades in russia , in the other countries where they lived , holed themselves up in their alleged german culture and came to germany and noticed it ’ s somehow totally different , and then they aren ’ t able to cope . some have pointed to the muslim headscarf as a symbol of cultural isolation and social exclusion following a ruling by germany 's high court allowing a muslim teacher to wear her headscarf in class if there is no state law against it .
does it in fact signify the social exclusion of women ? i wouldn ’ t put it so simply .
we greens advocate throughout the world that there shouldn ’ t be constraints requiring wearing a headscarf .
why should i advocate constraints in germany not to wear a headscarf ? but the case that the issue is pegged on , a teacher who is german , who studied at german universities , who is everything but the exemplification of an oppressed woman , but rather lives highly emancipated and self-determined , to claim that she is the example of the greatest form of oppression is wrong . there are many reasons why women in our country wear headscarves .
i might like them or not .
i wouldn ’ t forcefully impose something in the german democracy that i fight in other countries : the constraint of self-determination .
i don ’ t believe in carrying out women ’ s liberation in the form of discrimination .
and women ’ s emancipation , women ’ s equality is definitely not expressed just by the headscarf . is wearing a headscarf compatible with integration ? i think so .
the headscarf issue isn ’ t an issue of the willingness to become integrated , rather it ’ s important what ’ s in people ’ s heads , what ’ s happening underneath the headscarf and how our democracy is interpreted and accepted . can a strictly devout muslim become an integrated german citizen ? a strictly devout muslim can be integrated into our society just as a strictly devout catholic can . does islam have a future in germany and europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " islam has a present and a future . "
it doesn ’ t only have a future , it has a present , whether we like it or not .

" headscarves are the opposite of integration " europe 's integration challenge germany -pipe- 13.04.2004 " what 's in people 's heads is important " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth has been the commissioner of human rights and humanitarian aid since 2003 .
dw-world : opposition christian democrats say germany has n't been an immigrant country since it stopped recruiting foreigners in 1972 .
do you think germany is an immigrant country ? claudia roth : it ’ s one of the biggest lies of past decades to say that germany isn ’ t a real immigrant country .
we have been an immigrant country for over 50 years , and people have come here who have helped to build this country .
but what we are not is an immigrant country that has managed to regulate immigration , to protect the right to asylum and to foster integration . what is successful integration ? successful integration is much more than acquiring language skills .
integration must be related to legal integration , to education and work .
legal integration means , for example , eased naturalization , a citizenship right that we changed . successful integration means that the wealth people possess , who come here from other cultures , from other languages , from different religions is understood as wealth and not as a threat .
that we build on these abilities by providing native language opportunities and at the same time fostering the german language much more purposefully and much more consistently among the people who come here . successful integration is also an expression of the education opportunities that immigrants ' children have in our country .
if social origin remains the most decisive factor in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education access for immigrant children : " we have a lot of catching up to do . " when it comes to access and school problems - that children with immigrant backgrounds , above all , have - we have a lot of catching up to do .
in the areas of work , training , joblessness the numbers show that immigrants are much more frequently affected by unemployment , that young people have big difficulties advancing into higher spheres . we have big deficits , and that also arises from the ideological refusal to say we are an immigrant country .
people come here ; people should come here .
it makes our country richer , more multifaceted . has integration made progress in germany or has it regressed ? it hasn ’ t regressed .
at least there ’ s a consensus that integration is important .
there are certainly many very positive signals of successful integration , but there are also negative signals .
groups exist that withdraw into their alleged own cultures .
you have the feeling there are groups of immigrants who wall themselves into an alleged culture of their country of origin .
turkey , for example .
sometimes i have the feeling things are much more open in istanbul or izmir than in some areas of germany .
a similar problem : ethnic germans -lrb- from eastern europe -rrb- , who for decades in russia , in the other countries where they lived , holed themselves up in their alleged german culture and came to germany and noticed it ’ s somehow totally different , and then they aren ’ t able to cope . some have pointed to the muslim headscarf as a symbol of cultural isolation and social exclusion following a ruling by germany 's high court allowing a muslim teacher to wear her headscarf in class if there is no state law against it .
does it in fact signify the social exclusion of women ? i wouldn ’ t put it so simply .
we greens advocate throughout the world that there shouldn ’ t be constraints requiring wearing a headscarf .
why should i advocate constraints in germany not to wear a headscarf ? but the case that the issue is pegged on , a teacher who is german , who studied at german universities , who is everything but the exemplification of an oppressed woman , but rather lives highly emancipated and self-determined , to claim that she is the example of the greatest form of oppression is wrong . there are many reasons why women in our country wear headscarves .
i might like them or not .
i wouldn ’ t forcefully impose something in the german democracy that i fight in other countries : the constraint of self-determination .
i don ’ t believe in carrying out women ’ s liberation in the form of discrimination .
and women ’ s emancipation , women ’ s equality is definitely not expressed just by the headscarf . is wearing a headscarf compatible with integration ? i think so .
the headscarf issue isn ’ t an issue of the willingness to become integrated , rather it ’ s important what ’ s in people ’ s heads , what ’ s happening underneath the headscarf and how our democracy is interpreted and accepted . can a strictly devout muslim become an integrated german citizen ? a strictly devout muslim can be integrated into our society just as a strictly devout catholic can . does islam have a future in germany and europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " islam has a present and a future . "
it doesn ’ t only have a future , it has a present , whether we like it or not .
it ’ s a question of democracy .
even now islam is the second largest religious community in the european union .
islam per se isn ’ t an enemy just like christianity per se isn ’ t an enemy .
we would be wise to treat the religious practices of different religions in our society equally , with the greatest meticulousness , particularly by virtue of our own historical responsibility and democratic sensibilities . why has germany failed to pass an immigration law yet ? because the ideological barriers are infinitely high here .
because this issue is always an issue that surfaces in the maelstrom of populist politics here .
because problems are very easily diverted onto weak groups in out society that have little lobby , like immigrants .
because people refuse future-oriented modern policies despite knowing better . we need this immigration law .
we need it urgently , because we can ’ t compete anymore with other european countries .

lured by warm climes , pristine beaches , a striking backdrop and german beer , an increasing number of germans - not necessarily equipped with a return ticket - are heading to cape town in south africa . a leisurely read of the tabloid newspaper bild while nursing a wheat beer and chomping on a fried sausage might sound like paradise to some germans .
but take the same scene and add a bright sun , warm surf and rugged mountains , and you 'll have light-starved germans drooling at the thought . the latter is precisely what more than 100,000 germans enjoy most of the year , every year , in cape town , one of south africa 's most beautiful and relaxed cities .
they are permanent refugees from northern europe 's cold and grey and they 're leaving their stamp on the city .
cape town now hosts a thriving array of german bookshops , car dealers , travel agencies , schools , bakeries and pubs . these immigrants joined each year by another 100,000 germans who regularly flee the teutonic winter to spend the summer soaking up the south african sun .
besides them , another 140,000 visit cape town for briefer periods throughout the year .
at times , south africa 's second city has more germans than mid-sized german municipalities like bielefeld or bonn . everything just round the corner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cape town is one of the world 's most scenic spots for paragliding , drawing enthusiasts from around the world .
ralf erdner , who came to cape town ten years ago , knows why he stayed on .
" you take one step out of your office and you 're practically on vacation .
20 minutes to the next vineyard , five minutes to the beach , ten minutes to the waterfront .
it does n't matter if i want to hike , dive , sail or play golf - everything is very affordable and just a stone 's throw away , without traffic snarls and with sun , " he told deutsche welle . in addition to cape town 's climatic and culinary charms , the city 's property prices are very affordable .
in the past six years , the number of german property owners in the region has continually risen , especially since a charming cape-dutch country house costs about the same as a fashionable apartment in hamburg . business and property interests erdner 's own company in cape town , international business network , advises german investors on legal , economic and tax issues . erdner said his work had changed over the past few years .
" we used to have a huge number of people who came from germany and wanted to buy a holiday home .
and then we had those , who said , ' i want to live for six months in germany and six months in south africa . '
they wanted to make the best of both summers , " he said . once one german decided to start a business in the country , the floodgates opened as others jumped on the bandwagon . " a whole new trend has actually stemmed from it now , so we now do n't have as many property buyers , but rather more middle-sized companies who come here , " he said . a city for romantics ? german migration to cape town has a long tradition .
germans , along with the dutch and british , have been flocking to south africa 's southern tip since the 17th century , a fact that 's reflected in names of local towns such as hamburg , frankfurt or heidelberg . many germans also fought alongside the boers , south africans of dutch or huguenot descent , against the british colonizers .
migration from germany slowed during south africa 's apartheid regime and only picked up again after president mandela was elected to office following democratic elections in 1994 . stefan hippler , the priest with the german-speaking catholic community in cape town , said many germans view the city romantically . " cape town somehow seems to be the dream of sleepless nights for many germans , even for many pensioners .
it 's become a bit like a promised city where people can be happy . " but happiness is n't all that cape town is about .
it may be largely insulated from the crippling poverty and misery seen elsewhere in africa , but the paradisaical atmosphere is occasionally shaken by reports of crime and burglary . warring street gangs can draw bystanders into their paths . bavarian sausage and sunny fun however germans working in the hospitality industry in cape town are n't that much bothered by the city 's darker side . " one gets used to it , " said susanne funk , a german immigrant who runs a bed and breakfast at the foot of the tafelsberg mountain .
" you get to grips with the feeling that it 's more dangerous here .
and for me personally , all the positive experiences are so overwhelming lovely that i do n't think about going to germany . " bayreuth-born wolfgang ködel , who ensures that his german guests get enough beer on tap in his pub , is proud that he 's been able to create a slice of bavaria in africa , complete with the region 's music and food , including grilled pig 's knuckles .
" i would say that our bavarian sausage here in cape town is at least as good as in munich , " he said .
" naturally most of the guests come because of the beer and we brew our own here . " with all that hearty german food topped with enough sunshine and surf to go around , it is n't hard to understand why cape town has become such a hot destination - either permanent or part-time - for germans . funk sums up the feeling : " i look forward to my vacation in germany .

the german foreign ministry issued a warning on tuesday for its citizens to leave iraq as the spate of foreign kidnappings continues .
at the same time , german aid organizations completed their withdrawal from iraq . as unsubstantiated reports are circulating about the possible deaths of the two german security officials abducted in iraq last wednesday , the german foreign ministry has advised its citizens to leave iraq .
the warning comes a day after what is thought to be the last group of german humanitarian workers in iraq were pulled out of the country on monday . " german citizens are advised to leave iraq , " the foreign ministry statement warned .
" in the face of developments in the region , be advised there is also a high security risk in kuwait .
because of the situation in iraq , people are again urgently warned against travel in the neighbouring country . " the statement was issued as unconfirmed reports suggested that the two security agents from the german embassy in baghdad who went missing last week when they disappeared during a routine exchange of staff are now dead .
the men , said to be members of germany 's elite gsg-9 special forces group , were travelling from baghdad to jordan when they were ambushed by unknown assailants . missing men feared dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobias ritrath , 25 , and thomas haffenker , 38 , have been missing since wednesday .
since no kidnap claim has been issued , the german foreign ministry concluded that the men , identified in german media reports as tobias ritrath , 25 , and thomas haffenker , 38 , may have been killed during the attack near the sunni town of falluja , the scene of the recent uprising 's most violent escalations . a reporter for the london-based daily telegraph newspaper in the city has said he saw the bodies of two germans in the area while germany 's ard television reported on monday that the german embassy in baghdad had received a videotape showing the corpses of two men which staffers had identified as the missing security officials . aid agencies pull out last remaining staff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunni insurgents guard in fallujah .
meanwhile , german aid organizations evacuated their last four workers from iraq on monday due to the deteriorating security situation , a spokesman for " aktion deutschland hilft " told reporters .
wolfgang nierwetberg of the bonn-based agency said that the last four members of a 10-person team removing munitions from residential areas left baghdad on a u.n. aircraft for amman .
" every foreigner is now being seen as a prime target .
the danger has become too high , " nierwetberg said . forty-five iraqi workers assisting the group in its project to clear mines , reopen channels of food distribution and install water purification systems have stayed in place in an attempt to continue the german organization 's work in baghdad . all german charity workers are now thought to have pulled out of iraq .
around 60 germans are thought to remain in the country , most of them either journalists or people with iraqi partners .
germany has no troops deployed in iraq . as the security situation deteriorates further in iraq , other foreign aid agencies have taken the decision to suspend operations .
on friday , french group premiere urgence , one of the few charities still operating in iraq , also put its work on hold .
" premiere urgence is alarmed at the chaos into which iraq has plunged and is provisionally suspending its activities , " the organization said in a statement . abduction a growing threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrator holds a poster with pictures of the japanese hostages held by militants in iraq .
the growing unrest has increased the danger of the situation for foreigners in iraq .
several foreigners have been taken hostage on the dangerous route between baghdad and amman which passes by falluja , where a sunni insurgency against u.s. forces intensified this week .
fighting has been heavy in iraq in the past week , and several civilians have either been kidnapped or killed . there are fears for two czechs , reportedly television journalists , after a taxi firm told afp news agency they were abducted en route to jordan and also for the japanese hostages who were taken last week and whose fate remains unknown .

labor unions are up in arms . also charged with rebuilding germany 's five former communist eastern states , german transportation minister manfred stolpe on tuesday weighed in on the furious debate sparked by the publication of a controversial government-commissioned report last week on germany 's disastrous bid to modernize its eastern states since 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said he was in favor of setting up special low wage sectors in the eastern states , where the state would pay out a part of the salaries .
" it 's a thought that one must seriously pursue , " stolpe said in an interview with business daily handelsblatt . the minister added that the so-called wage subsidies , which would amount to welfare benefits being rebundled as cash incentives instead of as entitlements , could be tied into a law for " regions for innovation " currently being drafted by economics minister wolfgang clement .
" we must examine , how far we can get it into the program of the economics minister , " stolpe said . the " regions for innovation " law , which clement is expected to introduce this year , aims at cutting red tape and repealing certain regulations in construction and planning laws in order to boost the depressed economy in the east . proposal takes up commission 's recommendation stolpe 's plan for wage subsidies for germany 's eastern states echoes a key proposal put forth by the government-commissioned panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi last week . the commission 's report - openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the former communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 - largely concluded that the € 90 billion -lrb- $ 107.9 billion -rrb- berlin spends annually on rebuilding the so-called new federal states is wasted and that stagnant eastern germany is now dragging the wealthier west into ruin . in addition to cash incentives for guaranteed jobs , the commission also suggested a new master reconstruction plan , long-term tax relief for eastern german companies , concentration of economic aid in specific growth centers and the inclusion of at least one eastern german firm in tenders for government contracts to counter years of flawed eastern policy . fears of eu expansion stolpe has defended his plan of special low wage zones in eastern germany by pointing towards the likely consequences of the european union 's expansion in may when it takes in ten new mainly former communist eastern european countries . the minister warned that enlargement would lead to a flood of workers from neighboring eastern european countries taking up most low wage jobs in eastern germany .
stolpe pointed out that it would be an unacceptable situation , particularly because long-term unemployment in eastern germany is on the rise from year to year .
the dohnanyi report pointed out that chronically high unemployment of almost 20 percent is exacerbating the region 's problems . the minister has argued that it 's thus all the more important that workers in low cost sectors in eastern germany have the possibility of a wage supplement in addition to welfare benefits . unions irked by plan however stolpe 's proposal is expected to run into stiff opposition from the country 's powerful labor unions , many of whom fear that it would water down hard negotiated wage agreements with industries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german federation of trade unions , shot down the suggestion on tuesday .
" if special economic zones were a successful model , then eastern germany should have been a flourishing landscape in the face of lower wages and longer working hours , " sommer told daily tagesspiegel . he added that the discussion was n't just wrong , but also dangerous .
" conservative politicians want to exploit the woes of the east , to first catapult the special economic zone and then the whole country into the past , " he thundered . criticism of the plan has also emanated from german industry , which is struggling to recover from a recession .

the german foreign ministry issued a warning on tuesday for its citizens to leave iraq as the spate of foreign kidnappings continues .
at the same time , german aid organizations completed their withdrawal from iraq . as unsubstantiated reports are circulating about the possible deaths of the two german security officials abducted in iraq last wednesday , the german foreign ministry has advised its citizens to leave iraq .
the warning comes a day after what is thought to be the last group of german humanitarian workers in iraq were pulled out of the country on monday . " german citizens are advised to leave iraq , " the foreign ministry statement warned .
" in the face of developments in the region , be advised there is also a high security risk in kuwait .
because of the situation in iraq , people are again urgently warned against travel in the neighbouring country . " the statement was issued as unconfirmed reports suggested that the two security agents from the german embassy in baghdad who went missing last week when they disappeared during a routine exchange of staff are now dead .
the men , said to be members of germany 's elite gsg-9 special forces group , were travelling from baghdad to jordan when they were ambushed by unknown assailants . missing men feared dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobias ritrath , 25 , and thomas haffenker , 38 , have been missing since wednesday .
since no kidnap claim has been issued , the german foreign ministry concluded that the men , identified in german media reports as tobias ritrath , 25 , and thomas haffenker , 38 , may have been killed during the attack near the sunni town of falluja , the scene of the recent uprising 's most violent escalations . a reporter for the london-based daily telegraph newspaper in the city has said he saw the bodies of two germans in the area while germany 's ard television reported on monday that the german embassy in baghdad had received a videotape showing the corpses of two men which staffers had identified as the missing security officials . aid agencies pull out last remaining staff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunni insurgents guard in fallujah .
meanwhile , german aid organizations evacuated their last four workers from iraq on monday due to the deteriorating security situation , a spokesman for " aktion deutschland hilft " told reporters .
wolfgang nierwetberg of the bonn-based agency said that the last four members of a 10-person team removing munitions from residential areas left baghdad on a u.n. aircraft for amman .
" every foreigner is now being seen as a prime target .
the danger has become too high , " nierwetberg said . forty-five iraqi workers assisting the group in its project to clear mines , reopen channels of food distribution and install water purification systems have stayed in place in an attempt to continue the german organization 's work in baghdad . all german charity workers are now thought to have pulled out of iraq .
around 60 germans are thought to remain in the country , most of them either journalists or people with iraqi partners .
germany has no troops deployed in iraq . as the security situation deteriorates further in iraq , other foreign aid agencies have taken the decision to suspend operations .
on friday , french group premiere urgence , one of the few charities still operating in iraq , also put its work on hold .
" premiere urgence is alarmed at the chaos into which iraq has plunged and is provisionally suspending its activities , " the organization said in a statement . abduction a growing threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrator holds a poster with pictures of the japanese hostages held by militants in iraq .
the growing unrest has increased the danger of the situation for foreigners in iraq .
several foreigners have been taken hostage on the dangerous route between baghdad and amman which passes by falluja , where a sunni insurgency against u.s. forces intensified this week .

following a damning report on germany 's efforts to rebuild its once communist east , transportation minister manfred stolpe has proposed setting up special low wage zones in the east .
labor unions are up in arms . also charged with rebuilding germany 's five former communist eastern states , german transportation minister manfred stolpe on tuesday weighed in on the furious debate sparked by the publication of a controversial government-commissioned report last week on germany 's disastrous bid to modernize its eastern states since 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- said he was in favor of setting up special low wage sectors in the eastern states , where the state would pay out a part of the salaries .
" it 's a thought that one must seriously pursue , " stolpe said in an interview with business daily handelsblatt . the minister added that the so-called wage subsidies , which would amount to welfare benefits being rebundled as cash incentives instead of as entitlements , could be tied into a law for " regions for innovation " currently being drafted by economics minister wolfgang clement .
" we must examine , how far we can get it into the program of the economics minister , " stolpe said . the " regions for innovation " law , which clement is expected to introduce this year , aims at cutting red tape and repealing certain regulations in construction and planning laws in order to boost the depressed economy in the east . proposal takes up commission 's recommendation stolpe 's plan for wage subsidies for germany 's eastern states echoes a key proposal put forth by the government-commissioned panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi last week . the commission 's report - openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the former communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 - largely concluded that the € 90 billion -lrb- $ 107.9 billion -rrb- berlin spends annually on rebuilding the so-called new federal states is wasted and that stagnant eastern germany is now dragging the wealthier west into ruin . in addition to cash incentives for guaranteed jobs , the commission also suggested a new master reconstruction plan , long-term tax relief for eastern german companies , concentration of economic aid in specific growth centers and the inclusion of at least one eastern german firm in tenders for government contracts to counter years of flawed eastern policy . fears of eu expansion stolpe has defended his plan of special low wage zones in eastern germany by pointing towards the likely consequences of the european union 's expansion in may when it takes in ten new mainly former communist eastern european countries . the minister warned that enlargement would lead to a flood of workers from neighboring eastern european countries taking up most low wage jobs in eastern germany .
stolpe pointed out that it would be an unacceptable situation , particularly because long-term unemployment in eastern germany is on the rise from year to year .
the dohnanyi report pointed out that chronically high unemployment of almost 20 percent is exacerbating the region 's problems . the minister has argued that it 's thus all the more important that workers in low cost sectors in eastern germany have the possibility of a wage supplement in addition to welfare benefits . unions irked by plan however stolpe 's proposal is expected to run into stiff opposition from the country 's powerful labor unions , many of whom fear that it would water down hard negotiated wage agreements with industries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german federation of trade unions , shot down the suggestion on tuesday .
" if special economic zones were a successful model , then eastern germany should have been a flourishing landscape in the face of lower wages and longer working hours , " sommer told daily tagesspiegel . he added that the discussion was n't just wrong , but also dangerous .
" conservative politicians want to exploit the woes of the east , to first catapult the special economic zone and then the whole country into the past , " he thundered . criticism of the plan has also emanated from german industry , which is struggling to recover from a recession .

now a christian democratic politician has proposed incentives for church tax payers , in the hopes that people will stop leaving in droves . christian böhr took advantage of the easter holiday , when the churches enjoy throngs of visitors , to announce that the growing number of people opting out of the christian churches was an ominous development that had to be stopped . " leaving the church should not be a scheme to save taxes , " the christian democratic party 's deputy chairman proclaimed monday .
böhr proposed that germans be offered tax incentives so they will stay in the church .
he said catholics and protestants should be allowed to deduct 20 percent of the church tax they pay from their income tax . the government should examine his proposal , which could save easily taxpayers around € 100 -lrb- $ 119 -rrb- per year , böhr said .
the state would profit from giving church taxpayers a break .
" the churches run numerous kindergartens , hospitals , schools or social stations . "
if the churches lost funding , they would be forced to close such institutions , böhr claimed . state collection plate church tax in germany means that germans fund the country 's christian churches whether they donate to the collection plate or not .
but taxpayers can already deduct the payments on their tax declarations as expenses . germans pay 8 to 9 percent of their income tax if they are members in one of the recognized religious communities .
most germans are born into the catholic or protestant church .
they start paying church tax as soon as they start working ; parents pay church tax on their children 's behalf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishops in the cologne cathedral in 2002 , the churches received € 3.35 billion -lrb- $ 4.02 billion -rrb- in church tax revenue . the german state agreed long ago with the catholic and protestant churches that it would collect the levy and pass it on to them , and the state 's right do so is even laid out in germany 's constitution .
other religious communities can also claim a piece of the pie , as long as they are registered as statutory bodies and recognized by the individual german states , which are responsible for collecting the tax . in berlin , the old catholic church , which split from roman catholicism in the late 19th century , also receives tax revenues from its members , and in other german states confessions such as judaism get church tax money , berlin senate spokesman matthias kolbeck told dw-world .
leaving the lap of the church the only way people can avoid paying the levy is by officially getting out of the church and that 's exactly what thousands of people do each year .
only 63.8 percent of the 82 million people in germany are members of the roman catholic or protestant church , and the numbers have been dropping dramatically for years .
in 2002 over 119,000 people got out of the roman catholic church .
the most recent figures from the protestant church show that nearly 172,000 members opted out in 2001 .
from 1992 to 2001 almost 1.4 million people became former catholics and nearly 2.4 million germans left protestantism . but not everyone who leaves the church is just out to save taxes .
the badische neueste nachrichten newspaper commented on böhr 's proposal : " the 300,000 christians who turned their back on the two big christian churches … did n't all leave because of church tax , but frequently for other reasons : many view the church , especially the catholic church , as strangely out-of-touch . " and for years , critics of the tax have said that it should be transformed into a levy to benefit culture in general .
" a culture tax that everyone had to pay would be fairer in every way - potentially with the requirement that the taxpayer can designate which statutory body should receive the money , " the nürnberger zeitung paper wrote . nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tax cuts leave germans cold a poll conducted by the forsa opinion research company shows that the majority of germans do not feel that the 2004 tax cuts of € 15 billion -lrb- $ 18.3 billion -rrb- are having much effect on their disposable income .
-lrb- march 5 , 2004 -rrb- a nation of tax evaders ?

now a christian democratic politician has proposed incentives for church tax payers , in the hopes that people will stop leaving in droves . christian böhr took advantage of the easter holiday , when the churches enjoy throngs of visitors , to announce that the growing number of people opting out of the christian churches was an ominous development that had to be stopped . " leaving the church should not be a scheme to save taxes , " the christian democratic party 's deputy chairman proclaimed monday .
böhr proposed that germans be offered tax incentives so they will stay in the church .
he said catholics and protestants should be allowed to deduct 20 percent of the church tax they pay from their income tax . the government should examine his proposal , which could save easily taxpayers around € 100 -lrb- $ 119 -rrb- per year , böhr said .
the state would profit from giving church taxpayers a break .
" the churches run numerous kindergartens , hospitals , schools or social stations . "
if the churches lost funding , they would be forced to close such institutions , böhr claimed . state collection plate church tax in germany means that germans fund the country 's christian churches whether they donate to the collection plate or not .
but taxpayers can already deduct the payments on their tax declarations as expenses . germans pay 8 to 9 percent of their income tax if they are members in one of the recognized religious communities .

from 1992 to 2001 almost 1.4 million people became former catholics and nearly 2.4 million germans left protestantism . but not everyone who leaves the church is just out to save taxes .
the badische neueste nachrichten newspaper commented on böhr 's proposal : " the 300,000 christians who turned their back on the two big christian churches … did n't all leave because of church tax , but frequently for other reasons : many view the church , especially the catholic church , as strangely out-of-touch . " and for years , critics of the tax have said that it should be transformed into a levy to benefit culture in general .

now a christian democratic politician has proposed incentives for church tax payers , in the hopes that people will stop leaving in droves . christian böhr took advantage of the easter holiday , when the churches enjoy throngs of visitors , to announce that the growing number of people opting out of the christian churches was an ominous development that had to be stopped . " leaving the church should not be a scheme to save taxes , " the christian democratic party 's deputy chairman proclaimed monday .
böhr proposed that germans be offered tax incentives so they will stay in the church .
he said catholics and protestants should be allowed to deduct 20 percent of the church tax they pay from their income tax . the government should examine his proposal , which could save easily taxpayers around € 100 -lrb- $ 119 -rrb- per year , böhr said .
the state would profit from giving church taxpayers a break .
" the churches run numerous kindergartens , hospitals , schools or social stations . "
if the churches lost funding , they would be forced to close such institutions , böhr claimed . state collection plate church tax in germany means that germans fund the country 's christian churches whether they donate to the collection plate or not .
but taxpayers can already deduct the payments on their tax declarations as expenses . germans pay 8 to 9 percent of their income tax if they are members in one of the recognized religious communities .
most germans are born into the catholic or protestant church .
they start paying church tax as soon as they start working ; parents pay church tax on their children 's behalf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishops in the cologne cathedral in 2002 , the churches received € 3.35 billion -lrb- $ 4.02 billion -rrb- in church tax revenue . the german state agreed long ago with the catholic and protestant churches that it would collect the levy and pass it on to them , and the state 's right do so is even laid out in germany 's constitution .
other religious communities can also claim a piece of the pie , as long as they are registered as statutory bodies and recognized by the individual german states , which are responsible for collecting the tax . in berlin , the old catholic church , which split from roman catholicism in the late 19th century , also receives tax revenues from its members , and in other german states confessions such as judaism get church tax money , berlin senate spokesman matthias kolbeck told dw-world .
leaving the lap of the church the only way people can avoid paying the levy is by officially getting out of the church and that 's exactly what thousands of people do each year .

a month and a half after the death of president boris trajkovski in a plane crash , macedonians are to elect a new head of state .
all four candidates say they 'll embrace trajkovski 's commitment to bury ethnic enmities . the four men vying to replace boris trajkovski in wednesday 's elections all have one important thing in common with the late macedonian president , analysts say .
like him , they want to bury past ethnic divisions that nearly led the country into civil war , and focus on bringing macedonia closer in line with the european union .
up until his death in a february plane crash , trajkovski had been one of the most energetic proponents of closer ties between macedonia and europe .
he was also well-practiced at balancing the demands of macedonian hard-liners and ethnic albanian politicians . so far , the 2001 peace deal he presided over has remained in place .
the deal laid out reforms to end tensions between the two ethnic groups , making it possible to turn politicians ' attention to the country 's pressing economic problems , including a 40 percent unemployment rate . crvenkovski favored to win the next macedonian president will inherit trajkovski 's legacy .
the favored candidate is the country 's prime minister , branko crvenkovski , who represents the macedonian majority .
the post of president is largely ceremonial , so it is seen as a testament to the importance of trajkovski 's successor that crvenkovski is willing to risk his more powerful role as prime minister . crvenkovski 's campaign posters show him at the side of world leaders such as u.s. president george w. bush and u.n. secretary-general kofi annan .
his slogan reads : " branko crvenkovski : the statesman . " " we need good interethnic relations , peace and security , " he told a rally on monday .
" it means membership in nato and the european union .
let 's grab the chance . " crvenkovski 's main rival in the election is another macedonian , sasko kedev of the opposition vmro party .
though he is largely unknown , analysts have not ruled out a surprise victory for kedev , who 's been positioning himself as the " new face of macedonia . " albanian candidates ' slim hopes two ethnic albanians are also in the race , though they are reported to have little chance of winning .
ethnic albanians make up only a quarter of the population , and macedonian voters are unlikely to cross ethnic lines . another possible outcome is no outcome - at least in the first round .
for the election to be valid , the winner has to receive over 50 percent of the vote .
with four candidates , it 's likely that there will be a second round runoff between the top two candidates . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de president 's death throws pall over macedonia 's eu drive macedonian president boris trajkovski died in a plane crash over bosnia on thursday .

a month and a half after the death of president boris trajkovski in a plane crash , macedonians are to elect a new head of state .
all four candidates say they 'll embrace trajkovski 's commitment to bury ethnic enmities . the four men vying to replace boris trajkovski in wednesday 's elections all have one important thing in common with the late macedonian president , analysts say .
like him , they want to bury past ethnic divisions that nearly led the country into civil war , and focus on bringing macedonia closer in line with the european union .
up until his death in a february plane crash , trajkovski had been one of the most energetic proponents of closer ties between macedonia and europe .
he was also well-practiced at balancing the demands of macedonian hard-liners and ethnic albanian politicians . so far , the 2001 peace deal he presided over has remained in place .
the deal laid out reforms to end tensions between the two ethnic groups , making it possible to turn politicians ' attention to the country 's pressing economic problems , including a 40 percent unemployment rate . crvenkovski favored to win the next macedonian president will inherit trajkovski 's legacy .
the favored candidate is the country 's prime minister , branko crvenkovski , who represents the macedonian majority .
the post of president is largely ceremonial , so it is seen as a testament to the importance of trajkovski 's successor that crvenkovski is willing to risk his more powerful role as prime minister . crvenkovski 's campaign posters show him at the side of world leaders such as u.s. president george w. bush and u.n. secretary-general kofi annan .
his slogan reads : " branko crvenkovski : the statesman . " " we need good interethnic relations , peace and security , " he told a rally on monday .
" it means membership in nato and the european union .
let 's grab the chance . " crvenkovski 's main rival in the election is another macedonian , sasko kedev of the opposition vmro party .
though he is largely unknown , analysts have not ruled out a surprise victory for kedev , who 's been positioning himself as the " new face of macedonia . " albanian candidates ' slim hopes two ethnic albanians are also in the race , though they are reported to have little chance of winning .
ethnic albanians make up only a quarter of the population , and macedonian voters are unlikely to cross ethnic lines . another possible outcome is no outcome - at least in the first round .
for the election to be valid , the winner has to receive over 50 percent of the vote .
with four candidates , it 's likely that there will be a second round runoff between the top two candidates . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de president 's death throws pall over macedonia 's eu drive macedonian president boris trajkovski died in a plane crash over bosnia on thursday .

" what 's in people 's heads is important " europe 's integration challenge germany -pipe- 13.04.2004 " headscarves are the opposite of integration " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach is the conservatives ' point man on integration and immigration .
dw-world : foreigners make up nearly one-tenth of germany 's population .
is germany an immigrant country ? wolfgang bosbach : that 's purely a question of definition .
one can say a country is an immigrant country when there 's a noteworthy amount of immigration .
of course , germany is an immigrant country , like all countries .
however , one can also say - and this definition seems the right one to me - a country only becomes an immigrant country when it recruits immigrants .
that 's something we stopped doing in 1973 . we recruited immigrants for 18 years , from 1954 to 1973 .
then we recruited guest workers to come and work and then to leave again .
what we experienced was that they came , they worked here , but many of them stayed and brought over their families . in recent years , we have all come to the conclusion that we need a systematic integration policy under the heading " encourage but also demand . " what is successful integration ? integration is a success when you say , " i did n't just come to germany to work , to live , to have a better life than i did at home .
instead , i have found a new home in germany . "
that thought describes the situation better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " germans have to learn to approach immigrants . "
more than just learning the language is necessary , including being oriented in social relations , the country 's history .
on the one side , immigrants must be prepared to put effort into becoming integrated and to adapt to the germans .
on the other side , germans have to learn to approach immigrants .
we have to approach each other . has integration made progress in germany or has it regressed ? we have done both at the same time .
on the one hand , there 's no doubt that millions of immigrants have become superbly integrated , that they are our neighbors in the best sense of the word , that we do n't view them as foreigners ' in quotation marks ' anymore .
they are our colleagues , our teammates .
they play a role in local organizations and in church communities . on the other hand , especially in the big cities , where we have a high concentration of foreigners , parallel societies have developed .
that 's not good for integration .
if my neighbor , my baker , my butcher , my doctor , my lawyer are foreigners like me , why should i make an effort to become integrated , since i already get along fine . is wearing a headscarf compatible with integration ? no , the headscarf is the opposite of integration . it 's not for me to comment on - and certainly not to criticize - whether someone wears a headscarf as an expression of her religious convictions .
that is the individual 's decision .
just as you probably can not force someone to become integrated . but we have to differentiate between wearing a headscarf in public and wearing a headscarf when working as a civil servant .
it 's different , for example , with a teacher , who the children can not avoid .
we ca n't tolerate that .
that is no longer an issue of private convictions . but , the headscarf is not only an expression of religious conviction .
rather , it is also a symbol of social separation .
in a judeo-christian culture , one consciously dissociates oneself from the majority society with a headscarf . can a devout muslim become an integrated german citizen ? i do n't doubt that at all .
in a country marked by judeo-christianity there 's no question about which faith is more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in a country marked by judeo-christianity there 's no question about which faith is more important . " important .
we have freedom of religion .
we do n't have a state religion .
we have the separation between church and state .
i have respect for every devout muslim .
why should n't they apply for german citizenship ? does islam have a future in germany and europe ? islam is advancing and not just in europe .
no one questions islam 's right to exist .
we are a very tolerant country .
but tolerance must end , where religious convictions lead to totalitarian pretenses , where people aim to demolish our state and legal system to establish a theocracy based on islam . why has germany failed to pass an immigration law yet ? people sometimes get the impression we do n't have any legislation on foreigners in germany .
we do have a foreigners law , asylum laws , a multitude of regulations .
now the question is whether the new social democratic-green immigration bill is in the country 's interest , whether it will create more problems or solve more problems . if we agree , we will have an entirely new immigration law .
for the social democratic-green bill is not an amendment to the existing foreigner legislation .
rather , it is an entirely new law .

" what 's in people 's heads is important " europe 's integration challenge germany -pipe- 13.04.2004 " headscarves are the opposite of integration " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach is the conservatives ' point man on integration and immigration .
dw-world : foreigners make up nearly one-tenth of germany 's population .
is germany an immigrant country ? wolfgang bosbach : that 's purely a question of definition .
one can say a country is an immigrant country when there 's a noteworthy amount of immigration .
of course , germany is an immigrant country , like all countries .
however , one can also say - and this definition seems the right one to me - a country only becomes an immigrant country when it recruits immigrants .
that 's something we stopped doing in 1973 . we recruited immigrants for 18 years , from 1954 to 1973 .
then we recruited guest workers to come and work and then to leave again .
what we experienced was that they came , they worked here , but many of them stayed and brought over their families . in recent years , we have all come to the conclusion that we need a systematic integration policy under the heading " encourage but also demand . " what is successful integration ? integration is a success when you say , " i did n't just come to germany to work , to live , to have a better life than i did at home .
instead , i have found a new home in germany . "
that thought describes the situation better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " germans have to learn to approach immigrants . "
more than just learning the language is necessary , including being oriented in social relations , the country 's history .
on the one side , immigrants must be prepared to put effort into becoming integrated and to adapt to the germans .
on the other side , germans have to learn to approach immigrants .
we have to approach each other . has integration made progress in germany or has it regressed ? we have done both at the same time .
on the one hand , there 's no doubt that millions of immigrants have become superbly integrated , that they are our neighbors in the best sense of the word , that we do n't view them as foreigners ' in quotation marks ' anymore .
they are our colleagues , our teammates .
they play a role in local organizations and in church communities . on the other hand , especially in the big cities , where we have a high concentration of foreigners , parallel societies have developed .
that 's not good for integration .
if my neighbor , my baker , my butcher , my doctor , my lawyer are foreigners like me , why should i make an effort to become integrated , since i already get along fine . is wearing a headscarf compatible with integration ? no , the headscarf is the opposite of integration . it 's not for me to comment on - and certainly not to criticize - whether someone wears a headscarf as an expression of her religious convictions .
that is the individual 's decision .
just as you probably can not force someone to become integrated . but we have to differentiate between wearing a headscarf in public and wearing a headscarf when working as a civil servant .
it 's different , for example , with a teacher , who the children can not avoid .
we ca n't tolerate that .
that is no longer an issue of private convictions . but , the headscarf is not only an expression of religious conviction .
rather , it is also a symbol of social separation .
in a judeo-christian culture , one consciously dissociates oneself from the majority society with a headscarf . can a devout muslim become an integrated german citizen ? i do n't doubt that at all .
in a country marked by judeo-christianity there 's no question about which faith is more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in a country marked by judeo-christianity there 's no question about which faith is more important . " important .
we have freedom of religion .
we do n't have a state religion .
we have the separation between church and state .
i have respect for every devout muslim .
why should n't they apply for german citizenship ? does islam have a future in germany and europe ? islam is advancing and not just in europe .
no one questions islam 's right to exist .
we are a very tolerant country .
but tolerance must end , where religious convictions lead to totalitarian pretenses , where people aim to demolish our state and legal system to establish a theocracy based on islam . why has germany failed to pass an immigration law yet ? people sometimes get the impression we do n't have any legislation on foreigners in germany .
we do have a foreigners law , asylum laws , a multitude of regulations .
now the question is whether the new social democratic-green immigration bill is in the country 's interest , whether it will create more problems or solve more problems . if we agree , we will have an entirely new immigration law .
for the social democratic-green bill is not an amendment to the existing foreigner legislation .

dw-world : " headscarves are the opposite of integration " dw-world : europe 's integration challenge germany -pipe- 13.04.2004 " what 's in people 's heads is important " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth has been the commissioner of human rights and humanitarian aid since 2003 .
dw-world : opposition christian democrats say germany has n't been an immigrant country since it stopped recruiting foreigners in 1972 .
do you think germany is an immigrant country ? claudia roth : it ’ s one of the biggest lies of past decades to say that germany isn ’ t a real immigrant country .
we have been an immigrant country for over 50 years , and people have come here who have helped to build this country .
but what we are not is an immigrant country that has managed to regulate immigration , to protect the right to asylum and to foster integration . what is successful integration ? successful integration is much more than acquiring language skills .
integration must be related to legal integration , to education and work .
legal integration means , for example , eased naturalization , a citizenship right that we changed . successful integration means that the wealth people possess , who come here from other cultures , from other languages , from different religions is understood as wealth and not as a threat .
that we build on these abilities by providing native language opportunities and at the same time fostering the german language much more purposefully and much more consistently among the people who come here . successful integration is also an expression of the education opportunities that immigrants ' children have in our country .
if social origin remains the most decisive factor in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education access for immigrant children : " we have a lot of catching up to do . " when it comes to access and school problems - that children with immigrant backgrounds , above all , have - we have a lot of catching up to do .
in the areas of work , training , joblessness the numbers show that immigrants are much more frequently affected by unemployment , that young people have big difficulties advancing into higher spheres . we have big deficits , and that also arises from the ideological refusal to say we are an immigrant country .
people come here ; people should come here .
it makes our country richer , more multifaceted . has integration made progress in germany or has it regressed ? it hasn ’ t regressed .
at least there ’ s a consensus that integration is important .
there are certainly many very positive signals of successful integration , but there are also negative signals .
groups exist that withdraw into their alleged own cultures .
you have the feeling there are groups of immigrants who wall themselves into an alleged culture of their country of origin .
turkey , for example .
sometimes i have the feeling things are much more open in istanbul or izmir than in some areas of germany .
a similar problem : ethnic germans -lrb- from eastern europe -rrb- , who for decades in russia , in the other countries where they lived , holed themselves up in their alleged german culture and came to germany and noticed it ’ s somehow totally different , and then they aren ’ t able to cope . some have pointed to the muslim headscarf as a symbol of cultural isolation and social exclusion following a ruling by germany 's high court allowing a muslim teacher to wear her headscarf in class if there is no state law against it .
does it in fact signify the social exclusion of women ? i wouldn ’ t put it so simply .
we greens advocate throughout the world that there shouldn ’ t be constraints requiring wearing a headscarf .
why should i advocate constraints in germany not to wear a headscarf ? but the case that the issue is pegged on , a teacher who is german , who studied at german universities , who is everything but the exemplification of an oppressed woman , but rather lives highly emancipated and self-determined , to claim that she is the example of the greatest form of oppression is wrong . there are many reasons why women in our country wear headscarves .
i might like them or not .
i wouldn ’ t forcefully impose something in the german democracy that i fight in other countries : the constraint of self-determination .
i don ’ t believe in carrying out women ’ s liberation in the form of discrimination .
and women ’ s emancipation , women ’ s equality is definitely not expressed just by the headscarf . is wearing a headscarf compatible with integration ? i think so .
the headscarf issue isn ’ t an issue of the willingness to become integrated , rather it ’ s important what ’ s in people ’ s heads , what ’ s happening underneath the headscarf and how our democracy is interpreted and accepted . can a strictly devout muslim become an integrated german citizen ? a strictly devout muslim can be integrated into our society just as a strictly devout catholic can . does islam have a future in germany and europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " islam has a present and a future . "
it doesn ’ t only have a future , it has a present , whether we like it or not .
it ’ s a question of democracy .
even now islam is the second largest religious community in the european union .
islam per se isn ’ t an enemy just like christianity per se isn ’ t an enemy .
we would be wise to treat the religious practices of different religions in our society equally , with the greatest meticulousness , particularly by virtue of our own historical responsibility and democratic sensibilities . why has germany failed to pass an immigration law yet ? because the ideological barriers are infinitely high here .
because this issue is always an issue that surfaces in the maelstrom of populist politics here .
because problems are very easily diverted onto weak groups in out society that have little lobby , like immigrants .
because people refuse future-oriented modern policies despite knowing better . we need this immigration law .
we need it urgently , because we can ’ t compete anymore with other european countries .
but we only need an immigration law if immigration is truly regulated .
what we don ’ t need is an immigration limitation law . nancy isenson interviewed claudia roth send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

sometimes i have the feeling things are much more open in istanbul or izmir than in some areas of germany .
a similar problem : ethnic germans -lrb- from eastern europe -rrb- , who for decades in russia , in the other countries where they lived , holed themselves up in their alleged german culture and came to germany and noticed it ’ s somehow totally different , and then they aren ’ t able to cope . some have pointed to the muslim headscarf as a symbol of cultural isolation and social exclusion following a ruling by germany 's high court allowing a muslim teacher to wear her headscarf in class if there is no state law against it .
does it in fact signify the social exclusion of women ? i wouldn ’ t put it so simply .
we greens advocate throughout the world that there shouldn ’ t be constraints requiring wearing a headscarf .
why should i advocate constraints in germany not to wear a headscarf ? but the case that the issue is pegged on , a teacher who is german , who studied at german universities , who is everything but the exemplification of an oppressed woman , but rather lives highly emancipated and self-determined , to claim that she is the example of the greatest form of oppression is wrong . there are many reasons why women in our country wear headscarves .
i might like them or not .
i wouldn ’ t forcefully impose something in the german democracy that i fight in other countries : the constraint of self-determination .
i don ’ t believe in carrying out women ’ s liberation in the form of discrimination .
and women ’ s emancipation , women ’ s equality is definitely not expressed just by the headscarf . is wearing a headscarf compatible with integration ? i think so .
the headscarf issue isn ’ t an issue of the willingness to become integrated , rather it ’ s important what ’ s in people ’ s heads , what ’ s happening underneath the headscarf and how our democracy is interpreted and accepted . can a strictly devout muslim become an integrated german citizen ? a strictly devout muslim can be integrated into our society just as a strictly devout catholic can . does islam have a future in germany and europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " islam has a present and a future . "
it doesn ’ t only have a future , it has a present , whether we like it or not .
it ’ s a question of democracy .
even now islam is the second largest religious community in the european union .
islam per se isn ’ t an enemy just like christianity per se isn ’ t an enemy .
we would be wise to treat the religious practices of different religions in our society equally , with the greatest meticulousness , particularly by virtue of our own historical responsibility and democratic sensibilities . why has germany failed to pass an immigration law yet ? because the ideological barriers are infinitely high here .
because this issue is always an issue that surfaces in the maelstrom of populist politics here .
because problems are very easily diverted onto weak groups in out society that have little lobby , like immigrants .
because people refuse future-oriented modern policies despite knowing better . we need this immigration law .
we need it urgently , because we can ’ t compete anymore with other european countries .
but we only need an immigration law if immigration is truly regulated .
what we don ’ t need is an immigration limitation law . nancy isenson interviewed claudia roth send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

now a christian democratic politician has proposed incentives for church tax payers , in the hopes that people will stop leaving in droves . christian böhr took advantage of the easter holiday , when the churches enjoy throngs of visitors , to announce that the growing number of people opting out of the christian churches was an ominous development that had to be stopped . " leaving the church should not be a scheme to save taxes , " the christian democratic party 's deputy chairman proclaimed monday .
böhr proposed that germans be offered tax incentives so they will stay in the church .
he said catholics and protestants should be allowed to deduct 20 percent of the church tax they pay from their income tax . the government should examine his proposal , which could save easily taxpayers around € 100 -lrb- $ 119 -rrb- per year , böhr said .
the state would profit from giving church taxpayers a break .
" the churches run numerous kindergartens , hospitals , schools or social stations . "
if the churches lost funding , they would be forced to close such institutions , böhr claimed . state collection plate church tax in germany means that germans fund the country 's christian churches whether they donate to the collection plate or not .
but taxpayers can already deduct the payments on their tax declarations as expenses . germans pay 8 to 9 percent of their income tax if they are members in one of the recognized religious communities .
most germans are born into the catholic or protestant church .
they start paying church tax as soon as they start working ; parents pay church tax on their children 's behalf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishops in the cologne cathedral in 2002 , the churches received € 3.35 billion -lrb- $ 4.02 billion -rrb- in church tax revenue . the german state agreed long ago with the catholic and protestant churches that it would collect the levy and pass it on to them , and the state 's right do so is even laid out in germany 's constitution .
other religious communities can also claim a piece of the pie , as long as they are registered as statutory bodies and recognized by the individual german states , which are responsible for collecting the tax . in berlin , the old catholic church , which split from roman catholicism in the late 19th century , also receives tax revenues from its members , and in other german states confessions such as judaism get church tax money , berlin senate spokesman matthias kolbeck told dw-world .
leaving the lap of the church the only way people can avoid paying the levy is by officially getting out of the church and that 's exactly what thousands of people do each year .
only 63.8 percent of the 82 million people in germany are members of the roman catholic or protestant church , and the numbers have been dropping dramatically for years .
in 2002 over 119,000 people got out of the roman catholic church .
the most recent figures from the protestant church show that nearly 172,000 members opted out in 2001 .
from 1992 to 2001 almost 1.4 million people became former catholics and nearly 2.4 million germans left protestantism . but not everyone who leaves the church is just out to save taxes .
the badische neueste nachrichten newspaper commented on böhr 's proposal : " the 300,000 christians who turned their back on the two big christian churches … did n't all leave because of church tax , but frequently for other reasons : many view the church , especially the catholic church , as strangely out-of-touch . " and for years , critics of the tax have said that it should be transformed into a levy to benefit culture in general .
" a culture tax that everyone had to pay would be fairer in every way - potentially with the requirement that the taxpayer can designate which statutory body should receive the money , " the nürnberger zeitung paper wrote . nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : tax cuts leave germans cold a poll conducted by the forsa opinion research company shows that the majority of germans do not feel that the 2004 tax cuts of € 15 billion -lrb- $ 18.3 billion -rrb- are having much effect on their disposable income .

it says ministers have met their pledge to recruit 2,000 extra gps by april 2004 and suggests 97 % of patients now see a gp within the two day target .
dr david colin-thome , the government 's primary care tsar who wrote the report , said gps were also providing a greater range of services than ever before .
the british medical association welcomed the findings .
hospital work according to the report , gp practices are now doing more of the work traditionally done in hospitals .
it says gps carried out over 700,000 such procedures last year , up 100,000 on the previous year .
this progress report pays tribute to what is already being achieved in primary care and general practice dr john chisholm , british medical association the report says progress has also been made in modernising practice premises .
nearly 2,000 surgeries have now been improved or replaced .
some 268 non-stop primary care centres have also been established .
in addition , over 25,000 community nurses have been trained to prescribe certain medicines to patients .
" over the last four years , primary care services have continued to expand and improve with more doctors and more nurses providing a greater range of services than ever before , " said dr colin-thome .
he said the introduction of the new gp contract at the beginning of april will drive improvements further .
the aim of the contract is to reward practices for the quality of care they provide , not just the number of patients they treat .
dr colin-thome said : " with almost every general practice in england now signed up to the new gp contract , investment in primary care will increase by a third over the next three years .
" the new contract will help realise our vision of a responsive , high-quality primary care service that meets patients ' healthcare needs , close to their home , whatever their circumstances and whatever the time of day or night . "
' more to come ' dr john chisholm , chairman of the bma 's gps committee , backed the report 's findings .
" this progress report pays tribute to what is already being achieved in primary care and general practice , through the hard work and commitment of gps and primary care teams .
" it is also a herald of what is to come , particularly as a result of a new gp contract that is better for patients and for general practitioners and full of opportunities . "

" i am delighted to see that the tremendous strengths of primary care are , at last , being recognised and supported , " said its chairman professor david haslam .

" this report confirms that major improvements are underway in primary care , " said gill morgan , its chief executive .
" we believe the new gms contract is an exciting opportunity to build on this , with a new drive to provide high quality services closer to home .
" it also provides a firm basis on which to continue the trend towards integrated services across primary and secondary care that can further improve the patient experience and outcomes . "
andrew lansley , for the tories , said : " we welcome the progress that has been made but do not underestimate the real problems that exist .

it says ministers have met their pledge to recruit 2,000 extra gps by april 2004 and suggests 97 % of patients now see a gp within the two day target .
dr david colin-thome , the government 's primary care tsar who wrote the report , said gps were also providing a greater range of services than ever before .
the british medical association welcomed the findings .
hospital work according to the report , gp practices are now doing more of the work traditionally done in hospitals .
it says gps carried out over 700,000 such procedures last year , up 100,000 on the previous year .
this progress report pays tribute to what is already being achieved in primary care and general practice dr john chisholm , british medical association the report says progress has also been made in modernising practice premises .
nearly 2,000 surgeries have now been improved or replaced .
some 268 non-stop primary care centres have also been established .
in addition , over 25,000 community nurses have been trained to prescribe certain medicines to patients .
" over the last four years , primary care services have continued to expand and improve with more doctors and more nurses providing a greater range of services than ever before , " said dr colin-thome .
he said the introduction of the new gp contract at the beginning of april will drive improvements further .
the aim of the contract is to reward practices for the quality of care they provide , not just the number of patients they treat .
dr colin-thome said : " with almost every general practice in england now signed up to the new gp contract , investment in primary care will increase by a third over the next three years .
" the new contract will help realise our vision of a responsive , high-quality primary care service that meets patients ' healthcare needs , close to their home , whatever their circumstances and whatever the time of day or night . "
' more to come ' dr john chisholm , chairman of the bma 's gps committee , backed the report 's findings .
" this progress report pays tribute to what is already being achieved in primary care and general practice , through the hard work and commitment of gps and primary care teams .
" it is also a herald of what is to come , particularly as a result of a new gp contract that is better for patients and for general practitioners and full of opportunities . "
the royal college of gps also welcomed the findings .
" i am delighted to see that the tremendous strengths of primary care are , at last , being recognised and supported , " said its chairman professor david haslam .
the nhs confederation , which represents nhs management , backed that view .
" this report confirms that major improvements are underway in primary care , " said gill morgan , its chief executive .
" we believe the new gms contract is an exciting opportunity to build on this , with a new drive to provide high quality services closer to home .
" it also provides a firm basis on which to continue the trend towards integrated services across primary and secondary care that can further improve the patient experience and outcomes . "

a fatal accident inquiry is expected into the death of emma frame who fell ill after being prescribed 10 times the licensed dose of fluticasone .
doctors have admitted they do not know how many children are on such doses .
the drug is safe within recommended limits and helps thousands control what can be life-threatening asthma .
bbc scotland 's documentary programme frontline scotland said that concerned parents were advised to contact their gp for advice , but under no circumstances should they stop important medication .
emma 's parents , from strathaven in lanarkshire , want a full review of prescribing practises to make sure other children are not put at risk .
scotland is the asthma capital of the world with one in three children having the disease .
we are the experts in manufacturing and developing medicines , the doctors are experts in treating patients and we do work very closely together dr david leather glaxosmithkline uk emma , who died when she was five , became a sufferer when she was diagnosed with the disease at the age of one after coughing at night to the point where she would vomit .
doctors recommended she went on inhaled steroids and when she was 18-months old she was put on a new drug , flixotide , otherwise known as fluticasone .
her father stewart said : " when emma was taken to hospital , she was shaking and starting to fit .
" she was ventilated and at that point people were optimistic again , but after about an hour the doctors told us that she could n't survive .
' benefited patients ' " the loss of emma was devastating and not knowing what happened at the time did n't seem important .
" the shock of losing emma was every parent 's nightmare .
it is very difficult to explain how you feel at that point . "
a government department , the medicine control agency , looks at the evidence on the safety of new drugs .
it licenses them on what it considers to be the largest safest dose , but doctors can prescribe beyond that maximum .
emma frame died at the age of five in the case of emma , and her older brother callum who was also an asthma sufferer , the dosage was 10 times the so-called " off-label " recommendation .
glaxosmithkline is the manufacturer of flixotide , which generates £ 3bn in worldwide sales for the firm .
dr david leather , director of medical affairs for glaxosmithkline uk , said : " you have to remember that flixotide has been out 10 years and it has benefited 250,000 patients who have had their lives dramatically improved .
" inhaled steroids have also benefited asthmatics , asthma deaths were rising in the uk up until a decade or so ago and in the last 10 years we have seen a reduction in deaths directly because of these medicines - almost a 40 % reduction in the last 10 years or so .
" we are the experts in manufacturing and developing medicines , the doctors are experts in treating patients and we do work very closely together .
" we are 100 % confident about the safety profile of floxitide within its licensed doses and we recognise that doctors have difficult decisions to make . "

the music development fund is facing a 30 % reduction in its budget this year .
the prince of wales ' official harpist , catrin finch , has told bbc wales ' taro naw programme , that every child should be able to learn a musical instrument .
the welsh assembly government said it is up to individual local authorities to decide how they spend the total funding made available to them .
the music development fund was set up in 1999 , to pay for extra-curricular music activities , including instrument lessons for pupils who could not afford them and music therapy for children with special needs .
also included in the fund was rock and pop tuition to encourage pupils who might not otherwise be interested in academic studies .
when people come up to you after a performance and tell you what they have got out of it , it makes everything worthwhile catrin finch but during this financial year , the fund is being cut by more than 30 % - from £ 3m to £ 1.9m.
there are also fears that the entire fund will be cut in 2005 .
ms finch , 23 , who is originally from llanon , near aberystwyth , said she was very disappointed that the fund was being cut in wales " of all places " .
" music is so important for children , " she added .
" it 's vital that every child has the chance to learn an instrument .
" i had so much help from ceredigion council .
my parents could not have afforded all the tuition i had and everybody deserves that chance . "
in scotland , its parliament has announced £ 17.5m in additional funding to ensure that every child in primary schools there has the chance to learn an instrument .
" by now i have had wonderful experiences through music and have met people all over the world , " said ms finch .
" when people come up to you after a performance and tell you what they have got out of it , it makes everything worthwhile . "
in a statement the welsh assembly government said local authorities had received a " good " settlement of nearly £ 3.2bn from them for 2004-05 - and it was up to them to decide how to spend it .
" since 1999 a specific music development fund has provided funding for music activities outside of formal schooling , " it read .
" over the last three years over £ 9m has been provided for the music development fund . " £ 1.9m has been earmarked for 2004-05 .
" however , as the music development fund is now included in the better schools fund programme , local authorities this year will have the flexibility to move money into different activities to target what they regard as their priority areas . "
taro naw will be broadcast on tuesday at 2025 bst on s4c .

baa also revealed that passenger numbers hit 10.8 million in march , a 10.4 % rise on the same month last year .
the sharp increase was due to depressed figures in march 2003 , when the iraq conflict led to a fall in air travel .
baa operates airports at heathrow , stansted , gatwick , southampton , glasgow , edinburgh and aberdeen .
budget boost heathrow saw an 11.6 % increase in passenger volumes in march , compared with the same month in 2003 .
meanwhile , stansted saw a rise of 21 % , and gatwick managed a rise of 0.6 % despite a 17.6 % drop in charter traffic .
but the group 's biggest success story was southampton which saw passenger numbers surge 86.9 % thanks to the growth of low-cost scheduled services .
elsewhere , glasgow , edinburgh and aberdeen airports performed solidly with a combined monthly growth rate of 7.1 pct .
steady growth north atlantic traffic enjoyed a strong recovery as passengers returned following recent terror scares , with numbers up 12.1 % - with heathrow performing particularly well with growth of 16.6 % on such routes .
other long haul traffic rose by 20 % , european scheduled traffic also recorded gains of 12.6 % , and uk domestic routes gained 6.6 % .
but the charter market remained relatively weak with a drop of 9 % .
baa also revealed that as a result of a slow recovery in world trade and cut backs in air services following the deadly sars virus outbreak , cargo fell 1.3 % to 1.7 million tonnes .
however , looking ahead the group said that , notwithstanding external shocks , it expected to see passenger growth of 5 % for the year to end-march 2005 .
