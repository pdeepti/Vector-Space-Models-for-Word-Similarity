a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .
the accident has triggered a debate on uncontrolled speeding on the autobahns . rolf fischer 's passion for high speeds proved to be his undoing on tuesday when a german court found the 34-year-old mercedes test driver guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while travelling at 250km / h on a german motorway . nicknamed " turbo-rolf " among his colleagues for his preference for fast cars , the daimlerchrysler engineer now faces 18 months in prison . fischer has also been fired by daimlerchrysler following the court sentencing . a case of reckless speeding the state prosecution in karlsruhe , who had called for a prison sentence of one year and nine months , said that on the day of the accident in summer last year , fischer was tailgaiting a car driven by a woman named only as jasmin a. on the a5 autobahn . the engineer was on his way to a car test-track in the northern city of papenburg in a company-owned , dark mercedes slk .
fischer forced the 21-year-old woman , driving in a much smaller kia , to shift into one of the slow lanes . startled by his agressiveness and speed , the woman lost control of her car while swerving to change lanes .
the car spun across two lanes and smashed into some trees .
she and her daughter , rebecca , died instantly .
fischer sped off from the scene . police said they had finally found fischer on the basis of petrol station receipts , mobile phone records and the testimony of a witness .
witnesses during the trial also identified fischer 's mercedes as having caused the accident . however fischer himself had pleaded not guilty to manslaughter , fleeing from the scene of the accident and serious traffic violations during the trial .
despite his colorful nickname , which has been splashed in the tabloid press , fischer had denied his love for fast driving .
" it 's a complete mystery to me why people say that i have an aggressive driving style , " he said during the trial .
" i never forced anybody off the road nor did i notice anything about an accident , " he said . speed limits anyone ? the case has prompted new questions about the lack of speed limits on germany 's 11,393-kilometer-long autobahn network designed in the 1920s .
germany remains the only country in the world that allows drivers to stretch their cars to the limit , a feature that also lures speed-happy tourists unable to convert their motorways into racing tracks in their own countries . but experts are now repeating calls for a review of the country 's fast-lane culture . " we think it is a big problem because germany is the only country world-wide where no limits of speed on the motorway exists .
that means there are a lot of parts on the motorway where people can drive as fast as they want to , " daniel kluge of the german ministry of transport and environment told deutsche welle .
" so we have big problems where there are cars with less speed - then you have a big speed difference . " the losers usually are slower drivers caught in the fast lane , who are subject to an irritable flash of headlights or impatient drivers demanding clear passage . the german automobile association , adac , has repeatedly pointed out that there is a recommended top speed of 130km / h on all german motorways . but kluge pointed out there are no incentives to stick to the limit .
" if you go faster that that there is no possibility to be stopped by the police so … you in fact drive as fast as you want to . " speeding : personal freedom ? though the " turbo-rolf " case has stirred national debate in the country about speeding , tailgaiting or flashing headlights on motorways , kluge said it 's unlikely to radically alter the apparent german fascination with speed . he said there were several reasons for it .
" one part is the advertising of the automobile industry ; in germany it is nearly a tradition to advertise cars which drive safe with high speed , " kluge said .
" another thing is that many people in germany still think it is a kind of freedom and that it 's their right to have this personal feeling of speed . " but many believe that a prison sentence will now send a clear signal that there is indeed a limit to personal freedom on german motorways . kerstin steinbrecher -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese tourists in germany : castles and the autobahn since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .

today 's police send out an sms .
after more than a year of testing , germany 's interior ministry has announced police will start using sms text messages to track down criminals .
critics say the plan encourages spying and is not effective . a bank has just been robbed . a prisoner has escaped .
a bus has been hijacked .
and now the police are conducting a mass manhunt to find the culprit .
calling all public-minded citizens !
in 10 german cities regional police start their search for escaped criminals and missing persons by reaching for their mobile phones and sending out a short text message .
the people on the ground ready to help are the hundreds of voluntarily registered " spotters " - like taxi and bus drivers or city workers - who have agreed to cooperate with the police to track down suspected criminals by sending in their tips .
organized by the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- , the sms crime tracking method has been functioning as a test project in regional police departments since september 2002 . but now german interior minister otto schily has announced that it will become a regular feature in police work throughout the country .
" it 's another precise way to have the public help search for criminals or missing people , " schily said at a press conference earlier in the week .
spy on your neighbor not everyone is pleased with the method .
critics have been quick to pounce on the concept of asking the public to join the police in fighting crime .
jörg tauss , media spokesman for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary faction - schily 's own party - fears that the new method will encourage citizens to spy on and " denounce " their neighbors and other people .
he called on schily to stop at once this " latest nonsense from police circles . "
rainer lingenthal of the federal interior ministry rejected the criticism and urged tauss to reconsider and retract his remarks about denunciation .
the spd 's domestic policy spokesman , dieter wiefelspütz , said the sms search method was an additional possibility that should be tried out , but he conceded that miracles could not be expected from it .
however , schily said the new method could significantly improve crime fighting .
speaking at a press conference last sunday , the minister emphasized the need for the police to exhaust all possibilities in their attempts to capture a perpetrator immediately after a crime has been committed .
" the speedy and direct involvement of citizens enables new forms of cooperation between police and the population , " he said adding that using sms increased the probability of tracking down the criminal and quickly clearing up the crime .
ministry claims " considerable success " according to the interior ministry , the police achieved " considerable success " during the year-long trial period .
introduced at 11 police stations around the country , the sms search method involved the registry of between 50 and 100 volonteers in each location , many of whom were involved in public transport and worked in close proximity to the public . messages sent out by the police often included descriptions of suspects and vehicle information such as licence plate numbers .
anyone who receives the information and makes a positive identification can call a special hotline at the local police station .
for those a little hesitant , there 's a financial incentive : should the information provided by the sms receiver lead to the apprehension and conviction of a wanted person , the police will give the citizen a reward of around 50 euros .
based on the positive results of the tests in all the major german cities , the bka has decided to employ the sms function in all its police departments .
media say only " modest successes " however , media reports refer only to " modest successes " so far .
the ostthüringer zeitung newspaper reported that during a test in the eastern city of jena there had been no concrete relation between effort and use .
even police are not convinced of the method 's effectiveness .
the states of bavaria and baden-württemberg , as well as the police in cologne , have said they do not want to take part in the project .
other federal states have not yet decided . dw staff -lrb- bp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cops test sms project to catch crooks a pilot project enlisting the help of the public to catch criminals using information transmitted by sms text messages to mobile phones has started this week in the german cities of wiesbaden and bochum .

organized by the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- , the sms crime tracking method has been functioning as a test project in regional police departments since september 2002 . but now german interior minister otto schily has announced that it will become a regular feature in police work throughout the country .
" it 's another precise way to have the public help search for criminals or missing people , " schily said at a press conference earlier in the week .
spy on your neighbor not everyone is pleased with the method .
critics have been quick to pounce on the concept of asking the public to join the police in fighting crime .
jörg tauss , media spokesman for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary faction - schily 's own party - fears that the new method will encourage citizens to spy on and " denounce " their neighbors and other people .
he called on schily to stop at once this " latest nonsense from police circles . "
rainer lingenthal of the federal interior ministry rejected the criticism and urged tauss to reconsider and retract his remarks about denunciation .
the spd 's domestic policy spokesman , dieter wiefelspütz , said the sms search method was an additional possibility that should be tried out , but he conceded that miracles could not be expected from it .
however , schily said the new method could significantly improve crime fighting .
speaking at a press conference last sunday , the minister emphasized the need for the police to exhaust all possibilities in their attempts to capture a perpetrator immediately after a crime has been committed .
" the speedy and direct involvement of citizens enables new forms of cooperation between police and the population , " he said adding that using sms increased the probability of tracking down the criminal and quickly clearing up the crime .
ministry claims " considerable success " according to the interior ministry , the police achieved " considerable success " during the year-long trial period .
introduced at 11 police stations around the country , the sms search method involved the registry of between 50 and 100 volonteers in each location , many of whom were involved in public transport and worked in close proximity to the public . messages sent out by the police often included descriptions of suspects and vehicle information such as licence plate numbers .
anyone who receives the information and makes a positive identification can call a special hotline at the local police station .
for those a little hesitant , there 's a financial incentive : should the information provided by the sms receiver lead to the apprehension and conviction of a wanted person , the police will give the citizen a reward of around 50 euros .
based on the positive results of the tests in all the major german cities , the bka has decided to employ the sms function in all its police departments .
media say only " modest successes " however , media reports refer only to " modest successes " so far .
the ostthüringer zeitung newspaper reported that during a test in the eastern city of jena there had been no concrete relation between effort and use .
even police are not convinced of the method 's effectiveness .
the states of bavaria and baden-württemberg , as well as the police in cologne , have said they do not want to take part in the project .

" sibel and i hoped naively that it would n't come out , " he told a berlin daily . even the berlinale 's director dieter kosslick is firmly throwing his weight behind the actress .
" we 're behind her all the way , " he said .
kosslick admitted he too had known about kekilli 's past , and said " but i have nothing to say here morally . "
the berlinale director added that he had organized a lawyer for kekilli and mobilized everything within his power .
" but thanks to the media , she ca n't even go out of her home , she 's totally besieged , " he said . head on wins accolades head-on has been hailed by the german media , not just because of its hard-hitting story line , but also because it was the first german film to win the golden bear after 18 long years . akin , whose films usually deal with young turks in germany straddling two cultures , has since been praised for putting german film back on the map . the film tells the story of a young turkish-german woman played by kekilli who enters a marriage of convenience with a beer-drinking , middle-aged turkish-german punk -lrb- played by birol ünel -rrb- to escape her conservative muslim family .
the film moves between hamburg and istanbul . as the two live it up with their own wild lifestyles and separate sexual affairs , the couple eventually falls in love - a situation that ends when the husband kills one of the lovers in a jealous rage . kekilli , a virtual unknown until head-on grabbed attention at the berlinale -lrb- she was allegedly spotted by akin on the street and cast right away -rrb- told dw-world last week that she was familiar with the situation in the film .
" i also grew up in such a conservative family , where there are such girls , " she said .
" my parents are modern , but there were always conflicts when i did n't get my freedom to an extent , but i always fought for it . " most agree that the present scandal wo n't damage kekilli 's budding acting career , but rather have the opposite effect .
as german actor mathieu carriere pointed out , " the fact that sibel kekilli had starred in pornos is unimportant .
better to go from pornos to the " oscar " than the other way round .

a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .
the accident has triggered a debate on uncontrolled speeding on the autobahns . rolf fischer 's passion for high speeds proved to be his undoing on tuesday when a german court found the 34-year-old mercedes test driver guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while travelling at 250km / h on a german motorway . nicknamed " turbo-rolf " among his colleagues for his preference for fast cars , the daimlerchrysler engineer now faces 18 months in prison . fischer has also been fired by daimlerchrysler following the court sentencing . a case of reckless speeding the state prosecution in karlsruhe , who had called for a prison sentence of one year and nine months , said that on the day of the accident in summer last year , fischer was tailgaiting a car driven by a woman named only as jasmin a. on the a5 autobahn . the engineer was on his way to a car test-track in the northern city of papenburg in a company-owned , dark mercedes slk .
fischer forced the 21-year-old woman , driving in a much smaller kia , to shift into one of the slow lanes . startled by his agressiveness and speed , the woman lost control of her car while swerving to change lanes .
the car spun across two lanes and smashed into some trees .
she and her daughter , rebecca , died instantly .
fischer sped off from the scene . police said they had finally found fischer on the basis of petrol station receipts , mobile phone records and the testimony of a witness .
witnesses during the trial also identified fischer 's mercedes as having caused the accident . however fischer himself had pleaded not guilty to manslaughter , fleeing from the scene of the accident and serious traffic violations during the trial .
despite his colorful nickname , which has been splashed in the tabloid press , fischer had denied his love for fast driving .
" it 's a complete mystery to me why people say that i have an aggressive driving style , " he said during the trial .
" i never forced anybody off the road nor did i notice anything about an accident , " he said . speed limits anyone ? the case has prompted new questions about the lack of speed limits on germany 's 11,393-kilometer-long autobahn network designed in the 1920s .
germany remains the only country in the world that allows drivers to stretch their cars to the limit , a feature that also lures speed-happy tourists unable to convert their motorways into racing tracks in their own countries . but experts are now repeating calls for a review of the country 's fast-lane culture . " we think it is a big problem because germany is the only country world-wide where no limits of speed on the motorway exists .
that means there are a lot of parts on the motorway where people can drive as fast as they want to , " daniel kluge of the german ministry of transport and environment told deutsche welle .
" so we have big problems where there are cars with less speed - then you have a big speed difference . " the losers usually are slower drivers caught in the fast lane , who are subject to an irritable flash of headlights or impatient drivers demanding clear passage . the german automobile association , adac , has repeatedly pointed out that there is a recommended top speed of 130km / h on all german motorways . but kluge pointed out there are no incentives to stick to the limit .
" if you go faster that that there is no possibility to be stopped by the police so … you in fact drive as fast as you want to . " speeding : personal freedom ? though the " turbo-rolf " case has stirred national debate in the country about speeding , tailgaiting or flashing headlights on motorways , kluge said it 's unlikely to radically alter the apparent german fascination with speed . he said there were several reasons for it .
" one part is the advertising of the automobile industry ; in germany it is nearly a tradition to advertise cars which drive safe with high speed , " kluge said .
" another thing is that many people in germany still think it is a kind of freedom and that it 's their right to have this personal feeling of speed . " but many believe that a prison sentence will now send a clear signal that there is indeed a limit to personal freedom on german motorways . kerstin steinbrecher -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese tourists in germany : castles and the autobahn since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .

the accident has triggered a debate on uncontrolled speeding on the autobahns . rolf fischer 's passion for high speeds proved to be his undoing on tuesday when a german court found the 34-year-old mercedes test driver guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while travelling at 250km / h on a german motorway . nicknamed " turbo-rolf " among his colleagues for his preference for fast cars , the daimlerchrysler engineer now faces 18 months in prison . fischer has also been fired by daimlerchrysler following the court sentencing . a case of reckless speeding the state prosecution in karlsruhe , who had called for a prison sentence of one year and nine months , said that on the day of the accident in summer last year , fischer was tailgaiting a car driven by a woman named only as jasmin a. on the a5 autobahn . the engineer was on his way to a car test-track in the northern city of papenburg in a company-owned , dark mercedes slk .
fischer forced the 21-year-old woman , driving in a much smaller kia , to shift into one of the slow lanes . startled by his agressiveness and speed , the woman lost control of her car while swerving to change lanes .
the car spun across two lanes and smashed into some trees .
she and her daughter , rebecca , died instantly .
fischer sped off from the scene . police said they had finally found fischer on the basis of petrol station receipts , mobile phone records and the testimony of a witness .
witnesses during the trial also identified fischer 's mercedes as having caused the accident . however fischer himself had pleaded not guilty to manslaughter , fleeing from the scene of the accident and serious traffic violations during the trial .
despite his colorful nickname , which has been splashed in the tabloid press , fischer had denied his love for fast driving .
" it 's a complete mystery to me why people say that i have an aggressive driving style , " he said during the trial .
" i never forced anybody off the road nor did i notice anything about an accident , " he said . speed limits anyone ? the case has prompted new questions about the lack of speed limits on germany 's 11,393-kilometer-long autobahn network designed in the 1920s .
germany remains the only country in the world that allows drivers to stretch their cars to the limit , a feature that also lures speed-happy tourists unable to convert their motorways into racing tracks in their own countries . but experts are now repeating calls for a review of the country 's fast-lane culture . " we think it is a big problem because germany is the only country world-wide where no limits of speed on the motorway exists .
that means there are a lot of parts on the motorway where people can drive as fast as they want to , " daniel kluge of the german ministry of transport and environment told deutsche welle .
" so we have big problems where there are cars with less speed - then you have a big speed difference . " the losers usually are slower drivers caught in the fast lane , who are subject to an irritable flash of headlights or impatient drivers demanding clear passage . the german automobile association , adac , has repeatedly pointed out that there is a recommended top speed of 130km / h on all german motorways . but kluge pointed out there are no incentives to stick to the limit .
" if you go faster that that there is no possibility to be stopped by the police so … you in fact drive as fast as you want to . " speeding : personal freedom ? though the " turbo-rolf " case has stirred national debate in the country about speeding , tailgaiting or flashing headlights on motorways , kluge said it 's unlikely to radically alter the apparent german fascination with speed . he said there were several reasons for it .
" one part is the advertising of the automobile industry ; in germany it is nearly a tradition to advertise cars which drive safe with high speed , " kluge said .
" another thing is that many people in germany still think it is a kind of freedom and that it 's their right to have this personal feeling of speed . " but many believe that a prison sentence will now send a clear signal that there is indeed a limit to personal freedom on german motorways . kerstin steinbrecher -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese tourists in germany : castles and the autobahn since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .

"
days after being celebrated at the berlinale for her role in the award-winning film " head-on " , 23-year-old sibel kekilli is at the center of a sex scandal after a tabloid published sleazy details of a pornographic past . the curtain may have dropped on the star-studded berlinale film festival in the capital last week , but a scandal engulfing one of its most promising german stars has now exploded in the country . germany 's mass-selling bild announced this week that 23-year-old sibel kekilli - who received rave reviews for her role as a hamburg nurse in the film head-on that won the coveted golden bear in an unexpected triumph for germany - had starred in a string of porno films before her illustrious berlinale debut . the gritty lowdown in a no-holds-barred report , a headline in the tabloid screamed on tuesday , " why did the petite diva star in such hard-core pornos ? " an assortment of pictures showed the young actress involved in a porn scene on a location in ibiza as well as images from her latest award-winning film . the paper reported that kekilli , who is of turkish origin , had starred in " nine hardcore pornographic movies " until autumn 2002 .
the tabloid , notorious for its dirt-digging tactics reported that kekilli 's father , who has been living in germany since 1977 was in shock . " the disgrace is too great for the family , " kekilli 's father said .
" sibel moved to hamburg two years ago .
apparently she worked in the city hall and now this news .
i can never forgive her for it .
i do n't want to ever see her again , " he said . " what counts is the golden bear " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish-born actors sibel kekilli , left , and birol uenel pose during a photo call before the awarding ceremony at the berlin international filmfestival berlinale in berlin saturday , feb .
14 , 2004 .
fatih akin 's film gegen die wand -lrb- head on -rrb- was awarded with the golden bear for the best film .
-lrb- ap photo / jan bauer -rrb- the charming angelic-faced actress , who made a splash in the media during the berlinale together with film director fatih akin and co-star birol ünel -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , is being candid about her past .
" yes , i did make these -lrb- porno -rrb- films .
but that 's the past .
what counts is the golden bear , " she told bild . the budding star has also received support from her new-found contacts in the film world . akin said he had been aware of kekilli 's past right from the beginning , but it had n't bothered him in the least .
he added he had n't seen the porno films himself because " i wanted to direct head-on with an unbiased mind . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german director of turkish origin fatih akin poses with his golden bear award after the awarding ceremony at the 54nd berlinale international film festival berlin saturday , feb 14 , 2004 .
the turkish-german movie ' gegen die wand ' -lrb- head on -rrb- , won the top award " golden bear " at the berlin film festival on saturday .
-lrb- ap photo / fabrizio bensch , pool -rrb- akin -lrb- photo -rrb- slammed the tabloid reporting of the topic as " bigoted and disgusting " and said he had n't mentioned kekilli 's past earlier because he wanted to protect the actress .
" sibel and i hoped naively that it would n't come out , " he told a berlin daily . even the berlinale 's director dieter kosslick is firmly throwing his weight behind the actress .
" we 're behind her all the way , " he said .
kosslick admitted he too had known about kekilli 's past , and said " but i have nothing to say here morally . "
the berlinale director added that he had organized a lawyer for kekilli and mobilized everything within his power .
" but thanks to the media , she ca n't even go out of her home , she 's totally besieged , " he said . head on wins accolades head-on has been hailed by the german media , not just because of its hard-hitting story line , but also because it was the first german film to win the golden bear after 18 long years . akin , whose films usually deal with young turks in germany straddling two cultures , has since been praised for putting german film back on the map . the film tells the story of a young turkish-german woman played by kekilli who enters a marriage of convenience with a beer-drinking , middle-aged turkish-german punk -lrb- played by birol ünel -rrb- to escape her conservative muslim family .
the film moves between hamburg and istanbul . as the two live it up with their own wild lifestyles and separate sexual affairs , the couple eventually falls in love - a situation that ends when the husband kills one of the lovers in a jealous rage . kekilli , a virtual unknown until head-on grabbed attention at the berlinale -lrb- she was allegedly spotted by akin on the street and cast right away -rrb- told dw-world last week that she was familiar with the situation in the film .
" i also grew up in such a conservative family , where there are such girls , " she said .
" my parents are modern , but there were always conflicts when i did n't get my freedom to an extent , but i always fought for it . " most agree that the present scandal wo n't damage kekilli 's budding acting career , but rather have the opposite effect .
as german actor mathieu carriere pointed out , " the fact that sibel kekilli had starred in pornos is unimportant .
better to go from pornos to the " oscar " than the other way round .

today 's police send out an sms .
after more than a year of testing , germany 's interior ministry has announced police will start using sms text messages to track down criminals .
critics say the plan encourages spying and is not effective . a bank has just been robbed . a prisoner has escaped .
a bus has been hijacked .
and now the police are conducting a mass manhunt to find the culprit .
calling all public-minded citizens !
in 10 german cities regional police start their search for escaped criminals and missing persons by reaching for their mobile phones and sending out a short text message .
the people on the ground ready to help are the hundreds of voluntarily registered " spotters " - like taxi and bus drivers or city workers - who have agreed to cooperate with the police to track down suspected criminals by sending in their tips .
organized by the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- , the sms crime tracking method has been functioning as a test project in regional police departments since september 2002 . but now german interior minister otto schily has announced that it will become a regular feature in police work throughout the country .
" it 's another precise way to have the public help search for criminals or missing people , " schily said at a press conference earlier in the week .
spy on your neighbor not everyone is pleased with the method .
critics have been quick to pounce on the concept of asking the public to join the police in fighting crime .
jörg tauss , media spokesman for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary faction - schily 's own party - fears that the new method will encourage citizens to spy on and " denounce " their neighbors and other people .
he called on schily to stop at once this " latest nonsense from police circles . "
rainer lingenthal of the federal interior ministry rejected the criticism and urged tauss to reconsider and retract his remarks about denunciation .
the spd 's domestic policy spokesman , dieter wiefelspütz , said the sms search method was an additional possibility that should be tried out , but he conceded that miracles could not be expected from it .
however , schily said the new method could significantly improve crime fighting .
speaking at a press conference last sunday , the minister emphasized the need for the police to exhaust all possibilities in their attempts to capture a perpetrator immediately after a crime has been committed .
" the speedy and direct involvement of citizens enables new forms of cooperation between police and the population , " he said adding that using sms increased the probability of tracking down the criminal and quickly clearing up the crime .
ministry claims " considerable success " according to the interior ministry , the police achieved " considerable success " during the year-long trial period .
introduced at 11 police stations around the country , the sms search method involved the registry of between 50 and 100 volonteers in each location , many of whom were involved in public transport and worked in close proximity to the public . messages sent out by the police often included descriptions of suspects and vehicle information such as licence plate numbers .
anyone who receives the information and makes a positive identification can call a special hotline at the local police station .
for those a little hesitant , there 's a financial incentive : should the information provided by the sms receiver lead to the apprehension and conviction of a wanted person , the police will give the citizen a reward of around 50 euros .
based on the positive results of the tests in all the major german cities , the bka has decided to employ the sms function in all its police departments .
media say only " modest successes " however , media reports refer only to " modest successes " so far .
the ostthüringer zeitung newspaper reported that during a test in the eastern city of jena there had been no concrete relation between effort and use .
even police are not convinced of the method 's effectiveness .
the states of bavaria and baden-württemberg , as well as the police in cologne , have said they do not want to take part in the project .

today 's police send out an sms .
after more than a year of testing , germany 's interior ministry has announced police will start using sms text messages to track down criminals .
critics say the plan encourages spying and is not effective . a bank has just been robbed . a prisoner has escaped .
a bus has been hijacked .
and now the police are conducting a mass manhunt to find the culprit .
calling all public-minded citizens !
in 10 german cities regional police start their search for escaped criminals and missing persons by reaching for their mobile phones and sending out a short text message .
the people on the ground ready to help are the hundreds of voluntarily registered " spotters " - like taxi and bus drivers or city workers - who have agreed to cooperate with the police to track down suspected criminals by sending in their tips .
organized by the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- , the sms crime tracking method has been functioning as a test project in regional police departments since september 2002 . but now german interior minister otto schily has announced that it will become a regular feature in police work throughout the country .
" it 's another precise way to have the public help search for criminals or missing people , " schily said at a press conference earlier in the week .
spy on your neighbor not everyone is pleased with the method .
critics have been quick to pounce on the concept of asking the public to join the police in fighting crime .
jörg tauss , media spokesman for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary faction - schily 's own party - fears that the new method will encourage citizens to spy on and " denounce " their neighbors and other people .
he called on schily to stop at once this " latest nonsense from police circles . "
rainer lingenthal of the federal interior ministry rejected the criticism and urged tauss to reconsider and retract his remarks about denunciation .
the spd 's domestic policy spokesman , dieter wiefelspütz , said the sms search method was an additional possibility that should be tried out , but he conceded that miracles could not be expected from it .
however , schily said the new method could significantly improve crime fighting .
speaking at a press conference last sunday , the minister emphasized the need for the police to exhaust all possibilities in their attempts to capture a perpetrator immediately after a crime has been committed .
" the speedy and direct involvement of citizens enables new forms of cooperation between police and the population , " he said adding that using sms increased the probability of tracking down the criminal and quickly clearing up the crime .
ministry claims " considerable success " according to the interior ministry , the police achieved " considerable success " during the year-long trial period .
introduced at 11 police stations around the country , the sms search method involved the registry of between 50 and 100 volonteers in each location , many of whom were involved in public transport and worked in close proximity to the public . messages sent out by the police often included descriptions of suspects and vehicle information such as licence plate numbers .
anyone who receives the information and makes a positive identification can call a special hotline at the local police station .
for those a little hesitant , there 's a financial incentive : should the information provided by the sms receiver lead to the apprehension and conviction of a wanted person , the police will give the citizen a reward of around 50 euros .
based on the positive results of the tests in all the major german cities , the bka has decided to employ the sms function in all its police departments .

"
days after being celebrated at the berlinale for her role in the award-winning film " head-on " , 23-year-old sibel kekilli is at the center of a sex scandal after a tabloid published sleazy details of a pornographic past . the curtain may have dropped on the star-studded berlinale film festival in the capital last week , but a scandal engulfing one of its most promising german stars has now exploded in the country . germany 's mass-selling bild announced this week that 23-year-old sibel kekilli - who received rave reviews for her role as a hamburg nurse in the film head-on that won the coveted golden bear in an unexpected triumph for germany - had starred in a string of porno films before her illustrious berlinale debut . the gritty lowdown in a no-holds-barred report , a headline in the tabloid screamed on tuesday , " why did the petite diva star in such hard-core pornos ? " an assortment of pictures showed the young actress involved in a porn scene on a location in ibiza as well as images from her latest award-winning film . the paper reported that kekilli , who is of turkish origin , had starred in " nine hardcore pornographic movies " until autumn 2002 .
the tabloid , notorious for its dirt-digging tactics reported that kekilli 's father , who has been living in germany since 1977 was in shock . " the disgrace is too great for the family , " kekilli 's father said .
" sibel moved to hamburg two years ago .
apparently she worked in the city hall and now this news .
i can never forgive her for it .
i do n't want to ever see her again , " he said . " what counts is the golden bear " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish-born actors sibel kekilli , left , and birol uenel pose during a photo call before the awarding ceremony at the berlin international filmfestival berlinale in berlin saturday , feb .
14 , 2004 .
fatih akin 's film gegen die wand -lrb- head on -rrb- was awarded with the golden bear for the best film .
-lrb- ap photo / jan bauer -rrb- the charming angelic-faced actress , who made a splash in the media during the berlinale together with film director fatih akin and co-star birol ünel -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , is being candid about her past .
" yes , i did make these -lrb- porno -rrb- films .
but that 's the past .
what counts is the golden bear , " she told bild . the budding star has also received support from her new-found contacts in the film world . akin said he had been aware of kekilli 's past right from the beginning , but it had n't bothered him in the least .
he added he had n't seen the porno films himself because " i wanted to direct head-on with an unbiased mind . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german director of turkish origin fatih akin poses with his golden bear award after the awarding ceremony at the 54nd berlinale international film festival berlin saturday , feb 14 , 2004 .
the turkish-german movie ' gegen die wand ' -lrb- head on -rrb- , won the top award " golden bear " at the berlin film festival on saturday .
-lrb- ap photo / fabrizio bensch , pool -rrb- akin -lrb- photo -rrb- slammed the tabloid reporting of the topic as " bigoted and disgusting " and said he had n't mentioned kekilli 's past earlier because he wanted to protect the actress .
" sibel and i hoped naively that it would n't come out , " he told a berlin daily . even the berlinale 's director dieter kosslick is firmly throwing his weight behind the actress .
" we 're behind her all the way , " he said .
kosslick admitted he too had known about kekilli 's past , and said " but i have nothing to say here morally . "
the berlinale director added that he had organized a lawyer for kekilli and mobilized everything within his power .
" but thanks to the media , she ca n't even go out of her home , she 's totally besieged , " he said . head on wins accolades head-on has been hailed by the german media , not just because of its hard-hitting story line , but also because it was the first german film to win the golden bear after 18 long years . akin , whose films usually deal with young turks in germany straddling two cultures , has since been praised for putting german film back on the map . the film tells the story of a young turkish-german woman played by kekilli who enters a marriage of convenience with a beer-drinking , middle-aged turkish-german punk -lrb- played by birol ünel -rrb- to escape her conservative muslim family .
the film moves between hamburg and istanbul . as the two live it up with their own wild lifestyles and separate sexual affairs , the couple eventually falls in love - a situation that ends when the husband kills one of the lovers in a jealous rage . kekilli , a virtual unknown until head-on grabbed attention at the berlinale -lrb- she was allegedly spotted by akin on the street and cast right away -rrb- told dw-world last week that she was familiar with the situation in the film .
" i also grew up in such a conservative family , where there are such girls , " she said .
" my parents are modern , but there were always conflicts when i did n't get my freedom to an extent , but i always fought for it . " most agree that the present scandal wo n't damage kekilli 's budding acting career , but rather have the opposite effect .
as german actor mathieu carriere pointed out , " the fact that sibel kekilli had starred in pornos is unimportant .

today 's police send out an sms .
after more than a year of testing , germany 's interior ministry has announced police will start using sms text messages to track down criminals .
critics say the plan encourages spying and is not effective . a bank has just been robbed . a prisoner has escaped .
a bus has been hijacked .
and now the police are conducting a mass manhunt to find the culprit .
calling all public-minded citizens !
in 10 german cities regional police start their search for escaped criminals and missing persons by reaching for their mobile phones and sending out a short text message .
the people on the ground ready to help are the hundreds of voluntarily registered " spotters " - like taxi and bus drivers or city workers - who have agreed to cooperate with the police to track down suspected criminals by sending in their tips .
organized by the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- , the sms crime tracking method has been functioning as a test project in regional police departments since september 2002 . but now german interior minister otto schily has announced that it will become a regular feature in police work throughout the country .
" it 's another precise way to have the public help search for criminals or missing people , " schily said at a press conference earlier in the week .
spy on your neighbor not everyone is pleased with the method .
critics have been quick to pounce on the concept of asking the public to join the police in fighting crime .
jörg tauss , media spokesman for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary faction - schily 's own party - fears that the new method will encourage citizens to spy on and " denounce " their neighbors and other people .
he called on schily to stop at once this " latest nonsense from police circles . "

a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .
the accident has triggered a debate on uncontrolled speeding on the autobahns . rolf fischer 's passion for high speeds proved to be his undoing on tuesday when a german court found the 34-year-old mercedes test driver guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while travelling at 250km / h on a german motorway . nicknamed " turbo-rolf " among his colleagues for his preference for fast cars , the daimlerchrysler engineer now faces 18 months in prison . fischer has also been fired by daimlerchrysler following the court sentencing . a case of reckless speeding the state prosecution in karlsruhe , who had called for a prison sentence of one year and nine months , said that on the day of the accident in summer last year , fischer was tailgaiting a car driven by a woman named only as jasmin a. on the a5 autobahn . the engineer was on his way to a car test-track in the northern city of papenburg in a company-owned , dark mercedes slk .
fischer forced the 21-year-old woman , driving in a much smaller kia , to shift into one of the slow lanes . startled by his agressiveness and speed , the woman lost control of her car while swerving to change lanes .
the car spun across two lanes and smashed into some trees .
she and her daughter , rebecca , died instantly .
fischer sped off from the scene . police said they had finally found fischer on the basis of petrol station receipts , mobile phone records and the testimony of a witness .
witnesses during the trial also identified fischer 's mercedes as having caused the accident . however fischer himself had pleaded not guilty to manslaughter , fleeing from the scene of the accident and serious traffic violations during the trial .
despite his colorful nickname , which has been splashed in the tabloid press , fischer had denied his love for fast driving .
" it 's a complete mystery to me why people say that i have an aggressive driving style , " he said during the trial .
" i never forced anybody off the road nor did i notice anything about an accident , " he said . speed limits anyone ? the case has prompted new questions about the lack of speed limits on germany 's 11,393-kilometer-long autobahn network designed in the 1920s .
germany remains the only country in the world that allows drivers to stretch their cars to the limit , a feature that also lures speed-happy tourists unable to convert their motorways into racing tracks in their own countries . but experts are now repeating calls for a review of the country 's fast-lane culture . " we think it is a big problem because germany is the only country world-wide where no limits of speed on the motorway exists .
that means there are a lot of parts on the motorway where people can drive as fast as they want to , " daniel kluge of the german ministry of transport and environment told deutsche welle .
" so we have big problems where there are cars with less speed - then you have a big speed difference . " the losers usually are slower drivers caught in the fast lane , who are subject to an irritable flash of headlights or impatient drivers demanding clear passage . the german automobile association , adac , has repeatedly pointed out that there is a recommended top speed of 130km / h on all german motorways . but kluge pointed out there are no incentives to stick to the limit .
" if you go faster that that there is no possibility to be stopped by the police so … you in fact drive as fast as you want to . " speeding : personal freedom ? though the " turbo-rolf " case has stirred national debate in the country about speeding , tailgaiting or flashing headlights on motorways , kluge said it 's unlikely to radically alter the apparent german fascination with speed . he said there were several reasons for it .
" one part is the advertising of the automobile industry ; in germany it is nearly a tradition to advertise cars which drive safe with high speed , " kluge said .
" another thing is that many people in germany still think it is a kind of freedom and that it 's their right to have this personal feeling of speed . " but many believe that a prison sentence will now send a clear signal that there is indeed a limit to personal freedom on german motorways . kerstin steinbrecher -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese tourists in germany : castles and the autobahn since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .

"
days after being celebrated at the berlinale for her role in the award-winning film " head-on " , 23-year-old sibel kekilli is at the center of a sex scandal after a tabloid published sleazy details of a pornographic past . the curtain may have dropped on the star-studded berlinale film festival in the capital last week , but a scandal engulfing one of its most promising german stars has now exploded in the country . germany 's mass-selling bild announced this week that 23-year-old sibel kekilli - who received rave reviews for her role as a hamburg nurse in the film head-on that won the coveted golden bear in an unexpected triumph for germany - had starred in a string of porno films before her illustrious berlinale debut . the gritty lowdown in a no-holds-barred report , a headline in the tabloid screamed on tuesday , " why did the petite diva star in such hard-core pornos ? " an assortment of pictures showed the young actress involved in a porn scene on a location in ibiza as well as images from her latest award-winning film . the paper reported that kekilli , who is of turkish origin , had starred in " nine hardcore pornographic movies " until autumn 2002 .
the tabloid , notorious for its dirt-digging tactics reported that kekilli 's father , who has been living in germany since 1977 was in shock . " the disgrace is too great for the family , " kekilli 's father said .
" sibel moved to hamburg two years ago .
apparently she worked in the city hall and now this news .
i can never forgive her for it .
i do n't want to ever see her again , " he said . " what counts is the golden bear " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish-born actors sibel kekilli , left , and birol uenel pose during a photo call before the awarding ceremony at the berlin international filmfestival berlinale in berlin saturday , feb .
14 , 2004 .
fatih akin 's film gegen die wand -lrb- head on -rrb- was awarded with the golden bear for the best film .
-lrb- ap photo / jan bauer -rrb- the charming angelic-faced actress , who made a splash in the media during the berlinale together with film director fatih akin and co-star birol ünel -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , is being candid about her past .
" yes , i did make these -lrb- porno -rrb- films .
but that 's the past .
what counts is the golden bear , " she told bild . the budding star has also received support from her new-found contacts in the film world . akin said he had been aware of kekilli 's past right from the beginning , but it had n't bothered him in the least .
he added he had n't seen the porno films himself because " i wanted to direct head-on with an unbiased mind . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german director of turkish origin fatih akin poses with his golden bear award after the awarding ceremony at the 54nd berlinale international film festival berlin saturday , feb 14 , 2004 .
the turkish-german movie ' gegen die wand ' -lrb- head on -rrb- , won the top award " golden bear " at the berlin film festival on saturday .
-lrb- ap photo / fabrizio bensch , pool -rrb- akin -lrb- photo -rrb- slammed the tabloid reporting of the topic as " bigoted and disgusting " and said he had n't mentioned kekilli 's past earlier because he wanted to protect the actress .
" sibel and i hoped naively that it would n't come out , " he told a berlin daily . even the berlinale 's director dieter kosslick is firmly throwing his weight behind the actress .
" we 're behind her all the way , " he said .
kosslick admitted he too had known about kekilli 's past , and said " but i have nothing to say here morally . "
the berlinale director added that he had organized a lawyer for kekilli and mobilized everything within his power .
" but thanks to the media , she ca n't even go out of her home , she 's totally besieged , " he said . head on wins accolades head-on has been hailed by the german media , not just because of its hard-hitting story line , but also because it was the first german film to win the golden bear after 18 long years . akin , whose films usually deal with young turks in germany straddling two cultures , has since been praised for putting german film back on the map . the film tells the story of a young turkish-german woman played by kekilli who enters a marriage of convenience with a beer-drinking , middle-aged turkish-german punk -lrb- played by birol ünel -rrb- to escape her conservative muslim family .
the film moves between hamburg and istanbul . as the two live it up with their own wild lifestyles and separate sexual affairs , the couple eventually falls in love - a situation that ends when the husband kills one of the lovers in a jealous rage . kekilli , a virtual unknown until head-on grabbed attention at the berlinale -lrb- she was allegedly spotted by akin on the street and cast right away -rrb- told dw-world last week that she was familiar with the situation in the film .
" i also grew up in such a conservative family , where there are such girls , " she said .
" my parents are modern , but there were always conflicts when i did n't get my freedom to an extent , but i always fought for it . " most agree that the present scandal wo n't damage kekilli 's budding acting career , but rather have the opposite effect .
as german actor mathieu carriere pointed out , " the fact that sibel kekilli had starred in pornos is unimportant .
better to go from pornos to the " oscar " than the other way round .

a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .
the accident has triggered a debate on uncontrolled speeding on the autobahns . rolf fischer 's passion for high speeds proved to be his undoing on tuesday when a german court found the 34-year-old mercedes test driver guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while travelling at 250km / h on a german motorway . nicknamed " turbo-rolf " among his colleagues for his preference for fast cars , the daimlerchrysler engineer now faces 18 months in prison . fischer has also been fired by daimlerchrysler following the court sentencing . a case of reckless speeding the state prosecution in karlsruhe , who had called for a prison sentence of one year and nine months , said that on the day of the accident in summer last year , fischer was tailgaiting a car driven by a woman named only as jasmin a. on the a5 autobahn . the engineer was on his way to a car test-track in the northern city of papenburg in a company-owned , dark mercedes slk .
fischer forced the 21-year-old woman , driving in a much smaller kia , to shift into one of the slow lanes . startled by his agressiveness and speed , the woman lost control of her car while swerving to change lanes .
the car spun across two lanes and smashed into some trees .
she and her daughter , rebecca , died instantly .
fischer sped off from the scene . police said they had finally found fischer on the basis of petrol station receipts , mobile phone records and the testimony of a witness .
witnesses during the trial also identified fischer 's mercedes as having caused the accident . however fischer himself had pleaded not guilty to manslaughter , fleeing from the scene of the accident and serious traffic violations during the trial .
despite his colorful nickname , which has been splashed in the tabloid press , fischer had denied his love for fast driving .
" it 's a complete mystery to me why people say that i have an aggressive driving style , " he said during the trial .
" i never forced anybody off the road nor did i notice anything about an accident , " he said . speed limits anyone ? the case has prompted new questions about the lack of speed limits on germany 's 11,393-kilometer-long autobahn network designed in the 1920s .
germany remains the only country in the world that allows drivers to stretch their cars to the limit , a feature that also lures speed-happy tourists unable to convert their motorways into racing tracks in their own countries . but experts are now repeating calls for a review of the country 's fast-lane culture . " we think it is a big problem because germany is the only country world-wide where no limits of speed on the motorway exists .
that means there are a lot of parts on the motorway where people can drive as fast as they want to , " daniel kluge of the german ministry of transport and environment told deutsche welle .
" so we have big problems where there are cars with less speed - then you have a big speed difference . " the losers usually are slower drivers caught in the fast lane , who are subject to an irritable flash of headlights or impatient drivers demanding clear passage . the german automobile association , adac , has repeatedly pointed out that there is a recommended top speed of 130km / h on all german motorways . but kluge pointed out there are no incentives to stick to the limit .
" if you go faster that that there is no possibility to be stopped by the police so … you in fact drive as fast as you want to . " speeding : personal freedom ? though the " turbo-rolf " case has stirred national debate in the country about speeding , tailgaiting or flashing headlights on motorways , kluge said it 's unlikely to radically alter the apparent german fascination with speed . he said there were several reasons for it .
" one part is the advertising of the automobile industry ; in germany it is nearly a tradition to advertise cars which drive safe with high speed , " kluge said .
" another thing is that many people in germany still think it is a kind of freedom and that it 's their right to have this personal feeling of speed . " but many believe that a prison sentence will now send a clear signal that there is indeed a limit to personal freedom on german motorways . kerstin steinbrecher -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese tourists in germany : castles and the autobahn since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .

fischer forced the 21-year-old woman , driving in a much smaller kia , to shift into one of the slow lanes . startled by his agressiveness and speed , the woman lost control of her car while swerving to change lanes .
the car spun across two lanes and smashed into some trees .
she and her daughter , rebecca , died instantly .
fischer sped off from the scene . police said they had finally found fischer on the basis of petrol station receipts , mobile phone records and the testimony of a witness .
witnesses during the trial also identified fischer 's mercedes as having caused the accident . however fischer himself had pleaded not guilty to manslaughter , fleeing from the scene of the accident and serious traffic violations during the trial .
despite his colorful nickname , which has been splashed in the tabloid press , fischer had denied his love for fast driving .
" it 's a complete mystery to me why people say that i have an aggressive driving style , " he said during the trial .
" i never forced anybody off the road nor did i notice anything about an accident , " he said . speed limits anyone ? the case has prompted new questions about the lack of speed limits on germany 's 11,393-kilometer-long autobahn network designed in the 1920s .
germany remains the only country in the world that allows drivers to stretch their cars to the limit , a feature that also lures speed-happy tourists unable to convert their motorways into racing tracks in their own countries . but experts are now repeating calls for a review of the country 's fast-lane culture . " we think it is a big problem because germany is the only country world-wide where no limits of speed on the motorway exists .
that means there are a lot of parts on the motorway where people can drive as fast as they want to , " daniel kluge of the german ministry of transport and environment told deutsche welle .
" so we have big problems where there are cars with less speed - then you have a big speed difference . " the losers usually are slower drivers caught in the fast lane , who are subject to an irritable flash of headlights or impatient drivers demanding clear passage . the german automobile association , adac , has repeatedly pointed out that there is a recommended top speed of 130km / h on all german motorways . but kluge pointed out there are no incentives to stick to the limit .
" if you go faster that that there is no possibility to be stopped by the police so … you in fact drive as fast as you want to . " speeding : personal freedom ? though the " turbo-rolf " case has stirred national debate in the country about speeding , tailgaiting or flashing headlights on motorways , kluge said it 's unlikely to radically alter the apparent german fascination with speed . he said there were several reasons for it .
" one part is the advertising of the automobile industry ; in germany it is nearly a tradition to advertise cars which drive safe with high speed , " kluge said .
" another thing is that many people in germany still think it is a kind of freedom and that it 's their right to have this personal feeling of speed . " but many believe that a prison sentence will now send a clear signal that there is indeed a limit to personal freedom on german motorways . kerstin steinbrecher -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese tourists in germany : castles and the autobahn since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .

today 's police send out an sms .
after more than a year of testing , germany 's interior ministry has announced police will start using sms text messages to track down criminals .
critics say the plan encourages spying and is not effective . a bank has just been robbed . a prisoner has escaped .
a bus has been hijacked .
and now the police are conducting a mass manhunt to find the culprit .
calling all public-minded citizens !
in 10 german cities regional police start their search for escaped criminals and missing persons by reaching for their mobile phones and sending out a short text message .
the people on the ground ready to help are the hundreds of voluntarily registered " spotters " - like taxi and bus drivers or city workers - who have agreed to cooperate with the police to track down suspected criminals by sending in their tips .
organized by the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- , the sms crime tracking method has been functioning as a test project in regional police departments since september 2002 . but now german interior minister otto schily has announced that it will become a regular feature in police work throughout the country .
" it 's another precise way to have the public help search for criminals or missing people , " schily said at a press conference earlier in the week .
spy on your neighbor not everyone is pleased with the method .
critics have been quick to pounce on the concept of asking the public to join the police in fighting crime .
jörg tauss , media spokesman for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary faction - schily 's own party - fears that the new method will encourage citizens to spy on and " denounce " their neighbors and other people .
he called on schily to stop at once this " latest nonsense from police circles . "
rainer lingenthal of the federal interior ministry rejected the criticism and urged tauss to reconsider and retract his remarks about denunciation .
the spd 's domestic policy spokesman , dieter wiefelspütz , said the sms search method was an additional possibility that should be tried out , but he conceded that miracles could not be expected from it .
however , schily said the new method could significantly improve crime fighting .
speaking at a press conference last sunday , the minister emphasized the need for the police to exhaust all possibilities in their attempts to capture a perpetrator immediately after a crime has been committed .
" the speedy and direct involvement of citizens enables new forms of cooperation between police and the population , " he said adding that using sms increased the probability of tracking down the criminal and quickly clearing up the crime .
ministry claims " considerable success " according to the interior ministry , the police achieved " considerable success " during the year-long trial period .
introduced at 11 police stations around the country , the sms search method involved the registry of between 50 and 100 volonteers in each location , many of whom were involved in public transport and worked in close proximity to the public . messages sent out by the police often included descriptions of suspects and vehicle information such as licence plate numbers .
anyone who receives the information and makes a positive identification can call a special hotline at the local police station .
for those a little hesitant , there 's a financial incentive : should the information provided by the sms receiver lead to the apprehension and conviction of a wanted person , the police will give the citizen a reward of around 50 euros .
based on the positive results of the tests in all the major german cities , the bka has decided to employ the sms function in all its police departments .
media say only " modest successes " however , media reports refer only to " modest successes " so far .
the ostthüringer zeitung newspaper reported that during a test in the eastern city of jena there had been no concrete relation between effort and use .
even police are not convinced of the method 's effectiveness .
the states of bavaria and baden-württemberg , as well as the police in cologne , have said they do not want to take part in the project .
other federal states have not yet decided . dw staff -lrb- bp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cops test sms project to catch crooks a pilot project enlisting the help of the public to catch criminals using information transmitted by sms text messages to mobile phones has started this week in the german cities of wiesbaden and bochum .

"
days after being celebrated at the berlinale for her role in the award-winning film " head-on " , 23-year-old sibel kekilli is at the center of a sex scandal after a tabloid published sleazy details of a pornographic past . the curtain may have dropped on the star-studded berlinale film festival in the capital last week , but a scandal engulfing one of its most promising german stars has now exploded in the country . germany 's mass-selling bild announced this week that 23-year-old sibel kekilli - who received rave reviews for her role as a hamburg nurse in the film head-on that won the coveted golden bear in an unexpected triumph for germany - had starred in a string of porno films before her illustrious berlinale debut . the gritty lowdown in a no-holds-barred report , a headline in the tabloid screamed on tuesday , " why did the petite diva star in such hard-core pornos ? " an assortment of pictures showed the young actress involved in a porn scene on a location in ibiza as well as images from her latest award-winning film . the paper reported that kekilli , who is of turkish origin , had starred in " nine hardcore pornographic movies " until autumn 2002 .
the tabloid , notorious for its dirt-digging tactics reported that kekilli 's father , who has been living in germany since 1977 was in shock . " the disgrace is too great for the family , " kekilli 's father said .
" sibel moved to hamburg two years ago .
apparently she worked in the city hall and now this news .
i can never forgive her for it .
i do n't want to ever see her again , " he said . " what counts is the golden bear " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish-born actors sibel kekilli , left , and birol uenel pose during a photo call before the awarding ceremony at the berlin international filmfestival berlinale in berlin saturday , feb .
14 , 2004 .
fatih akin 's film gegen die wand -lrb- head on -rrb- was awarded with the golden bear for the best film .
-lrb- ap photo / jan bauer -rrb- the charming angelic-faced actress , who made a splash in the media during the berlinale together with film director fatih akin and co-star birol ünel -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , is being candid about her past .
" yes , i did make these -lrb- porno -rrb- films .
but that 's the past .
what counts is the golden bear , " she told bild . the budding star has also received support from her new-found contacts in the film world . akin said he had been aware of kekilli 's past right from the beginning , but it had n't bothered him in the least .
he added he had n't seen the porno films himself because " i wanted to direct head-on with an unbiased mind . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german director of turkish origin fatih akin poses with his golden bear award after the awarding ceremony at the 54nd berlinale international film festival berlin saturday , feb 14 , 2004 .
the turkish-german movie ' gegen die wand ' -lrb- head on -rrb- , won the top award " golden bear " at the berlin film festival on saturday .
-lrb- ap photo / fabrizio bensch , pool -rrb- akin -lrb- photo -rrb- slammed the tabloid reporting of the topic as " bigoted and disgusting " and said he had n't mentioned kekilli 's past earlier because he wanted to protect the actress .
" sibel and i hoped naively that it would n't come out , " he told a berlin daily . even the berlinale 's director dieter kosslick is firmly throwing his weight behind the actress .
" we 're behind her all the way , " he said .
kosslick admitted he too had known about kekilli 's past , and said " but i have nothing to say here morally . "
the berlinale director added that he had organized a lawyer for kekilli and mobilized everything within his power .
" but thanks to the media , she ca n't even go out of her home , she 's totally besieged , " he said . head on wins accolades head-on has been hailed by the german media , not just because of its hard-hitting story line , but also because it was the first german film to win the golden bear after 18 long years . akin , whose films usually deal with young turks in germany straddling two cultures , has since been praised for putting german film back on the map . the film tells the story of a young turkish-german woman played by kekilli who enters a marriage of convenience with a beer-drinking , middle-aged turkish-german punk -lrb- played by birol ünel -rrb- to escape her conservative muslim family .
the film moves between hamburg and istanbul . as the two live it up with their own wild lifestyles and separate sexual affairs , the couple eventually falls in love - a situation that ends when the husband kills one of the lovers in a jealous rage . kekilli , a virtual unknown until head-on grabbed attention at the berlinale -lrb- she was allegedly spotted by akin on the street and cast right away -rrb- told dw-world last week that she was familiar with the situation in the film .
" i also grew up in such a conservative family , where there are such girls , " she said .
" my parents are modern , but there were always conflicts when i did n't get my freedom to an extent , but i always fought for it . " most agree that the present scandal wo n't damage kekilli 's budding acting career , but rather have the opposite effect .
as german actor mathieu carriere pointed out , " the fact that sibel kekilli had starred in pornos is unimportant .
better to go from pornos to the " oscar " than the other way round .

a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .
the accident has triggered a debate on uncontrolled speeding on the autobahns . rolf fischer 's passion for high speeds proved to be his undoing on tuesday when a german court found the 34-year-old mercedes test driver guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while travelling at 250km / h on a german motorway . nicknamed " turbo-rolf " among his colleagues for his preference for fast cars , the daimlerchrysler engineer now faces 18 months in prison . fischer has also been fired by daimlerchrysler following the court sentencing . a case of reckless speeding the state prosecution in karlsruhe , who had called for a prison sentence of one year and nine months , said that on the day of the accident in summer last year , fischer was tailgaiting a car driven by a woman named only as jasmin a. on the a5 autobahn . the engineer was on his way to a car test-track in the northern city of papenburg in a company-owned , dark mercedes slk .
fischer forced the 21-year-old woman , driving in a much smaller kia , to shift into one of the slow lanes . startled by his agressiveness and speed , the woman lost control of her car while swerving to change lanes .
the car spun across two lanes and smashed into some trees .
she and her daughter , rebecca , died instantly .
fischer sped off from the scene . police said they had finally found fischer on the basis of petrol station receipts , mobile phone records and the testimony of a witness .
witnesses during the trial also identified fischer 's mercedes as having caused the accident . however fischer himself had pleaded not guilty to manslaughter , fleeing from the scene of the accident and serious traffic violations during the trial .
despite his colorful nickname , which has been splashed in the tabloid press , fischer had denied his love for fast driving .
" it 's a complete mystery to me why people say that i have an aggressive driving style , " he said during the trial .
" i never forced anybody off the road nor did i notice anything about an accident , " he said . speed limits anyone ? the case has prompted new questions about the lack of speed limits on germany 's 11,393-kilometer-long autobahn network designed in the 1920s .
germany remains the only country in the world that allows drivers to stretch their cars to the limit , a feature that also lures speed-happy tourists unable to convert their motorways into racing tracks in their own countries . but experts are now repeating calls for a review of the country 's fast-lane culture . " we think it is a big problem because germany is the only country world-wide where no limits of speed on the motorway exists .
that means there are a lot of parts on the motorway where people can drive as fast as they want to , " daniel kluge of the german ministry of transport and environment told deutsche welle .
" so we have big problems where there are cars with less speed - then you have a big speed difference . " the losers usually are slower drivers caught in the fast lane , who are subject to an irritable flash of headlights or impatient drivers demanding clear passage . the german automobile association , adac , has repeatedly pointed out that there is a recommended top speed of 130km / h on all german motorways . but kluge pointed out there are no incentives to stick to the limit .
" if you go faster that that there is no possibility to be stopped by the police so … you in fact drive as fast as you want to . " speeding : personal freedom ? though the " turbo-rolf " case has stirred national debate in the country about speeding , tailgaiting or flashing headlights on motorways , kluge said it 's unlikely to radically alter the apparent german fascination with speed . he said there were several reasons for it .
" one part is the advertising of the automobile industry ; in germany it is nearly a tradition to advertise cars which drive safe with high speed , " kluge said .
" another thing is that many people in germany still think it is a kind of freedom and that it 's their right to have this personal feeling of speed .

"
days after being celebrated at the berlinale for her role in the award-winning film " head-on " , 23-year-old sibel kekilli is at the center of a sex scandal after a tabloid published sleazy details of a pornographic past . the curtain may have dropped on the star-studded berlinale film festival in the capital last week , but a scandal engulfing one of its most promising german stars has now exploded in the country . germany 's mass-selling bild announced this week that 23-year-old sibel kekilli - who received rave reviews for her role as a hamburg nurse in the film head-on that won the coveted golden bear in an unexpected triumph for germany - had starred in a string of porno films before her illustrious berlinale debut . the gritty lowdown in a no-holds-barred report , a headline in the tabloid screamed on tuesday , " why did the petite diva star in such hard-core pornos ? " an assortment of pictures showed the young actress involved in a porn scene on a location in ibiza as well as images from her latest award-winning film . the paper reported that kekilli , who is of turkish origin , had starred in " nine hardcore pornographic movies " until autumn 2002 .
the tabloid , notorious for its dirt-digging tactics reported that kekilli 's father , who has been living in germany since 1977 was in shock . " the disgrace is too great for the family , " kekilli 's father said .
" sibel moved to hamburg two years ago .
apparently she worked in the city hall and now this news .
i can never forgive her for it .
i do n't want to ever see her again , " he said . " what counts is the golden bear " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish-born actors sibel kekilli , left , and birol uenel pose during a photo call before the awarding ceremony at the berlin international filmfestival berlinale in berlin saturday , feb .
14 , 2004 .
fatih akin 's film gegen die wand -lrb- head on -rrb- was awarded with the golden bear for the best film .
-lrb- ap photo / jan bauer -rrb- the charming angelic-faced actress , who made a splash in the media during the berlinale together with film director fatih akin and co-star birol ünel -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , is being candid about her past .
" yes , i did make these -lrb- porno -rrb- films .
but that 's the past .
what counts is the golden bear , " she told bild . the budding star has also received support from her new-found contacts in the film world . akin said he had been aware of kekilli 's past right from the beginning , but it had n't bothered him in the least .
he added he had n't seen the porno films himself because " i wanted to direct head-on with an unbiased mind . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german director of turkish origin fatih akin poses with his golden bear award after the awarding ceremony at the 54nd berlinale international film festival berlin saturday , feb 14 , 2004 .
the turkish-german movie ' gegen die wand ' -lrb- head on -rrb- , won the top award " golden bear " at the berlin film festival on saturday .
-lrb- ap photo / fabrizio bensch , pool -rrb- akin -lrb- photo -rrb- slammed the tabloid reporting of the topic as " bigoted and disgusting " and said he had n't mentioned kekilli 's past earlier because he wanted to protect the actress .
" sibel and i hoped naively that it would n't come out , " he told a berlin daily . even the berlinale 's director dieter kosslick is firmly throwing his weight behind the actress .
" we 're behind her all the way , " he said .
kosslick admitted he too had known about kekilli 's past , and said " but i have nothing to say here morally . "
the berlinale director added that he had organized a lawyer for kekilli and mobilized everything within his power .
" but thanks to the media , she ca n't even go out of her home , she 's totally besieged , " he said . head on wins accolades head-on has been hailed by the german media , not just because of its hard-hitting story line , but also because it was the first german film to win the golden bear after 18 long years . akin , whose films usually deal with young turks in germany straddling two cultures , has since been praised for putting german film back on the map . the film tells the story of a young turkish-german woman played by kekilli who enters a marriage of convenience with a beer-drinking , middle-aged turkish-german punk -lrb- played by birol ünel -rrb- to escape her conservative muslim family .
the film moves between hamburg and istanbul . as the two live it up with their own wild lifestyles and separate sexual affairs , the couple eventually falls in love - a situation that ends when the husband kills one of the lovers in a jealous rage . kekilli , a virtual unknown until head-on grabbed attention at the berlinale -lrb- she was allegedly spotted by akin on the street and cast right away -rrb- told dw-world last week that she was familiar with the situation in the film .
" i also grew up in such a conservative family , where there are such girls , " she said .
" my parents are modern , but there were always conflicts when i did n't get my freedom to an extent , but i always fought for it . " most agree that the present scandal wo n't damage kekilli 's budding acting career , but rather have the opposite effect .
as german actor mathieu carriere pointed out , " the fact that sibel kekilli had starred in pornos is unimportant .

a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .
the accident has triggered a debate on uncontrolled speeding on the autobahns . rolf fischer 's passion for high speeds proved to be his undoing on tuesday when a german court found the 34-year-old mercedes test driver guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while travelling at 250km / h on a german motorway . nicknamed " turbo-rolf " among his colleagues for his preference for fast cars , the daimlerchrysler engineer now faces 18 months in prison . fischer has also been fired by daimlerchrysler following the court sentencing . a case of reckless speeding the state prosecution in karlsruhe , who had called for a prison sentence of one year and nine months , said that on the day of the accident in summer last year , fischer was tailgaiting a car driven by a woman named only as jasmin a. on the a5 autobahn . the engineer was on his way to a car test-track in the northern city of papenburg in a company-owned , dark mercedes slk .
fischer forced the 21-year-old woman , driving in a much smaller kia , to shift into one of the slow lanes . startled by his agressiveness and speed , the woman lost control of her car while swerving to change lanes .
the car spun across two lanes and smashed into some trees .
she and her daughter , rebecca , died instantly .
fischer sped off from the scene . police said they had finally found fischer on the basis of petrol station receipts , mobile phone records and the testimony of a witness .
witnesses during the trial also identified fischer 's mercedes as having caused the accident . however fischer himself had pleaded not guilty to manslaughter , fleeing from the scene of the accident and serious traffic violations during the trial .
despite his colorful nickname , which has been splashed in the tabloid press , fischer had denied his love for fast driving .
" it 's a complete mystery to me why people say that i have an aggressive driving style , " he said during the trial .
" i never forced anybody off the road nor did i notice anything about an accident , " he said . speed limits anyone ? the case has prompted new questions about the lack of speed limits on germany 's 11,393-kilometer-long autobahn network designed in the 1920s .
germany remains the only country in the world that allows drivers to stretch their cars to the limit , a feature that also lures speed-happy tourists unable to convert their motorways into racing tracks in their own countries . but experts are now repeating calls for a review of the country 's fast-lane culture . " we think it is a big problem because germany is the only country world-wide where no limits of speed on the motorway exists .
that means there are a lot of parts on the motorway where people can drive as fast as they want to , " daniel kluge of the german ministry of transport and environment told deutsche welle .
" so we have big problems where there are cars with less speed - then you have a big speed difference . " the losers usually are slower drivers caught in the fast lane , who are subject to an irritable flash of headlights or impatient drivers demanding clear passage . the german automobile association , adac , has repeatedly pointed out that there is a recommended top speed of 130km / h on all german motorways . but kluge pointed out there are no incentives to stick to the limit .
" if you go faster that that there is no possibility to be stopped by the police so … you in fact drive as fast as you want to . " speeding : personal freedom ? though the " turbo-rolf " case has stirred national debate in the country about speeding , tailgaiting or flashing headlights on motorways , kluge said it 's unlikely to radically alter the apparent german fascination with speed . he said there were several reasons for it .
" one part is the advertising of the automobile industry ; in germany it is nearly a tradition to advertise cars which drive safe with high speed , " kluge said .
" another thing is that many people in germany still think it is a kind of freedom and that it 's their right to have this personal feeling of speed . " but many believe that a prison sentence will now send a clear signal that there is indeed a limit to personal freedom on german motorways . kerstin steinbrecher -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese tourists in germany : castles and the autobahn since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .

today 's police send out an sms .
after more than a year of testing , germany 's interior ministry has announced police will start using sms text messages to track down criminals .
critics say the plan encourages spying and is not effective . a bank has just been robbed . a prisoner has escaped .
a bus has been hijacked .
and now the police are conducting a mass manhunt to find the culprit .
calling all public-minded citizens !
in 10 german cities regional police start their search for escaped criminals and missing persons by reaching for their mobile phones and sending out a short text message .
the people on the ground ready to help are the hundreds of voluntarily registered " spotters " - like taxi and bus drivers or city workers - who have agreed to cooperate with the police to track down suspected criminals by sending in their tips .
organized by the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- , the sms crime tracking method has been functioning as a test project in regional police departments since september 2002 . but now german interior minister otto schily has announced that it will become a regular feature in police work throughout the country .
" it 's another precise way to have the public help search for criminals or missing people , " schily said at a press conference earlier in the week .
spy on your neighbor not everyone is pleased with the method .
critics have been quick to pounce on the concept of asking the public to join the police in fighting crime .
jörg tauss , media spokesman for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary faction - schily 's own party - fears that the new method will encourage citizens to spy on and " denounce " their neighbors and other people .
he called on schily to stop at once this " latest nonsense from police circles . "
rainer lingenthal of the federal interior ministry rejected the criticism and urged tauss to reconsider and retract his remarks about denunciation .
the spd 's domestic policy spokesman , dieter wiefelspütz , said the sms search method was an additional possibility that should be tried out , but he conceded that miracles could not be expected from it .
however , schily said the new method could significantly improve crime fighting .
speaking at a press conference last sunday , the minister emphasized the need for the police to exhaust all possibilities in their attempts to capture a perpetrator immediately after a crime has been committed .
" the speedy and direct involvement of citizens enables new forms of cooperation between police and the population , " he said adding that using sms increased the probability of tracking down the criminal and quickly clearing up the crime .
ministry claims " considerable success " according to the interior ministry , the police achieved " considerable success " during the year-long trial period .
introduced at 11 police stations around the country , the sms search method involved the registry of between 50 and 100 volonteers in each location , many of whom were involved in public transport and worked in close proximity to the public . messages sent out by the police often included descriptions of suspects and vehicle information such as licence plate numbers .
anyone who receives the information and makes a positive identification can call a special hotline at the local police station .
for those a little hesitant , there 's a financial incentive : should the information provided by the sms receiver lead to the apprehension and conviction of a wanted person , the police will give the citizen a reward of around 50 euros .
based on the positive results of the tests in all the major german cities , the bka has decided to employ the sms function in all its police departments .
media say only " modest successes " however , media reports refer only to " modest successes " so far .
the ostthüringer zeitung newspaper reported that during a test in the eastern city of jena there had been no concrete relation between effort and use .
even police are not convinced of the method 's effectiveness .
the states of bavaria and baden-württemberg , as well as the police in cologne , have said they do not want to take part in the project .

today 's police send out an sms .
after more than a year of testing , germany 's interior ministry has announced police will start using sms text messages to track down criminals .
critics say the plan encourages spying and is not effective . a bank has just been robbed . a prisoner has escaped .
a bus has been hijacked .
and now the police are conducting a mass manhunt to find the culprit .
calling all public-minded citizens !
in 10 german cities regional police start their search for escaped criminals and missing persons by reaching for their mobile phones and sending out a short text message .
the people on the ground ready to help are the hundreds of voluntarily registered " spotters " - like taxi and bus drivers or city workers - who have agreed to cooperate with the police to track down suspected criminals by sending in their tips .
organized by the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- , the sms crime tracking method has been functioning as a test project in regional police departments since september 2002 . but now german interior minister otto schily has announced that it will become a regular feature in police work throughout the country .
" it 's another precise way to have the public help search for criminals or missing people , " schily said at a press conference earlier in the week .
spy on your neighbor not everyone is pleased with the method .
critics have been quick to pounce on the concept of asking the public to join the police in fighting crime .
jörg tauss , media spokesman for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary faction - schily 's own party - fears that the new method will encourage citizens to spy on and " denounce " their neighbors and other people .
he called on schily to stop at once this " latest nonsense from police circles . "
rainer lingenthal of the federal interior ministry rejected the criticism and urged tauss to reconsider and retract his remarks about denunciation .
the spd 's domestic policy spokesman , dieter wiefelspütz , said the sms search method was an additional possibility that should be tried out , but he conceded that miracles could not be expected from it .
however , schily said the new method could significantly improve crime fighting .
speaking at a press conference last sunday , the minister emphasized the need for the police to exhaust all possibilities in their attempts to capture a perpetrator immediately after a crime has been committed .
" the speedy and direct involvement of citizens enables new forms of cooperation between police and the population , " he said adding that using sms increased the probability of tracking down the criminal and quickly clearing up the crime .
ministry claims " considerable success " according to the interior ministry , the police achieved " considerable success " during the year-long trial period .
introduced at 11 police stations around the country , the sms search method involved the registry of between 50 and 100 volonteers in each location , many of whom were involved in public transport and worked in close proximity to the public . messages sent out by the police often included descriptions of suspects and vehicle information such as licence plate numbers .
anyone who receives the information and makes a positive identification can call a special hotline at the local police station .
for those a little hesitant , there 's a financial incentive : should the information provided by the sms receiver lead to the apprehension and conviction of a wanted person , the police will give the citizen a reward of around 50 euros .
based on the positive results of the tests in all the major german cities , the bka has decided to employ the sms function in all its police departments .
media say only " modest successes " however , media reports refer only to " modest successes " so far .
the ostthüringer zeitung newspaper reported that during a test in the eastern city of jena there had been no concrete relation between effort and use .
even police are not convinced of the method 's effectiveness .
the states of bavaria and baden-württemberg , as well as the police in cologne , have said they do not want to take part in the project .

"
days after being celebrated at the berlinale for her role in the award-winning film " head-on " , 23-year-old sibel kekilli is at the center of a sex scandal after a tabloid published sleazy details of a pornographic past . the curtain may have dropped on the star-studded berlinale film festival in the capital last week , but a scandal engulfing one of its most promising german stars has now exploded in the country . germany 's mass-selling bild announced this week that 23-year-old sibel kekilli - who received rave reviews for her role as a hamburg nurse in the film head-on that won the coveted golden bear in an unexpected triumph for germany - had starred in a string of porno films before her illustrious berlinale debut . the gritty lowdown in a no-holds-barred report , a headline in the tabloid screamed on tuesday , " why did the petite diva star in such hard-core pornos ? " an assortment of pictures showed the young actress involved in a porn scene on a location in ibiza as well as images from her latest award-winning film . the paper reported that kekilli , who is of turkish origin , had starred in " nine hardcore pornographic movies " until autumn 2002 .
the tabloid , notorious for its dirt-digging tactics reported that kekilli 's father , who has been living in germany since 1977 was in shock . " the disgrace is too great for the family , " kekilli 's father said .
" sibel moved to hamburg two years ago .
apparently she worked in the city hall and now this news .

-lrb- ap photo / fabrizio bensch , pool -rrb- akin -lrb- photo -rrb- slammed the tabloid reporting of the topic as " bigoted and disgusting " and said he had n't mentioned kekilli 's past earlier because he wanted to protect the actress .
" sibel and i hoped naively that it would n't come out , " he told a berlin daily . even the berlinale 's director dieter kosslick is firmly throwing his weight behind the actress .
" we 're behind her all the way , " he said .
kosslick admitted he too had known about kekilli 's past , and said " but i have nothing to say here morally . "
the berlinale director added that he had organized a lawyer for kekilli and mobilized everything within his power .
" but thanks to the media , she ca n't even go out of her home , she 's totally besieged , " he said . head on wins accolades head-on has been hailed by the german media , not just because of its hard-hitting story line , but also because it was the first german film to win the golden bear after 18 long years . akin , whose films usually deal with young turks in germany straddling two cultures , has since been praised for putting german film back on the map . the film tells the story of a young turkish-german woman played by kekilli who enters a marriage of convenience with a beer-drinking , middle-aged turkish-german punk -lrb- played by birol ünel -rrb- to escape her conservative muslim family .
the film moves between hamburg and istanbul . as the two live it up with their own wild lifestyles and separate sexual affairs , the couple eventually falls in love - a situation that ends when the husband kills one of the lovers in a jealous rage . kekilli , a virtual unknown until head-on grabbed attention at the berlinale -lrb- she was allegedly spotted by akin on the street and cast right away -rrb- told dw-world last week that she was familiar with the situation in the film .
" i also grew up in such a conservative family , where there are such girls , " she said .
" my parents are modern , but there were always conflicts when i did n't get my freedom to an extent , but i always fought for it . " most agree that the present scandal wo n't damage kekilli 's budding acting career , but rather have the opposite effect .

a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .
the accident has triggered a debate on uncontrolled speeding on the autobahns . rolf fischer 's passion for high speeds proved to be his undoing on tuesday when a german court found the 34-year-old mercedes test driver guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while travelling at 250km / h on a german motorway . nicknamed " turbo-rolf " among his colleagues for his preference for fast cars , the daimlerchrysler engineer now faces 18 months in prison . fischer has also been fired by daimlerchrysler following the court sentencing . a case of reckless speeding the state prosecution in karlsruhe , who had called for a prison sentence of one year and nine months , said that on the day of the accident in summer last year , fischer was tailgaiting a car driven by a woman named only as jasmin a. on the a5 autobahn . the engineer was on his way to a car test-track in the northern city of papenburg in a company-owned , dark mercedes slk .
fischer forced the 21-year-old woman , driving in a much smaller kia , to shift into one of the slow lanes . startled by his agressiveness and speed , the woman lost control of her car while swerving to change lanes .
the car spun across two lanes and smashed into some trees .
she and her daughter , rebecca , died instantly .
fischer sped off from the scene . police said they had finally found fischer on the basis of petrol station receipts , mobile phone records and the testimony of a witness .
witnesses during the trial also identified fischer 's mercedes as having caused the accident . however fischer himself had pleaded not guilty to manslaughter , fleeing from the scene of the accident and serious traffic violations during the trial .
despite his colorful nickname , which has been splashed in the tabloid press , fischer had denied his love for fast driving .
" it 's a complete mystery to me why people say that i have an aggressive driving style , " he said during the trial .
" i never forced anybody off the road nor did i notice anything about an accident , " he said . speed limits anyone ? the case has prompted new questions about the lack of speed limits on germany 's 11,393-kilometer-long autobahn network designed in the 1920s .
germany remains the only country in the world that allows drivers to stretch their cars to the limit , a feature that also lures speed-happy tourists unable to convert their motorways into racing tracks in their own countries . but experts are now repeating calls for a review of the country 's fast-lane culture . " we think it is a big problem because germany is the only country world-wide where no limits of speed on the motorway exists .
that means there are a lot of parts on the motorway where people can drive as fast as they want to , " daniel kluge of the german ministry of transport and environment told deutsche welle .
" so we have big problems where there are cars with less speed - then you have a big speed difference . " the losers usually are slower drivers caught in the fast lane , who are subject to an irritable flash of headlights or impatient drivers demanding clear passage . the german automobile association , adac , has repeatedly pointed out that there is a recommended top speed of 130km / h on all german motorways . but kluge pointed out there are no incentives to stick to the limit .
" if you go faster that that there is no possibility to be stopped by the police so … you in fact drive as fast as you want to . " speeding : personal freedom ? though the " turbo-rolf " case has stirred national debate in the country about speeding , tailgaiting or flashing headlights on motorways , kluge said it 's unlikely to radically alter the apparent german fascination with speed . he said there were several reasons for it .
" one part is the advertising of the automobile industry ; in germany it is nearly a tradition to advertise cars which drive safe with high speed , " kluge said .
" another thing is that many people in germany still think it is a kind of freedom and that it 's their right to have this personal feeling of speed . " but many believe that a prison sentence will now send a clear signal that there is indeed a limit to personal freedom on german motorways . kerstin steinbrecher -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese tourists in germany : castles and the autobahn since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .

" the losers usually are slower drivers caught in the fast lane , who are subject to an irritable flash of headlights or impatient drivers demanding clear passage . the german automobile association , adac , has repeatedly pointed out that there is a recommended top speed of 130km / h on all german motorways . but kluge pointed out there are no incentives to stick to the limit .
" if you go faster that that there is no possibility to be stopped by the police so … you in fact drive as fast as you want to . " speeding : personal freedom ? though the " turbo-rolf " case has stirred national debate in the country about speeding , tailgaiting or flashing headlights on motorways , kluge said it 's unlikely to radically alter the apparent german fascination with speed . he said there were several reasons for it .
" one part is the advertising of the automobile industry ; in germany it is nearly a tradition to advertise cars which drive safe with high speed , " kluge said .
" another thing is that many people in germany still think it is a kind of freedom and that it 's their right to have this personal feeling of speed . " but many believe that a prison sentence will now send a clear signal that there is indeed a limit to personal freedom on german motorways . kerstin steinbrecher -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese tourists in germany : castles and the autobahn since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .

today 's police send out an sms .
after more than a year of testing , germany 's interior ministry has announced police will start using sms text messages to track down criminals .
critics say the plan encourages spying and is not effective . a bank has just been robbed . a prisoner has escaped .
a bus has been hijacked .
and now the police are conducting a mass manhunt to find the culprit .
calling all public-minded citizens !
in 10 german cities regional police start their search for escaped criminals and missing persons by reaching for their mobile phones and sending out a short text message .
the people on the ground ready to help are the hundreds of voluntarily registered " spotters " - like taxi and bus drivers or city workers - who have agreed to cooperate with the police to track down suspected criminals by sending in their tips .
organized by the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- , the sms crime tracking method has been functioning as a test project in regional police departments since september 2002 . but now german interior minister otto schily has announced that it will become a regular feature in police work throughout the country .
" it 's another precise way to have the public help search for criminals or missing people , " schily said at a press conference earlier in the week .
spy on your neighbor not everyone is pleased with the method .
critics have been quick to pounce on the concept of asking the public to join the police in fighting crime .
jörg tauss , media spokesman for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary faction - schily 's own party - fears that the new method will encourage citizens to spy on and " denounce " their neighbors and other people .
he called on schily to stop at once this " latest nonsense from police circles . "
rainer lingenthal of the federal interior ministry rejected the criticism and urged tauss to reconsider and retract his remarks about denunciation .
the spd 's domestic policy spokesman , dieter wiefelspütz , said the sms search method was an additional possibility that should be tried out , but he conceded that miracles could not be expected from it .
however , schily said the new method could significantly improve crime fighting .
speaking at a press conference last sunday , the minister emphasized the need for the police to exhaust all possibilities in their attempts to capture a perpetrator immediately after a crime has been committed .
" the speedy and direct involvement of citizens enables new forms of cooperation between police and the population , " he said adding that using sms increased the probability of tracking down the criminal and quickly clearing up the crime .
ministry claims " considerable success " according to the interior ministry , the police achieved " considerable success " during the year-long trial period .
introduced at 11 police stations around the country , the sms search method involved the registry of between 50 and 100 volonteers in each location , many of whom were involved in public transport and worked in close proximity to the public . messages sent out by the police often included descriptions of suspects and vehicle information such as licence plate numbers .
anyone who receives the information and makes a positive identification can call a special hotline at the local police station .
for those a little hesitant , there 's a financial incentive : should the information provided by the sms receiver lead to the apprehension and conviction of a wanted person , the police will give the citizen a reward of around 50 euros .
based on the positive results of the tests in all the major german cities , the bka has decided to employ the sms function in all its police departments .
media say only " modest successes " however , media reports refer only to " modest successes " so far .
the ostthüringer zeitung newspaper reported that during a test in the eastern city of jena there had been no concrete relation between effort and use .
even police are not convinced of the method 's effectiveness .
the states of bavaria and baden-württemberg , as well as the police in cologne , have said they do not want to take part in the project .

today 's police send out an sms .
after more than a year of testing , germany 's interior ministry has announced police will start using sms text messages to track down criminals .
critics say the plan encourages spying and is not effective . a bank has just been robbed . a prisoner has escaped .
a bus has been hijacked .
and now the police are conducting a mass manhunt to find the culprit .
calling all public-minded citizens !
in 10 german cities regional police start their search for escaped criminals and missing persons by reaching for their mobile phones and sending out a short text message .
the people on the ground ready to help are the hundreds of voluntarily registered " spotters " - like taxi and bus drivers or city workers - who have agreed to cooperate with the police to track down suspected criminals by sending in their tips .
organized by the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- , the sms crime tracking method has been functioning as a test project in regional police departments since september 2002 . but now german interior minister otto schily has announced that it will become a regular feature in police work throughout the country .
" it 's another precise way to have the public help search for criminals or missing people , " schily said at a press conference earlier in the week .
spy on your neighbor not everyone is pleased with the method .
critics have been quick to pounce on the concept of asking the public to join the police in fighting crime .
jörg tauss , media spokesman for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary faction - schily 's own party - fears that the new method will encourage citizens to spy on and " denounce " their neighbors and other people .
he called on schily to stop at once this " latest nonsense from police circles . "
rainer lingenthal of the federal interior ministry rejected the criticism and urged tauss to reconsider and retract his remarks about denunciation .
the spd 's domestic policy spokesman , dieter wiefelspütz , said the sms search method was an additional possibility that should be tried out , but he conceded that miracles could not be expected from it .
however , schily said the new method could significantly improve crime fighting .
speaking at a press conference last sunday , the minister emphasized the need for the police to exhaust all possibilities in their attempts to capture a perpetrator immediately after a crime has been committed .
" the speedy and direct involvement of citizens enables new forms of cooperation between police and the population , " he said adding that using sms increased the probability of tracking down the criminal and quickly clearing up the crime .
ministry claims " considerable success " according to the interior ministry , the police achieved " considerable success " during the year-long trial period .
introduced at 11 police stations around the country , the sms search method involved the registry of between 50 and 100 volonteers in each location , many of whom were involved in public transport and worked in close proximity to the public . messages sent out by the police often included descriptions of suspects and vehicle information such as licence plate numbers .
anyone who receives the information and makes a positive identification can call a special hotline at the local police station .
for those a little hesitant , there 's a financial incentive : should the information provided by the sms receiver lead to the apprehension and conviction of a wanted person , the police will give the citizen a reward of around 50 euros .
based on the positive results of the tests in all the major german cities , the bka has decided to employ the sms function in all its police departments .
media say only " modest successes " however , media reports refer only to " modest successes " so far .
the ostthüringer zeitung newspaper reported that during a test in the eastern city of jena there had been no concrete relation between effort and use .
even police are not convinced of the method 's effectiveness .
the states of bavaria and baden-württemberg , as well as the police in cologne , have said they do not want to take part in the project .
other federal states have not yet decided . dw staff -lrb- bp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cops test sms project to catch crooks a pilot project enlisting the help of the public to catch criminals using information transmitted by sms text messages to mobile phones has started this week in the german cities of wiesbaden and bochum .

a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .
the accident has triggered a debate on uncontrolled speeding on the autobahns . rolf fischer 's passion for high speeds proved to be his undoing on tuesday when a german court found the 34-year-old mercedes test driver guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while travelling at 250km / h on a german motorway . nicknamed " turbo-rolf " among his colleagues for his preference for fast cars , the daimlerchrysler engineer now faces 18 months in prison . fischer has also been fired by daimlerchrysler following the court sentencing . a case of reckless speeding the state prosecution in karlsruhe , who had called for a prison sentence of one year and nine months , said that on the day of the accident in summer last year , fischer was tailgaiting a car driven by a woman named only as jasmin a. on the a5 autobahn . the engineer was on his way to a car test-track in the northern city of papenburg in a company-owned , dark mercedes slk .
fischer forced the 21-year-old woman , driving in a much smaller kia , to shift into one of the slow lanes . startled by his agressiveness and speed , the woman lost control of her car while swerving to change lanes .
the car spun across two lanes and smashed into some trees .
she and her daughter , rebecca , died instantly .
fischer sped off from the scene . police said they had finally found fischer on the basis of petrol station receipts , mobile phone records and the testimony of a witness .
witnesses during the trial also identified fischer 's mercedes as having caused the accident . however fischer himself had pleaded not guilty to manslaughter , fleeing from the scene of the accident and serious traffic violations during the trial .
despite his colorful nickname , which has been splashed in the tabloid press , fischer had denied his love for fast driving .
" it 's a complete mystery to me why people say that i have an aggressive driving style , " he said during the trial .
" i never forced anybody off the road nor did i notice anything about an accident , " he said . speed limits anyone ? the case has prompted new questions about the lack of speed limits on germany 's 11,393-kilometer-long autobahn network designed in the 1920s .
germany remains the only country in the world that allows drivers to stretch their cars to the limit , a feature that also lures speed-happy tourists unable to convert their motorways into racing tracks in their own countries . but experts are now repeating calls for a review of the country 's fast-lane culture . " we think it is a big problem because germany is the only country world-wide where no limits of speed on the motorway exists .
that means there are a lot of parts on the motorway where people can drive as fast as they want to , " daniel kluge of the german ministry of transport and environment told deutsche welle .
" so we have big problems where there are cars with less speed - then you have a big speed difference . " the losers usually are slower drivers caught in the fast lane , who are subject to an irritable flash of headlights or impatient drivers demanding clear passage . the german automobile association , adac , has repeatedly pointed out that there is a recommended top speed of 130km / h on all german motorways . but kluge pointed out there are no incentives to stick to the limit .
" if you go faster that that there is no possibility to be stopped by the police so … you in fact drive as fast as you want to . " speeding : personal freedom ? though the " turbo-rolf " case has stirred national debate in the country about speeding , tailgaiting or flashing headlights on motorways , kluge said it 's unlikely to radically alter the apparent german fascination with speed . he said there were several reasons for it .
" one part is the advertising of the automobile industry ; in germany it is nearly a tradition to advertise cars which drive safe with high speed , " kluge said .
" another thing is that many people in germany still think it is a kind of freedom and that it 's their right to have this personal feeling of speed . " but many believe that a prison sentence will now send a clear signal that there is indeed a limit to personal freedom on german motorways . kerstin steinbrecher -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese tourists in germany : castles and the autobahn since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .

the accident has triggered a debate on uncontrolled speeding on the autobahns . rolf fischer 's passion for high speeds proved to be his undoing on tuesday when a german court found the 34-year-old mercedes test driver guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while travelling at 250km / h on a german motorway . nicknamed " turbo-rolf " among his colleagues for his preference for fast cars , the daimlerchrysler engineer now faces 18 months in prison . fischer has also been fired by daimlerchrysler following the court sentencing . a case of reckless speeding the state prosecution in karlsruhe , who had called for a prison sentence of one year and nine months , said that on the day of the accident in summer last year , fischer was tailgaiting a car driven by a woman named only as jasmin a. on the a5 autobahn . the engineer was on his way to a car test-track in the northern city of papenburg in a company-owned , dark mercedes slk .
fischer forced the 21-year-old woman , driving in a much smaller kia , to shift into one of the slow lanes . startled by his agressiveness and speed , the woman lost control of her car while swerving to change lanes .
the car spun across two lanes and smashed into some trees .
she and her daughter , rebecca , died instantly .
fischer sped off from the scene . police said they had finally found fischer on the basis of petrol station receipts , mobile phone records and the testimony of a witness .
witnesses during the trial also identified fischer 's mercedes as having caused the accident . however fischer himself had pleaded not guilty to manslaughter , fleeing from the scene of the accident and serious traffic violations during the trial .
despite his colorful nickname , which has been splashed in the tabloid press , fischer had denied his love for fast driving .
" it 's a complete mystery to me why people say that i have an aggressive driving style , " he said during the trial .
" i never forced anybody off the road nor did i notice anything about an accident , " he said . speed limits anyone ? the case has prompted new questions about the lack of speed limits on germany 's 11,393-kilometer-long autobahn network designed in the 1920s .
germany remains the only country in the world that allows drivers to stretch their cars to the limit , a feature that also lures speed-happy tourists unable to convert their motorways into racing tracks in their own countries . but experts are now repeating calls for a review of the country 's fast-lane culture . " we think it is a big problem because germany is the only country world-wide where no limits of speed on the motorway exists .
that means there are a lot of parts on the motorway where people can drive as fast as they want to , " daniel kluge of the german ministry of transport and environment told deutsche welle .
" so we have big problems where there are cars with less speed - then you have a big speed difference . " the losers usually are slower drivers caught in the fast lane , who are subject to an irritable flash of headlights or impatient drivers demanding clear passage . the german automobile association , adac , has repeatedly pointed out that there is a recommended top speed of 130km / h on all german motorways . but kluge pointed out there are no incentives to stick to the limit .
" if you go faster that that there is no possibility to be stopped by the police so … you in fact drive as fast as you want to . " speeding : personal freedom ? though the " turbo-rolf " case has stirred national debate in the country about speeding , tailgaiting or flashing headlights on motorways , kluge said it 's unlikely to radically alter the apparent german fascination with speed . he said there were several reasons for it .
" one part is the advertising of the automobile industry ; in germany it is nearly a tradition to advertise cars which drive safe with high speed , " kluge said .
" another thing is that many people in germany still think it is a kind of freedom and that it 's their right to have this personal feeling of speed . " but many believe that a prison sentence will now send a clear signal that there is indeed a limit to personal freedom on german motorways . kerstin steinbrecher -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese tourists in germany : castles and the autobahn since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .

a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .
the accident has triggered a debate on uncontrolled speeding on the autobahns . rolf fischer 's passion for high speeds proved to be his undoing on tuesday when a german court found the 34-year-old mercedes test driver guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while travelling at 250km / h on a german motorway . nicknamed " turbo-rolf " among his colleagues for his preference for fast cars , the daimlerchrysler engineer now faces 18 months in prison . fischer has also been fired by daimlerchrysler following the court sentencing . a case of reckless speeding the state prosecution in karlsruhe , who had called for a prison sentence of one year and nine months , said that on the day of the accident in summer last year , fischer was tailgaiting a car driven by a woman named only as jasmin a. on the a5 autobahn . the engineer was on his way to a car test-track in the northern city of papenburg in a company-owned , dark mercedes slk .
fischer forced the 21-year-old woman , driving in a much smaller kia , to shift into one of the slow lanes . startled by his agressiveness and speed , the woman lost control of her car while swerving to change lanes .
the car spun across two lanes and smashed into some trees .
she and her daughter , rebecca , died instantly .
fischer sped off from the scene . police said they had finally found fischer on the basis of petrol station receipts , mobile phone records and the testimony of a witness .
witnesses during the trial also identified fischer 's mercedes as having caused the accident . however fischer himself had pleaded not guilty to manslaughter , fleeing from the scene of the accident and serious traffic violations during the trial .
despite his colorful nickname , which has been splashed in the tabloid press , fischer had denied his love for fast driving .
" it 's a complete mystery to me why people say that i have an aggressive driving style , " he said during the trial .
" i never forced anybody off the road nor did i notice anything about an accident , " he said . speed limits anyone ? the case has prompted new questions about the lack of speed limits on germany 's 11,393-kilometer-long autobahn network designed in the 1920s .
germany remains the only country in the world that allows drivers to stretch their cars to the limit , a feature that also lures speed-happy tourists unable to convert their motorways into racing tracks in their own countries . but experts are now repeating calls for a review of the country 's fast-lane culture . " we think it is a big problem because germany is the only country world-wide where no limits of speed on the motorway exists .
that means there are a lot of parts on the motorway where people can drive as fast as they want to , " daniel kluge of the german ministry of transport and environment told deutsche welle .
" so we have big problems where there are cars with less speed - then you have a big speed difference . " the losers usually are slower drivers caught in the fast lane , who are subject to an irritable flash of headlights or impatient drivers demanding clear passage . the german automobile association , adac , has repeatedly pointed out that there is a recommended top speed of 130km / h on all german motorways . but kluge pointed out there are no incentives to stick to the limit .
" if you go faster that that there is no possibility to be stopped by the police so … you in fact drive as fast as you want to . " speeding : personal freedom ? though the " turbo-rolf " case has stirred national debate in the country about speeding , tailgaiting or flashing headlights on motorways , kluge said it 's unlikely to radically alter the apparent german fascination with speed . he said there were several reasons for it .
" one part is the advertising of the automobile industry ; in germany it is nearly a tradition to advertise cars which drive safe with high speed , " kluge said .
" another thing is that many people in germany still think it is a kind of freedom and that it 's their right to have this personal feeling of speed . " but many believe that a prison sentence will now send a clear signal that there is indeed a limit to personal freedom on german motorways . kerstin steinbrecher -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese tourists in germany : castles and the autobahn since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .

today 's police send out an sms .
after more than a year of testing , germany 's interior ministry has announced police will start using sms text messages to track down criminals .
critics say the plan encourages spying and is not effective . a bank has just been robbed . a prisoner has escaped .
a bus has been hijacked .
and now the police are conducting a mass manhunt to find the culprit .
calling all public-minded citizens !
in 10 german cities regional police start their search for escaped criminals and missing persons by reaching for their mobile phones and sending out a short text message .
the people on the ground ready to help are the hundreds of voluntarily registered " spotters " - like taxi and bus drivers or city workers - who have agreed to cooperate with the police to track down suspected criminals by sending in their tips .
organized by the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- , the sms crime tracking method has been functioning as a test project in regional police departments since september 2002 . but now german interior minister otto schily has announced that it will become a regular feature in police work throughout the country .
" it 's another precise way to have the public help search for criminals or missing people , " schily said at a press conference earlier in the week .
spy on your neighbor not everyone is pleased with the method .
critics have been quick to pounce on the concept of asking the public to join the police in fighting crime .
jörg tauss , media spokesman for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary faction - schily 's own party - fears that the new method will encourage citizens to spy on and " denounce " their neighbors and other people .
he called on schily to stop at once this " latest nonsense from police circles . "
rainer lingenthal of the federal interior ministry rejected the criticism and urged tauss to reconsider and retract his remarks about denunciation .
the spd 's domestic policy spokesman , dieter wiefelspütz , said the sms search method was an additional possibility that should be tried out , but he conceded that miracles could not be expected from it .
however , schily said the new method could significantly improve crime fighting .
speaking at a press conference last sunday , the minister emphasized the need for the police to exhaust all possibilities in their attempts to capture a perpetrator immediately after a crime has been committed .
" the speedy and direct involvement of citizens enables new forms of cooperation between police and the population , " he said adding that using sms increased the probability of tracking down the criminal and quickly clearing up the crime .
ministry claims " considerable success " according to the interior ministry , the police achieved " considerable success " during the year-long trial period .
introduced at 11 police stations around the country , the sms search method involved the registry of between 50 and 100 volonteers in each location , many of whom were involved in public transport and worked in close proximity to the public . messages sent out by the police often included descriptions of suspects and vehicle information such as licence plate numbers .
anyone who receives the information and makes a positive identification can call a special hotline at the local police station .
for those a little hesitant , there 's a financial incentive : should the information provided by the sms receiver lead to the apprehension and conviction of a wanted person , the police will give the citizen a reward of around 50 euros .
based on the positive results of the tests in all the major german cities , the bka has decided to employ the sms function in all its police departments .
media say only " modest successes " however , media reports refer only to " modest successes " so far .
the ostthüringer zeitung newspaper reported that during a test in the eastern city of jena there had been no concrete relation between effort and use .
even police are not convinced of the method 's effectiveness .
the states of bavaria and baden-württemberg , as well as the police in cologne , have said they do not want to take part in the project .
other federal states have not yet decided . dw staff -lrb- bp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cops test sms project to catch crooks a pilot project enlisting the help of the public to catch criminals using information transmitted by sms text messages to mobile phones has started this week in the german cities of wiesbaden and bochum .

today 's police send out an sms .
after more than a year of testing , germany 's interior ministry has announced police will start using sms text messages to track down criminals .
critics say the plan encourages spying and is not effective . a bank has just been robbed . a prisoner has escaped .
a bus has been hijacked .
and now the police are conducting a mass manhunt to find the culprit .
calling all public-minded citizens !
in 10 german cities regional police start their search for escaped criminals and missing persons by reaching for their mobile phones and sending out a short text message .
the people on the ground ready to help are the hundreds of voluntarily registered " spotters " - like taxi and bus drivers or city workers - who have agreed to cooperate with the police to track down suspected criminals by sending in their tips .
organized by the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- , the sms crime tracking method has been functioning as a test project in regional police departments since september 2002 . but now german interior minister otto schily has announced that it will become a regular feature in police work throughout the country .
" it 's another precise way to have the public help search for criminals or missing people , " schily said at a press conference earlier in the week .
spy on your neighbor not everyone is pleased with the method .
critics have been quick to pounce on the concept of asking the public to join the police in fighting crime .
jörg tauss , media spokesman for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary faction - schily 's own party - fears that the new method will encourage citizens to spy on and " denounce " their neighbors and other people .
he called on schily to stop at once this " latest nonsense from police circles . "
rainer lingenthal of the federal interior ministry rejected the criticism and urged tauss to reconsider and retract his remarks about denunciation .
the spd 's domestic policy spokesman , dieter wiefelspütz , said the sms search method was an additional possibility that should be tried out , but he conceded that miracles could not be expected from it .
however , schily said the new method could significantly improve crime fighting .
speaking at a press conference last sunday , the minister emphasized the need for the police to exhaust all possibilities in their attempts to capture a perpetrator immediately after a crime has been committed .
" the speedy and direct involvement of citizens enables new forms of cooperation between police and the population , " he said adding that using sms increased the probability of tracking down the criminal and quickly clearing up the crime .
ministry claims " considerable success " according to the interior ministry , the police achieved " considerable success " during the year-long trial period .
introduced at 11 police stations around the country , the sms search method involved the registry of between 50 and 100 volonteers in each location , many of whom were involved in public transport and worked in close proximity to the public . messages sent out by the police often included descriptions of suspects and vehicle information such as licence plate numbers .
anyone who receives the information and makes a positive identification can call a special hotline at the local police station .
for those a little hesitant , there 's a financial incentive : should the information provided by the sms receiver lead to the apprehension and conviction of a wanted person , the police will give the citizen a reward of around 50 euros .
based on the positive results of the tests in all the major german cities , the bka has decided to employ the sms function in all its police departments .
media say only " modest successes " however , media reports refer only to " modest successes " so far .
the ostthüringer zeitung newspaper reported that during a test in the eastern city of jena there had been no concrete relation between effort and use .
even police are not convinced of the method 's effectiveness .
the states of bavaria and baden-württemberg , as well as the police in cologne , have said they do not want to take part in the project .
other federal states have not yet decided . dw staff -lrb- bp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cops test sms project to catch crooks a pilot project enlisting the help of the public to catch criminals using information transmitted by sms text messages to mobile phones has started this week in the german cities of wiesbaden and bochum .

today 's police send out an sms .
after more than a year of testing , germany 's interior ministry has announced police will start using sms text messages to track down criminals .
critics say the plan encourages spying and is not effective . a bank has just been robbed . a prisoner has escaped .
a bus has been hijacked .
and now the police are conducting a mass manhunt to find the culprit .
calling all public-minded citizens !
in 10 german cities regional police start their search for escaped criminals and missing persons by reaching for their mobile phones and sending out a short text message .
the people on the ground ready to help are the hundreds of voluntarily registered " spotters " - like taxi and bus drivers or city workers - who have agreed to cooperate with the police to track down suspected criminals by sending in their tips .
organized by the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- , the sms crime tracking method has been functioning as a test project in regional police departments since september 2002 . but now german interior minister otto schily has announced that it will become a regular feature in police work throughout the country .
" it 's another precise way to have the public help search for criminals or missing people , " schily said at a press conference earlier in the week .
spy on your neighbor not everyone is pleased with the method .
critics have been quick to pounce on the concept of asking the public to join the police in fighting crime .
jörg tauss , media spokesman for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary faction - schily 's own party - fears that the new method will encourage citizens to spy on and " denounce " their neighbors and other people .
he called on schily to stop at once this " latest nonsense from police circles . "
rainer lingenthal of the federal interior ministry rejected the criticism and urged tauss to reconsider and retract his remarks about denunciation .
the spd 's domestic policy spokesman , dieter wiefelspütz , said the sms search method was an additional possibility that should be tried out , but he conceded that miracles could not be expected from it .
however , schily said the new method could significantly improve crime fighting .
speaking at a press conference last sunday , the minister emphasized the need for the police to exhaust all possibilities in their attempts to capture a perpetrator immediately after a crime has been committed .
" the speedy and direct involvement of citizens enables new forms of cooperation between police and the population , " he said adding that using sms increased the probability of tracking down the criminal and quickly clearing up the crime .
ministry claims " considerable success " according to the interior ministry , the police achieved " considerable success " during the year-long trial period .
introduced at 11 police stations around the country , the sms search method involved the registry of between 50 and 100 volonteers in each location , many of whom were involved in public transport and worked in close proximity to the public . messages sent out by the police often included descriptions of suspects and vehicle information such as licence plate numbers .
anyone who receives the information and makes a positive identification can call a special hotline at the local police station .
for those a little hesitant , there 's a financial incentive : should the information provided by the sms receiver lead to the apprehension and conviction of a wanted person , the police will give the citizen a reward of around 50 euros .
based on the positive results of the tests in all the major german cities , the bka has decided to employ the sms function in all its police departments .
media say only " modest successes " however , media reports refer only to " modest successes " so far .
the ostthüringer zeitung newspaper reported that during a test in the eastern city of jena there had been no concrete relation between effort and use .
even police are not convinced of the method 's effectiveness .
the states of bavaria and baden-württemberg , as well as the police in cologne , have said they do not want to take part in the project .
other federal states have not yet decided . dw staff -lrb- bp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cops test sms project to catch crooks a pilot project enlisting the help of the public to catch criminals using information transmitted by sms text messages to mobile phones has started this week in the german cities of wiesbaden and bochum .

"
days after being celebrated at the berlinale for her role in the award-winning film " head-on " , 23-year-old sibel kekilli is at the center of a sex scandal after a tabloid published sleazy details of a pornographic past . the curtain may have dropped on the star-studded berlinale film festival in the capital last week , but a scandal engulfing one of its most promising german stars has now exploded in the country . germany 's mass-selling bild announced this week that 23-year-old sibel kekilli - who received rave reviews for her role as a hamburg nurse in the film head-on that won the coveted golden bear in an unexpected triumph for germany - had starred in a string of porno films before her illustrious berlinale debut . the gritty lowdown in a no-holds-barred report , a headline in the tabloid screamed on tuesday , " why did the petite diva star in such hard-core pornos ? " an assortment of pictures showed the young actress involved in a porn scene on a location in ibiza as well as images from her latest award-winning film . the paper reported that kekilli , who is of turkish origin , had starred in " nine hardcore pornographic movies " until autumn 2002 .
the tabloid , notorious for its dirt-digging tactics reported that kekilli 's father , who has been living in germany since 1977 was in shock . " the disgrace is too great for the family , " kekilli 's father said .
" sibel moved to hamburg two years ago .
apparently she worked in the city hall and now this news .
i can never forgive her for it .
i do n't want to ever see her again , " he said . " what counts is the golden bear " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish-born actors sibel kekilli , left , and birol uenel pose during a photo call before the awarding ceremony at the berlin international filmfestival berlinale in berlin saturday , feb .
14 , 2004 .
fatih akin 's film gegen die wand -lrb- head on -rrb- was awarded with the golden bear for the best film .
-lrb- ap photo / jan bauer -rrb- the charming angelic-faced actress , who made a splash in the media during the berlinale together with film director fatih akin and co-star birol ünel -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , is being candid about her past .
" yes , i did make these -lrb- porno -rrb- films .
but that 's the past .
what counts is the golden bear , " she told bild . the budding star has also received support from her new-found contacts in the film world . akin said he had been aware of kekilli 's past right from the beginning , but it had n't bothered him in the least .
he added he had n't seen the porno films himself because " i wanted to direct head-on with an unbiased mind . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german director of turkish origin fatih akin poses with his golden bear award after the awarding ceremony at the 54nd berlinale international film festival berlin saturday , feb 14 , 2004 .
the turkish-german movie ' gegen die wand ' -lrb- head on -rrb- , won the top award " golden bear " at the berlin film festival on saturday .
-lrb- ap photo / fabrizio bensch , pool -rrb- akin -lrb- photo -rrb- slammed the tabloid reporting of the topic as " bigoted and disgusting " and said he had n't mentioned kekilli 's past earlier because he wanted to protect the actress .
" sibel and i hoped naively that it would n't come out , " he told a berlin daily . even the berlinale 's director dieter kosslick is firmly throwing his weight behind the actress .
" we 're behind her all the way , " he said .
kosslick admitted he too had known about kekilli 's past , and said " but i have nothing to say here morally . "
the berlinale director added that he had organized a lawyer for kekilli and mobilized everything within his power .
" but thanks to the media , she ca n't even go out of her home , she 's totally besieged , " he said . head on wins accolades head-on has been hailed by the german media , not just because of its hard-hitting story line , but also because it was the first german film to win the golden bear after 18 long years . akin , whose films usually deal with young turks in germany straddling two cultures , has since been praised for putting german film back on the map . the film tells the story of a young turkish-german woman played by kekilli who enters a marriage of convenience with a beer-drinking , middle-aged turkish-german punk -lrb- played by birol ünel -rrb- to escape her conservative muslim family .
the film moves between hamburg and istanbul . as the two live it up with their own wild lifestyles and separate sexual affairs , the couple eventually falls in love - a situation that ends when the husband kills one of the lovers in a jealous rage . kekilli , a virtual unknown until head-on grabbed attention at the berlinale -lrb- she was allegedly spotted by akin on the street and cast right away -rrb- told dw-world last week that she was familiar with the situation in the film .
" i also grew up in such a conservative family , where there are such girls , " she said .
" my parents are modern , but there were always conflicts when i did n't get my freedom to an extent , but i always fought for it . " most agree that the present scandal wo n't damage kekilli 's budding acting career , but rather have the opposite effect .
as german actor mathieu carriere pointed out , " the fact that sibel kekilli had starred in pornos is unimportant .
better to go from pornos to the " oscar " than the other way round .

a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .
the accident has triggered a debate on uncontrolled speeding on the autobahns . rolf fischer 's passion for high speeds proved to be his undoing on tuesday when a german court found the 34-year-old mercedes test driver guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while travelling at 250km / h on a german motorway . nicknamed " turbo-rolf " among his colleagues for his preference for fast cars , the daimlerchrysler engineer now faces 18 months in prison . fischer has also been fired by daimlerchrysler following the court sentencing . a case of reckless speeding the state prosecution in karlsruhe , who had called for a prison sentence of one year and nine months , said that on the day of the accident in summer last year , fischer was tailgaiting a car driven by a woman named only as jasmin a. on the a5 autobahn . the engineer was on his way to a car test-track in the northern city of papenburg in a company-owned , dark mercedes slk .
fischer forced the 21-year-old woman , driving in a much smaller kia , to shift into one of the slow lanes . startled by his agressiveness and speed , the woman lost control of her car while swerving to change lanes .
the car spun across two lanes and smashed into some trees .
she and her daughter , rebecca , died instantly .
fischer sped off from the scene . police said they had finally found fischer on the basis of petrol station receipts , mobile phone records and the testimony of a witness .
witnesses during the trial also identified fischer 's mercedes as having caused the accident . however fischer himself had pleaded not guilty to manslaughter , fleeing from the scene of the accident and serious traffic violations during the trial .
despite his colorful nickname , which has been splashed in the tabloid press , fischer had denied his love for fast driving .
" it 's a complete mystery to me why people say that i have an aggressive driving style , " he said during the trial .
" i never forced anybody off the road nor did i notice anything about an accident , " he said . speed limits anyone ? the case has prompted new questions about the lack of speed limits on germany 's 11,393-kilometer-long autobahn network designed in the 1920s .
germany remains the only country in the world that allows drivers to stretch their cars to the limit , a feature that also lures speed-happy tourists unable to convert their motorways into racing tracks in their own countries . but experts are now repeating calls for a review of the country 's fast-lane culture . " we think it is a big problem because germany is the only country world-wide where no limits of speed on the motorway exists .
that means there are a lot of parts on the motorway where people can drive as fast as they want to , " daniel kluge of the german ministry of transport and environment told deutsche welle .
" so we have big problems where there are cars with less speed - then you have a big speed difference . " the losers usually are slower drivers caught in the fast lane , who are subject to an irritable flash of headlights or impatient drivers demanding clear passage . the german automobile association , adac , has repeatedly pointed out that there is a recommended top speed of 130km / h on all german motorways . but kluge pointed out there are no incentives to stick to the limit .
" if you go faster that that there is no possibility to be stopped by the police so … you in fact drive as fast as you want to . " speeding : personal freedom ? though the " turbo-rolf " case has stirred national debate in the country about speeding , tailgaiting or flashing headlights on motorways , kluge said it 's unlikely to radically alter the apparent german fascination with speed . he said there were several reasons for it .
" one part is the advertising of the automobile industry ; in germany it is nearly a tradition to advertise cars which drive safe with high speed , " kluge said .
" another thing is that many people in germany still think it is a kind of freedom and that it 's their right to have this personal feeling of speed .

" speeding : personal freedom ? though the " turbo-rolf " case has stirred national debate in the country about speeding , tailgaiting or flashing headlights on motorways , kluge said it 's unlikely to radically alter the apparent german fascination with speed . he said there were several reasons for it .

" another thing is that many people in germany still think it is a kind of freedom and that it 's their right to have this personal feeling of speed . " but many believe that a prison sentence will now send a clear signal that there is indeed a limit to personal freedom on german motorways . kerstin steinbrecher -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese tourists in germany : castles and the autobahn since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .

14 , 2004 .
fatih akin 's film gegen die wand -lrb- head on -rrb- was awarded with the golden bear for the best film .
-lrb- ap photo / jan bauer -rrb- the charming angelic-faced actress , who made a splash in the media during the berlinale together with film director fatih akin and co-star birol ünel -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , is being candid about her past .
" yes , i did make these -lrb- porno -rrb- films .
but that 's the past .
what counts is the golden bear , " she told bild . the budding star has also received support from her new-found contacts in the film world . akin said he had been aware of kekilli 's past right from the beginning , but it had n't bothered him in the least .
he added he had n't seen the porno films himself because " i wanted to direct head-on with an unbiased mind . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german director of turkish origin fatih akin poses with his golden bear award after the awarding ceremony at the 54nd berlinale international film festival berlin saturday , feb 14 , 2004 .
the turkish-german movie ' gegen die wand ' -lrb- head on -rrb- , won the top award " golden bear " at the berlin film festival on saturday .
-lrb- ap photo / fabrizio bensch , pool -rrb- akin -lrb- photo -rrb- slammed the tabloid reporting of the topic as " bigoted and disgusting " and said he had n't mentioned kekilli 's past earlier because he wanted to protect the actress .
" sibel and i hoped naively that it would n't come out , " he told a berlin daily . even the berlinale 's director dieter kosslick is firmly throwing his weight behind the actress .
" we 're behind her all the way , " he said .
kosslick admitted he too had known about kekilli 's past , and said " but i have nothing to say here morally . "
the berlinale director added that he had organized a lawyer for kekilli and mobilized everything within his power .
" but thanks to the media , she ca n't even go out of her home , she 's totally besieged , " he said . head on wins accolades head-on has been hailed by the german media , not just because of its hard-hitting story line , but also because it was the first german film to win the golden bear after 18 long years . akin , whose films usually deal with young turks in germany straddling two cultures , has since been praised for putting german film back on the map . the film tells the story of a young turkish-german woman played by kekilli who enters a marriage of convenience with a beer-drinking , middle-aged turkish-german punk -lrb- played by birol ünel -rrb- to escape her conservative muslim family .
the film moves between hamburg and istanbul . as the two live it up with their own wild lifestyles and separate sexual affairs , the couple eventually falls in love - a situation that ends when the husband kills one of the lovers in a jealous rage . kekilli , a virtual unknown until head-on grabbed attention at the berlinale -lrb- she was allegedly spotted by akin on the street and cast right away -rrb- told dw-world last week that she was familiar with the situation in the film .
" i also grew up in such a conservative family , where there are such girls , " she said .
" my parents are modern , but there were always conflicts when i did n't get my freedom to an extent , but i always fought for it . " most agree that the present scandal wo n't damage kekilli 's budding acting career , but rather have the opposite effect .
as german actor mathieu carriere pointed out , " the fact that sibel kekilli had starred in pornos is unimportant .
better to go from pornos to the " oscar " than the other way round .

a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .
the accident has triggered a debate on uncontrolled speeding on the autobahns . rolf fischer 's passion for high speeds proved to be his undoing on tuesday when a german court found the 34-year-old mercedes test driver guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while travelling at 250km / h on a german motorway . nicknamed " turbo-rolf " among his colleagues for his preference for fast cars , the daimlerchrysler engineer now faces 18 months in prison . fischer has also been fired by daimlerchrysler following the court sentencing . a case of reckless speeding the state prosecution in karlsruhe , who had called for a prison sentence of one year and nine months , said that on the day of the accident in summer last year , fischer was tailgaiting a car driven by a woman named only as jasmin a. on the a5 autobahn . the engineer was on his way to a car test-track in the northern city of papenburg in a company-owned , dark mercedes slk .
fischer forced the 21-year-old woman , driving in a much smaller kia , to shift into one of the slow lanes . startled by his agressiveness and speed , the woman lost control of her car while swerving to change lanes .
the car spun across two lanes and smashed into some trees .
she and her daughter , rebecca , died instantly .
fischer sped off from the scene . police said they had finally found fischer on the basis of petrol station receipts , mobile phone records and the testimony of a witness .
witnesses during the trial also identified fischer 's mercedes as having caused the accident . however fischer himself had pleaded not guilty to manslaughter , fleeing from the scene of the accident and serious traffic violations during the trial .
despite his colorful nickname , which has been splashed in the tabloid press , fischer had denied his love for fast driving .
" it 's a complete mystery to me why people say that i have an aggressive driving style , " he said during the trial .
" i never forced anybody off the road nor did i notice anything about an accident , " he said . speed limits anyone ? the case has prompted new questions about the lack of speed limits on germany 's 11,393-kilometer-long autobahn network designed in the 1920s .
germany remains the only country in the world that allows drivers to stretch their cars to the limit , a feature that also lures speed-happy tourists unable to convert their motorways into racing tracks in their own countries . but experts are now repeating calls for a review of the country 's fast-lane culture . " we think it is a big problem because germany is the only country world-wide where no limits of speed on the motorway exists .
that means there are a lot of parts on the motorway where people can drive as fast as they want to , " daniel kluge of the german ministry of transport and environment told deutsche welle .
" so we have big problems where there are cars with less speed - then you have a big speed difference . " the losers usually are slower drivers caught in the fast lane , who are subject to an irritable flash of headlights or impatient drivers demanding clear passage . the german automobile association , adac , has repeatedly pointed out that there is a recommended top speed of 130km / h on all german motorways . but kluge pointed out there are no incentives to stick to the limit .
" if you go faster that that there is no possibility to be stopped by the police so … you in fact drive as fast as you want to . " speeding : personal freedom ? though the " turbo-rolf " case has stirred national debate in the country about speeding , tailgaiting or flashing headlights on motorways , kluge said it 's unlikely to radically alter the apparent german fascination with speed . he said there were several reasons for it .
" one part is the advertising of the automobile industry ; in germany it is nearly a tradition to advertise cars which drive safe with high speed , " kluge said .
" another thing is that many people in germany still think it is a kind of freedom and that it 's their right to have this personal feeling of speed . " but many believe that a prison sentence will now send a clear signal that there is indeed a limit to personal freedom on german motorways . kerstin steinbrecher -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese tourists in germany : castles and the autobahn since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .

today 's police send out an sms .
after more than a year of testing , germany 's interior ministry has announced police will start using sms text messages to track down criminals .
critics say the plan encourages spying and is not effective . a bank has just been robbed . a prisoner has escaped .
a bus has been hijacked .
and now the police are conducting a mass manhunt to find the culprit .
calling all public-minded citizens !
in 10 german cities regional police start their search for escaped criminals and missing persons by reaching for their mobile phones and sending out a short text message .
the people on the ground ready to help are the hundreds of voluntarily registered " spotters " - like taxi and bus drivers or city workers - who have agreed to cooperate with the police to track down suspected criminals by sending in their tips .
organized by the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- , the sms crime tracking method has been functioning as a test project in regional police departments since september 2002 . but now german interior minister otto schily has announced that it will become a regular feature in police work throughout the country .
" it 's another precise way to have the public help search for criminals or missing people , " schily said at a press conference earlier in the week .
spy on your neighbor not everyone is pleased with the method .
critics have been quick to pounce on the concept of asking the public to join the police in fighting crime .
jörg tauss , media spokesman for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary faction - schily 's own party - fears that the new method will encourage citizens to spy on and " denounce " their neighbors and other people .
he called on schily to stop at once this " latest nonsense from police circles . "
rainer lingenthal of the federal interior ministry rejected the criticism and urged tauss to reconsider and retract his remarks about denunciation .
the spd 's domestic policy spokesman , dieter wiefelspütz , said the sms search method was an additional possibility that should be tried out , but he conceded that miracles could not be expected from it .
however , schily said the new method could significantly improve crime fighting .
speaking at a press conference last sunday , the minister emphasized the need for the police to exhaust all possibilities in their attempts to capture a perpetrator immediately after a crime has been committed .
" the speedy and direct involvement of citizens enables new forms of cooperation between police and the population , " he said adding that using sms increased the probability of tracking down the criminal and quickly clearing up the crime .
ministry claims " considerable success " according to the interior ministry , the police achieved " considerable success " during the year-long trial period .
introduced at 11 police stations around the country , the sms search method involved the registry of between 50 and 100 volonteers in each location , many of whom were involved in public transport and worked in close proximity to the public . messages sent out by the police often included descriptions of suspects and vehicle information such as licence plate numbers .
anyone who receives the information and makes a positive identification can call a special hotline at the local police station .
for those a little hesitant , there 's a financial incentive : should the information provided by the sms receiver lead to the apprehension and conviction of a wanted person , the police will give the citizen a reward of around 50 euros .
based on the positive results of the tests in all the major german cities , the bka has decided to employ the sms function in all its police departments .
media say only " modest successes " however , media reports refer only to " modest successes " so far .
the ostthüringer zeitung newspaper reported that during a test in the eastern city of jena there had been no concrete relation between effort and use .
even police are not convinced of the method 's effectiveness .
the states of bavaria and baden-württemberg , as well as the police in cologne , have said they do not want to take part in the project .
other federal states have not yet decided . dw staff -lrb- bp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cops test sms project to catch crooks a pilot project enlisting the help of the public to catch criminals using information transmitted by sms text messages to mobile phones has started this week in the german cities of wiesbaden and bochum .

today 's police send out an sms .
after more than a year of testing , germany 's interior ministry has announced police will start using sms text messages to track down criminals .
critics say the plan encourages spying and is not effective . a bank has just been robbed . a prisoner has escaped .
a bus has been hijacked .
and now the police are conducting a mass manhunt to find the culprit .
calling all public-minded citizens !
in 10 german cities regional police start their search for escaped criminals and missing persons by reaching for their mobile phones and sending out a short text message .
the people on the ground ready to help are the hundreds of voluntarily registered " spotters " - like taxi and bus drivers or city workers - who have agreed to cooperate with the police to track down suspected criminals by sending in their tips .
organized by the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- , the sms crime tracking method has been functioning as a test project in regional police departments since september 2002 . but now german interior minister otto schily has announced that it will become a regular feature in police work throughout the country .
" it 's another precise way to have the public help search for criminals or missing people , " schily said at a press conference earlier in the week .
spy on your neighbor not everyone is pleased with the method .
critics have been quick to pounce on the concept of asking the public to join the police in fighting crime .
jörg tauss , media spokesman for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary faction - schily 's own party - fears that the new method will encourage citizens to spy on and " denounce " their neighbors and other people .
he called on schily to stop at once this " latest nonsense from police circles . "
rainer lingenthal of the federal interior ministry rejected the criticism and urged tauss to reconsider and retract his remarks about denunciation .
the spd 's domestic policy spokesman , dieter wiefelspütz , said the sms search method was an additional possibility that should be tried out , but he conceded that miracles could not be expected from it .
however , schily said the new method could significantly improve crime fighting .
speaking at a press conference last sunday , the minister emphasized the need for the police to exhaust all possibilities in their attempts to capture a perpetrator immediately after a crime has been committed .
" the speedy and direct involvement of citizens enables new forms of cooperation between police and the population , " he said adding that using sms increased the probability of tracking down the criminal and quickly clearing up the crime .
ministry claims " considerable success " according to the interior ministry , the police achieved " considerable success " during the year-long trial period .
introduced at 11 police stations around the country , the sms search method involved the registry of between 50 and 100 volonteers in each location , many of whom were involved in public transport and worked in close proximity to the public . messages sent out by the police often included descriptions of suspects and vehicle information such as licence plate numbers .
anyone who receives the information and makes a positive identification can call a special hotline at the local police station .
for those a little hesitant , there 's a financial incentive : should the information provided by the sms receiver lead to the apprehension and conviction of a wanted person , the police will give the citizen a reward of around 50 euros .
based on the positive results of the tests in all the major german cities , the bka has decided to employ the sms function in all its police departments .
media say only " modest successes " however , media reports refer only to " modest successes " so far .
the ostthüringer zeitung newspaper reported that during a test in the eastern city of jena there had been no concrete relation between effort and use .
even police are not convinced of the method 's effectiveness .
the states of bavaria and baden-württemberg , as well as the police in cologne , have said they do not want to take part in the project .

a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .
the accident has triggered a debate on uncontrolled speeding on the autobahns . rolf fischer 's passion for high speeds proved to be his undoing on tuesday when a german court found the 34-year-old mercedes test driver guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while travelling at 250km / h on a german motorway . nicknamed " turbo-rolf " among his colleagues for his preference for fast cars , the daimlerchrysler engineer now faces 18 months in prison . fischer has also been fired by daimlerchrysler following the court sentencing . a case of reckless speeding the state prosecution in karlsruhe , who had called for a prison sentence of one year and nine months , said that on the day of the accident in summer last year , fischer was tailgaiting a car driven by a woman named only as jasmin a. on the a5 autobahn . the engineer was on his way to a car test-track in the northern city of papenburg in a company-owned , dark mercedes slk .
fischer forced the 21-year-old woman , driving in a much smaller kia , to shift into one of the slow lanes . startled by his agressiveness and speed , the woman lost control of her car while swerving to change lanes .
the car spun across two lanes and smashed into some trees .
she and her daughter , rebecca , died instantly .
fischer sped off from the scene . police said they had finally found fischer on the basis of petrol station receipts , mobile phone records and the testimony of a witness .
witnesses during the trial also identified fischer 's mercedes as having caused the accident . however fischer himself had pleaded not guilty to manslaughter , fleeing from the scene of the accident and serious traffic violations during the trial .
despite his colorful nickname , which has been splashed in the tabloid press , fischer had denied his love for fast driving .
" it 's a complete mystery to me why people say that i have an aggressive driving style , " he said during the trial .
" i never forced anybody off the road nor did i notice anything about an accident , " he said . speed limits anyone ? the case has prompted new questions about the lack of speed limits on germany 's 11,393-kilometer-long autobahn network designed in the 1920s .
germany remains the only country in the world that allows drivers to stretch their cars to the limit , a feature that also lures speed-happy tourists unable to convert their motorways into racing tracks in their own countries . but experts are now repeating calls for a review of the country 's fast-lane culture . " we think it is a big problem because germany is the only country world-wide where no limits of speed on the motorway exists .
that means there are a lot of parts on the motorway where people can drive as fast as they want to , " daniel kluge of the german ministry of transport and environment told deutsche welle .
" so we have big problems where there are cars with less speed - then you have a big speed difference . " the losers usually are slower drivers caught in the fast lane , who are subject to an irritable flash of headlights or impatient drivers demanding clear passage . the german automobile association , adac , has repeatedly pointed out that there is a recommended top speed of 130km / h on all german motorways . but kluge pointed out there are no incentives to stick to the limit .
" if you go faster that that there is no possibility to be stopped by the police so … you in fact drive as fast as you want to . " speeding : personal freedom ? though the " turbo-rolf " case has stirred national debate in the country about speeding , tailgaiting or flashing headlights on motorways , kluge said it 's unlikely to radically alter the apparent german fascination with speed . he said there were several reasons for it .
" one part is the advertising of the automobile industry ; in germany it is nearly a tradition to advertise cars which drive safe with high speed , " kluge said .
" another thing is that many people in germany still think it is a kind of freedom and that it 's their right to have this personal feeling of speed . " but many believe that a prison sentence will now send a clear signal that there is indeed a limit to personal freedom on german motorways . kerstin steinbrecher -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese tourists in germany : castles and the autobahn since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .

"
days after being celebrated at the berlinale for her role in the award-winning film " head-on " , 23-year-old sibel kekilli is at the center of a sex scandal after a tabloid published sleazy details of a pornographic past . the curtain may have dropped on the star-studded berlinale film festival in the capital last week , but a scandal engulfing one of its most promising german stars has now exploded in the country . germany 's mass-selling bild announced this week that 23-year-old sibel kekilli - who received rave reviews for her role as a hamburg nurse in the film head-on that won the coveted golden bear in an unexpected triumph for germany - had starred in a string of porno films before her illustrious berlinale debut . the gritty lowdown in a no-holds-barred report , a headline in the tabloid screamed on tuesday , " why did the petite diva star in such hard-core pornos ? " an assortment of pictures showed the young actress involved in a porn scene on a location in ibiza as well as images from her latest award-winning film . the paper reported that kekilli , who is of turkish origin , had starred in " nine hardcore pornographic movies " until autumn 2002 .
the tabloid , notorious for its dirt-digging tactics reported that kekilli 's father , who has been living in germany since 1977 was in shock . " the disgrace is too great for the family , " kekilli 's father said .
" sibel moved to hamburg two years ago .
apparently she worked in the city hall and now this news .
i can never forgive her for it .
i do n't want to ever see her again , " he said . " what counts is the golden bear " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish-born actors sibel kekilli , left , and birol uenel pose during a photo call before the awarding ceremony at the berlin international filmfestival berlinale in berlin saturday , feb .
14 , 2004 .
fatih akin 's film gegen die wand -lrb- head on -rrb- was awarded with the golden bear for the best film .
-lrb- ap photo / jan bauer -rrb- the charming angelic-faced actress , who made a splash in the media during the berlinale together with film director fatih akin and co-star birol ünel -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , is being candid about her past .
" yes , i did make these -lrb- porno -rrb- films .
but that 's the past .
what counts is the golden bear , " she told bild . the budding star has also received support from her new-found contacts in the film world . akin said he had been aware of kekilli 's past right from the beginning , but it had n't bothered him in the least .
he added he had n't seen the porno films himself because " i wanted to direct head-on with an unbiased mind . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german director of turkish origin fatih akin poses with his golden bear award after the awarding ceremony at the 54nd berlinale international film festival berlin saturday , feb 14 , 2004 .
the turkish-german movie ' gegen die wand ' -lrb- head on -rrb- , won the top award " golden bear " at the berlin film festival on saturday .
-lrb- ap photo / fabrizio bensch , pool -rrb- akin -lrb- photo -rrb- slammed the tabloid reporting of the topic as " bigoted and disgusting " and said he had n't mentioned kekilli 's past earlier because he wanted to protect the actress .
" sibel and i hoped naively that it would n't come out , " he told a berlin daily . even the berlinale 's director dieter kosslick is firmly throwing his weight behind the actress .
" we 're behind her all the way , " he said .
kosslick admitted he too had known about kekilli 's past , and said " but i have nothing to say here morally . "
the berlinale director added that he had organized a lawyer for kekilli and mobilized everything within his power .
" but thanks to the media , she ca n't even go out of her home , she 's totally besieged , " he said . head on wins accolades head-on has been hailed by the german media , not just because of its hard-hitting story line , but also because it was the first german film to win the golden bear after 18 long years . akin , whose films usually deal with young turks in germany straddling two cultures , has since been praised for putting german film back on the map . the film tells the story of a young turkish-german woman played by kekilli who enters a marriage of convenience with a beer-drinking , middle-aged turkish-german punk -lrb- played by birol ünel -rrb- to escape her conservative muslim family .
the film moves between hamburg and istanbul . as the two live it up with their own wild lifestyles and separate sexual affairs , the couple eventually falls in love - a situation that ends when the husband kills one of the lovers in a jealous rage . kekilli , a virtual unknown until head-on grabbed attention at the berlinale -lrb- she was allegedly spotted by akin on the street and cast right away -rrb- told dw-world last week that she was familiar with the situation in the film .
" i also grew up in such a conservative family , where there are such girls , " she said .
" my parents are modern , but there were always conflicts when i did n't get my freedom to an extent , but i always fought for it . " most agree that the present scandal wo n't damage kekilli 's budding acting career , but rather have the opposite effect .
as german actor mathieu carriere pointed out , " the fact that sibel kekilli had starred in pornos is unimportant .
better to go from pornos to the " oscar " than the other way round .

a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .
the accident has triggered a debate on uncontrolled speeding on the autobahns . rolf fischer 's passion for high speeds proved to be his undoing on tuesday when a german court found the 34-year-old mercedes test driver guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while travelling at 250km / h on a german motorway . nicknamed " turbo-rolf " among his colleagues for his preference for fast cars , the daimlerchrysler engineer now faces 18 months in prison . fischer has also been fired by daimlerchrysler following the court sentencing . a case of reckless speeding the state prosecution in karlsruhe , who had called for a prison sentence of one year and nine months , said that on the day of the accident in summer last year , fischer was tailgaiting a car driven by a woman named only as jasmin a. on the a5 autobahn . the engineer was on his way to a car test-track in the northern city of papenburg in a company-owned , dark mercedes slk .
fischer forced the 21-year-old woman , driving in a much smaller kia , to shift into one of the slow lanes . startled by his agressiveness and speed , the woman lost control of her car while swerving to change lanes .
the car spun across two lanes and smashed into some trees .
she and her daughter , rebecca , died instantly .
fischer sped off from the scene . police said they had finally found fischer on the basis of petrol station receipts , mobile phone records and the testimony of a witness .
witnesses during the trial also identified fischer 's mercedes as having caused the accident . however fischer himself had pleaded not guilty to manslaughter , fleeing from the scene of the accident and serious traffic violations during the trial .
despite his colorful nickname , which has been splashed in the tabloid press , fischer had denied his love for fast driving .
" it 's a complete mystery to me why people say that i have an aggressive driving style , " he said during the trial .
" i never forced anybody off the road nor did i notice anything about an accident , " he said . speed limits anyone ? the case has prompted new questions about the lack of speed limits on germany 's 11,393-kilometer-long autobahn network designed in the 1920s .
germany remains the only country in the world that allows drivers to stretch their cars to the limit , a feature that also lures speed-happy tourists unable to convert their motorways into racing tracks in their own countries . but experts are now repeating calls for a review of the country 's fast-lane culture . " we think it is a big problem because germany is the only country world-wide where no limits of speed on the motorway exists .
that means there are a lot of parts on the motorway where people can drive as fast as they want to , " daniel kluge of the german ministry of transport and environment told deutsche welle .
" so we have big problems where there are cars with less speed - then you have a big speed difference . " the losers usually are slower drivers caught in the fast lane , who are subject to an irritable flash of headlights or impatient drivers demanding clear passage . the german automobile association , adac , has repeatedly pointed out that there is a recommended top speed of 130km / h on all german motorways . but kluge pointed out there are no incentives to stick to the limit .
" if you go faster that that there is no possibility to be stopped by the police so … you in fact drive as fast as you want to . " speeding : personal freedom ? though the " turbo-rolf " case has stirred national debate in the country about speeding , tailgaiting or flashing headlights on motorways , kluge said it 's unlikely to radically alter the apparent german fascination with speed . he said there were several reasons for it .
" one part is the advertising of the automobile industry ; in germany it is nearly a tradition to advertise cars which drive safe with high speed , " kluge said .
" another thing is that many people in germany still think it is a kind of freedom and that it 's their right to have this personal feeling of speed . " but many believe that a prison sentence will now send a clear signal that there is indeed a limit to personal freedom on german motorways . kerstin steinbrecher -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese tourists in germany : castles and the autobahn since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .

"
days after being celebrated at the berlinale for her role in the award-winning film " head-on " , 23-year-old sibel kekilli is at the center of a sex scandal after a tabloid published sleazy details of a pornographic past . the curtain may have dropped on the star-studded berlinale film festival in the capital last week , but a scandal engulfing one of its most promising german stars has now exploded in the country . germany 's mass-selling bild announced this week that 23-year-old sibel kekilli - who received rave reviews for her role as a hamburg nurse in the film head-on that won the coveted golden bear in an unexpected triumph for germany - had starred in a string of porno films before her illustrious berlinale debut . the gritty lowdown in a no-holds-barred report , a headline in the tabloid screamed on tuesday , " why did the petite diva star in such hard-core pornos ? " an assortment of pictures showed the young actress involved in a porn scene on a location in ibiza as well as images from her latest award-winning film . the paper reported that kekilli , who is of turkish origin , had starred in " nine hardcore pornographic movies " until autumn 2002 .
the tabloid , notorious for its dirt-digging tactics reported that kekilli 's father , who has been living in germany since 1977 was in shock . " the disgrace is too great for the family , " kekilli 's father said .
" sibel moved to hamburg two years ago .
apparently she worked in the city hall and now this news .

today 's police send out an sms .
after more than a year of testing , germany 's interior ministry has announced police will start using sms text messages to track down criminals .
critics say the plan encourages spying and is not effective . a bank has just been robbed . a prisoner has escaped .
a bus has been hijacked .
and now the police are conducting a mass manhunt to find the culprit .
calling all public-minded citizens !
in 10 german cities regional police start their search for escaped criminals and missing persons by reaching for their mobile phones and sending out a short text message .
the people on the ground ready to help are the hundreds of voluntarily registered " spotters " - like taxi and bus drivers or city workers - who have agreed to cooperate with the police to track down suspected criminals by sending in their tips .
organized by the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- , the sms crime tracking method has been functioning as a test project in regional police departments since september 2002 . but now german interior minister otto schily has announced that it will become a regular feature in police work throughout the country .
" it 's another precise way to have the public help search for criminals or missing people , " schily said at a press conference earlier in the week .
spy on your neighbor not everyone is pleased with the method .
critics have been quick to pounce on the concept of asking the public to join the police in fighting crime .
jörg tauss , media spokesman for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary faction - schily 's own party - fears that the new method will encourage citizens to spy on and " denounce " their neighbors and other people .
he called on schily to stop at once this " latest nonsense from police circles . "
rainer lingenthal of the federal interior ministry rejected the criticism and urged tauss to reconsider and retract his remarks about denunciation .
the spd 's domestic policy spokesman , dieter wiefelspütz , said the sms search method was an additional possibility that should be tried out , but he conceded that miracles could not be expected from it .
however , schily said the new method could significantly improve crime fighting .
speaking at a press conference last sunday , the minister emphasized the need for the police to exhaust all possibilities in their attempts to capture a perpetrator immediately after a crime has been committed .
" the speedy and direct involvement of citizens enables new forms of cooperation between police and the population , " he said adding that using sms increased the probability of tracking down the criminal and quickly clearing up the crime .
ministry claims " considerable success " according to the interior ministry , the police achieved " considerable success " during the year-long trial period .
introduced at 11 police stations around the country , the sms search method involved the registry of between 50 and 100 volonteers in each location , many of whom were involved in public transport and worked in close proximity to the public . messages sent out by the police often included descriptions of suspects and vehicle information such as licence plate numbers .
anyone who receives the information and makes a positive identification can call a special hotline at the local police station .
for those a little hesitant , there 's a financial incentive : should the information provided by the sms receiver lead to the apprehension and conviction of a wanted person , the police will give the citizen a reward of around 50 euros .
based on the positive results of the tests in all the major german cities , the bka has decided to employ the sms function in all its police departments .
media say only " modest successes " however , media reports refer only to " modest successes " so far .
the ostthüringer zeitung newspaper reported that during a test in the eastern city of jena there had been no concrete relation between effort and use .
even police are not convinced of the method 's effectiveness .
the states of bavaria and baden-württemberg , as well as the police in cologne , have said they do not want to take part in the project .

when his father died 20 years ago , he inherited the five-hectare plantation which lies just north of duekoue .
until two or three years ago , mr dobiya was doing well .
these days , the good times are just a memory .
" i used to produce about three tonnes of coffee a year .
now , with the rebellion , we barely reach 500kg in a year .
it gets lower all the time because the plants are rotting , " he said .
crops at the vast plantation are rotting because his employees have all run away .
" the peasants have n't come to work since the crisis began , " he said .
" they said they were going to burkina faso or mali to leave their children and elderly parents in safety .
but none of them has come back . "
all of his employees were people who originated from neighbouring burkina faso or mali .
in ivory coast , this group of people are known as " etrangers " or foreigners .
many of them were born here , some are even second generation - but they are still called foreigners or " les burkinabes " .
militia groups take a half-hour drive west of duekoue , to the smaller town of guiglo , and you can find over 7,000 people of burkinabe origin .
they have not left ivory coast , but are living within the relatively safe confines of a refugee camp , or what the ivorians call somewhat ironically , a " welcome centre " .
hatred is a big problem - it still exists here definitely , there is so much hatred against the foreigners bil dobiya , cocoa farmer under a wooden shelter , close to the entrance of the camp , idrissa zungurane , a local burkinabe elder , explains why he fled the plantations .
" the guere people are jealous of us , " he says , throwing his arms up above his head .
" they used militia groups to chase us , the burkinabe , off our land .
now we 've got nothing .
" we came to ivory coast because of the money and the cocoa .
now the guere want to chase us back to burkina faso because they want the money we make from cocoa and coffee . "
hatred mr dobiya is neither guere nor " etranger " .
french troops have been patrolling at kahin he is what is known in ivory coast , as an allogene - an ivorian national who has moved from the area they were born to another area .
mr dobiya is from tuba , a small town 120km north of duekoue .
he agrees nevertheless , that the guere are to blame for the violence and hence his depleted annual coffee produce .
" many burkinabe have been injured or killed by the guere .
i do n't even have a number , it is so high , " says mr dobiya .
" hatred is a big problem .
it still exists here definitely .
there is so much hatred against the foreigners .
if it continues for much longer , i will be finished , " he said .
but people of guere origin deny that they are responsible for the growing hatred .
continuous attacks earlier this year , on 5 january , there was a massacre in a local village called kahin .
like mr dobiya 's plantations , kahin lies within ivory coast 's so-called zone of confidence : a strip of land running across the country which is patrolled by french soldiers .
despite the french patrols , over 36 people were killed in kahin last month .
at least 30 were guere , and about six were burkinabe .
tate du gaston is guere , he used to live in kahin , but he fled to guiglo late last year .
" the burkinabe have begun and continue their attacks .
they set fire to the entire village of kahin , " he said .
" they came and tied us up .
they plan it all out and every day they come , all together , and slaughter us . "
insecure zone jacques doue , deputy mayor of guiglo , is a rotund and jovial figure of a man .
mr doue has lived in guiglo most of his life and clearly loves and is proud of his town .
he has no doubts about where his ethnic loyalties lie .
" it 's the foreigners who are attacking the guere , " he says from behind a huge desk .
the burkinabes feel guere are jealous of their achievements " the people go quickly into the villages to massacre the local population .
in kahin , there were 30 guere killed on 5 january compared to six foreigners .
" and right up until today , this zone is completely insecure .
that 's why the autochthonous population ca n't return to their homes .
that 's why they 're all staying with us in guiglo , " said mr doue .
as the communities continue to disagree , planters like mr dobiya are struggling to make ends meet .
he says that even if his employees come back within the next month , his plantations will take at least a year to recover .
" if you leave coffee and cocoa untended for two years , it 'll take at least a year to get it back to where it was .
" we live in hope that the crisis will come to an end - but there are many people who are still very , frightened . "

it is thought that west wales and the valleys could be eligible for hundreds of millions of pounds from the european union 's regional aid programme .
the current round of funding , known as objective one and worth £ 1.2 billion , is due to come to an end in 2006 .
the extension would run to 2013 .
as the european union expands to 25 members in may 2004 , taking in poorer countries from the east , wales will become wealthier compared to the rest of the eu .
poorest areas as a consequence , it had been thought that wales would be less likely to get the grants - which are intended to help improve the economies of europe 's poorest areas .
however , it is thought that wales could still eligible for a form of objective one funding .
to be eligible for the new level of grant the poorest parts of wales would need to remain statistically under 75 % of the wealth of the ' old eu ' of 15 members .
the commission says it is its intention for the average payment to west wales and the valleys over seven years from 2006 to be 74 % of current objective one handouts - beginning at 85 % in 2007 and tapering down to 60 % in 2013 .
it wants to provide temporary support for regions who would otherwise lose out because of the ' statistical effect ' of the enlargement of the eu .
eastern parts of wales could also receive lesser forms of eu aid over the same period .
any funding from the eu will have to be " matched " by equal funding from the treasury which is why there will now be further debate in wales and at westminster on the european commission 's proposals .
the ultimate decision will be made by the european council of ministers , which includes the uk government .

around wales , lifeboats were launched 1,062 times last year , up 15 % on 2002 , and crews rescued 1,061 people , compared to 859 the previous year .
the busiest stations around wales were tenby , which saw 78 launches and 46 rescues , and beaumaris on anglesey , which witnessed 77 launches and 93 rescues .
the long hot summer has been partly blamed for the increase in call-outs , which contributed to a record 8,047 launches across the uk during the year .
the total number of lifeboat launches in the uk has increased year-on-year since 1986 .
rnli operations director michael vlasto said there were a number of factors which had contributed to the increase .
" the changing patterns of sea use by the public , improved search and rescue techniques and the dramatic growth in the use of mobile telephones among the public , " he said .
busiest stations in 2003 tenby : 78 launches , 46 rescues beaumaris : 77 launches , 93 rescues mumbles : 61 launches , 93 rescues trearddur : 60 launches , 54 rescues rhyl : 59 launches , 44 rescues " and , particularly for 2003 , the long , hot summer , " he added .
however , the rise is causing concern , and the organisation is now attempting to reduce numbers with preventative initiatives such as the sea check scheme .
sea check sees rnli volunteers trained up to offer free safety advice to boat owners .
they also make sure people have the right equipment on board when they put to sea .
the rnli is also expanding its beach lifeguard service and is introducing more hovercrafts .
mr vlasto said the rnli was committed to encouraging sea users to be safe " because launching lifeboats was expensive and risky to crews " .
the annual running costs of the rnli , which is a registered charity , were around £ 107m in 2003 .

twenty-five refuges are being created in large coniferous plantations , a habitat which is disliked by the rival grey squirrel .
the plan was worked up by the scottish squirrel group , which includes the forestry commission , scottish natural heritage and other bodies .
in the last 50 years the species has experienced a widespread decline .
the new strategy aims to improve habitat , establish a local squirrel group network and maintain a national database of records .
mammals specialist at scottish natural heritage , mairi cole , said : " red squirrels in scotland continue to be threatened , particularly by development , woodland management and competition from the grey squirrel .
" this strategy will help us to focus on areas where we can maximise our efforts to protect this endangered species and sets out clear ways of working with foresters and other groups which can help red squirrels survive . "
despite their high profile , red squirrels are under-recorded in a large part of the country , but it is known that about 75 % -lrb- 121,000 animals -rrb- of the uk population , are based in scotland .
forestry commission scotland conservator , alex morris , said : " the contribution that foresters and landowners continue to make to managing the woodland habitat to favour red squirrels , and also controlling competing grey squirrels in woodlands , is crucial to the long-term future of red squirrels in scotland .
" the strategy moves us in the direction of identifying where such work is going to be most effective and should engender even more close working between forest managers and local groups to conserve these important red squirrel populations . "

twenty-five refuges are being created in large coniferous plantations , a habitat which is disliked by the rival grey squirrel .
the plan was worked up by the scottish squirrel group , which includes the forestry commission , scottish natural heritage and other bodies .
in the last 50 years the species has experienced a widespread decline .
the new strategy aims to improve habitat , establish a local squirrel group network and maintain a national database of records .
the grey squirrel is among the threats to the red squirrel mammals specialist at scottish natural heritage , mairi cole , said : " red squirrels in scotland continue to be threatened , particularly by development , woodland management and competition from the grey squirrel .
" this strategy will help us to focus on areas where we can maximise our efforts to protect this endangered species and sets out clear ways of working with foresters and other groups which can help red squirrels survive . "
despite their high profile , red squirrels are under-recorded in a large part of the country , but it is known that about 75 % -lrb- 121,000 animals -rrb- of the uk population , are based in scotland .
forestry commission scotland conservator , alex morris , said : " the contribution that foresters and landowners continue to make to managing the woodland habitat to favour red squirrels , and also controlling competing grey squirrels in woodlands , is crucial to the long-term future of red squirrels in scotland .
" the strategy moves us in the direction of identifying where such work is going to be most effective and should engender even more close working between forest managers and local groups to conserve these important red squirrel populations . "

around wales , lifeboats were launched 1,062 times last year , up 15 % on 2002 , and crews rescued 1,061 people , compared to 859 the previous year .
the busiest stations around wales were tenby , which saw 78 launches and 46 rescues , and beaumaris on anglesey , which witnessed 77 launches and 93 rescues .
the long hot summer has been partly blamed for the increase in call-outs , which contributed to a record 8,047 launches across the uk during the year .
the total number of lifeboat launches in the uk has increased year-on-year since 1986 .
rnli operations director michael vlasto said there were a number of factors which had contributed to the increase .
" the changing patterns of sea use by the public , improved search and rescue techniques and the dramatic growth in the use of mobile telephones among the public , " he said .
busiest stations in 2003 tenby : 78 launches , 46 rescues beaumaris : 77 launches , 93 rescues mumbles : 61 launches , 93 rescues trearddur : 60 launches , 54 rescues rhyl : 59 launches , 44 rescues " and , particularly for 2003 , the long , hot summer , " he added .
however , the rise is causing concern , and the organisation is now attempting to reduce numbers with preventative initiatives such as the sea check scheme .
sea check sees rnli volunteers trained up to offer free safety advice to boat owners .
they also make sure people have the right equipment on board when they put to sea .
the rnli is also expanding its beach lifeguard service and is introducing more hovercrafts .
mr vlasto said the rnli was committed to encouraging sea users to be safe " because launching lifeboats was expensive and risky to crews " .
the annual running costs of the rnli , which is a registered charity , were around £ 107m in 2003 .

busiest stations in 2003 tenby : 78 launches , 46 rescues beaumaris : 77 launches , 93 rescues mumbles : 61 launches , 93 rescues trearddur : 60 launches , 54 rescues rhyl : 59 launches , 44 rescues " and , particularly for 2003 , the long , hot summer , " he added .
however , the rise is causing concern , and the organisation is now attempting to reduce numbers with preventative initiatives such as the sea check scheme .
sea check sees rnli volunteers trained up to offer free safety advice to boat owners .
they also make sure people have the right equipment on board when they put to sea .
the rnli is also expanding its beach lifeguard service and is introducing more hovercrafts .
mr vlasto said the rnli was committed to encouraging sea users to be safe " because launching lifeboats was expensive and risky to crews " .
the annual running costs of the rnli , which is a registered charity , were around £ 107m in 2003 .

around wales , lifeboats were launched 1,062 times last year , up 15 % on 2002 , and crews rescued 1,061 people , compared to 859 the previous year .
the busiest stations around wales were tenby , which saw 78 launches and 46 rescues , and beaumaris on anglesey , which witnessed 77 launches and 93 rescues .
the long hot summer has been partly blamed for the increase in call-outs , which contributed to a record 8,047 launches across the uk during the year .

head keeper darren mcgarry said everyone was delighted with the tiny new arrival .
edinburgh zoo has been participating in a european endangered species programme for pudu since 1985 .

the moves are coordinated by the european studbrook keeper for the species who is based at wuppertal zoo in germany .
the southern pudu live in lowland temperate rainforests in chile and south-west argentina .

the men had served as lieutenants to the coup leader , george speight , now serving a life sentence for treason .
one , a former member of britain 's special forces , helped co-ordinate the storming of the fijian parliament .
the uprising sent the south pacific nation into chaos , with ministers held hostage at gunpoint for 56 days .
' returning heroes ' speight , a failed businessman , led the overthrow of the indian-dominated government four years ago .
the coup in 2000 deeply divided the pacific island along racial lines his brother , james , was among those released from a prison island off the coast of the fijian capital , suva .
former army major josefa savua and ilisoni ligairi , who once served with britain 's elite sas unit , were also released .
ligairi helped mastermind the assault on the parliament compound , which was carried out by disaffected members of fiji 's military .
the men were sentenced to three years in jail after treason charges against them were dropped and replaced by lesser offences , including kidnapping .
on their release , the men were greeted like returning heroes by a crowd of about 150 supporters in suva .
racial divisions the rebels have always insisted the government of former prime minister mahendra chaudhry was ousted to protect the rights of indigenous fijians , which they claimed were being eroded by the indian-led administration .
fiji remains a country clearly divided by race .
about 44 % of the population are indo-fijians , ancestors of indentured labourers brought from india to work on colonial sugar plantations by the british .
democracy has been re-established since the coup of may 2000 and power now rests in the hands of a hardline nationalist government .

the men had served as lieutenants to the coup leader , george speight , now serving a life sentence for treason .
one , a former member of britain 's special forces , helped co-ordinate the storming of the fijian parliament .
the uprising sent the south pacific nation into chaos , with ministers held hostage at gunpoint for 56 days .
' returning heroes ' speight , a failed businessman , led the overthrow of the indian-dominated government four years ago .
the coup in 2000 deeply divided the pacific island along racial lines his brother , james , was among those released from a prison island off the coast of the fijian capital , suva .
former army major josefa savua and ilisoni ligairi , who once served with britain 's elite sas unit , were also released .
ligairi helped mastermind the assault on the parliament compound , which was carried out by disaffected members of fiji 's military .
the men were sentenced to three years in jail after treason charges against them were dropped and replaced by lesser offences , including kidnapping .
on their release , the men were greeted like returning heroes by a crowd of about 150 supporters in suva .
racial divisions the rebels have always insisted the government of former prime minister mahendra chaudhry was ousted to protect the rights of indigenous fijians , which they claimed were being eroded by the indian-led administration .
fiji remains a country clearly divided by race .
about 44 % of the population are indo-fijians , ancestors of indentured labourers brought from india to work on colonial sugar plantations by the british .
democracy has been re-established since the coup of may 2000 and power now rests in the hands of a hardline nationalist government .

mps will be given the full details - which were agreed during talks in no 10 - on monday , downing street said .
britain is one of only two existing eu countries to allow people from states like lithuania , the czech republic and poland the right to work from 1 may .
moves could include a work permit scheme , and restrictions on benefits .
tuesday 's talks involved home secretary david blunkett , foreign secretary jack straw and work secretary andrew smith .
no discouragement ?
ireland is the only other eu country to have decided not to place restrictions on the citizens of new member states working .
the government had already indicated it was looking at ways to stop " benefit shoppers " - people turning up and trying to tap into the uk 's health and benefits systems .
but there has been support from ministers for allowing the right to work .
emergency meetings in downing street only nine weeks before the accession date shows what mess they are in david davis tory home affairs later , work and pensions minister andrew smith refused to reveal the details of the package , saying parliament should be told first .
he denied there had been " panic " over the issue , saying the government had always realised there would need to be regulations after eu enlargement .
" as the prime minister said in the house of commons , of course there have been the developments in terms of the decisions which other countries have taken , " mr smith told reporters .
" anyone sensible would take account of the position in the light of those and that is what we are doing . "
the tories last week accused the government of being confused on this issue .
this came after mr blair first indicated britain was looking at tighter controls to limit migration from eastern europe , and then mr blunkett insisted there would not be measures to discourage people from heading to the uk to work .
however he told the bbc steps would be announced " shortly " to stop the uk becoming a magnet for people who want to claim benefits and not work .
crisis ?
conservative home affairs spokesman david davis questioned why the government had been forced to hold a " crisis summit " nine weeks ahead of the accession date when eu enlargement had been " planned for years " .
new eu members -lrb- from 1 may -rrb- poland slovakia czech republic slovenia lithuania latvia hungary estonia malta cyprus he said : " emergency meetings in downing street only nine weeks before the accession date shows what mess they are in . "
for the lib dems , mark oaten said : " blair 's victory over david blunkett surely signals the final victory for populism over principle . "
ex-home office minister john denham said there were good reasons to allow new eu citizens to work in britain - for example to fill existing gaps in the labour market .
swamped ?
but he added there was a danger that if a small number of people were perceived to be exploiting the benefits system it could cause " a great deal of trouble " .
john monks , now head of the european-wide version of the tuc , accused sections of the media of talking up the danger that the uk would be " swamped " .
scotland 's first minister jack mcconnell said his country was facing a " serious population problem " with numbers due to fall below five million by 2009 .
it was therefore important that the new eu had as " free an economic market as possible because that 's the way to global prosperity not just for mainland europe but for the uk as well " .
all existing member states are able to impose transitional restrictions form up to seven years on the right of residents of eight of the ten new eu member states to work and claim benefits .
the idea is that by the end of that period of time the economies of the new members will have grown , thus making it less likely that mass migration will follow .
the restrictions only cover the former comunist states joining the eu - a separate deal means that there are no restrictions on citizens of cyprus and malta .

but he added there was a danger that if a small number of people were perceived to be exploiting the benefits system it could cause " a great deal of trouble " .
john monks , now head of the european-wide version of the tuc , accused sections of the media of talking up the danger that the uk would be " swamped " .
scotland 's first minister jack mcconnell said his country was facing a " serious population problem " with numbers due to fall below five million by 2009 .
it was therefore important that the new eu had as " free an economic market as possible because that 's the way to global prosperity not just for mainland europe but for the uk as well " .
all existing member states are able to impose transitional restrictions form up to seven years on the right of residents of eight of the ten new eu member states to work and claim benefits .
the idea is that by the end of that period of time the economies of the new members will have grown , thus making it less likely that mass migration will follow .
the restrictions only cover the former comunist states joining the eu - a separate deal means that there are no restrictions on citizens of cyprus and malta .

irish ferries is blaming a failure to come to an agreement with two unions - siptu and seamen 's union of ireland - about cost cutting measures , as it strives to make itself more competitive .
on tuesday , around 600 company workers received letters saying that , unless negotiations could be advanced by 20 february , the services would be suspended .
spokeswoman emma hargreaves said that any suspension would not begin before 27 february .
it would leave the company only operating the ulysses , the world 's largest car ferry , on the dublin-holyhead route .
however , the seamen 's union are saying that , if the other three services are suspended , its members will not continue to operate the ulysses .
ferries affected jonathan swift , between dublin and holyhead isle of inishmore , between rosslare and pembroke normandy , between rosslare and roscoff phil tallet is the chairman of pembroke dock 's chamber of trade and said as the summer season approaches " things could get rather serious " .
" that 's when pubs and hotels benefit from the ferries , " he said .
" people use it who work in ireland regularly , to go home to ireland , for stag parties . "
a spokesman for irish ferries said it was not sure how long the lay-off might be , but indicated it could be for several months .
" obviously a time would come when we have obligations to people going on their summer holidays , " added the spokesman .
the firm has recently set itself the task of shedding 52 sea-going staff and saving £ 2.3m a year , after an investigation found it had " the highest crew ratio in the british isles " .
but it has not been able to agree with the unions , despite negotiations at the irish labour court and labour relations commission .
irish ferries said the letter sent to staff said it was willing to negotiate any alternative proposals put forward by the union .
a company spokeswoman has said rugby fans travelling to and from dublin for sunday 's six nations clash will not be affected by the move .
