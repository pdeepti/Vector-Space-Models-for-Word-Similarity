austria 's outspoken nationalist jörg haider looks set to return to national prominence after winning a tough reelection as governor in the state of carinthia on sunday . one of europe 's most successful far-right politicians proved he could still pull in the votes with nationalist and xenophobic rhetoric and hold onto his seat as the governor in austria 's southern state of carinthia .
with 90 percent of ballots counted , jörg haider 's freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- garnered 42.4 percent of the vote , compared to just over 38 percent for the rival socialists and a lowly 11.6 percent for chancellor wolfgang schüssel 's conservative people 's party .
" nobody figured we had a chance again of being number one , " haider boasted to the austria press agency after the preliminary results came out .
national significance while the voting was restricted to carinthia , it 's significance extends all the way to vienna .
beyond seeking reelection as governor , haider made no secret of his plans to use a win in the southern state as a springboard for reclaiming national prominence .
" i want to revive the fpö from carinthia , " haider repeated in campaign speeches throughout the state .
nationally , however , the freedom party only enjoys about 10 percent support , compared to close to 30 percent four years ago when it first entered the federal government .
in salzburg , where austrians also voted in regional elections on sunday , the fpö received less than 10 percent of votes , suggesting that the success in carinthia owed more to haider 's personal charisma than a national revival for the party .
on the rebound ?
haider 's victory on sunday may be the demonstration of strength the populist politician needs to return to national party politics .
after stepping down from party leadership in 2000 and retreating to carinthia , haider seems to be itching to return to the bigger stage .
but many blame haider for the party 's national demise and will be watching closely to see what the fiery far-rightist has in store .
after skyrocketing into the national coalition four years ago with schüssel 's conservatives , haider quickly began chalking up bad marks for comments that sounded sympathetic to the nazis and contemptuous of foreigners and minorities .
a visit with saddam hussein on the eve of the iraq war and a friendship with moammar gadhafi when libya was still on the international blacklist , as well as a recent comparison between u.s. president george bush and hitler , have cost him the support of party followers .
when the european union slapped temporary sanctions on austria to protest the fpö 's role in the governing coalition , haider got out of the limelight .
since handing over the party leadership , he 's tried to run things from the sidelines , but has instead alienated supporters and driven voters to other parties .
" i regret nothing and see no reason to change my political agendy , " haider told the associated press .
" for speaking plainly you are attacked by your political opponents .
then two or three years later , they suddenly agree with you . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria 's jörg haider fights for his future the alpine firebrand is fighting for survival .
he 's been busy pulling out his trademark populist tactics , but it might not be enough to get him reelected when his home state of carinthia goes to the polls on sunday .

austria 's outspoken nationalist jörg haider looks set to return to national prominence after winning a tough reelection as governor in the state of carinthia on sunday . one of europe 's most successful far-right politicians proved he could still pull in the votes with nationalist and xenophobic rhetoric and hold onto his seat as the governor in austria 's southern state of carinthia .
with 90 percent of ballots counted , jörg haider 's freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- garnered 42.4 percent of the vote , compared to just over 38 percent for the rival socialists and a lowly 11.6 percent for chancellor wolfgang schüssel 's conservative people 's party .
" nobody figured we had a chance again of being number one , " haider boasted to the austria press agency after the preliminary results came out .
national significance while the voting was restricted to carinthia , it 's significance extends all the way to vienna .
beyond seeking reelection as governor , haider made no secret of his plans to use a win in the southern state as a springboard for reclaiming national prominence .
" i want to revive the fpö from carinthia , " haider repeated in campaign speeches throughout the state .
nationally , however , the freedom party only enjoys about 10 percent support , compared to close to 30 percent four years ago when it first entered the federal government .
in salzburg , where austrians also voted in regional elections on sunday , the fpö received less than 10 percent of votes , suggesting that the success in carinthia owed more to haider 's personal charisma than a national revival for the party .
on the rebound ?
haider 's victory on sunday may be the demonstration of strength the populist politician needs to return to national party politics .
after stepping down from party leadership in 2000 and retreating to carinthia , haider seems to be itching to return to the bigger stage .
but many blame haider for the party 's national demise and will be watching closely to see what the fiery far-rightist has in store .
after skyrocketing into the national coalition four years ago with schüssel 's conservatives , haider quickly began chalking up bad marks for comments that sounded sympathetic to the nazis and contemptuous of foreigners and minorities .
a visit with saddam hussein on the eve of the iraq war and a friendship with moammar gadhafi when libya was still on the international blacklist , as well as a recent comparison between u.s. president george bush and hitler , have cost him the support of party followers .
when the european union slapped temporary sanctions on austria to protest the fpö 's role in the governing coalition , haider got out of the limelight .
since handing over the party leadership , he 's tried to run things from the sidelines , but has instead alienated supporters and driven voters to other parties .
" i regret nothing and see no reason to change my political agendy , " haider told the associated press .

up on the north sea a string of islands offers plenty of dunes and shore for beachcombing - and the archipelago is growing . germany 's north sea islands , particularly spiekeroog , borkum , nordeney and mellum , are growing , not only in popularity among tourists , but in actual size .
a new study conducted by the national park service in lower saxony shows that four of the eight islands are actually bigger today than they were 40 years ago .
between 1966 and 1997 the islands , which are located in the wattenmeer -lrb- mud flats -rrb- national park , increased in area as the sand dunes and salt water marshes expanded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial photo of the island wangeooge .
the growth was measured with aerial photos taken over the years .
the national park examined the images and recorded the differences throughout the decades .
one of the primary changes noted was that the eastern end of the four islands extended further and further into the sea .
the park service sited changes in the patterns of water currents which caused more silt to be washed up and deposited on the islands .
the so-called east frisian islands are surrounded by a fragile eco-system that is protected by the national park .
the islands themselves , except for the bird island mellum , are inhabited .
during the summer months , they are often overcrowded as germans from mainland lower saxony and hamburg flock to the extensive sandy beaches . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sylt : in winter , a mellower pleasure winter on the popular beach resort of sylt means icy grey waters under a dark sky , bracing sea air , heavy surf - and above all , more calm than in summer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.03.2004 far-right austrian wins re-election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with nationalist rhetoric haider gets reelected governor .
austria 's outspoken nationalist jörg haider looks set to return to national prominence after winning a tough reelection as governor in the state of carinthia on sunday . one of europe 's most successful far-right politicians proved he could still pull in the votes with nationalist and xenophobic rhetoric and hold onto his seat as the governor in austria 's southern state of carinthia .
with 90 percent of ballots counted , jörg haider 's freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- garnered 42.4 percent of the vote , compared to just over 38 percent for the rival socialists and a lowly 11.6 percent for chancellor wolfgang schüssel 's conservative people 's party .
" nobody figured we had a chance again of being number one , " haider boasted to the austria press agency after the preliminary results came out .
national significance while the voting was restricted to carinthia , it 's significance extends all the way to vienna .
beyond seeking reelection as governor , haider made no secret of his plans to use a win in the southern state as a springboard for reclaiming national prominence .
" i want to revive the fpö from carinthia , " haider repeated in campaign speeches throughout the state .
nationally , however , the freedom party only enjoys about 10 percent support , compared to close to 30 percent four years ago when it first entered the federal government .
in salzburg , where austrians also voted in regional elections on sunday , the fpö received less than 10 percent of votes , suggesting that the success in carinthia owed more to haider 's personal charisma than a national revival for the party .
on the rebound ?
haider 's victory on sunday may be the demonstration of strength the populist politician needs to return to national party politics .
after stepping down from party leadership in 2000 and retreating to carinthia , haider seems to be itching to return to the bigger stage .
but many blame haider for the party 's national demise and will be watching closely to see what the fiery far-rightist has in store .
after skyrocketing into the national coalition four years ago with schüssel 's conservatives , haider quickly began chalking up bad marks for comments that sounded sympathetic to the nazis and contemptuous of foreigners and minorities .
a visit with saddam hussein on the eve of the iraq war and a friendship with moammar gadhafi when libya was still on the international blacklist , as well as a recent comparison between u.s. president george bush and hitler , have cost him the support of party followers .
when the european union slapped temporary sanctions on austria to protest the fpö 's role in the governing coalition , haider got out of the limelight .
since handing over the party leadership , he 's tried to run things from the sidelines , but has instead alienated supporters and driven voters to other parties .
" i regret nothing and see no reason to change my political agendy , " haider told the associated press .
" for speaking plainly you are attacked by your political opponents .
then two or three years later , they suddenly agree with you . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria 's jörg haider fights for his future the alpine firebrand is fighting for survival .
he 's been busy pulling out his trademark populist tactics , but it might not be enough to get him reelected when his home state of carinthia goes to the polls on sunday .

up on the north sea a string of islands offers plenty of dunes and shore for beachcombing - and the archipelago is growing . germany 's north sea islands , particularly spiekeroog , borkum , nordeney and mellum , are growing , not only in popularity among tourists , but in actual size .
a new study conducted by the national park service in lower saxony shows that four of the eight islands are actually bigger today than they were 40 years ago .
between 1966 and 1997 the islands , which are located in the wattenmeer -lrb- mud flats -rrb- national park , increased in area as the sand dunes and salt water marshes expanded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial photo of the island wangeooge .
the growth was measured with aerial photos taken over the years .
the national park examined the images and recorded the differences throughout the decades .
one of the primary changes noted was that the eastern end of the four islands extended further and further into the sea .
the park service sited changes in the patterns of water currents which caused more silt to be washed up and deposited on the islands .
the so-called east frisian islands are surrounded by a fragile eco-system that is protected by the national park .
the islands themselves , except for the bird island mellum , are inhabited .
during the summer months , they are often overcrowded as germans from mainland lower saxony and hamburg flock to the extensive sandy beaches . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sylt : in winter , a mellower pleasure winter on the popular beach resort of sylt means icy grey waters under a dark sky , bracing sea air , heavy surf - and above all , more calm than in summer .

austria 's outspoken nationalist jörg haider looks set to return to national prominence after winning a tough reelection as governor in the state of carinthia on sunday . one of europe 's most successful far-right politicians proved he could still pull in the votes with nationalist and xenophobic rhetoric and hold onto his seat as the governor in austria 's southern state of carinthia .
with 90 percent of ballots counted , jörg haider 's freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- garnered 42.4 percent of the vote , compared to just over 38 percent for the rival socialists and a lowly 11.6 percent for chancellor wolfgang schüssel 's conservative people 's party .
" nobody figured we had a chance again of being number one , " haider boasted to the austria press agency after the preliminary results came out .
national significance while the voting was restricted to carinthia , it 's significance extends all the way to vienna .
beyond seeking reelection as governor , haider made no secret of his plans to use a win in the southern state as a springboard for reclaiming national prominence .
" i want to revive the fpö from carinthia , " haider repeated in campaign speeches throughout the state .
nationally , however , the freedom party only enjoys about 10 percent support , compared to close to 30 percent four years ago when it first entered the federal government .
in salzburg , where austrians also voted in regional elections on sunday , the fpö received less than 10 percent of votes , suggesting that the success in carinthia owed more to haider 's personal charisma than a national revival for the party .
on the rebound ?
haider 's victory on sunday may be the demonstration of strength the populist politician needs to return to national party politics .
after stepping down from party leadership in 2000 and retreating to carinthia , haider seems to be itching to return to the bigger stage .
but many blame haider for the party 's national demise and will be watching closely to see what the fiery far-rightist has in store .
after skyrocketing into the national coalition four years ago with schüssel 's conservatives , haider quickly began chalking up bad marks for comments that sounded sympathetic to the nazis and contemptuous of foreigners and minorities .
a visit with saddam hussein on the eve of the iraq war and a friendship with moammar gadhafi when libya was still on the international blacklist , as well as a recent comparison between u.s. president george bush and hitler , have cost him the support of party followers .
when the european union slapped temporary sanctions on austria to protest the fpö 's role in the governing coalition , haider got out of the limelight .
since handing over the party leadership , he 's tried to run things from the sidelines , but has instead alienated supporters and driven voters to other parties .

up on the north sea a string of islands offers plenty of dunes and shore for beachcombing - and the archipelago is growing . germany 's north sea islands , particularly spiekeroog , borkum , nordeney and mellum , are growing , not only in popularity among tourists , but in actual size .
a new study conducted by the national park service in lower saxony shows that four of the eight islands are actually bigger today than they were 40 years ago .
between 1966 and 1997 the islands , which are located in the wattenmeer -lrb- mud flats -rrb- national park , increased in area as the sand dunes and salt water marshes expanded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial photo of the island wangeooge .
the growth was measured with aerial photos taken over the years .
the national park examined the images and recorded the differences throughout the decades .
one of the primary changes noted was that the eastern end of the four islands extended further and further into the sea .
the park service sited changes in the patterns of water currents which caused more silt to be washed up and deposited on the islands .
the so-called east frisian islands are surrounded by a fragile eco-system that is protected by the national park .
the islands themselves , except for the bird island mellum , are inhabited .
during the summer months , they are often overcrowded as germans from mainland lower saxony and hamburg flock to the extensive sandy beaches . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sylt : in winter , a mellower pleasure winter on the popular beach resort of sylt means icy grey waters under a dark sky , bracing sea air , heavy surf - and above all , more calm than in summer .

austria 's outspoken nationalist jörg haider looks set to return to national prominence after winning a tough reelection as governor in the state of carinthia on sunday . one of europe 's most successful far-right politicians proved he could still pull in the votes with nationalist and xenophobic rhetoric and hold onto his seat as the governor in austria 's southern state of carinthia .
with 90 percent of ballots counted , jörg haider 's freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- garnered 42.4 percent of the vote , compared to just over 38 percent for the rival socialists and a lowly 11.6 percent for chancellor wolfgang schüssel 's conservative people 's party .
" nobody figured we had a chance again of being number one , " haider boasted to the austria press agency after the preliminary results came out .
national significance while the voting was restricted to carinthia , it 's significance extends all the way to vienna .
beyond seeking reelection as governor , haider made no secret of his plans to use a win in the southern state as a springboard for reclaiming national prominence .
" i want to revive the fpö from carinthia , " haider repeated in campaign speeches throughout the state .
nationally , however , the freedom party only enjoys about 10 percent support , compared to close to 30 percent four years ago when it first entered the federal government .
in salzburg , where austrians also voted in regional elections on sunday , the fpö received less than 10 percent of votes , suggesting that the success in carinthia owed more to haider 's personal charisma than a national revival for the party .
on the rebound ?
haider 's victory on sunday may be the demonstration of strength the populist politician needs to return to national party politics .
after stepping down from party leadership in 2000 and retreating to carinthia , haider seems to be itching to return to the bigger stage .
but many blame haider for the party 's national demise and will be watching closely to see what the fiery far-rightist has in store .
after skyrocketing into the national coalition four years ago with schüssel 's conservatives , haider quickly began chalking up bad marks for comments that sounded sympathetic to the nazis and contemptuous of foreigners and minorities .
a visit with saddam hussein on the eve of the iraq war and a friendship with moammar gadhafi when libya was still on the international blacklist , as well as a recent comparison between u.s. president george bush and hitler , have cost him the support of party followers .
when the european union slapped temporary sanctions on austria to protest the fpö 's role in the governing coalition , haider got out of the limelight .
since handing over the party leadership , he 's tried to run things from the sidelines , but has instead alienated supporters and driven voters to other parties .
" i regret nothing and see no reason to change my political agendy , " haider told the associated press .
" for speaking plainly you are attacked by your political opponents .
then two or three years later , they suddenly agree with you . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria 's jörg haider fights for his future the alpine firebrand is fighting for survival .
he 's been busy pulling out his trademark populist tactics , but it might not be enough to get him reelected when his home state of carinthia goes to the polls on sunday .

up on the north sea a string of islands offers plenty of dunes and shore for beachcombing - and the archipelago is growing . germany 's north sea islands , particularly spiekeroog , borkum , nordeney and mellum , are growing , not only in popularity among tourists , but in actual size .
a new study conducted by the national park service in lower saxony shows that four of the eight islands are actually bigger today than they were 40 years ago .
between 1966 and 1997 the islands , which are located in the wattenmeer -lrb- mud flats -rrb- national park , increased in area as the sand dunes and salt water marshes expanded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial photo of the island wangeooge .
the growth was measured with aerial photos taken over the years .
the national park examined the images and recorded the differences throughout the decades .
one of the primary changes noted was that the eastern end of the four islands extended further and further into the sea .
the park service sited changes in the patterns of water currents which caused more silt to be washed up and deposited on the islands .
the so-called east frisian islands are surrounded by a fragile eco-system that is protected by the national park .
the islands themselves , except for the bird island mellum , are inhabited .
during the summer months , they are often overcrowded as germans from mainland lower saxony and hamburg flock to the extensive sandy beaches . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sylt : in winter , a mellower pleasure winter on the popular beach resort of sylt means icy grey waters under a dark sky , bracing sea air , heavy surf - and above all , more calm than in summer .

not long ago the world would n't have blinked when the german music industry handed out its echo awards .
but with stars like anastacia and pink gracing the stage , international audiences are starting to tune in to berlin . after the grammys and the brits , germany 's echo awards are the most important in the music industry .
for the 13th year running , honors were handed out in 26 categories from best international singer and band to best folk musician and best national newcomer .
more than 4,000 guests turned out on saturday for the gala event studded with star performances by pink , anastacia and kylie minogue .
for american singer anastacia , it was the first european show since recovering from cancer a year ago .
the real highlight of the evening , however , was the german rock group " wir sind helden " -lrb- we 're heroes -rrb- , which snatched up three awards as best new national radio act , best national newcomer overall and best new german video .
bildunterschrift : the german band " wir sind helden " won three awards for best new national act .

more than 4,000 guests turned out on saturday for the gala event studded with star performances by pink , anastacia and kylie minogue .
for american singer anastacia , it was the first european show since recovering from cancer a year ago .

austria 's outspoken nationalist jörg haider looks set to return to national prominence after winning a tough reelection as governor in the state of carinthia on sunday . one of europe 's most successful far-right politicians proved he could still pull in the votes with nationalist and xenophobic rhetoric and hold onto his seat as the governor in austria 's southern state of carinthia .
with 90 percent of ballots counted , jörg haider 's freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- garnered 42.4 percent of the vote , compared to just over 38 percent for the rival socialists and a lowly 11.6 percent for chancellor wolfgang schüssel 's conservative people 's party .
" nobody figured we had a chance again of being number one , " haider boasted to the austria press agency after the preliminary results came out .
national significance while the voting was restricted to carinthia , it 's significance extends all the way to vienna .
beyond seeking reelection as governor , haider made no secret of his plans to use a win in the southern state as a springboard for reclaiming national prominence .
" i want to revive the fpö from carinthia , " haider repeated in campaign speeches throughout the state .
nationally , however , the freedom party only enjoys about 10 percent support , compared to close to 30 percent four years ago when it first entered the federal government .
in salzburg , where austrians also voted in regional elections on sunday , the fpö received less than 10 percent of votes , suggesting that the success in carinthia owed more to haider 's personal charisma than a national revival for the party .
on the rebound ?
haider 's victory on sunday may be the demonstration of strength the populist politician needs to return to national party politics .
after stepping down from party leadership in 2000 and retreating to carinthia , haider seems to be itching to return to the bigger stage .
but many blame haider for the party 's national demise and will be watching closely to see what the fiery far-rightist has in store .
after skyrocketing into the national coalition four years ago with schüssel 's conservatives , haider quickly began chalking up bad marks for comments that sounded sympathetic to the nazis and contemptuous of foreigners and minorities .
a visit with saddam hussein on the eve of the iraq war and a friendship with moammar gadhafi when libya was still on the international blacklist , as well as a recent comparison between u.s. president george bush and hitler , have cost him the support of party followers .
when the european union slapped temporary sanctions on austria to protest the fpö 's role in the governing coalition , haider got out of the limelight .
since handing over the party leadership , he 's tried to run things from the sidelines , but has instead alienated supporters and driven voters to other parties .
" i regret nothing and see no reason to change my political agendy , " haider told the associated press .
" for speaking plainly you are attacked by your political opponents .
then two or three years later , they suddenly agree with you . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria 's jörg haider fights for his future the alpine firebrand is fighting for survival .

austria 's outspoken nationalist jörg haider looks set to return to national prominence after winning a tough reelection as governor in the state of carinthia on sunday . one of europe 's most successful far-right politicians proved he could still pull in the votes with nationalist and xenophobic rhetoric and hold onto his seat as the governor in austria 's southern state of carinthia .
with 90 percent of ballots counted , jörg haider 's freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- garnered 42.4 percent of the vote , compared to just over 38 percent for the rival socialists and a lowly 11.6 percent for chancellor wolfgang schüssel 's conservative people 's party .
" nobody figured we had a chance again of being number one , " haider boasted to the austria press agency after the preliminary results came out .
national significance while the voting was restricted to carinthia , it 's significance extends all the way to vienna .
beyond seeking reelection as governor , haider made no secret of his plans to use a win in the southern state as a springboard for reclaiming national prominence .
" i want to revive the fpö from carinthia , " haider repeated in campaign speeches throughout the state .
nationally , however , the freedom party only enjoys about 10 percent support , compared to close to 30 percent four years ago when it first entered the federal government .
in salzburg , where austrians also voted in regional elections on sunday , the fpö received less than 10 percent of votes , suggesting that the success in carinthia owed more to haider 's personal charisma than a national revival for the party .
on the rebound ?
haider 's victory on sunday may be the demonstration of strength the populist politician needs to return to national party politics .
after stepping down from party leadership in 2000 and retreating to carinthia , haider seems to be itching to return to the bigger stage .
but many blame haider for the party 's national demise and will be watching closely to see what the fiery far-rightist has in store .
after skyrocketing into the national coalition four years ago with schüssel 's conservatives , haider quickly began chalking up bad marks for comments that sounded sympathetic to the nazis and contemptuous of foreigners and minorities .
a visit with saddam hussein on the eve of the iraq war and a friendship with moammar gadhafi when libya was still on the international blacklist , as well as a recent comparison between u.s. president george bush and hitler , have cost him the support of party followers .
when the european union slapped temporary sanctions on austria to protest the fpö 's role in the governing coalition , haider got out of the limelight .
since handing over the party leadership , he 's tried to run things from the sidelines , but has instead alienated supporters and driven voters to other parties .
" i regret nothing and see no reason to change my political agendy , " haider told the associated press .

not long ago the world would n't have blinked when the german music industry handed out its echo awards .
but with stars like anastacia and pink gracing the stage , international audiences are starting to tune in to berlin . after the grammys and the brits , germany 's echo awards are the most important in the music industry .
for the 13th year running , honors were handed out in 26 categories from best international singer and band to best folk musician and best national newcomer .
more than 4,000 guests turned out on saturday for the gala event studded with star performances by pink , anastacia and kylie minogue .
for american singer anastacia , it was the first european show since recovering from cancer a year ago .
the real highlight of the evening , however , was the german rock group " wir sind helden " -lrb- we 're heroes -rrb- , which snatched up three awards as best new national radio act , best national newcomer overall and best new german video .
bildunterschrift : the german band " wir sind helden " won three awards for best new national act .
the berlin band 's record company , labels , even received an award for best marketing of a group .
in recognition of the honors , the group gave a spectacular performance of their hit song " denkmal " -lrb- monument -rrb- .
the fans are to thank best national male vocal artist was sasha , alias dick brave , who managed to beat out overnight " germany seeks the superstar " sensation daniel küblböck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvonne catterfeld rising starlet yvonne catterfeld won best german female vocal performer .
" i am really excited , i 'm just glowing .
the prize is always like getting something like feedback from the public , " she said after the awards ceremony .
indeed , the winners have only their fans to thank for an award at the echos .
nominations are based on record sales in germany for the past year .
international venue with 13 years to look back on , the echos have grown into a venue for big-name international acts .
and even if robbie williams and shania twain - voted best international male and female pop artists - did n't show up personally to pick up their awards , their absence did n't dampen the mood among the invited guests . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pushing for more pop ' auf deutsch ' english-language music dominates the airwaves in germany .

austria 's outspoken nationalist jörg haider looks set to return to national prominence after winning a tough reelection as governor in the state of carinthia on sunday . one of europe 's most successful far-right politicians proved he could still pull in the votes with nationalist and xenophobic rhetoric and hold onto his seat as the governor in austria 's southern state of carinthia .
with 90 percent of ballots counted , jörg haider 's freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- garnered 42.4 percent of the vote , compared to just over 38 percent for the rival socialists and a lowly 11.6 percent for chancellor wolfgang schüssel 's conservative people 's party .
" nobody figured we had a chance again of being number one , " haider boasted to the austria press agency after the preliminary results came out .
national significance while the voting was restricted to carinthia , it 's significance extends all the way to vienna .
beyond seeking reelection as governor , haider made no secret of his plans to use a win in the southern state as a springboard for reclaiming national prominence .
" i want to revive the fpö from carinthia , " haider repeated in campaign speeches throughout the state .
nationally , however , the freedom party only enjoys about 10 percent support , compared to close to 30 percent four years ago when it first entered the federal government .
in salzburg , where austrians also voted in regional elections on sunday , the fpö received less than 10 percent of votes , suggesting that the success in carinthia owed more to haider 's personal charisma than a national revival for the party .
on the rebound ?
haider 's victory on sunday may be the demonstration of strength the populist politician needs to return to national party politics .
after stepping down from party leadership in 2000 and retreating to carinthia , haider seems to be itching to return to the bigger stage .
but many blame haider for the party 's national demise and will be watching closely to see what the fiery far-rightist has in store .
after skyrocketing into the national coalition four years ago with schüssel 's conservatives , haider quickly began chalking up bad marks for comments that sounded sympathetic to the nazis and contemptuous of foreigners and minorities .
a visit with saddam hussein on the eve of the iraq war and a friendship with moammar gadhafi when libya was still on the international blacklist , as well as a recent comparison between u.s. president george bush and hitler , have cost him the support of party followers .
when the european union slapped temporary sanctions on austria to protest the fpö 's role in the governing coalition , haider got out of the limelight .
since handing over the party leadership , he 's tried to run things from the sidelines , but has instead alienated supporters and driven voters to other parties .
" i regret nothing and see no reason to change my political agendy , " haider told the associated press .
" for speaking plainly you are attacked by your political opponents .
then two or three years later , they suddenly agree with you . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria 's jörg haider fights for his future the alpine firebrand is fighting for survival .

not long ago the world would n't have blinked when the german music industry handed out its echo awards .
but with stars like anastacia and pink gracing the stage , international audiences are starting to tune in to berlin . after the grammys and the brits , germany 's echo awards are the most important in the music industry .
for the 13th year running , honors were handed out in 26 categories from best international singer and band to best folk musician and best national newcomer .
more than 4,000 guests turned out on saturday for the gala event studded with star performances by pink , anastacia and kylie minogue .
for american singer anastacia , it was the first european show since recovering from cancer a year ago .
the real highlight of the evening , however , was the german rock group " wir sind helden " -lrb- we 're heroes -rrb- , which snatched up three awards as best new national radio act , best national newcomer overall and best new german video .
bildunterschrift : the german band " wir sind helden " won three awards for best new national act .
the berlin band 's record company , labels , even received an award for best marketing of a group .
in recognition of the honors , the group gave a spectacular performance of their hit song " denkmal " -lrb- monument -rrb- .
the fans are to thank best national male vocal artist was sasha , alias dick brave , who managed to beat out overnight " germany seeks the superstar " sensation daniel küblböck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvonne catterfeld rising starlet yvonne catterfeld won best german female vocal performer .
" i am really excited , i 'm just glowing .
the prize is always like getting something like feedback from the public , " she said after the awards ceremony .
indeed , the winners have only their fans to thank for an award at the echos .
nominations are based on record sales in germany for the past year .
international venue with 13 years to look back on , the echos have grown into a venue for big-name international acts .
and even if robbie williams and shania twain - voted best international male and female pop artists - did n't show up personally to pick up their awards , their absence did n't dampen the mood among the invited guests . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pushing for more pop ' auf deutsch ' english-language music dominates the airwaves in germany .
but some are calling for a radio quota that would force stations to play more german songs , saying it would help homegrown artists and the local music industry .

austria 's outspoken nationalist jörg haider looks set to return to national prominence after winning a tough reelection as governor in the state of carinthia on sunday . one of europe 's most successful far-right politicians proved he could still pull in the votes with nationalist and xenophobic rhetoric and hold onto his seat as the governor in austria 's southern state of carinthia .
with 90 percent of ballots counted , jörg haider 's freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- garnered 42.4 percent of the vote , compared to just over 38 percent for the rival socialists and a lowly 11.6 percent for chancellor wolfgang schüssel 's conservative people 's party .
" nobody figured we had a chance again of being number one , " haider boasted to the austria press agency after the preliminary results came out .
national significance while the voting was restricted to carinthia , it 's significance extends all the way to vienna .
beyond seeking reelection as governor , haider made no secret of his plans to use a win in the southern state as a springboard for reclaiming national prominence .
" i want to revive the fpö from carinthia , " haider repeated in campaign speeches throughout the state .
nationally , however , the freedom party only enjoys about 10 percent support , compared to close to 30 percent four years ago when it first entered the federal government .
in salzburg , where austrians also voted in regional elections on sunday , the fpö received less than 10 percent of votes , suggesting that the success in carinthia owed more to haider 's personal charisma than a national revival for the party .
on the rebound ?
haider 's victory on sunday may be the demonstration of strength the populist politician needs to return to national party politics .
after stepping down from party leadership in 2000 and retreating to carinthia , haider seems to be itching to return to the bigger stage .
but many blame haider for the party 's national demise and will be watching closely to see what the fiery far-rightist has in store .
after skyrocketing into the national coalition four years ago with schüssel 's conservatives , haider quickly began chalking up bad marks for comments that sounded sympathetic to the nazis and contemptuous of foreigners and minorities .
a visit with saddam hussein on the eve of the iraq war and a friendship with moammar gadhafi when libya was still on the international blacklist , as well as a recent comparison between u.s. president george bush and hitler , have cost him the support of party followers .
when the european union slapped temporary sanctions on austria to protest the fpö 's role in the governing coalition , haider got out of the limelight .
since handing over the party leadership , he 's tried to run things from the sidelines , but has instead alienated supporters and driven voters to other parties .
" i regret nothing and see no reason to change my political agendy , " haider told the associated press .
" for speaking plainly you are attacked by your political opponents .

austria 's outspoken nationalist jörg haider looks set to return to national prominence after winning a tough reelection as governor in the state of carinthia on sunday . one of europe 's most successful far-right politicians proved he could still pull in the votes with nationalist and xenophobic rhetoric and hold onto his seat as the governor in austria 's southern state of carinthia .
with 90 percent of ballots counted , jörg haider 's freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- garnered 42.4 percent of the vote , compared to just over 38 percent for the rival socialists and a lowly 11.6 percent for chancellor wolfgang schüssel 's conservative people 's party .
" nobody figured we had a chance again of being number one , " haider boasted to the austria press agency after the preliminary results came out .
national significance while the voting was restricted to carinthia , it 's significance extends all the way to vienna .
beyond seeking reelection as governor , haider made no secret of his plans to use a win in the southern state as a springboard for reclaiming national prominence .
" i want to revive the fpö from carinthia , " haider repeated in campaign speeches throughout the state .
nationally , however , the freedom party only enjoys about 10 percent support , compared to close to 30 percent four years ago when it first entered the federal government .
in salzburg , where austrians also voted in regional elections on sunday , the fpö received less than 10 percent of votes , suggesting that the success in carinthia owed more to haider 's personal charisma than a national revival for the party .
on the rebound ?
haider 's victory on sunday may be the demonstration of strength the populist politician needs to return to national party politics .
after stepping down from party leadership in 2000 and retreating to carinthia , haider seems to be itching to return to the bigger stage .
but many blame haider for the party 's national demise and will be watching closely to see what the fiery far-rightist has in store .
after skyrocketing into the national coalition four years ago with schüssel 's conservatives , haider quickly began chalking up bad marks for comments that sounded sympathetic to the nazis and contemptuous of foreigners and minorities .
a visit with saddam hussein on the eve of the iraq war and a friendship with moammar gadhafi when libya was still on the international blacklist , as well as a recent comparison between u.s. president george bush and hitler , have cost him the support of party followers .
when the european union slapped temporary sanctions on austria to protest the fpö 's role in the governing coalition , haider got out of the limelight .
since handing over the party leadership , he 's tried to run things from the sidelines , but has instead alienated supporters and driven voters to other parties .
" i regret nothing and see no reason to change my political agendy , " haider told the associated press .
" for speaking plainly you are attacked by your political opponents .
then two or three years later , they suddenly agree with you . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria 's jörg haider fights for his future the alpine firebrand is fighting for survival .

from a new tax policy , to changes in labor law and wage negotiations , members of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , agreed in principle to a common reform position .
however , the issues of loosening job protection laws and relaxing rules on nationwide wage deals proved a sticking point for more social-minded members in the parties ' left wing .
the plan to remove laws protecting workers from job dismissal during their first four years of employment " is way over the top , " said cdu deputy party chairman christoph böhr .
" the plan takes advantage of the miserable state of economy to attack workers ' rights , " proclaimed the chairman of the christian democratic employee 's association , hermann-josef arentz .
but csu leader edmund stoiber and the party 's secretary general , markus söder , defended the proposals as the best means to create more employment opportunities .
" socially fair is whatever creates jobs , " söder told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
the ruling social democrats joined forces with the trade unions in criticizing the opposition 's plans as a " cold and brutal " attack on german society . more briefs 06.03.2004 -pipe- " passion of christ " not suitable for children 06.03.2004 -pipe- budget cuts threaten cultural institutions abroad 06.03.2004 -pipe- selection of german president is " humiliating " 05.03.2004 -pipe- schröder casts ' bild zeitung ' aside 05.03.2004 -pipe- the great german bunny count 05.03.2004 -pipe- kohl thinks memoirs will set record straight 05.03.2004 -pipe- germany refuses to foot bill for brothel visits 05.03.2004 -pipe- schröder , prodi voice optimism on eu constitution radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

austria 's outspoken nationalist jörg haider looks set to return to national prominence after winning a tough reelection as governor in the state of carinthia on sunday . one of europe 's most successful far-right politicians proved he could still pull in the votes with nationalist and xenophobic rhetoric and hold onto his seat as the governor in austria 's southern state of carinthia .
with 90 percent of ballots counted , jörg haider 's freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- garnered 42.4 percent of the vote , compared to just over 38 percent for the rival socialists and a lowly 11.6 percent for chancellor wolfgang schüssel 's conservative people 's party .
" nobody figured we had a chance again of being number one , " haider boasted to the austria press agency after the preliminary results came out .
national significance while the voting was restricted to carinthia , it 's significance extends all the way to vienna .
beyond seeking reelection as governor , haider made no secret of his plans to use a win in the southern state as a springboard for reclaiming national prominence .
" i want to revive the fpö from carinthia , " haider repeated in campaign speeches throughout the state .
nationally , however , the freedom party only enjoys about 10 percent support , compared to close to 30 percent four years ago when it first entered the federal government .
in salzburg , where austrians also voted in regional elections on sunday , the fpö received less than 10 percent of votes , suggesting that the success in carinthia owed more to haider 's personal charisma than a national revival for the party .
on the rebound ?
haider 's victory on sunday may be the demonstration of strength the populist politician needs to return to national party politics .
after stepping down from party leadership in 2000 and retreating to carinthia , haider seems to be itching to return to the bigger stage .
but many blame haider for the party 's national demise and will be watching closely to see what the fiery far-rightist has in store .
after skyrocketing into the national coalition four years ago with schüssel 's conservatives , haider quickly began chalking up bad marks for comments that sounded sympathetic to the nazis and contemptuous of foreigners and minorities .
a visit with saddam hussein on the eve of the iraq war and a friendship with moammar gadhafi when libya was still on the international blacklist , as well as a recent comparison between u.s. president george bush and hitler , have cost him the support of party followers .
when the european union slapped temporary sanctions on austria to protest the fpö 's role in the governing coalition , haider got out of the limelight .
since handing over the party leadership , he 's tried to run things from the sidelines , but has instead alienated supporters and driven voters to other parties .
" i regret nothing and see no reason to change my political agendy , " haider told the associated press .
" for speaking plainly you are attacked by your political opponents .

the 61-year old stepped down from his position as managing director of the imf last week to pursue a candidacy as the country 's president .
he was nominated by the conservative opposition , which holds the majority in the legislative assembly that votes on incumbent president johannes rau 's successor .

austria 's outspoken nationalist jörg haider looks set to return to national prominence after winning a tough reelection as governor in the state of carinthia on sunday . one of europe 's most successful far-right politicians proved he could still pull in the votes with nationalist and xenophobic rhetoric and hold onto his seat as the governor in austria 's southern state of carinthia .
with 90 percent of ballots counted , jörg haider 's freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- garnered 42.4 percent of the vote , compared to just over 38 percent for the rival socialists and a lowly 11.6 percent for chancellor wolfgang schüssel 's conservative people 's party .
" nobody figured we had a chance again of being number one , " haider boasted to the austria press agency after the preliminary results came out .
national significance while the voting was restricted to carinthia , it 's significance extends all the way to vienna .
beyond seeking reelection as governor , haider made no secret of his plans to use a win in the southern state as a springboard for reclaiming national prominence .
" i want to revive the fpö from carinthia , " haider repeated in campaign speeches throughout the state .
nationally , however , the freedom party only enjoys about 10 percent support , compared to close to 30 percent four years ago when it first entered the federal government .
in salzburg , where austrians also voted in regional elections on sunday , the fpö received less than 10 percent of votes , suggesting that the success in carinthia owed more to haider 's personal charisma than a national revival for the party .
on the rebound ?
haider 's victory on sunday may be the demonstration of strength the populist politician needs to return to national party politics .
after stepping down from party leadership in 2000 and retreating to carinthia , haider seems to be itching to return to the bigger stage .
but many blame haider for the party 's national demise and will be watching closely to see what the fiery far-rightist has in store .
after skyrocketing into the national coalition four years ago with schüssel 's conservatives , haider quickly began chalking up bad marks for comments that sounded sympathetic to the nazis and contemptuous of foreigners and minorities .
a visit with saddam hussein on the eve of the iraq war and a friendship with moammar gadhafi when libya was still on the international blacklist , as well as a recent comparison between u.s. president george bush and hitler , have cost him the support of party followers .
when the european union slapped temporary sanctions on austria to protest the fpö 's role in the governing coalition , haider got out of the limelight .
since handing over the party leadership , he 's tried to run things from the sidelines , but has instead alienated supporters and driven voters to other parties .
" i regret nothing and see no reason to change my political agendy , " haider told the associated press .
" for speaking plainly you are attacked by your political opponents .

for the 13th year running , honors were handed out in 26 categories from best international singer and band to best folk musician and best national newcomer .
more than 4,000 guests turned out on saturday for the gala event studded with star performances by pink , anastacia and kylie minogue .
for american singer anastacia , it was the first european show since recovering from cancer a year ago .

the secretary of the st piran project , eileen carter , said the church was a vital part of cornish heritage .
the replica currach is made using traditional methods " the oratory is the centre of cornish culture and heritage and we believe it should be reclaimed for the people of cornwall .
" it is an icon and it 's something we have to get excavated and cared for in the future . "
the dunes march is the biggest event of the st piran-tide calendar .
on friday , hundreds of people marched through the centre of truro to mark the actual saints day , but more people are expected on sunday .
the procession will makes its way through the dunes , stopping at the celtic cross and the oratory .
along the way a three-part play , illustrating the life of st piran , will be performed .
perran beach is where st piran is said to have come ashore in the sixth century , having made the journey from ireland in a currach .
