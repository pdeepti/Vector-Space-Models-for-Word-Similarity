she asked for the country 's forgiveness . " we germans recognize our historical , political , moral and ethical responsibility and guilt , " the development minister said saturday , choking back tears .
wieczorek-zeul was in namibia to participate in a service commemorating the anniversary of the battle of warterberg 100 years ago .
during the fight , ín what was then the colonial german southwest africa , german soldiers are said to have forced the surviving herero into the omaheke desert and blocked access to all water sources .
thousands died a painful death from starvation and thirst .
between 45,000 and 65,000 herero are believed to have been killed as well as 10,000 from the nama tribe .
german gen. lothar von trotha said at the time he would " wipe them out with rivers of blood . "
historians have described this policy as one of " blatant terrorism " and " shocking brutality . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul " i respectfully commemorate your ancestors who died in the fight against their german oppressors , " wieczorek-zeul told several thousand herero people who gathered at the site of the battle .
" blinded by colonial delusion , " she said , germans brought " violence , discrimination , racism and destruction " to the country .
minister : today it would have been genocide today , she said , the crimes that took place a hundred years ago would have been defined as genocide , and von trotha would have been brought before a criminal tribunal .
" in the name of our common lord , i ask for your forgiveness , " she said , in a statement that was the most far-reaching admission of guilt germany has yet given .
her comments were greeted with light applause from the audience .
but many herero have called on germany to issue an explicit apology for the massacre .
but wieczorek-zeul said that everything she said in her speech should be seen as an apology for the crimes committed under german leadership .
namibia 's minister of lands , hifikepunye pohamba , who is also expected to become the country 's next president , said he accepted the apology " in the name of the namibian people . "
no official apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german marines gather in namibia in 1904 before launching a full-fledged assault on the herero people .
an official apology from berlin as well as the classification of the colonial war as genocide was one of the main demands the herero people had made of the german government .
one herero group is currently suing berlin in united states courts for damages in the billions of dollars .
referring to the lawsuits during a visit to namibia in october , german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to offer an apology that could be used to bolster the case for reparations .
on saturday , wieczorek-zeul pledged further development aid for namibia as well as support for land reforms .
calculated on a per-capita basis , namibia currently receives more development aid from germany than any other african country .
since the country 's independence from south africa in 1990 , it has received more than € 500 million -lrb- $ 619 million -rrb- in german aid .
calls for reconciliation both wieczorek-zeul and representatives of the heroro have called for reconciliation between the descendents of the victims and culprits of the uprising .
" we recall with tears the victims of our ancestors .
today we should make right what was made wrong a hundred years ago , " herero bishop kameeta said .
he called on all namibians to reconcile with themselves and with the descendants of those responsible for the acts of cruelty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero woman wears her traditional headdress .
more than 3,000 herero , nama and namibians of german origin gathered in okarara at the foot of the warterberg for saturday 's memorial service .
the day 's events also included reenactments of the fateful battle .
in 1904 , the herero launched a major uprising against their german colonial masters , killing more than 100 germans .
the uprising led germany 's von trotha to order to decimation of the entire herero population .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.08.2004 happiness begins after work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be it barbequeing , hanging out or pursuing a hobby , germans love their free time longer work hours and shorter vacation - or part time work and more flexibility ?
in germany , many people are rethinking their relationship between work and free time .
but what 's the recipe for success ? most people draw positive emotions and self-affirmation from their work .
it 's also where they place the bulk of their energy .
german researchers recently delved into this seeming paradox and came up with some interesting results .
nowadays , more than ever before , having fun with friends , leisure time and free time is more highly valued than ever before .
even professionals in the it sector , once known as people who burned the midnight oil , have discovered the concept of leisure time .
where are the workaholics ?
munich researchers contracted by the hans böckler foundation recently conducted interviews with software developers , consultants , executives and administrative workers from it companies .
the results ?
people these days are seeking a greater division between their work and private lives .
spending a long evening or even an entire night in front of the screen has fallen out of vogue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people have abandoned entrepreneurship for more stabile working hours others have long appreciated the art of shutting down their computers and leaving work promptly at the end of the day , like angelika .
after years of burning the candle at both ends , the former entrepreneur gave up her independent job to take up a position as an accountant , where she has fixed office hours .
now , angelika 's work gives her the opportunity to use her time a little better .
" my favorite thing is to meet up with nice people and entertain myself , " she says .
" i think it 's great to just be together with other people , but i also need lots of quiet time for myself and like to stay home , too , " the 50-year-old said .
angelika is far from alone .
recent studies have pointed to the new trend of a " comfort culture " among germans .
being comfortable at home is the top priority for most germans surveyed .
in one study , 68 percent of those surveyed said they were satisfied at home if they had a television .
forty percent said all they needed was a radio to be content .
another 46 percent said a newspaper and good food was all they needed .
today 's modern , almost unavoidable amount of possibilities during one 's free time are attracting a lot more people towards leisure - a word that for a long time seemed almost forgotten in germany .
but few will admit that - even today .
" for a long time , i thought , i absolutely have to have a hobby , " said angelika .
" i thought about it a lot with my friends but still found myself unable to find anything .
we were feeling some pretty low self-esteem because we had n't found a hobby .
but then we noticed that we did n't even need one .
we 're happy just wasting our free time - and that 's just fine . "
hobbies can be expensive , but not stressful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at a tango class in münster but some still let the pressure to peform control their free time .
inline skating on mondays , jogging on tuesdays and thursdays and then maybe a dance class and an english brush up course once a week .
however , people who lead that kind of lifestyle must also organize their lives exactly as they do their jobs , and that has its own set of limitations .
on the scale between idleness and someone who pursues many activities during his free time , 48-year-old dental technician norbert says he falls somewhere in between .
" my free time is really valuable to me and i have to admit that i also work to help finance some of my hobbies , " he said .
" i get a certain amount of fulfillment out of my job because i feel a lot of responsibility .

in germany , many people are rethinking their relationship between work and free time .
but what 's the recipe for success ? most people draw positive emotions and self-affirmation from their work .
it 's also where they place the bulk of their energy .
german researchers recently delved into this seeming paradox and came up with some interesting results .
nowadays , more than ever before , having fun with friends , leisure time and free time is more highly valued than ever before .
even professionals in the it sector , once known as people who burned the midnight oil , have discovered the concept of leisure time .
where are the workaholics ?
munich researchers contracted by the hans böckler foundation recently conducted interviews with software developers , consultants , executives and administrative workers from it companies .
the results ?
people these days are seeking a greater division between their work and private lives .
spending a long evening or even an entire night in front of the screen has fallen out of vogue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people have abandoned entrepreneurship for more stabile working hours others have long appreciated the art of shutting down their computers and leaving work promptly at the end of the day , like angelika .
after years of burning the candle at both ends , the former entrepreneur gave up her independent job to take up a position as an accountant , where she has fixed office hours .
now , angelika 's work gives her the opportunity to use her time a little better .
" my favorite thing is to meet up with nice people and entertain myself , " she says .
" i think it 's great to just be together with other people , but i also need lots of quiet time for myself and like to stay home , too , " the 50-year-old said .
angelika is far from alone .
recent studies have pointed to the new trend of a " comfort culture " among germans .
being comfortable at home is the top priority for most germans surveyed .
in one study , 68 percent of those surveyed said they were satisfied at home if they had a television .
forty percent said all they needed was a radio to be content .
another 46 percent said a newspaper and good food was all they needed .
today 's modern , almost unavoidable amount of possibilities during one 's free time are attracting a lot more people towards leisure - a word that for a long time seemed almost forgotten in germany .
but few will admit that - even today .
" for a long time , i thought , i absolutely have to have a hobby , " said angelika .
" i thought about it a lot with my friends but still found myself unable to find anything .
we were feeling some pretty low self-esteem because we had n't found a hobby .
but then we noticed that we did n't even need one .
we 're happy just wasting our free time - and that 's just fine . "
hobbies can be expensive , but not stressful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at a tango class in münster but some still let the pressure to peform control their free time .
inline skating on mondays , jogging on tuesdays and thursdays and then maybe a dance class and an english brush up course once a week .
however , people who lead that kind of lifestyle must also organize their lives exactly as they do their jobs , and that has its own set of limitations .
on the scale between idleness and someone who pursues many activities during his free time , 48-year-old dental technician norbert says he falls somewhere in between .
" my free time is really valuable to me and i have to admit that i also work to help finance some of my hobbies , " he said .

" my free time is really valuable to me and i have to admit that i also work to help finance some of my hobbies , " he said .
" i get a certain amount of fulfillment out of my job because i feel a lot of responsibility .
but i can also experience that in my free time . "
at times , norbert says he would like to do more to live out his creative side .
he 's already in a part-time rock band .
but he 's also aware that working as a professional musician he would also experience the same kind of work pressure he has as a dental technician .
the exception : hobby as career others have gone to the other extreme and turned their hobbies into careers .
but with growing labor market crisis , that 's mostly the exception .
take cabaret artist stefan reusch , for example .
in his life , the borders between work and play are completely blurred .
" that 's not really normal free time , " he says .
" when i watch television at night , it 's also part of my work - at least partly . "
the evening news often includes items about chancellor gerhard schröder or opposition leader angela merkel that reusch will later comment on in his comedy show .
" you 're always watching it with one professional ear listening , " too .
if reusch is able to work three days and then have a long break , then he 's quite happy .
to be able to go jogging now and then , ride his bike or play a bit of soccer - there 's no lack of free time activity for reusch on the days he does n't have any work .
" i 'm not saying these are the best ways of using my free time or that i recharge my energy this way , " he says .
" you can also muddle through your spare time . "
most germans do n't want pressure reusch already knows that most germans do n't ideally like to mix their work and free time is .
he also understands the kind of pressure many fall under both before and after work .
" our society is n't ill because of a division of free time and career , rather because both are carried out with such fear .
people jog so they wo n't get too fat or look too old .
they do n't jog for fun , " reusch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for example , if someone works too much during the week , then that person is under more pressure to have fun on saturdays or during free time .
younger people then tend to party through the whole weekend .
fathers tend to do more with their children during that time .
" that means that when the weather is bad and people sit at home , he 's still under pressure and has no way to burn off the steam , " said reusche .
" i think that 's unhealthy and not very nice . " monika hoegen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

after scoring two wonderful goals through their midfielders michael ballack and sebastian deisler , bayern were looking for more of the same from their marauding players , packing the midfield with five stars and leaving roy makaay up front alone for the visit of hertha bsc berlin .
berlin , denied a victory at bochum last week , were looking to get into winning ways in the olympic stadium and employed fredi bobic as a second striker beside wichniarek , with brazilian flair backing them up in marcelinho and gilberto .
the first half started off as if a classic would unfold with both sides piling forward in wave after wave of attack in search of the early break-through .
the frantic start also brought the first signature tackles from the ' hard men ' of both teams letting their opponents know they were there .
thorsten frings for munich and niko kovac of berlin were both involved in heavy challenges and this physicality , rather than the attacking ideas of the few minutes , would later become a dominant theme of the first half .
samba style rocks bayern berlin settled quicker and pegged the bavarians back for a good ten minutes before the deadlock was broken .
a searching ball into the bayern area appeared to catch a berlin attacker offside but the flag and whistle never came and it was left to marcelinho to lash a wicked shot past oliver kahn from close range .
bayern went in search of parity straight away but soon their ideas petered out with star midfielder deisler the main culprit in the profilgacy which was to dominate munich 's first half .
time and time again the young midfielder sent high balls over the defense in search of players who were n't there or skied speculative long range efforts over the bar , sending the ball scuttling across the athetics track behind the berlin goal .
match becomes a battle in their frustration , the bayern players began a physical game which resulted in a flurry of free-kicks and cards for both teams as the game lost rhythm and shape .
berlin chose to defend the narrow lead , forcing bayern to take the game to them .
however , the creative flair of bayern 's stars seemed dampened by the resilience of their opponents and frustration crept in .
the second half started as a dream for bayern .
roque santa cruz replaced ze roberto at the break and added another attacking option to the bayern team .
his impact was immediate .
latching onto a stunning pass by mehmet scholl , santa cruz charged into the area and delivered a pin-point cross for roy makaay to equalize .
home side pushes for winner bayern dominated the next twenty minutes of the half with the midfield pushing up in a red and white line behind the two strikers as they pushed for the winner .
but berlin were not out of the game and woke up to have their own chances as the agme wore on .
the home team , however , were single-minded in their approach and had many good efforts - and even more terrible , wasted chances - to go ahead .
the best falling to roy makaay in the final minute after bayern had been reduced to 10 men .
in the end , the grinding , physical nature of the game was detrimental to the spectacle and had worn the players down by the time it came to make a difference .
berlin looked happy with their draw but munich looked frustrated by their own wasted chances to push for the top spot in the bundesliga .

after scoring two wonderful goals through their midfielders michael ballack and sebastian deisler , bayern were looking for more of the same from their marauding players , packing the midfield with five stars and leaving roy makaay up front alone for the visit of hertha bsc berlin .
berlin , denied a victory at bochum last week , were looking to get into winning ways in the olympic stadium and employed fredi bobic as a second striker beside wichniarek , with brazilian flair backing them up in marcelinho and gilberto .
the first half started off as if a classic would unfold with both sides piling forward in wave after wave of attack in search of the early break-through .
the frantic start also brought the first signature tackles from the ' hard men ' of both teams letting their opponents know they were there .
thorsten frings for munich and niko kovac of berlin were both involved in heavy challenges and this physicality , rather than the attacking ideas of the few minutes , would later become a dominant theme of the first half .
samba style rocks bayern berlin settled quicker and pegged the bavarians back for a good ten minutes before the deadlock was broken .
a searching ball into the bayern area appeared to catch a berlin attacker offside but the flag and whistle never came and it was left to marcelinho to lash a wicked shot past oliver kahn from close range .
bayern went in search of parity straight away but soon their ideas petered out with star midfielder deisler the main culprit in the profilgacy which was to dominate munich 's first half .
time and time again the young midfielder sent high balls over the defense in search of players who were n't there or skied speculative long range efforts over the bar , sending the ball scuttling across the athetics track behind the berlin goal .
match becomes a battle in their frustration , the bayern players began a physical game which resulted in a flurry of free-kicks and cards for both teams as the game lost rhythm and shape .
berlin chose to defend the narrow lead , forcing bayern to take the game to them .
however , the creative flair of bayern 's stars seemed dampened by the resilience of their opponents and frustration crept in .
the second half started as a dream for bayern .
roque santa cruz replaced ze roberto at the break and added another attacking option to the bayern team .
his impact was immediate .
latching onto a stunning pass by mehmet scholl , santa cruz charged into the area and delivered a pin-point cross for roy makaay to equalize .
home side pushes for winner bayern dominated the next twenty minutes of the half with the midfield pushing up in a red and white line behind the two strikers as they pushed for the winner .
but berlin were not out of the game and woke up to have their own chances as the agme wore on .
the home team , however , were single-minded in their approach and had many good efforts - and even more terrible , wasted chances - to go ahead .
the best falling to roy makaay in the final minute after bayern had been reduced to 10 men .
in the end , the grinding , physical nature of the game was detrimental to the spectacle and had worn the players down by the time it came to make a difference .

she asked for the country 's forgiveness . " we germans recognize our historical , political , moral and ethical responsibility and guilt , " the development minister said saturday , choking back tears .
wieczorek-zeul was in namibia to participate in a service commemorating the anniversary of the battle of warterberg 100 years ago .
during the fight , ín what was then the colonial german southwest africa , german soldiers are said to have forced the surviving herero into the omaheke desert and blocked access to all water sources .
thousands died a painful death from starvation and thirst .
between 45,000 and 65,000 herero are believed to have been killed as well as 10,000 from the nama tribe .
german gen. lothar von trotha said at the time he would " wipe them out with rivers of blood . "
historians have described this policy as one of " blatant terrorism " and " shocking brutality . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul " i respectfully commemorate your ancestors who died in the fight against their german oppressors , " wieczorek-zeul told several thousand herero people who gathered at the site of the battle .
" blinded by colonial delusion , " she said , germans brought " violence , discrimination , racism and destruction " to the country .
minister : today it would have been genocide today , she said , the crimes that took place a hundred years ago would have been defined as genocide , and von trotha would have been brought before a criminal tribunal .
" in the name of our common lord , i ask for your forgiveness , " she said , in a statement that was the most far-reaching admission of guilt germany has yet given .
her comments were greeted with light applause from the audience .
but many herero have called on germany to issue an explicit apology for the massacre .
but wieczorek-zeul said that everything she said in her speech should be seen as an apology for the crimes committed under german leadership .
namibia 's minister of lands , hifikepunye pohamba , who is also expected to become the country 's next president , said he accepted the apology " in the name of the namibian people . "
no official apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german marines gather in namibia in 1904 before launching a full-fledged assault on the herero people .
an official apology from berlin as well as the classification of the colonial war as genocide was one of the main demands the herero people had made of the german government .
one herero group is currently suing berlin in united states courts for damages in the billions of dollars .
referring to the lawsuits during a visit to namibia in october , german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to offer an apology that could be used to bolster the case for reparations .
on saturday , wieczorek-zeul pledged further development aid for namibia as well as support for land reforms .
calculated on a per-capita basis , namibia currently receives more development aid from germany than any other african country .
since the country 's independence from south africa in 1990 , it has received more than € 500 million -lrb- $ 619 million -rrb- in german aid .
calls for reconciliation both wieczorek-zeul and representatives of the heroro have called for reconciliation between the descendents of the victims and culprits of the uprising .
" we recall with tears the victims of our ancestors .
today we should make right what was made wrong a hundred years ago , " herero bishop kameeta said .
he called on all namibians to reconcile with themselves and with the descendants of those responsible for the acts of cruelty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero woman wears her traditional headdress .
more than 3,000 herero , nama and namibians of german origin gathered in okarara at the foot of the warterberg for saturday 's memorial service .
the day 's events also included reenactments of the fateful battle .
in 1904 , the herero launched a major uprising against their german colonial masters , killing more than 100 germans .
the uprising led germany 's von trotha to order to decimation of the entire herero population .
fortunately , he did not succeed , and today there are again 120,000 herero and 60,000 nama minorities in the country . dw staff -lrb- dsl / afp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a painful reminder of german colonialism wednesday marks the 100th anniversary of germany 's brutal crushing of an ethnic uprising in namibia .

after scoring two wonderful goals through their midfielders michael ballack and sebastian deisler , bayern were looking for more of the same from their marauding players , packing the midfield with five stars and leaving roy makaay up front alone for the visit of hertha bsc berlin .
berlin , denied a victory at bochum last week , were looking to get into winning ways in the olympic stadium and employed fredi bobic as a second striker beside wichniarek , with brazilian flair backing them up in marcelinho and gilberto .
the first half started off as if a classic would unfold with both sides piling forward in wave after wave of attack in search of the early break-through .
the frantic start also brought the first signature tackles from the ' hard men ' of both teams letting their opponents know they were there .
thorsten frings for munich and niko kovac of berlin were both involved in heavy challenges and this physicality , rather than the attacking ideas of the few minutes , would later become a dominant theme of the first half .
samba style rocks bayern berlin settled quicker and pegged the bavarians back for a good ten minutes before the deadlock was broken .
a searching ball into the bayern area appeared to catch a berlin attacker offside but the flag and whistle never came and it was left to marcelinho to lash a wicked shot past oliver kahn from close range .
bayern went in search of parity straight away but soon their ideas petered out with star midfielder deisler the main culprit in the profilgacy which was to dominate munich 's first half .
time and time again the young midfielder sent high balls over the defense in search of players who were n't there or skied speculative long range efforts over the bar , sending the ball scuttling across the athetics track behind the berlin goal .
match becomes a battle in their frustration , the bayern players began a physical game which resulted in a flurry of free-kicks and cards for both teams as the game lost rhythm and shape .
berlin chose to defend the narrow lead , forcing bayern to take the game to them .
however , the creative flair of bayern 's stars seemed dampened by the resilience of their opponents and frustration crept in .
the second half started as a dream for bayern .
roque santa cruz replaced ze roberto at the break and added another attacking option to the bayern team .
his impact was immediate .
latching onto a stunning pass by mehmet scholl , santa cruz charged into the area and delivered a pin-point cross for roy makaay to equalize .
home side pushes for winner bayern dominated the next twenty minutes of the half with the midfield pushing up in a red and white line behind the two strikers as they pushed for the winner .
but berlin were not out of the game and woke up to have their own chances as the agme wore on .
the home team , however , were single-minded in their approach and had many good efforts - and even more terrible , wasted chances - to go ahead .
the best falling to roy makaay in the final minute after bayern had been reduced to 10 men .
in the end , the grinding , physical nature of the game was detrimental to the spectacle and had worn the players down by the time it came to make a difference .
berlin looked happy with their draw but munich looked frustrated by their own wasted chances to push for the top spot in the bundesliga .

after scoring two wonderful goals through their midfielders michael ballack and sebastian deisler , bayern were looking for more of the same from their marauding players , packing the midfield with five stars and leaving roy makaay up front alone for the visit of hertha bsc berlin .
berlin , denied a victory at bochum last week , were looking to get into winning ways in the olympic stadium and employed fredi bobic as a second striker beside wichniarek , with brazilian flair backing them up in marcelinho and gilberto .
the first half started off as if a classic would unfold with both sides piling forward in wave after wave of attack in search of the early break-through .
the frantic start also brought the first signature tackles from the ' hard men ' of both teams letting their opponents know they were there .
thorsten frings for munich and niko kovac of berlin were both involved in heavy challenges and this physicality , rather than the attacking ideas of the few minutes , would later become a dominant theme of the first half .
samba style rocks bayern berlin settled quicker and pegged the bavarians back for a good ten minutes before the deadlock was broken .
a searching ball into the bayern area appeared to catch a berlin attacker offside but the flag and whistle never came and it was left to marcelinho to lash a wicked shot past oliver kahn from close range .
bayern went in search of parity straight away but soon their ideas petered out with star midfielder deisler the main culprit in the profilgacy which was to dominate munich 's first half .
time and time again the young midfielder sent high balls over the defense in search of players who were n't there or skied speculative long range efforts over the bar , sending the ball scuttling across the athetics track behind the berlin goal .
match becomes a battle in their frustration , the bayern players began a physical game which resulted in a flurry of free-kicks and cards for both teams as the game lost rhythm and shape .
berlin chose to defend the narrow lead , forcing bayern to take the game to them .
however , the creative flair of bayern 's stars seemed dampened by the resilience of their opponents and frustration crept in .
the second half started as a dream for bayern .
roque santa cruz replaced ze roberto at the break and added another attacking option to the bayern team .
his impact was immediate .
latching onto a stunning pass by mehmet scholl , santa cruz charged into the area and delivered a pin-point cross for roy makaay to equalize .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.08.2004 happiness begins after work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be it barbequeing , hanging out or pursuing a hobby , germans love their free time longer work hours and shorter vacation - or part time work and more flexibility ?
in germany , many people are rethinking their relationship between work and free time .
but what 's the recipe for success ? most people draw positive emotions and self-affirmation from their work .
it 's also where they place the bulk of their energy .
german researchers recently delved into this seeming paradox and came up with some interesting results .
nowadays , more than ever before , having fun with friends , leisure time and free time is more highly valued than ever before .
even professionals in the it sector , once known as people who burned the midnight oil , have discovered the concept of leisure time .
where are the workaholics ?
munich researchers contracted by the hans böckler foundation recently conducted interviews with software developers , consultants , executives and administrative workers from it companies .
the results ?
people these days are seeking a greater division between their work and private lives .
spending a long evening or even an entire night in front of the screen has fallen out of vogue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people have abandoned entrepreneurship for more stabile working hours others have long appreciated the art of shutting down their computers and leaving work promptly at the end of the day , like angelika .
after years of burning the candle at both ends , the former entrepreneur gave up her independent job to take up a position as an accountant , where she has fixed office hours .
now , angelika 's work gives her the opportunity to use her time a little better .
" my favorite thing is to meet up with nice people and entertain myself , " she says .
" i think it 's great to just be together with other people , but i also need lots of quiet time for myself and like to stay home , too , " the 50-year-old said .
angelika is far from alone .
recent studies have pointed to the new trend of a " comfort culture " among germans .
being comfortable at home is the top priority for most germans surveyed .
in one study , 68 percent of those surveyed said they were satisfied at home if they had a television .
forty percent said all they needed was a radio to be content .
another 46 percent said a newspaper and good food was all they needed .
today 's modern , almost unavoidable amount of possibilities during one 's free time are attracting a lot more people towards leisure - a word that for a long time seemed almost forgotten in germany .
but few will admit that - even today .
" for a long time , i thought , i absolutely have to have a hobby , " said angelika .
" i thought about it a lot with my friends but still found myself unable to find anything .
we were feeling some pretty low self-esteem because we had n't found a hobby .
but then we noticed that we did n't even need one .
we 're happy just wasting our free time - and that 's just fine . "
hobbies can be expensive , but not stressful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at a tango class in münster but some still let the pressure to peform control their free time .
inline skating on mondays , jogging on tuesdays and thursdays and then maybe a dance class and an english brush up course once a week .
however , people who lead that kind of lifestyle must also organize their lives exactly as they do their jobs , and that has its own set of limitations .
on the scale between idleness and someone who pursues many activities during his free time , 48-year-old dental technician norbert says he falls somewhere in between .
" my free time is really valuable to me and i have to admit that i also work to help finance some of my hobbies , " he said .
" i get a certain amount of fulfillment out of my job because i feel a lot of responsibility .
but i can also experience that in my free time . "
at times , norbert says he would like to do more to live out his creative side .
he 's already in a part-time rock band .
but he 's also aware that working as a professional musician he would also experience the same kind of work pressure he has as a dental technician .
the exception : hobby as career others have gone to the other extreme and turned their hobbies into careers .
but with growing labor market crisis , that 's mostly the exception .
take cabaret artist stefan reusch , for example .
in his life , the borders between work and play are completely blurred .
" that 's not really normal free time , " he says .
" when i watch television at night , it 's also part of my work - at least partly . "
the evening news often includes items about chancellor gerhard schröder or opposition leader angela merkel that reusch will later comment on in his comedy show .
" you 're always watching it with one professional ear listening , " too .
if reusch is able to work three days and then have a long break , then he 's quite happy .
to be able to go jogging now and then , ride his bike or play a bit of soccer - there 's no lack of free time activity for reusch on the days he does n't have any work .
" i 'm not saying these are the best ways of using my free time or that i recharge my energy this way , " he says .
" you can also muddle through your spare time . "
most germans do n't want pressure reusch already knows that most germans do n't ideally like to mix their work and free time is .
he also understands the kind of pressure many fall under both before and after work .
" our society is n't ill because of a division of free time and career , rather because both are carried out with such fear .
people jog so they wo n't get too fat or look too old .
they do n't jog for fun , " reusch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for example , if someone works too much during the week , then that person is under more pressure to have fun on saturdays or during free time .
younger people then tend to party through the whole weekend .
fathers tend to do more with their children during that time .
" that means that when the weather is bad and people sit at home , he 's still under pressure and has no way to burn off the steam , " said reusche .
" i think that 's unhealthy and not very nice . " monika hoegen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

after scoring two wonderful goals through their midfielders michael ballack and sebastian deisler , bayern were looking for more of the same from their marauding players , packing the midfield with five stars and leaving roy makaay up front alone for the visit of hertha bsc berlin .
berlin , denied a victory at bochum last week , were looking to get into winning ways in the olympic stadium and employed fredi bobic as a second striker beside wichniarek , with brazilian flair backing them up in marcelinho and gilberto .
the first half started off as if a classic would unfold with both sides piling forward in wave after wave of attack in search of the early break-through .
the frantic start also brought the first signature tackles from the ' hard men ' of both teams letting their opponents know they were there .
thorsten frings for munich and niko kovac of berlin were both involved in heavy challenges and this physicality , rather than the attacking ideas of the few minutes , would later become a dominant theme of the first half .
samba style rocks bayern berlin settled quicker and pegged the bavarians back for a good ten minutes before the deadlock was broken .
a searching ball into the bayern area appeared to catch a berlin attacker offside but the flag and whistle never came and it was left to marcelinho to lash a wicked shot past oliver kahn from close range .
bayern went in search of parity straight away but soon their ideas petered out with star midfielder deisler the main culprit in the profilgacy which was to dominate munich 's first half .
time and time again the young midfielder sent high balls over the defense in search of players who were n't there or skied speculative long range efforts over the bar , sending the ball scuttling across the athetics track behind the berlin goal .
match becomes a battle in their frustration , the bayern players began a physical game which resulted in a flurry of free-kicks and cards for both teams as the game lost rhythm and shape .
berlin chose to defend the narrow lead , forcing bayern to take the game to them .
however , the creative flair of bayern 's stars seemed dampened by the resilience of their opponents and frustration crept in .
the second half started as a dream for bayern .
roque santa cruz replaced ze roberto at the break and added another attacking option to the bayern team .
his impact was immediate .
latching onto a stunning pass by mehmet scholl , santa cruz charged into the area and delivered a pin-point cross for roy makaay to equalize .
home side pushes for winner bayern dominated the next twenty minutes of the half with the midfield pushing up in a red and white line behind the two strikers as they pushed for the winner .
but berlin were not out of the game and woke up to have their own chances as the agme wore on .
the home team , however , were single-minded in their approach and had many good efforts - and even more terrible , wasted chances - to go ahead .
the best falling to roy makaay in the final minute after bayern had been reduced to 10 men .
in the end , the grinding , physical nature of the game was detrimental to the spectacle and had worn the players down by the time it came to make a difference .
berlin looked happy with their draw but munich looked frustrated by their own wasted chances to push for the top spot in the bundesliga .
bayern munich : kahn , görlitz , linke , lucio , salihamidzic , deisler , frings , ballack , ze roberto , scholl , makaay hertha bsc berlin : fiedler , friedrich , van burik , simunic , marx , dardai , n. kovac , marceliho , gilberto , bobic , wichniarek nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de week two offers teams second chances the bundesliga enters week two and many of the clubs now know what they have to do to make a serious challenge for the title .

after scoring two wonderful goals through their midfielders michael ballack and sebastian deisler , bayern were looking for more of the same from their marauding players , packing the midfield with five stars and leaving roy makaay up front alone for the visit of hertha bsc berlin .
berlin , denied a victory at bochum last week , were looking to get into winning ways in the olympic stadium and employed fredi bobic as a second striker beside wichniarek , with brazilian flair backing them up in marcelinho and gilberto .
the first half started off as if a classic would unfold with both sides piling forward in wave after wave of attack in search of the early break-through .
the frantic start also brought the first signature tackles from the ' hard men ' of both teams letting their opponents know they were there .
thorsten frings for munich and niko kovac of berlin were both involved in heavy challenges and this physicality , rather than the attacking ideas of the few minutes , would later become a dominant theme of the first half .
samba style rocks bayern berlin settled quicker and pegged the bavarians back for a good ten minutes before the deadlock was broken .
a searching ball into the bayern area appeared to catch a berlin attacker offside but the flag and whistle never came and it was left to marcelinho to lash a wicked shot past oliver kahn from close range .
bayern went in search of parity straight away but soon their ideas petered out with star midfielder deisler the main culprit in the profilgacy which was to dominate munich 's first half .
time and time again the young midfielder sent high balls over the defense in search of players who were n't there or skied speculative long range efforts over the bar , sending the ball scuttling across the athetics track behind the berlin goal .
match becomes a battle in their frustration , the bayern players began a physical game which resulted in a flurry of free-kicks and cards for both teams as the game lost rhythm and shape .
berlin chose to defend the narrow lead , forcing bayern to take the game to them .
however , the creative flair of bayern 's stars seemed dampened by the resilience of their opponents and frustration crept in .
the second half started as a dream for bayern .
roque santa cruz replaced ze roberto at the break and added another attacking option to the bayern team .
his impact was immediate .
latching onto a stunning pass by mehmet scholl , santa cruz charged into the area and delivered a pin-point cross for roy makaay to equalize .
home side pushes for winner bayern dominated the next twenty minutes of the half with the midfield pushing up in a red and white line behind the two strikers as they pushed for the winner .
but berlin were not out of the game and woke up to have their own chances as the agme wore on .
the home team , however , were single-minded in their approach and had many good efforts - and even more terrible , wasted chances - to go ahead .
the best falling to roy makaay in the final minute after bayern had been reduced to 10 men .
in the end , the grinding , physical nature of the game was detrimental to the spectacle and had worn the players down by the time it came to make a difference .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.08.2004 germany asks for namibians ' ' forgiveness ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herero men reenact the uprising at omaheke 100 years after its deadly campaign against the herero people of namibia , development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul visited the former colony on saturday .
she asked for the country 's forgiveness . " we germans recognize our historical , political , moral and ethical responsibility and guilt , " the development minister said saturday , choking back tears .
wieczorek-zeul was in namibia to participate in a service commemorating the anniversary of the battle of warterberg 100 years ago .
during the fight , ín what was then the colonial german southwest africa , german soldiers are said to have forced the surviving herero into the omaheke desert and blocked access to all water sources .
thousands died a painful death from starvation and thirst .
between 45,000 and 65,000 herero are believed to have been killed as well as 10,000 from the nama tribe .
german gen. lothar von trotha said at the time he would " wipe them out with rivers of blood . "
historians have described this policy as one of " blatant terrorism " and " shocking brutality . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul " i respectfully commemorate your ancestors who died in the fight against their german oppressors , " wieczorek-zeul told several thousand herero people who gathered at the site of the battle .
" blinded by colonial delusion , " she said , germans brought " violence , discrimination , racism and destruction " to the country .
minister : today it would have been genocide today , she said , the crimes that took place a hundred years ago would have been defined as genocide , and von trotha would have been brought before a criminal tribunal .
" in the name of our common lord , i ask for your forgiveness , " she said , in a statement that was the most far-reaching admission of guilt germany has yet given .
her comments were greeted with light applause from the audience .
but many herero have called on germany to issue an explicit apology for the massacre .
but wieczorek-zeul said that everything she said in her speech should be seen as an apology for the crimes committed under german leadership .
namibia 's minister of lands , hifikepunye pohamba , who is also expected to become the country 's next president , said he accepted the apology " in the name of the namibian people . "
no official apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german marines gather in namibia in 1904 before launching a full-fledged assault on the herero people .
an official apology from berlin as well as the classification of the colonial war as genocide was one of the main demands the herero people had made of the german government .
one herero group is currently suing berlin in united states courts for damages in the billions of dollars .
referring to the lawsuits during a visit to namibia in october , german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to offer an apology that could be used to bolster the case for reparations .
on saturday , wieczorek-zeul pledged further development aid for namibia as well as support for land reforms .
calculated on a per-capita basis , namibia currently receives more development aid from germany than any other african country .
since the country 's independence from south africa in 1990 , it has received more than € 500 million -lrb- $ 619 million -rrb- in german aid .
calls for reconciliation both wieczorek-zeul and representatives of the heroro have called for reconciliation between the descendents of the victims and culprits of the uprising .
" we recall with tears the victims of our ancestors .
today we should make right what was made wrong a hundred years ago , " herero bishop kameeta said .
he called on all namibians to reconcile with themselves and with the descendants of those responsible for the acts of cruelty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero woman wears her traditional headdress .
more than 3,000 herero , nama and namibians of german origin gathered in okarara at the foot of the warterberg for saturday 's memorial service .
the day 's events also included reenactments of the fateful battle .
in 1904 , the herero launched a major uprising against their german colonial masters , killing more than 100 germans .
the uprising led germany 's von trotha to order to decimation of the entire herero population .
fortunately , he did not succeed , and today there are again 120,000 herero and 60,000 nama minorities in the country . dw staff -lrb- dsl / afp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a painful reminder of german colonialism wednesday marks the 100th anniversary of germany 's brutal crushing of an ethnic uprising in namibia .

she asked for the country 's forgiveness . " we germans recognize our historical , political , moral and ethical responsibility and guilt , " the development minister said saturday , choking back tears .
wieczorek-zeul was in namibia to participate in a service commemorating the anniversary of the battle of warterberg 100 years ago .
during the fight , ín what was then the colonial german southwest africa , german soldiers are said to have forced the surviving herero into the omaheke desert and blocked access to all water sources .
thousands died a painful death from starvation and thirst .
between 45,000 and 65,000 herero are believed to have been killed as well as 10,000 from the nama tribe .
german gen. lothar von trotha said at the time he would " wipe them out with rivers of blood . "
historians have described this policy as one of " blatant terrorism " and " shocking brutality . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul " i respectfully commemorate your ancestors who died in the fight against their german oppressors , " wieczorek-zeul told several thousand herero people who gathered at the site of the battle .
" blinded by colonial delusion , " she said , germans brought " violence , discrimination , racism and destruction " to the country .
minister : today it would have been genocide today , she said , the crimes that took place a hundred years ago would have been defined as genocide , and von trotha would have been brought before a criminal tribunal .
" in the name of our common lord , i ask for your forgiveness , " she said , in a statement that was the most far-reaching admission of guilt germany has yet given .
her comments were greeted with light applause from the audience .
but many herero have called on germany to issue an explicit apology for the massacre .
but wieczorek-zeul said that everything she said in her speech should be seen as an apology for the crimes committed under german leadership .
namibia 's minister of lands , hifikepunye pohamba , who is also expected to become the country 's next president , said he accepted the apology " in the name of the namibian people . "
no official apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german marines gather in namibia in 1904 before launching a full-fledged assault on the herero people .
an official apology from berlin as well as the classification of the colonial war as genocide was one of the main demands the herero people had made of the german government .
one herero group is currently suing berlin in united states courts for damages in the billions of dollars .
referring to the lawsuits during a visit to namibia in october , german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to offer an apology that could be used to bolster the case for reparations .
on saturday , wieczorek-zeul pledged further development aid for namibia as well as support for land reforms .
calculated on a per-capita basis , namibia currently receives more development aid from germany than any other african country .
since the country 's independence from south africa in 1990 , it has received more than € 500 million -lrb- $ 619 million -rrb- in german aid .
calls for reconciliation both wieczorek-zeul and representatives of the heroro have called for reconciliation between the descendents of the victims and culprits of the uprising .
" we recall with tears the victims of our ancestors .
today we should make right what was made wrong a hundred years ago , " herero bishop kameeta said .
he called on all namibians to reconcile with themselves and with the descendants of those responsible for the acts of cruelty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero woman wears her traditional headdress .
more than 3,000 herero , nama and namibians of german origin gathered in okarara at the foot of the warterberg for saturday 's memorial service .
the day 's events also included reenactments of the fateful battle .
in 1904 , the herero launched a major uprising against their german colonial masters , killing more than 100 germans .
the uprising led germany 's von trotha to order to decimation of the entire herero population .
fortunately , he did not succeed , and today there are again 120,000 herero and 60,000 nama minorities in the country . dw staff -lrb- dsl / afp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a painful reminder of german colonialism wednesday marks the 100th anniversary of germany 's brutal crushing of an ethnic uprising in namibia .

in germany , many people are rethinking their relationship between work and free time .
but what 's the recipe for success ? most people draw positive emotions and self-affirmation from their work .
it 's also where they place the bulk of their energy .
german researchers recently delved into this seeming paradox and came up with some interesting results .
nowadays , more than ever before , having fun with friends , leisure time and free time is more highly valued than ever before .
even professionals in the it sector , once known as people who burned the midnight oil , have discovered the concept of leisure time .
where are the workaholics ?
munich researchers contracted by the hans böckler foundation recently conducted interviews with software developers , consultants , executives and administrative workers from it companies .
the results ?
people these days are seeking a greater division between their work and private lives .
spending a long evening or even an entire night in front of the screen has fallen out of vogue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people have abandoned entrepreneurship for more stabile working hours others have long appreciated the art of shutting down their computers and leaving work promptly at the end of the day , like angelika .
after years of burning the candle at both ends , the former entrepreneur gave up her independent job to take up a position as an accountant , where she has fixed office hours .
now , angelika 's work gives her the opportunity to use her time a little better .
" my favorite thing is to meet up with nice people and entertain myself , " she says .
" i think it 's great to just be together with other people , but i also need lots of quiet time for myself and like to stay home , too , " the 50-year-old said .
angelika is far from alone .
recent studies have pointed to the new trend of a " comfort culture " among germans .
being comfortable at home is the top priority for most germans surveyed .
in one study , 68 percent of those surveyed said they were satisfied at home if they had a television .
forty percent said all they needed was a radio to be content .
another 46 percent said a newspaper and good food was all they needed .
today 's modern , almost unavoidable amount of possibilities during one 's free time are attracting a lot more people towards leisure - a word that for a long time seemed almost forgotten in germany .
but few will admit that - even today .
" for a long time , i thought , i absolutely have to have a hobby , " said angelika .
" i thought about it a lot with my friends but still found myself unable to find anything .
we were feeling some pretty low self-esteem because we had n't found a hobby .
but then we noticed that we did n't even need one .
we 're happy just wasting our free time - and that 's just fine . "
hobbies can be expensive , but not stressful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at a tango class in münster but some still let the pressure to peform control their free time .
inline skating on mondays , jogging on tuesdays and thursdays and then maybe a dance class and an english brush up course once a week .
however , people who lead that kind of lifestyle must also organize their lives exactly as they do their jobs , and that has its own set of limitations .
on the scale between idleness and someone who pursues many activities during his free time , 48-year-old dental technician norbert says he falls somewhere in between .
" my free time is really valuable to me and i have to admit that i also work to help finance some of my hobbies , " he said .
" i get a certain amount of fulfillment out of my job because i feel a lot of responsibility .
but i can also experience that in my free time . "
at times , norbert says he would like to do more to live out his creative side .
he 's already in a part-time rock band .
but he 's also aware that working as a professional musician he would also experience the same kind of work pressure he has as a dental technician .
the exception : hobby as career others have gone to the other extreme and turned their hobbies into careers .
but with growing labor market crisis , that 's mostly the exception .
take cabaret artist stefan reusch , for example .
in his life , the borders between work and play are completely blurred .
" that 's not really normal free time , " he says .
" when i watch television at night , it 's also part of my work - at least partly . "
the evening news often includes items about chancellor gerhard schröder or opposition leader angela merkel that reusch will later comment on in his comedy show .
" you 're always watching it with one professional ear listening , " too .
if reusch is able to work three days and then have a long break , then he 's quite happy .
to be able to go jogging now and then , ride his bike or play a bit of soccer - there 's no lack of free time activity for reusch on the days he does n't have any work .
" i 'm not saying these are the best ways of using my free time or that i recharge my energy this way , " he says .
" you can also muddle through your spare time . "
most germans do n't want pressure reusch already knows that most germans do n't ideally like to mix their work and free time is .
he also understands the kind of pressure many fall under both before and after work .
" our society is n't ill because of a division of free time and career , rather because both are carried out with such fear .
people jog so they wo n't get too fat or look too old .
they do n't jog for fun , " reusch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for example , if someone works too much during the week , then that person is under more pressure to have fun on saturdays or during free time .
younger people then tend to party through the whole weekend .

angelika is far from alone .
recent studies have pointed to the new trend of a " comfort culture " among germans .
being comfortable at home is the top priority for most germans surveyed .
in one study , 68 percent of those surveyed said they were satisfied at home if they had a television .
forty percent said all they needed was a radio to be content .
another 46 percent said a newspaper and good food was all they needed .
today 's modern , almost unavoidable amount of possibilities during one 's free time are attracting a lot more people towards leisure - a word that for a long time seemed almost forgotten in germany .

" for a long time , i thought , i absolutely have to have a hobby , " said angelika .
" i thought about it a lot with my friends but still found myself unable to find anything .
we were feeling some pretty low self-esteem because we had n't found a hobby .

on the scale between idleness and someone who pursues many activities during his free time , 48-year-old dental technician norbert says he falls somewhere in between .
" my free time is really valuable to me and i have to admit that i also work to help finance some of my hobbies , " he said .
" i get a certain amount of fulfillment out of my job because i feel a lot of responsibility .
but i can also experience that in my free time . "

in germany , many people are rethinking their relationship between work and free time .
but what 's the recipe for success ? most people draw positive emotions and self-affirmation from their work .
it 's also where they place the bulk of their energy .
german researchers recently delved into this seeming paradox and came up with some interesting results .
nowadays , more than ever before , having fun with friends , leisure time and free time is more highly valued than ever before .
even professionals in the it sector , once known as people who burned the midnight oil , have discovered the concept of leisure time .
where are the workaholics ?
munich researchers contracted by the hans böckler foundation recently conducted interviews with software developers , consultants , executives and administrative workers from it companies .
the results ?
people these days are seeking a greater division between their work and private lives .
spending a long evening or even an entire night in front of the screen has fallen out of vogue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people have abandoned entrepreneurship for more stabile working hours others have long appreciated the art of shutting down their computers and leaving work promptly at the end of the day , like angelika .
after years of burning the candle at both ends , the former entrepreneur gave up her independent job to take up a position as an accountant , where she has fixed office hours .
now , angelika 's work gives her the opportunity to use her time a little better .
" my favorite thing is to meet up with nice people and entertain myself , " she says .
" i think it 's great to just be together with other people , but i also need lots of quiet time for myself and like to stay home , too , " the 50-year-old said .
angelika is far from alone .
recent studies have pointed to the new trend of a " comfort culture " among germans .
being comfortable at home is the top priority for most germans surveyed .
in one study , 68 percent of those surveyed said they were satisfied at home if they had a television .
forty percent said all they needed was a radio to be content .
another 46 percent said a newspaper and good food was all they needed .
today 's modern , almost unavoidable amount of possibilities during one 's free time are attracting a lot more people towards leisure - a word that for a long time seemed almost forgotten in germany .
but few will admit that - even today .
" for a long time , i thought , i absolutely have to have a hobby , " said angelika .
" i thought about it a lot with my friends but still found myself unable to find anything .
we were feeling some pretty low self-esteem because we had n't found a hobby .
but then we noticed that we did n't even need one .
we 're happy just wasting our free time - and that 's just fine . "
hobbies can be expensive , but not stressful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at a tango class in münster but some still let the pressure to peform control their free time .
inline skating on mondays , jogging on tuesdays and thursdays and then maybe a dance class and an english brush up course once a week .
however , people who lead that kind of lifestyle must also organize their lives exactly as they do their jobs , and that has its own set of limitations .
on the scale between idleness and someone who pursues many activities during his free time , 48-year-old dental technician norbert says he falls somewhere in between .
" my free time is really valuable to me and i have to admit that i also work to help finance some of my hobbies , " he said .
" i get a certain amount of fulfillment out of my job because i feel a lot of responsibility .
but i can also experience that in my free time . "
at times , norbert says he would like to do more to live out his creative side .
he 's already in a part-time rock band .
but he 's also aware that working as a professional musician he would also experience the same kind of work pressure he has as a dental technician .
the exception : hobby as career others have gone to the other extreme and turned their hobbies into careers .
but with growing labor market crisis , that 's mostly the exception .
take cabaret artist stefan reusch , for example .
in his life , the borders between work and play are completely blurred .
" that 's not really normal free time , " he says .
" when i watch television at night , it 's also part of my work - at least partly . "
the evening news often includes items about chancellor gerhard schröder or opposition leader angela merkel that reusch will later comment on in his comedy show .
" you 're always watching it with one professional ear listening , " too .
if reusch is able to work three days and then have a long break , then he 's quite happy .
to be able to go jogging now and then , ride his bike or play a bit of soccer - there 's no lack of free time activity for reusch on the days he does n't have any work .
" i 'm not saying these are the best ways of using my free time or that i recharge my energy this way , " he says .
" you can also muddle through your spare time . "
most germans do n't want pressure reusch already knows that most germans do n't ideally like to mix their work and free time is .
he also understands the kind of pressure many fall under both before and after work .
" our society is n't ill because of a division of free time and career , rather because both are carried out with such fear .
people jog so they wo n't get too fat or look too old .
they do n't jog for fun , " reusch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for example , if someone works too much during the week , then that person is under more pressure to have fun on saturdays or during free time .
younger people then tend to party through the whole weekend .

in germany , many people are rethinking their relationship between work and free time .
but what 's the recipe for success ? most people draw positive emotions and self-affirmation from their work .
it 's also where they place the bulk of their energy .
german researchers recently delved into this seeming paradox and came up with some interesting results .
nowadays , more than ever before , having fun with friends , leisure time and free time is more highly valued than ever before .
even professionals in the it sector , once known as people who burned the midnight oil , have discovered the concept of leisure time .
where are the workaholics ?
munich researchers contracted by the hans böckler foundation recently conducted interviews with software developers , consultants , executives and administrative workers from it companies .
the results ?
people these days are seeking a greater division between their work and private lives .
spending a long evening or even an entire night in front of the screen has fallen out of vogue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people have abandoned entrepreneurship for more stabile working hours others have long appreciated the art of shutting down their computers and leaving work promptly at the end of the day , like angelika .
after years of burning the candle at both ends , the former entrepreneur gave up her independent job to take up a position as an accountant , where she has fixed office hours .
now , angelika 's work gives her the opportunity to use her time a little better .
" my favorite thing is to meet up with nice people and entertain myself , " she says .
" i think it 's great to just be together with other people , but i also need lots of quiet time for myself and like to stay home , too , " the 50-year-old said .
angelika is far from alone .
recent studies have pointed to the new trend of a " comfort culture " among germans .
being comfortable at home is the top priority for most germans surveyed .
in one study , 68 percent of those surveyed said they were satisfied at home if they had a television .
forty percent said all they needed was a radio to be content .
another 46 percent said a newspaper and good food was all they needed .
today 's modern , almost unavoidable amount of possibilities during one 's free time are attracting a lot more people towards leisure - a word that for a long time seemed almost forgotten in germany .
but few will admit that - even today .
" for a long time , i thought , i absolutely have to have a hobby , " said angelika .
" i thought about it a lot with my friends but still found myself unable to find anything .
we were feeling some pretty low self-esteem because we had n't found a hobby .
but then we noticed that we did n't even need one .
we 're happy just wasting our free time - and that 's just fine . "
hobbies can be expensive , but not stressful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at a tango class in münster but some still let the pressure to peform control their free time .
inline skating on mondays , jogging on tuesdays and thursdays and then maybe a dance class and an english brush up course once a week .
however , people who lead that kind of lifestyle must also organize their lives exactly as they do their jobs , and that has its own set of limitations .
on the scale between idleness and someone who pursues many activities during his free time , 48-year-old dental technician norbert says he falls somewhere in between .
" my free time is really valuable to me and i have to admit that i also work to help finance some of my hobbies , " he said .
" i get a certain amount of fulfillment out of my job because i feel a lot of responsibility .
but i can also experience that in my free time . "
at times , norbert says he would like to do more to live out his creative side .
he 's already in a part-time rock band .
but he 's also aware that working as a professional musician he would also experience the same kind of work pressure he has as a dental technician .
the exception : hobby as career others have gone to the other extreme and turned their hobbies into careers .
but with growing labor market crisis , that 's mostly the exception .
take cabaret artist stefan reusch , for example .
in his life , the borders between work and play are completely blurred .
" that 's not really normal free time , " he says .
" when i watch television at night , it 's also part of my work - at least partly . "
the evening news often includes items about chancellor gerhard schröder or opposition leader angela merkel that reusch will later comment on in his comedy show .
" you 're always watching it with one professional ear listening , " too .
if reusch is able to work three days and then have a long break , then he 's quite happy .
to be able to go jogging now and then , ride his bike or play a bit of soccer - there 's no lack of free time activity for reusch on the days he does n't have any work .
" i 'm not saying these are the best ways of using my free time or that i recharge my energy this way , " he says .
" you can also muddle through your spare time . "
most germans do n't want pressure reusch already knows that most germans do n't ideally like to mix their work and free time is .
he also understands the kind of pressure many fall under both before and after work .
" our society is n't ill because of a division of free time and career , rather because both are carried out with such fear .
people jog so they wo n't get too fat or look too old .
they do n't jog for fun , " reusch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for example , if someone works too much during the week , then that person is under more pressure to have fun on saturdays or during free time .
younger people then tend to party through the whole weekend .
fathers tend to do more with their children during that time .
" that means that when the weather is bad and people sit at home , he 's still under pressure and has no way to burn off the steam , " said reusche .
" i think that 's unhealthy and not very nice . " monika hoegen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

she asked for the country 's forgiveness . " we germans recognize our historical , political , moral and ethical responsibility and guilt , " the development minister said saturday , choking back tears .
wieczorek-zeul was in namibia to participate in a service commemorating the anniversary of the battle of warterberg 100 years ago .
during the fight , ín what was then the colonial german southwest africa , german soldiers are said to have forced the surviving herero into the omaheke desert and blocked access to all water sources .
thousands died a painful death from starvation and thirst .
between 45,000 and 65,000 herero are believed to have been killed as well as 10,000 from the nama tribe .
german gen. lothar von trotha said at the time he would " wipe them out with rivers of blood . "
historians have described this policy as one of " blatant terrorism " and " shocking brutality . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul " i respectfully commemorate your ancestors who died in the fight against their german oppressors , " wieczorek-zeul told several thousand herero people who gathered at the site of the battle .
" blinded by colonial delusion , " she said , germans brought " violence , discrimination , racism and destruction " to the country .
minister : today it would have been genocide today , she said , the crimes that took place a hundred years ago would have been defined as genocide , and von trotha would have been brought before a criminal tribunal .
" in the name of our common lord , i ask for your forgiveness , " she said , in a statement that was the most far-reaching admission of guilt germany has yet given .
her comments were greeted with light applause from the audience .
but many herero have called on germany to issue an explicit apology for the massacre .
but wieczorek-zeul said that everything she said in her speech should be seen as an apology for the crimes committed under german leadership .
namibia 's minister of lands , hifikepunye pohamba , who is also expected to become the country 's next president , said he accepted the apology " in the name of the namibian people . "
no official apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german marines gather in namibia in 1904 before launching a full-fledged assault on the herero people .
an official apology from berlin as well as the classification of the colonial war as genocide was one of the main demands the herero people had made of the german government .
one herero group is currently suing berlin in united states courts for damages in the billions of dollars .
referring to the lawsuits during a visit to namibia in october , german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to offer an apology that could be used to bolster the case for reparations .
on saturday , wieczorek-zeul pledged further development aid for namibia as well as support for land reforms .
calculated on a per-capita basis , namibia currently receives more development aid from germany than any other african country .
since the country 's independence from south africa in 1990 , it has received more than € 500 million -lrb- $ 619 million -rrb- in german aid .
calls for reconciliation both wieczorek-zeul and representatives of the heroro have called for reconciliation between the descendents of the victims and culprits of the uprising .
" we recall with tears the victims of our ancestors .
today we should make right what was made wrong a hundred years ago , " herero bishop kameeta said .
he called on all namibians to reconcile with themselves and with the descendants of those responsible for the acts of cruelty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero woman wears her traditional headdress .
more than 3,000 herero , nama and namibians of german origin gathered in okarara at the foot of the warterberg for saturday 's memorial service .
the day 's events also included reenactments of the fateful battle .
in 1904 , the herero launched a major uprising against their german colonial masters , killing more than 100 germans .
the uprising led germany 's von trotha to order to decimation of the entire herero population .

in germany , many people are rethinking their relationship between work and free time .
but what 's the recipe for success ? most people draw positive emotions and self-affirmation from their work .
it 's also where they place the bulk of their energy .
german researchers recently delved into this seeming paradox and came up with some interesting results .
nowadays , more than ever before , having fun with friends , leisure time and free time is more highly valued than ever before .
even professionals in the it sector , once known as people who burned the midnight oil , have discovered the concept of leisure time .
where are the workaholics ?
munich researchers contracted by the hans böckler foundation recently conducted interviews with software developers , consultants , executives and administrative workers from it companies .
the results ?
people these days are seeking a greater division between their work and private lives .
spending a long evening or even an entire night in front of the screen has fallen out of vogue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people have abandoned entrepreneurship for more stabile working hours others have long appreciated the art of shutting down their computers and leaving work promptly at the end of the day , like angelika .
after years of burning the candle at both ends , the former entrepreneur gave up her independent job to take up a position as an accountant , where she has fixed office hours .

angelika is far from alone .
recent studies have pointed to the new trend of a " comfort culture " among germans .
being comfortable at home is the top priority for most germans surveyed .

today 's modern , almost unavoidable amount of possibilities during one 's free time are attracting a lot more people towards leisure - a word that for a long time seemed almost forgotten in germany .
but few will admit that - even today .
" for a long time , i thought , i absolutely have to have a hobby , " said angelika .
" i thought about it a lot with my friends but still found myself unable to find anything .
we were feeling some pretty low self-esteem because we had n't found a hobby .
but then we noticed that we did n't even need one .
we 're happy just wasting our free time - and that 's just fine . "

" my free time is really valuable to me and i have to admit that i also work to help finance some of my hobbies , " he said .

in germany , many people are rethinking their relationship between work and free time .
but what 's the recipe for success ? most people draw positive emotions and self-affirmation from their work .
it 's also where they place the bulk of their energy .
german researchers recently delved into this seeming paradox and came up with some interesting results .
nowadays , more than ever before , having fun with friends , leisure time and free time is more highly valued than ever before .
even professionals in the it sector , once known as people who burned the midnight oil , have discovered the concept of leisure time .
where are the workaholics ?
munich researchers contracted by the hans böckler foundation recently conducted interviews with software developers , consultants , executives and administrative workers from it companies .
the results ?
people these days are seeking a greater division between their work and private lives .
spending a long evening or even an entire night in front of the screen has fallen out of vogue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people have abandoned entrepreneurship for more stabile working hours others have long appreciated the art of shutting down their computers and leaving work promptly at the end of the day , like angelika .
after years of burning the candle at both ends , the former entrepreneur gave up her independent job to take up a position as an accountant , where she has fixed office hours .
now , angelika 's work gives her the opportunity to use her time a little better .
" my favorite thing is to meet up with nice people and entertain myself , " she says .
" i think it 's great to just be together with other people , but i also need lots of quiet time for myself and like to stay home , too , " the 50-year-old said .
angelika is far from alone .
recent studies have pointed to the new trend of a " comfort culture " among germans .
being comfortable at home is the top priority for most germans surveyed .
in one study , 68 percent of those surveyed said they were satisfied at home if they had a television .
forty percent said all they needed was a radio to be content .
another 46 percent said a newspaper and good food was all they needed .
today 's modern , almost unavoidable amount of possibilities during one 's free time are attracting a lot more people towards leisure - a word that for a long time seemed almost forgotten in germany .
but few will admit that - even today .
" for a long time , i thought , i absolutely have to have a hobby , " said angelika .
" i thought about it a lot with my friends but still found myself unable to find anything .
we were feeling some pretty low self-esteem because we had n't found a hobby .
but then we noticed that we did n't even need one .
we 're happy just wasting our free time - and that 's just fine . "
hobbies can be expensive , but not stressful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at a tango class in münster but some still let the pressure to peform control their free time .
inline skating on mondays , jogging on tuesdays and thursdays and then maybe a dance class and an english brush up course once a week .
however , people who lead that kind of lifestyle must also organize their lives exactly as they do their jobs , and that has its own set of limitations .
on the scale between idleness and someone who pursues many activities during his free time , 48-year-old dental technician norbert says he falls somewhere in between .
" my free time is really valuable to me and i have to admit that i also work to help finance some of my hobbies , " he said .
" i get a certain amount of fulfillment out of my job because i feel a lot of responsibility .
but i can also experience that in my free time . "
at times , norbert says he would like to do more to live out his creative side .
he 's already in a part-time rock band .
but he 's also aware that working as a professional musician he would also experience the same kind of work pressure he has as a dental technician .
the exception : hobby as career others have gone to the other extreme and turned their hobbies into careers .
but with growing labor market crisis , that 's mostly the exception .
take cabaret artist stefan reusch , for example .
in his life , the borders between work and play are completely blurred .
" that 's not really normal free time , " he says .
" when i watch television at night , it 's also part of my work - at least partly . "
the evening news often includes items about chancellor gerhard schröder or opposition leader angela merkel that reusch will later comment on in his comedy show .
" you 're always watching it with one professional ear listening , " too .
if reusch is able to work three days and then have a long break , then he 's quite happy .
to be able to go jogging now and then , ride his bike or play a bit of soccer - there 's no lack of free time activity for reusch on the days he does n't have any work .
" i 'm not saying these are the best ways of using my free time or that i recharge my energy this way , " he says .
" you can also muddle through your spare time . "
most germans do n't want pressure reusch already knows that most germans do n't ideally like to mix their work and free time is .
he also understands the kind of pressure many fall under both before and after work .
" our society is n't ill because of a division of free time and career , rather because both are carried out with such fear .
people jog so they wo n't get too fat or look too old .
they do n't jog for fun , " reusch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for example , if someone works too much during the week , then that person is under more pressure to have fun on saturdays or during free time .
younger people then tend to party through the whole weekend .
fathers tend to do more with their children during that time .
" that means that when the weather is bad and people sit at home , he 's still under pressure and has no way to burn off the steam , " said reusche .
" i think that 's unhealthy and not very nice . " monika hoegen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

she asked for the country 's forgiveness . " we germans recognize our historical , political , moral and ethical responsibility and guilt , " the development minister said saturday , choking back tears .
wieczorek-zeul was in namibia to participate in a service commemorating the anniversary of the battle of warterberg 100 years ago .
during the fight , ín what was then the colonial german southwest africa , german soldiers are said to have forced the surviving herero into the omaheke desert and blocked access to all water sources .
thousands died a painful death from starvation and thirst .
between 45,000 and 65,000 herero are believed to have been killed as well as 10,000 from the nama tribe .
german gen. lothar von trotha said at the time he would " wipe them out with rivers of blood . "
historians have described this policy as one of " blatant terrorism " and " shocking brutality . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul " i respectfully commemorate your ancestors who died in the fight against their german oppressors , " wieczorek-zeul told several thousand herero people who gathered at the site of the battle .
" blinded by colonial delusion , " she said , germans brought " violence , discrimination , racism and destruction " to the country .
minister : today it would have been genocide today , she said , the crimes that took place a hundred years ago would have been defined as genocide , and von trotha would have been brought before a criminal tribunal .
" in the name of our common lord , i ask for your forgiveness , " she said , in a statement that was the most far-reaching admission of guilt germany has yet given .
her comments were greeted with light applause from the audience .
but many herero have called on germany to issue an explicit apology for the massacre .
but wieczorek-zeul said that everything she said in her speech should be seen as an apology for the crimes committed under german leadership .
namibia 's minister of lands , hifikepunye pohamba , who is also expected to become the country 's next president , said he accepted the apology " in the name of the namibian people . "
no official apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german marines gather in namibia in 1904 before launching a full-fledged assault on the herero people .
an official apology from berlin as well as the classification of the colonial war as genocide was one of the main demands the herero people had made of the german government .
one herero group is currently suing berlin in united states courts for damages in the billions of dollars .
referring to the lawsuits during a visit to namibia in october , german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to offer an apology that could be used to bolster the case for reparations .
on saturday , wieczorek-zeul pledged further development aid for namibia as well as support for land reforms .
calculated on a per-capita basis , namibia currently receives more development aid from germany than any other african country .
since the country 's independence from south africa in 1990 , it has received more than € 500 million -lrb- $ 619 million -rrb- in german aid .
calls for reconciliation both wieczorek-zeul and representatives of the heroro have called for reconciliation between the descendents of the victims and culprits of the uprising .
" we recall with tears the victims of our ancestors .
today we should make right what was made wrong a hundred years ago , " herero bishop kameeta said .
he called on all namibians to reconcile with themselves and with the descendants of those responsible for the acts of cruelty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero woman wears her traditional headdress .
more than 3,000 herero , nama and namibians of german origin gathered in okarara at the foot of the warterberg for saturday 's memorial service .

she asked for the country 's forgiveness . " we germans recognize our historical , political , moral and ethical responsibility and guilt , " the development minister said saturday , choking back tears .
wieczorek-zeul was in namibia to participate in a service commemorating the anniversary of the battle of warterberg 100 years ago .
during the fight , ín what was then the colonial german southwest africa , german soldiers are said to have forced the surviving herero into the omaheke desert and blocked access to all water sources .
thousands died a painful death from starvation and thirst .
between 45,000 and 65,000 herero are believed to have been killed as well as 10,000 from the nama tribe .
german gen. lothar von trotha said at the time he would " wipe them out with rivers of blood . "
historians have described this policy as one of " blatant terrorism " and " shocking brutality . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul " i respectfully commemorate your ancestors who died in the fight against their german oppressors , " wieczorek-zeul told several thousand herero people who gathered at the site of the battle .
" blinded by colonial delusion , " she said , germans brought " violence , discrimination , racism and destruction " to the country .
minister : today it would have been genocide today , she said , the crimes that took place a hundred years ago would have been defined as genocide , and von trotha would have been brought before a criminal tribunal .
" in the name of our common lord , i ask for your forgiveness , " she said , in a statement that was the most far-reaching admission of guilt germany has yet given .
her comments were greeted with light applause from the audience .
but many herero have called on germany to issue an explicit apology for the massacre .
but wieczorek-zeul said that everything she said in her speech should be seen as an apology for the crimes committed under german leadership .
namibia 's minister of lands , hifikepunye pohamba , who is also expected to become the country 's next president , said he accepted the apology " in the name of the namibian people . "
no official apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german marines gather in namibia in 1904 before launching a full-fledged assault on the herero people .
an official apology from berlin as well as the classification of the colonial war as genocide was one of the main demands the herero people had made of the german government .
one herero group is currently suing berlin in united states courts for damages in the billions of dollars .
referring to the lawsuits during a visit to namibia in october , german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to offer an apology that could be used to bolster the case for reparations .
on saturday , wieczorek-zeul pledged further development aid for namibia as well as support for land reforms .
calculated on a per-capita basis , namibia currently receives more development aid from germany than any other african country .
since the country 's independence from south africa in 1990 , it has received more than € 500 million -lrb- $ 619 million -rrb- in german aid .
calls for reconciliation both wieczorek-zeul and representatives of the heroro have called for reconciliation between the descendents of the victims and culprits of the uprising .
" we recall with tears the victims of our ancestors .
today we should make right what was made wrong a hundred years ago , " herero bishop kameeta said .
he called on all namibians to reconcile with themselves and with the descendants of those responsible for the acts of cruelty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero woman wears her traditional headdress .
more than 3,000 herero , nama and namibians of german origin gathered in okarara at the foot of the warterberg for saturday 's memorial service .

in germany , many people are rethinking their relationship between work and free time .
but what 's the recipe for success ? most people draw positive emotions and self-affirmation from their work .
it 's also where they place the bulk of their energy .
german researchers recently delved into this seeming paradox and came up with some interesting results .
nowadays , more than ever before , having fun with friends , leisure time and free time is more highly valued than ever before .
even professionals in the it sector , once known as people who burned the midnight oil , have discovered the concept of leisure time .
where are the workaholics ?
munich researchers contracted by the hans böckler foundation recently conducted interviews with software developers , consultants , executives and administrative workers from it companies .
the results ?
people these days are seeking a greater division between their work and private lives .
spending a long evening or even an entire night in front of the screen has fallen out of vogue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people have abandoned entrepreneurship for more stabile working hours others have long appreciated the art of shutting down their computers and leaving work promptly at the end of the day , like angelika .
after years of burning the candle at both ends , the former entrepreneur gave up her independent job to take up a position as an accountant , where she has fixed office hours .
now , angelika 's work gives her the opportunity to use her time a little better .
" my favorite thing is to meet up with nice people and entertain myself , " she says .
" i think it 's great to just be together with other people , but i also need lots of quiet time for myself and like to stay home , too , " the 50-year-old said .
angelika is far from alone .
recent studies have pointed to the new trend of a " comfort culture " among germans .
being comfortable at home is the top priority for most germans surveyed .
in one study , 68 percent of those surveyed said they were satisfied at home if they had a television .
forty percent said all they needed was a radio to be content .
another 46 percent said a newspaper and good food was all they needed .
today 's modern , almost unavoidable amount of possibilities during one 's free time are attracting a lot more people towards leisure - a word that for a long time seemed almost forgotten in germany .
but few will admit that - even today .
" for a long time , i thought , i absolutely have to have a hobby , " said angelika .
" i thought about it a lot with my friends but still found myself unable to find anything .
we were feeling some pretty low self-esteem because we had n't found a hobby .
but then we noticed that we did n't even need one .
we 're happy just wasting our free time - and that 's just fine . "
hobbies can be expensive , but not stressful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at a tango class in münster but some still let the pressure to peform control their free time .
inline skating on mondays , jogging on tuesdays and thursdays and then maybe a dance class and an english brush up course once a week .
however , people who lead that kind of lifestyle must also organize their lives exactly as they do their jobs , and that has its own set of limitations .
on the scale between idleness and someone who pursues many activities during his free time , 48-year-old dental technician norbert says he falls somewhere in between .
" my free time is really valuable to me and i have to admit that i also work to help finance some of my hobbies , " he said .
" i get a certain amount of fulfillment out of my job because i feel a lot of responsibility .
but i can also experience that in my free time . "
at times , norbert says he would like to do more to live out his creative side .
he 's already in a part-time rock band .
but he 's also aware that working as a professional musician he would also experience the same kind of work pressure he has as a dental technician .
the exception : hobby as career others have gone to the other extreme and turned their hobbies into careers .
but with growing labor market crisis , that 's mostly the exception .
take cabaret artist stefan reusch , for example .
in his life , the borders between work and play are completely blurred .
" that 's not really normal free time , " he says .
" when i watch television at night , it 's also part of my work - at least partly . "
the evening news often includes items about chancellor gerhard schröder or opposition leader angela merkel that reusch will later comment on in his comedy show .
" you 're always watching it with one professional ear listening , " too .
if reusch is able to work three days and then have a long break , then he 's quite happy .
to be able to go jogging now and then , ride his bike or play a bit of soccer - there 's no lack of free time activity for reusch on the days he does n't have any work .
" i 'm not saying these are the best ways of using my free time or that i recharge my energy this way , " he says .
" you can also muddle through your spare time . "
most germans do n't want pressure reusch already knows that most germans do n't ideally like to mix their work and free time is .

after scoring two wonderful goals through their midfielders michael ballack and sebastian deisler , bayern were looking for more of the same from their marauding players , packing the midfield with five stars and leaving roy makaay up front alone for the visit of hertha bsc berlin .
berlin , denied a victory at bochum last week , were looking to get into winning ways in the olympic stadium and employed fredi bobic as a second striker beside wichniarek , with brazilian flair backing them up in marcelinho and gilberto .
the first half started off as if a classic would unfold with both sides piling forward in wave after wave of attack in search of the early break-through .
the frantic start also brought the first signature tackles from the ' hard men ' of both teams letting their opponents know they were there .
thorsten frings for munich and niko kovac of berlin were both involved in heavy challenges and this physicality , rather than the attacking ideas of the few minutes , would later become a dominant theme of the first half .
samba style rocks bayern berlin settled quicker and pegged the bavarians back for a good ten minutes before the deadlock was broken .
a searching ball into the bayern area appeared to catch a berlin attacker offside but the flag and whistle never came and it was left to marcelinho to lash a wicked shot past oliver kahn from close range .
bayern went in search of parity straight away but soon their ideas petered out with star midfielder deisler the main culprit in the profilgacy which was to dominate munich 's first half .
time and time again the young midfielder sent high balls over the defense in search of players who were n't there or skied speculative long range efforts over the bar , sending the ball scuttling across the athetics track behind the berlin goal .
match becomes a battle in their frustration , the bayern players began a physical game which resulted in a flurry of free-kicks and cards for both teams as the game lost rhythm and shape .
berlin chose to defend the narrow lead , forcing bayern to take the game to them .
however , the creative flair of bayern 's stars seemed dampened by the resilience of their opponents and frustration crept in .
the second half started as a dream for bayern .
roque santa cruz replaced ze roberto at the break and added another attacking option to the bayern team .
his impact was immediate .
latching onto a stunning pass by mehmet scholl , santa cruz charged into the area and delivered a pin-point cross for roy makaay to equalize .
home side pushes for winner bayern dominated the next twenty minutes of the half with the midfield pushing up in a red and white line behind the two strikers as they pushed for the winner .
but berlin were not out of the game and woke up to have their own chances as the agme wore on .
the home team , however , were single-minded in their approach and had many good efforts - and even more terrible , wasted chances - to go ahead .
the best falling to roy makaay in the final minute after bayern had been reduced to 10 men .
in the end , the grinding , physical nature of the game was detrimental to the spectacle and had worn the players down by the time it came to make a difference .
berlin looked happy with their draw but munich looked frustrated by their own wasted chances to push for the top spot in the bundesliga .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.08.2004 germany asks for namibians ' ' forgiveness ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herero men reenact the uprising at omaheke 100 years after its deadly campaign against the herero people of namibia , development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul visited the former colony on saturday .
she asked for the country 's forgiveness . " we germans recognize our historical , political , moral and ethical responsibility and guilt , " the development minister said saturday , choking back tears .
wieczorek-zeul was in namibia to participate in a service commemorating the anniversary of the battle of warterberg 100 years ago .
during the fight , ín what was then the colonial german southwest africa , german soldiers are said to have forced the surviving herero into the omaheke desert and blocked access to all water sources .
thousands died a painful death from starvation and thirst .
between 45,000 and 65,000 herero are believed to have been killed as well as 10,000 from the nama tribe .
german gen. lothar von trotha said at the time he would " wipe them out with rivers of blood . "
historians have described this policy as one of " blatant terrorism " and " shocking brutality . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul " i respectfully commemorate your ancestors who died in the fight against their german oppressors , " wieczorek-zeul told several thousand herero people who gathered at the site of the battle .
" blinded by colonial delusion , " she said , germans brought " violence , discrimination , racism and destruction " to the country .
minister : today it would have been genocide today , she said , the crimes that took place a hundred years ago would have been defined as genocide , and von trotha would have been brought before a criminal tribunal .
" in the name of our common lord , i ask for your forgiveness , " she said , in a statement that was the most far-reaching admission of guilt germany has yet given .
her comments were greeted with light applause from the audience .
but many herero have called on germany to issue an explicit apology for the massacre .
but wieczorek-zeul said that everything she said in her speech should be seen as an apology for the crimes committed under german leadership .
namibia 's minister of lands , hifikepunye pohamba , who is also expected to become the country 's next president , said he accepted the apology " in the name of the namibian people . "
no official apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german marines gather in namibia in 1904 before launching a full-fledged assault on the herero people .
an official apology from berlin as well as the classification of the colonial war as genocide was one of the main demands the herero people had made of the german government .
one herero group is currently suing berlin in united states courts for damages in the billions of dollars .
referring to the lawsuits during a visit to namibia in october , german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to offer an apology that could be used to bolster the case for reparations .
on saturday , wieczorek-zeul pledged further development aid for namibia as well as support for land reforms .
calculated on a per-capita basis , namibia currently receives more development aid from germany than any other african country .
since the country 's independence from south africa in 1990 , it has received more than € 500 million -lrb- $ 619 million -rrb- in german aid .
calls for reconciliation both wieczorek-zeul and representatives of the heroro have called for reconciliation between the descendents of the victims and culprits of the uprising .
" we recall with tears the victims of our ancestors .
today we should make right what was made wrong a hundred years ago , " herero bishop kameeta said .
he called on all namibians to reconcile with themselves and with the descendants of those responsible for the acts of cruelty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero woman wears her traditional headdress .

she asked for the country 's forgiveness . " we germans recognize our historical , political , moral and ethical responsibility and guilt , " the development minister said saturday , choking back tears .
wieczorek-zeul was in namibia to participate in a service commemorating the anniversary of the battle of warterberg 100 years ago .
during the fight , ín what was then the colonial german southwest africa , german soldiers are said to have forced the surviving herero into the omaheke desert and blocked access to all water sources .
thousands died a painful death from starvation and thirst .
between 45,000 and 65,000 herero are believed to have been killed as well as 10,000 from the nama tribe .
german gen. lothar von trotha said at the time he would " wipe them out with rivers of blood . "
historians have described this policy as one of " blatant terrorism " and " shocking brutality . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul " i respectfully commemorate your ancestors who died in the fight against their german oppressors , " wieczorek-zeul told several thousand herero people who gathered at the site of the battle .
" blinded by colonial delusion , " she said , germans brought " violence , discrimination , racism and destruction " to the country .
minister : today it would have been genocide today , she said , the crimes that took place a hundred years ago would have been defined as genocide , and von trotha would have been brought before a criminal tribunal .
" in the name of our common lord , i ask for your forgiveness , " she said , in a statement that was the most far-reaching admission of guilt germany has yet given .
her comments were greeted with light applause from the audience .
but many herero have called on germany to issue an explicit apology for the massacre .
but wieczorek-zeul said that everything she said in her speech should be seen as an apology for the crimes committed under german leadership .
namibia 's minister of lands , hifikepunye pohamba , who is also expected to become the country 's next president , said he accepted the apology " in the name of the namibian people . "
no official apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german marines gather in namibia in 1904 before launching a full-fledged assault on the herero people .
an official apology from berlin as well as the classification of the colonial war as genocide was one of the main demands the herero people had made of the german government .
one herero group is currently suing berlin in united states courts for damages in the billions of dollars .
referring to the lawsuits during a visit to namibia in october , german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to offer an apology that could be used to bolster the case for reparations .
on saturday , wieczorek-zeul pledged further development aid for namibia as well as support for land reforms .
calculated on a per-capita basis , namibia currently receives more development aid from germany than any other african country .
since the country 's independence from south africa in 1990 , it has received more than € 500 million -lrb- $ 619 million -rrb- in german aid .

in germany , many people are rethinking their relationship between work and free time .
but what 's the recipe for success ? most people draw positive emotions and self-affirmation from their work .
it 's also where they place the bulk of their energy .
german researchers recently delved into this seeming paradox and came up with some interesting results .
nowadays , more than ever before , having fun with friends , leisure time and free time is more highly valued than ever before .
even professionals in the it sector , once known as people who burned the midnight oil , have discovered the concept of leisure time .
where are the workaholics ?
munich researchers contracted by the hans böckler foundation recently conducted interviews with software developers , consultants , executives and administrative workers from it companies .
the results ?
people these days are seeking a greater division between their work and private lives .
spending a long evening or even an entire night in front of the screen has fallen out of vogue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people have abandoned entrepreneurship for more stabile working hours others have long appreciated the art of shutting down their computers and leaving work promptly at the end of the day , like angelika .
after years of burning the candle at both ends , the former entrepreneur gave up her independent job to take up a position as an accountant , where she has fixed office hours .
now , angelika 's work gives her the opportunity to use her time a little better .
" my favorite thing is to meet up with nice people and entertain myself , " she says .
" i think it 's great to just be together with other people , but i also need lots of quiet time for myself and like to stay home , too , " the 50-year-old said .
angelika is far from alone .
recent studies have pointed to the new trend of a " comfort culture " among germans .
being comfortable at home is the top priority for most germans surveyed .
in one study , 68 percent of those surveyed said they were satisfied at home if they had a television .
forty percent said all they needed was a radio to be content .
another 46 percent said a newspaper and good food was all they needed .
today 's modern , almost unavoidable amount of possibilities during one 's free time are attracting a lot more people towards leisure - a word that for a long time seemed almost forgotten in germany .
but few will admit that - even today .
" for a long time , i thought , i absolutely have to have a hobby , " said angelika .
" i thought about it a lot with my friends but still found myself unable to find anything .
we were feeling some pretty low self-esteem because we had n't found a hobby .
but then we noticed that we did n't even need one .
we 're happy just wasting our free time - and that 's just fine . "
hobbies can be expensive , but not stressful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at a tango class in münster but some still let the pressure to peform control their free time .
inline skating on mondays , jogging on tuesdays and thursdays and then maybe a dance class and an english brush up course once a week .
however , people who lead that kind of lifestyle must also organize their lives exactly as they do their jobs , and that has its own set of limitations .
on the scale between idleness and someone who pursues many activities during his free time , 48-year-old dental technician norbert says he falls somewhere in between .
" my free time is really valuable to me and i have to admit that i also work to help finance some of my hobbies , " he said .
" i get a certain amount of fulfillment out of my job because i feel a lot of responsibility .
but i can also experience that in my free time . "
at times , norbert says he would like to do more to live out his creative side .
he 's already in a part-time rock band .
but he 's also aware that working as a professional musician he would also experience the same kind of work pressure he has as a dental technician .
the exception : hobby as career others have gone to the other extreme and turned their hobbies into careers .
but with growing labor market crisis , that 's mostly the exception .
take cabaret artist stefan reusch , for example .
in his life , the borders between work and play are completely blurred .
" that 's not really normal free time , " he says .
" when i watch television at night , it 's also part of my work - at least partly . "
the evening news often includes items about chancellor gerhard schröder or opposition leader angela merkel that reusch will later comment on in his comedy show .
" you 're always watching it with one professional ear listening , " too .
if reusch is able to work three days and then have a long break , then he 's quite happy .
to be able to go jogging now and then , ride his bike or play a bit of soccer - there 's no lack of free time activity for reusch on the days he does n't have any work .
" i 'm not saying these are the best ways of using my free time or that i recharge my energy this way , " he says .
" you can also muddle through your spare time . "
most germans do n't want pressure reusch already knows that most germans do n't ideally like to mix their work and free time is .
he also understands the kind of pressure many fall under both before and after work .
" our society is n't ill because of a division of free time and career , rather because both are carried out with such fear .
people jog so they wo n't get too fat or look too old .
they do n't jog for fun , " reusch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for example , if someone works too much during the week , then that person is under more pressure to have fun on saturdays or during free time .
younger people then tend to party through the whole weekend .
fathers tend to do more with their children during that time .
" that means that when the weather is bad and people sit at home , he 's still under pressure and has no way to burn off the steam , " said reusche .

she asked for the country 's forgiveness . " we germans recognize our historical , political , moral and ethical responsibility and guilt , " the development minister said saturday , choking back tears .
wieczorek-zeul was in namibia to participate in a service commemorating the anniversary of the battle of warterberg 100 years ago .
during the fight , ín what was then the colonial german southwest africa , german soldiers are said to have forced the surviving herero into the omaheke desert and blocked access to all water sources .
thousands died a painful death from starvation and thirst .
between 45,000 and 65,000 herero are believed to have been killed as well as 10,000 from the nama tribe .
german gen. lothar von trotha said at the time he would " wipe them out with rivers of blood . "
historians have described this policy as one of " blatant terrorism " and " shocking brutality . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul " i respectfully commemorate your ancestors who died in the fight against their german oppressors , " wieczorek-zeul told several thousand herero people who gathered at the site of the battle .
" blinded by colonial delusion , " she said , germans brought " violence , discrimination , racism and destruction " to the country .
minister : today it would have been genocide today , she said , the crimes that took place a hundred years ago would have been defined as genocide , and von trotha would have been brought before a criminal tribunal .
" in the name of our common lord , i ask for your forgiveness , " she said , in a statement that was the most far-reaching admission of guilt germany has yet given .
her comments were greeted with light applause from the audience .
but many herero have called on germany to issue an explicit apology for the massacre .
but wieczorek-zeul said that everything she said in her speech should be seen as an apology for the crimes committed under german leadership .
namibia 's minister of lands , hifikepunye pohamba , who is also expected to become the country 's next president , said he accepted the apology " in the name of the namibian people . "
no official apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german marines gather in namibia in 1904 before launching a full-fledged assault on the herero people .
an official apology from berlin as well as the classification of the colonial war as genocide was one of the main demands the herero people had made of the german government .
one herero group is currently suing berlin in united states courts for damages in the billions of dollars .
referring to the lawsuits during a visit to namibia in october , german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to offer an apology that could be used to bolster the case for reparations .
on saturday , wieczorek-zeul pledged further development aid for namibia as well as support for land reforms .
calculated on a per-capita basis , namibia currently receives more development aid from germany than any other african country .
since the country 's independence from south africa in 1990 , it has received more than € 500 million -lrb- $ 619 million -rrb- in german aid .
calls for reconciliation both wieczorek-zeul and representatives of the heroro have called for reconciliation between the descendents of the victims and culprits of the uprising .
" we recall with tears the victims of our ancestors .
today we should make right what was made wrong a hundred years ago , " herero bishop kameeta said .
he called on all namibians to reconcile with themselves and with the descendants of those responsible for the acts of cruelty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero woman wears her traditional headdress .
more than 3,000 herero , nama and namibians of german origin gathered in okarara at the foot of the warterberg for saturday 's memorial service .
the day 's events also included reenactments of the fateful battle .
in 1904 , the herero launched a major uprising against their german colonial masters , killing more than 100 germans .
the uprising led germany 's von trotha to order to decimation of the entire herero population .
fortunately , he did not succeed , and today there are again 120,000 herero and 60,000 nama minorities in the country . dw staff -lrb- dsl / afp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a painful reminder of german colonialism wednesday marks the 100th anniversary of germany 's brutal crushing of an ethnic uprising in namibia .

in germany , many people are rethinking their relationship between work and free time .
but what 's the recipe for success ? most people draw positive emotions and self-affirmation from their work .
it 's also where they place the bulk of their energy .
german researchers recently delved into this seeming paradox and came up with some interesting results .
nowadays , more than ever before , having fun with friends , leisure time and free time is more highly valued than ever before .
even professionals in the it sector , once known as people who burned the midnight oil , have discovered the concept of leisure time .
where are the workaholics ?
munich researchers contracted by the hans böckler foundation recently conducted interviews with software developers , consultants , executives and administrative workers from it companies .
the results ?
people these days are seeking a greater division between their work and private lives .
spending a long evening or even an entire night in front of the screen has fallen out of vogue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people have abandoned entrepreneurship for more stabile working hours others have long appreciated the art of shutting down their computers and leaving work promptly at the end of the day , like angelika .
after years of burning the candle at both ends , the former entrepreneur gave up her independent job to take up a position as an accountant , where she has fixed office hours .
now , angelika 's work gives her the opportunity to use her time a little better .
" my favorite thing is to meet up with nice people and entertain myself , " she says .
" i think it 's great to just be together with other people , but i also need lots of quiet time for myself and like to stay home , too , " the 50-year-old said .
angelika is far from alone .
recent studies have pointed to the new trend of a " comfort culture " among germans .
being comfortable at home is the top priority for most germans surveyed .
in one study , 68 percent of those surveyed said they were satisfied at home if they had a television .
forty percent said all they needed was a radio to be content .
another 46 percent said a newspaper and good food was all they needed .
today 's modern , almost unavoidable amount of possibilities during one 's free time are attracting a lot more people towards leisure - a word that for a long time seemed almost forgotten in germany .
but few will admit that - even today .
" for a long time , i thought , i absolutely have to have a hobby , " said angelika .
" i thought about it a lot with my friends but still found myself unable to find anything .
we were feeling some pretty low self-esteem because we had n't found a hobby .
but then we noticed that we did n't even need one .
we 're happy just wasting our free time - and that 's just fine . "
hobbies can be expensive , but not stressful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at a tango class in münster but some still let the pressure to peform control their free time .
inline skating on mondays , jogging on tuesdays and thursdays and then maybe a dance class and an english brush up course once a week .
however , people who lead that kind of lifestyle must also organize their lives exactly as they do their jobs , and that has its own set of limitations .
on the scale between idleness and someone who pursues many activities during his free time , 48-year-old dental technician norbert says he falls somewhere in between .
" my free time is really valuable to me and i have to admit that i also work to help finance some of my hobbies , " he said .
" i get a certain amount of fulfillment out of my job because i feel a lot of responsibility .
but i can also experience that in my free time . "
at times , norbert says he would like to do more to live out his creative side .
he 's already in a part-time rock band .
but he 's also aware that working as a professional musician he would also experience the same kind of work pressure he has as a dental technician .
the exception : hobby as career others have gone to the other extreme and turned their hobbies into careers .
but with growing labor market crisis , that 's mostly the exception .
take cabaret artist stefan reusch , for example .
in his life , the borders between work and play are completely blurred .
" that 's not really normal free time , " he says .
" when i watch television at night , it 's also part of my work - at least partly . "
the evening news often includes items about chancellor gerhard schröder or opposition leader angela merkel that reusch will later comment on in his comedy show .
" you 're always watching it with one professional ear listening , " too .
if reusch is able to work three days and then have a long break , then he 's quite happy .
to be able to go jogging now and then , ride his bike or play a bit of soccer - there 's no lack of free time activity for reusch on the days he does n't have any work .
" i 'm not saying these are the best ways of using my free time or that i recharge my energy this way , " he says .
" you can also muddle through your spare time . "
most germans do n't want pressure reusch already knows that most germans do n't ideally like to mix their work and free time is .
he also understands the kind of pressure many fall under both before and after work .
" our society is n't ill because of a division of free time and career , rather because both are carried out with such fear .
people jog so they wo n't get too fat or look too old .
they do n't jog for fun , " reusch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for example , if someone works too much during the week , then that person is under more pressure to have fun on saturdays or during free time .
younger people then tend to party through the whole weekend .

after years of burning the candle at both ends , the former entrepreneur gave up her independent job to take up a position as an accountant , where she has fixed office hours .

" i think it 's great to just be together with other people , but i also need lots of quiet time for myself and like to stay home , too , " the 50-year-old said .
angelika is far from alone .
recent studies have pointed to the new trend of a " comfort culture " among germans .
being comfortable at home is the top priority for most germans surveyed .
in one study , 68 percent of those surveyed said they were satisfied at home if they had a television .
forty percent said all they needed was a radio to be content .
another 46 percent said a newspaper and good food was all they needed .
today 's modern , almost unavoidable amount of possibilities during one 's free time are attracting a lot more people towards leisure - a word that for a long time seemed almost forgotten in germany .
but few will admit that - even today .
" for a long time , i thought , i absolutely have to have a hobby , " said angelika .
" i thought about it a lot with my friends but still found myself unable to find anything .
we were feeling some pretty low self-esteem because we had n't found a hobby .
but then we noticed that we did n't even need one .
we 're happy just wasting our free time - and that 's just fine . "
hobbies can be expensive , but not stressful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at a tango class in münster but some still let the pressure to peform control their free time .
inline skating on mondays , jogging on tuesdays and thursdays and then maybe a dance class and an english brush up course once a week .
however , people who lead that kind of lifestyle must also organize their lives exactly as they do their jobs , and that has its own set of limitations .
on the scale between idleness and someone who pursues many activities during his free time , 48-year-old dental technician norbert says he falls somewhere in between .
" my free time is really valuable to me and i have to admit that i also work to help finance some of my hobbies , " he said .
" i get a certain amount of fulfillment out of my job because i feel a lot of responsibility .
but i can also experience that in my free time . "
at times , norbert says he would like to do more to live out his creative side .
he 's already in a part-time rock band .
but he 's also aware that working as a professional musician he would also experience the same kind of work pressure he has as a dental technician .
the exception : hobby as career others have gone to the other extreme and turned their hobbies into careers .
but with growing labor market crisis , that 's mostly the exception .
take cabaret artist stefan reusch , for example .
in his life , the borders between work and play are completely blurred .
" that 's not really normal free time , " he says .
" when i watch television at night , it 's also part of my work - at least partly . "
the evening news often includes items about chancellor gerhard schröder or opposition leader angela merkel that reusch will later comment on in his comedy show .
" you 're always watching it with one professional ear listening , " too .
if reusch is able to work three days and then have a long break , then he 's quite happy .

in germany , many people are rethinking their relationship between work and free time .
but what 's the recipe for success ? most people draw positive emotions and self-affirmation from their work .
it 's also where they place the bulk of their energy .
german researchers recently delved into this seeming paradox and came up with some interesting results .
nowadays , more than ever before , having fun with friends , leisure time and free time is more highly valued than ever before .
even professionals in the it sector , once known as people who burned the midnight oil , have discovered the concept of leisure time .
where are the workaholics ?
munich researchers contracted by the hans böckler foundation recently conducted interviews with software developers , consultants , executives and administrative workers from it companies .
the results ?
people these days are seeking a greater division between their work and private lives .
spending a long evening or even an entire night in front of the screen has fallen out of vogue .

she asked for the country 's forgiveness . " we germans recognize our historical , political , moral and ethical responsibility and guilt , " the development minister said saturday , choking back tears .
wieczorek-zeul was in namibia to participate in a service commemorating the anniversary of the battle of warterberg 100 years ago .
during the fight , ín what was then the colonial german southwest africa , german soldiers are said to have forced the surviving herero into the omaheke desert and blocked access to all water sources .
thousands died a painful death from starvation and thirst .
between 45,000 and 65,000 herero are believed to have been killed as well as 10,000 from the nama tribe .
german gen. lothar von trotha said at the time he would " wipe them out with rivers of blood . "
historians have described this policy as one of " blatant terrorism " and " shocking brutality . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul " i respectfully commemorate your ancestors who died in the fight against their german oppressors , " wieczorek-zeul told several thousand herero people who gathered at the site of the battle .
" blinded by colonial delusion , " she said , germans brought " violence , discrimination , racism and destruction " to the country .
minister : today it would have been genocide today , she said , the crimes that took place a hundred years ago would have been defined as genocide , and von trotha would have been brought before a criminal tribunal .
" in the name of our common lord , i ask for your forgiveness , " she said , in a statement that was the most far-reaching admission of guilt germany has yet given .
her comments were greeted with light applause from the audience .
but many herero have called on germany to issue an explicit apology for the massacre .
but wieczorek-zeul said that everything she said in her speech should be seen as an apology for the crimes committed under german leadership .
namibia 's minister of lands , hifikepunye pohamba , who is also expected to become the country 's next president , said he accepted the apology " in the name of the namibian people . "
no official apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german marines gather in namibia in 1904 before launching a full-fledged assault on the herero people .
an official apology from berlin as well as the classification of the colonial war as genocide was one of the main demands the herero people had made of the german government .
one herero group is currently suing berlin in united states courts for damages in the billions of dollars .
referring to the lawsuits during a visit to namibia in october , german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to offer an apology that could be used to bolster the case for reparations .
on saturday , wieczorek-zeul pledged further development aid for namibia as well as support for land reforms .
calculated on a per-capita basis , namibia currently receives more development aid from germany than any other african country .
since the country 's independence from south africa in 1990 , it has received more than € 500 million -lrb- $ 619 million -rrb- in german aid .
calls for reconciliation both wieczorek-zeul and representatives of the heroro have called for reconciliation between the descendents of the victims and culprits of the uprising .
" we recall with tears the victims of our ancestors .
today we should make right what was made wrong a hundred years ago , " herero bishop kameeta said .
he called on all namibians to reconcile with themselves and with the descendants of those responsible for the acts of cruelty .

more than 3,000 herero , nama and namibians of german origin gathered in okarara at the foot of the warterberg for saturday 's memorial service .
the day 's events also included reenactments of the fateful battle .
in 1904 , the herero launched a major uprising against their german colonial masters , killing more than 100 germans .
the uprising led germany 's von trotha to order to decimation of the entire herero population .

she asked for the country 's forgiveness . " we germans recognize our historical , political , moral and ethical responsibility and guilt , " the development minister said saturday , choking back tears .
wieczorek-zeul was in namibia to participate in a service commemorating the anniversary of the battle of warterberg 100 years ago .
during the fight , ín what was then the colonial german southwest africa , german soldiers are said to have forced the surviving herero into the omaheke desert and blocked access to all water sources .
thousands died a painful death from starvation and thirst .
between 45,000 and 65,000 herero are believed to have been killed as well as 10,000 from the nama tribe .
german gen. lothar von trotha said at the time he would " wipe them out with rivers of blood . "
historians have described this policy as one of " blatant terrorism " and " shocking brutality . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul " i respectfully commemorate your ancestors who died in the fight against their german oppressors , " wieczorek-zeul told several thousand herero people who gathered at the site of the battle .
" blinded by colonial delusion , " she said , germans brought " violence , discrimination , racism and destruction " to the country .
minister : today it would have been genocide today , she said , the crimes that took place a hundred years ago would have been defined as genocide , and von trotha would have been brought before a criminal tribunal .
" in the name of our common lord , i ask for your forgiveness , " she said , in a statement that was the most far-reaching admission of guilt germany has yet given .
her comments were greeted with light applause from the audience .
but many herero have called on germany to issue an explicit apology for the massacre .
but wieczorek-zeul said that everything she said in her speech should be seen as an apology for the crimes committed under german leadership .
namibia 's minister of lands , hifikepunye pohamba , who is also expected to become the country 's next president , said he accepted the apology " in the name of the namibian people . "
no official apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german marines gather in namibia in 1904 before launching a full-fledged assault on the herero people .
an official apology from berlin as well as the classification of the colonial war as genocide was one of the main demands the herero people had made of the german government .
one herero group is currently suing berlin in united states courts for damages in the billions of dollars .
referring to the lawsuits during a visit to namibia in october , german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to offer an apology that could be used to bolster the case for reparations .

after scoring two wonderful goals through their midfielders michael ballack and sebastian deisler , bayern were looking for more of the same from their marauding players , packing the midfield with five stars and leaving roy makaay up front alone for the visit of hertha bsc berlin .
berlin , denied a victory at bochum last week , were looking to get into winning ways in the olympic stadium and employed fredi bobic as a second striker beside wichniarek , with brazilian flair backing them up in marcelinho and gilberto .
the first half started off as if a classic would unfold with both sides piling forward in wave after wave of attack in search of the early break-through .
the frantic start also brought the first signature tackles from the ' hard men ' of both teams letting their opponents know they were there .
thorsten frings for munich and niko kovac of berlin were both involved in heavy challenges and this physicality , rather than the attacking ideas of the few minutes , would later become a dominant theme of the first half .

a searching ball into the bayern area appeared to catch a berlin attacker offside but the flag and whistle never came and it was left to marcelinho to lash a wicked shot past oliver kahn from close range .
bayern went in search of parity straight away but soon their ideas petered out with star midfielder deisler the main culprit in the profilgacy which was to dominate munich 's first half .
time and time again the young midfielder sent high balls over the defense in search of players who were n't there or skied speculative long range efforts over the bar , sending the ball scuttling across the athetics track behind the berlin goal .
match becomes a battle in their frustration , the bayern players began a physical game which resulted in a flurry of free-kicks and cards for both teams as the game lost rhythm and shape .
berlin chose to defend the narrow lead , forcing bayern to take the game to them .
however , the creative flair of bayern 's stars seemed dampened by the resilience of their opponents and frustration crept in .
the second half started as a dream for bayern .
roque santa cruz replaced ze roberto at the break and added another attacking option to the bayern team .
his impact was immediate .
latching onto a stunning pass by mehmet scholl , santa cruz charged into the area and delivered a pin-point cross for roy makaay to equalize .
home side pushes for winner bayern dominated the next twenty minutes of the half with the midfield pushing up in a red and white line behind the two strikers as they pushed for the winner .

the home team , however , were single-minded in their approach and had many good efforts - and even more terrible , wasted chances - to go ahead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.08.2004 germany asks for namibians ' ' forgiveness ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herero men reenact the uprising at omaheke 100 years after its deadly campaign against the herero people of namibia , development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul visited the former colony on saturday .
she asked for the country 's forgiveness . " we germans recognize our historical , political , moral and ethical responsibility and guilt , " the development minister said saturday , choking back tears .
wieczorek-zeul was in namibia to participate in a service commemorating the anniversary of the battle of warterberg 100 years ago .
during the fight , ín what was then the colonial german southwest africa , german soldiers are said to have forced the surviving herero into the omaheke desert and blocked access to all water sources .
thousands died a painful death from starvation and thirst .
between 45,000 and 65,000 herero are believed to have been killed as well as 10,000 from the nama tribe .
german gen. lothar von trotha said at the time he would " wipe them out with rivers of blood . "
historians have described this policy as one of " blatant terrorism " and " shocking brutality . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul " i respectfully commemorate your ancestors who died in the fight against their german oppressors , " wieczorek-zeul told several thousand herero people who gathered at the site of the battle .
" blinded by colonial delusion , " she said , germans brought " violence , discrimination , racism and destruction " to the country .
minister : today it would have been genocide today , she said , the crimes that took place a hundred years ago would have been defined as genocide , and von trotha would have been brought before a criminal tribunal .
" in the name of our common lord , i ask for your forgiveness , " she said , in a statement that was the most far-reaching admission of guilt germany has yet given .
her comments were greeted with light applause from the audience .
but many herero have called on germany to issue an explicit apology for the massacre .
but wieczorek-zeul said that everything she said in her speech should be seen as an apology for the crimes committed under german leadership .
namibia 's minister of lands , hifikepunye pohamba , who is also expected to become the country 's next president , said he accepted the apology " in the name of the namibian people . "
no official apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german marines gather in namibia in 1904 before launching a full-fledged assault on the herero people .
an official apology from berlin as well as the classification of the colonial war as genocide was one of the main demands the herero people had made of the german government .
one herero group is currently suing berlin in united states courts for damages in the billions of dollars .
referring to the lawsuits during a visit to namibia in october , german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to offer an apology that could be used to bolster the case for reparations .
on saturday , wieczorek-zeul pledged further development aid for namibia as well as support for land reforms .
calculated on a per-capita basis , namibia currently receives more development aid from germany than any other african country .
since the country 's independence from south africa in 1990 , it has received more than € 500 million -lrb- $ 619 million -rrb- in german aid .
calls for reconciliation both wieczorek-zeul and representatives of the heroro have called for reconciliation between the descendents of the victims and culprits of the uprising .
" we recall with tears the victims of our ancestors .
today we should make right what was made wrong a hundred years ago , " herero bishop kameeta said .
he called on all namibians to reconcile with themselves and with the descendants of those responsible for the acts of cruelty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero woman wears her traditional headdress .
more than 3,000 herero , nama and namibians of german origin gathered in okarara at the foot of the warterberg for saturday 's memorial service .
the day 's events also included reenactments of the fateful battle .
in 1904 , the herero launched a major uprising against their german colonial masters , killing more than 100 germans .
the uprising led germany 's von trotha to order to decimation of the entire herero population .
fortunately , he did not succeed , and today there are again 120,000 herero and 60,000 nama minorities in the country . dw staff -lrb- dsl / afp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a painful reminder of german colonialism wednesday marks the 100th anniversary of germany 's brutal crushing of an ethnic uprising in namibia .
but reconciliation has been marred by a lawsuit filed by namibia 's ethnic herero people against german companies .

in germany , many people are rethinking their relationship between work and free time .
but what 's the recipe for success ? most people draw positive emotions and self-affirmation from their work .
it 's also where they place the bulk of their energy .
german researchers recently delved into this seeming paradox and came up with some interesting results .
nowadays , more than ever before , having fun with friends , leisure time and free time is more highly valued than ever before .
even professionals in the it sector , once known as people who burned the midnight oil , have discovered the concept of leisure time .
where are the workaholics ?
munich researchers contracted by the hans böckler foundation recently conducted interviews with software developers , consultants , executives and administrative workers from it companies .
the results ?
people these days are seeking a greater division between their work and private lives .
spending a long evening or even an entire night in front of the screen has fallen out of vogue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people have abandoned entrepreneurship for more stabile working hours others have long appreciated the art of shutting down their computers and leaving work promptly at the end of the day , like angelika .
after years of burning the candle at both ends , the former entrepreneur gave up her independent job to take up a position as an accountant , where she has fixed office hours .
now , angelika 's work gives her the opportunity to use her time a little better .
" my favorite thing is to meet up with nice people and entertain myself , " she says .
" i think it 's great to just be together with other people , but i also need lots of quiet time for myself and like to stay home , too , " the 50-year-old said .
angelika is far from alone .
recent studies have pointed to the new trend of a " comfort culture " among germans .
being comfortable at home is the top priority for most germans surveyed .
in one study , 68 percent of those surveyed said they were satisfied at home if they had a television .
forty percent said all they needed was a radio to be content .
another 46 percent said a newspaper and good food was all they needed .
today 's modern , almost unavoidable amount of possibilities during one 's free time are attracting a lot more people towards leisure - a word that for a long time seemed almost forgotten in germany .
but few will admit that - even today .
" for a long time , i thought , i absolutely have to have a hobby , " said angelika .
" i thought about it a lot with my friends but still found myself unable to find anything .
we were feeling some pretty low self-esteem because we had n't found a hobby .
but then we noticed that we did n't even need one .
we 're happy just wasting our free time - and that 's just fine . "
hobbies can be expensive , but not stressful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at a tango class in münster but some still let the pressure to peform control their free time .
inline skating on mondays , jogging on tuesdays and thursdays and then maybe a dance class and an english brush up course once a week .
however , people who lead that kind of lifestyle must also organize their lives exactly as they do their jobs , and that has its own set of limitations .
on the scale between idleness and someone who pursues many activities during his free time , 48-year-old dental technician norbert says he falls somewhere in between .
" my free time is really valuable to me and i have to admit that i also work to help finance some of my hobbies , " he said .
" i get a certain amount of fulfillment out of my job because i feel a lot of responsibility .
but i can also experience that in my free time . "
at times , norbert says he would like to do more to live out his creative side .
he 's already in a part-time rock band .
but he 's also aware that working as a professional musician he would also experience the same kind of work pressure he has as a dental technician .
the exception : hobby as career others have gone to the other extreme and turned their hobbies into careers .
but with growing labor market crisis , that 's mostly the exception .
take cabaret artist stefan reusch , for example .
in his life , the borders between work and play are completely blurred .
" that 's not really normal free time , " he says .
" when i watch television at night , it 's also part of my work - at least partly . "
the evening news often includes items about chancellor gerhard schröder or opposition leader angela merkel that reusch will later comment on in his comedy show .
" you 're always watching it with one professional ear listening , " too .
if reusch is able to work three days and then have a long break , then he 's quite happy .
to be able to go jogging now and then , ride his bike or play a bit of soccer - there 's no lack of free time activity for reusch on the days he does n't have any work .
" i 'm not saying these are the best ways of using my free time or that i recharge my energy this way , " he says .
" you can also muddle through your spare time . "
most germans do n't want pressure reusch already knows that most germans do n't ideally like to mix their work and free time is .
he also understands the kind of pressure many fall under both before and after work .
" our society is n't ill because of a division of free time and career , rather because both are carried out with such fear .
people jog so they wo n't get too fat or look too old .
they do n't jog for fun , " reusch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for example , if someone works too much during the week , then that person is under more pressure to have fun on saturdays or during free time .
younger people then tend to party through the whole weekend .
fathers tend to do more with their children during that time .
" that means that when the weather is bad and people sit at home , he 's still under pressure and has no way to burn off the steam , " said reusche .

she asked for the country 's forgiveness . " we germans recognize our historical , political , moral and ethical responsibility and guilt , " the development minister said saturday , choking back tears .
wieczorek-zeul was in namibia to participate in a service commemorating the anniversary of the battle of warterberg 100 years ago .
during the fight , ín what was then the colonial german southwest africa , german soldiers are said to have forced the surviving herero into the omaheke desert and blocked access to all water sources .
thousands died a painful death from starvation and thirst .
between 45,000 and 65,000 herero are believed to have been killed as well as 10,000 from the nama tribe .
german gen. lothar von trotha said at the time he would " wipe them out with rivers of blood . "
historians have described this policy as one of " blatant terrorism " and " shocking brutality . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul " i respectfully commemorate your ancestors who died in the fight against their german oppressors , " wieczorek-zeul told several thousand herero people who gathered at the site of the battle .
" blinded by colonial delusion , " she said , germans brought " violence , discrimination , racism and destruction " to the country .
minister : today it would have been genocide today , she said , the crimes that took place a hundred years ago would have been defined as genocide , and von trotha would have been brought before a criminal tribunal .
" in the name of our common lord , i ask for your forgiveness , " she said , in a statement that was the most far-reaching admission of guilt germany has yet given .
her comments were greeted with light applause from the audience .
but many herero have called on germany to issue an explicit apology for the massacre .
but wieczorek-zeul said that everything she said in her speech should be seen as an apology for the crimes committed under german leadership .
namibia 's minister of lands , hifikepunye pohamba , who is also expected to become the country 's next president , said he accepted the apology " in the name of the namibian people . "
no official apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german marines gather in namibia in 1904 before launching a full-fledged assault on the herero people .
an official apology from berlin as well as the classification of the colonial war as genocide was one of the main demands the herero people had made of the german government .
one herero group is currently suing berlin in united states courts for damages in the billions of dollars .
referring to the lawsuits during a visit to namibia in october , german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to offer an apology that could be used to bolster the case for reparations .
on saturday , wieczorek-zeul pledged further development aid for namibia as well as support for land reforms .
calculated on a per-capita basis , namibia currently receives more development aid from germany than any other african country .
since the country 's independence from south africa in 1990 , it has received more than € 500 million -lrb- $ 619 million -rrb- in german aid .
calls for reconciliation both wieczorek-zeul and representatives of the heroro have called for reconciliation between the descendents of the victims and culprits of the uprising .
" we recall with tears the victims of our ancestors .
today we should make right what was made wrong a hundred years ago , " herero bishop kameeta said .
he called on all namibians to reconcile with themselves and with the descendants of those responsible for the acts of cruelty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero woman wears her traditional headdress .
more than 3,000 herero , nama and namibians of german origin gathered in okarara at the foot of the warterberg for saturday 's memorial service .
the day 's events also included reenactments of the fateful battle .
in 1904 , the herero launched a major uprising against their german colonial masters , killing more than 100 germans .
the uprising led germany 's von trotha to order to decimation of the entire herero population .
fortunately , he did not succeed , and today there are again 120,000 herero and 60,000 nama minorities in the country . dw staff -lrb- dsl / afp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a painful reminder of german colonialism wednesday marks the 100th anniversary of germany 's brutal crushing of an ethnic uprising in namibia .

after scoring two wonderful goals through their midfielders michael ballack and sebastian deisler , bayern were looking for more of the same from their marauding players , packing the midfield with five stars and leaving roy makaay up front alone for the visit of hertha bsc berlin .
berlin , denied a victory at bochum last week , were looking to get into winning ways in the olympic stadium and employed fredi bobic as a second striker beside wichniarek , with brazilian flair backing them up in marcelinho and gilberto .
the first half started off as if a classic would unfold with both sides piling forward in wave after wave of attack in search of the early break-through .
the frantic start also brought the first signature tackles from the ' hard men ' of both teams letting their opponents know they were there .
thorsten frings for munich and niko kovac of berlin were both involved in heavy challenges and this physicality , rather than the attacking ideas of the few minutes , would later become a dominant theme of the first half .

a searching ball into the bayern area appeared to catch a berlin attacker offside but the flag and whistle never came and it was left to marcelinho to lash a wicked shot past oliver kahn from close range .
bayern went in search of parity straight away but soon their ideas petered out with star midfielder deisler the main culprit in the profilgacy which was to dominate munich 's first half .
time and time again the young midfielder sent high balls over the defense in search of players who were n't there or skied speculative long range efforts over the bar , sending the ball scuttling across the athetics track behind the berlin goal .
match becomes a battle in their frustration , the bayern players began a physical game which resulted in a flurry of free-kicks and cards for both teams as the game lost rhythm and shape .
berlin chose to defend the narrow lead , forcing bayern to take the game to them .
however , the creative flair of bayern 's stars seemed dampened by the resilience of their opponents and frustration crept in .
the second half started as a dream for bayern .
roque santa cruz replaced ze roberto at the break and added another attacking option to the bayern team .
his impact was immediate .
latching onto a stunning pass by mehmet scholl , santa cruz charged into the area and delivered a pin-point cross for roy makaay to equalize .

wieczorek-zeul was in namibia to participate in a service commemorating the anniversary of the battle of warterberg 100 years ago .
during the fight , ín what was then the colonial german southwest africa , german soldiers are said to have forced the surviving herero into the omaheke desert and blocked access to all water sources .
thousands died a painful death from starvation and thirst .
between 45,000 and 65,000 herero are believed to have been killed as well as 10,000 from the nama tribe .

namibia 's minister of lands , hifikepunye pohamba , who is also expected to become the country 's next president , said he accepted the apology " in the name of the namibian people . "
no official apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german marines gather in namibia in 1904 before launching a full-fledged assault on the herero people .
an official apology from berlin as well as the classification of the colonial war as genocide was one of the main demands the herero people had made of the german government .
one herero group is currently suing berlin in united states courts for damages in the billions of dollars .
referring to the lawsuits during a visit to namibia in october , german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to offer an apology that could be used to bolster the case for reparations .
on saturday , wieczorek-zeul pledged further development aid for namibia as well as support for land reforms .
calculated on a per-capita basis , namibia currently receives more development aid from germany than any other african country .
since the country 's independence from south africa in 1990 , it has received more than € 500 million -lrb- $ 619 million -rrb- in german aid .
calls for reconciliation both wieczorek-zeul and representatives of the heroro have called for reconciliation between the descendents of the victims and culprits of the uprising .
" we recall with tears the victims of our ancestors .
today we should make right what was made wrong a hundred years ago , " herero bishop kameeta said .
he called on all namibians to reconcile with themselves and with the descendants of those responsible for the acts of cruelty .

after scoring two wonderful goals through their midfielders michael ballack and sebastian deisler , bayern were looking for more of the same from their marauding players , packing the midfield with five stars and leaving roy makaay up front alone for the visit of hertha bsc berlin .
berlin , denied a victory at bochum last week , were looking to get into winning ways in the olympic stadium and employed fredi bobic as a second striker beside wichniarek , with brazilian flair backing them up in marcelinho and gilberto .
the first half started off as if a classic would unfold with both sides piling forward in wave after wave of attack in search of the early break-through .
the frantic start also brought the first signature tackles from the ' hard men ' of both teams letting their opponents know they were there .
thorsten frings for munich and niko kovac of berlin were both involved in heavy challenges and this physicality , rather than the attacking ideas of the few minutes , would later become a dominant theme of the first half .
samba style rocks bayern berlin settled quicker and pegged the bavarians back for a good ten minutes before the deadlock was broken .
a searching ball into the bayern area appeared to catch a berlin attacker offside but the flag and whistle never came and it was left to marcelinho to lash a wicked shot past oliver kahn from close range .
bayern went in search of parity straight away but soon their ideas petered out with star midfielder deisler the main culprit in the profilgacy which was to dominate munich 's first half .
time and time again the young midfielder sent high balls over the defense in search of players who were n't there or skied speculative long range efforts over the bar , sending the ball scuttling across the athetics track behind the berlin goal .
match becomes a battle in their frustration , the bayern players began a physical game which resulted in a flurry of free-kicks and cards for both teams as the game lost rhythm and shape .
berlin chose to defend the narrow lead , forcing bayern to take the game to them .
however , the creative flair of bayern 's stars seemed dampened by the resilience of their opponents and frustration crept in .
the second half started as a dream for bayern .
roque santa cruz replaced ze roberto at the break and added another attacking option to the bayern team .
his impact was immediate .
latching onto a stunning pass by mehmet scholl , santa cruz charged into the area and delivered a pin-point cross for roy makaay to equalize .
home side pushes for winner bayern dominated the next twenty minutes of the half with the midfield pushing up in a red and white line behind the two strikers as they pushed for the winner .
but berlin were not out of the game and woke up to have their own chances as the agme wore on .
the home team , however , were single-minded in their approach and had many good efforts - and even more terrible , wasted chances - to go ahead .
the best falling to roy makaay in the final minute after bayern had been reduced to 10 men .
in the end , the grinding , physical nature of the game was detrimental to the spectacle and had worn the players down by the time it came to make a difference .
berlin looked happy with their draw but munich looked frustrated by their own wasted chances to push for the top spot in the bundesliga .

after scoring two wonderful goals through their midfielders michael ballack and sebastian deisler , bayern were looking for more of the same from their marauding players , packing the midfield with five stars and leaving roy makaay up front alone for the visit of hertha bsc berlin .
berlin , denied a victory at bochum last week , were looking to get into winning ways in the olympic stadium and employed fredi bobic as a second striker beside wichniarek , with brazilian flair backing them up in marcelinho and gilberto .
the first half started off as if a classic would unfold with both sides piling forward in wave after wave of attack in search of the early break-through .
the frantic start also brought the first signature tackles from the ' hard men ' of both teams letting their opponents know they were there .
thorsten frings for munich and niko kovac of berlin were both involved in heavy challenges and this physicality , rather than the attacking ideas of the few minutes , would later become a dominant theme of the first half .
samba style rocks bayern berlin settled quicker and pegged the bavarians back for a good ten minutes before the deadlock was broken .
a searching ball into the bayern area appeared to catch a berlin attacker offside but the flag and whistle never came and it was left to marcelinho to lash a wicked shot past oliver kahn from close range .
bayern went in search of parity straight away but soon their ideas petered out with star midfielder deisler the main culprit in the profilgacy which was to dominate munich 's first half .
time and time again the young midfielder sent high balls over the defense in search of players who were n't there or skied speculative long range efforts over the bar , sending the ball scuttling across the athetics track behind the berlin goal .
match becomes a battle in their frustration , the bayern players began a physical game which resulted in a flurry of free-kicks and cards for both teams as the game lost rhythm and shape .
berlin chose to defend the narrow lead , forcing bayern to take the game to them .
however , the creative flair of bayern 's stars seemed dampened by the resilience of their opponents and frustration crept in .
the second half started as a dream for bayern .
roque santa cruz replaced ze roberto at the break and added another attacking option to the bayern team .
his impact was immediate .
latching onto a stunning pass by mehmet scholl , santa cruz charged into the area and delivered a pin-point cross for roy makaay to equalize .
home side pushes for winner bayern dominated the next twenty minutes of the half with the midfield pushing up in a red and white line behind the two strikers as they pushed for the winner .
but berlin were not out of the game and woke up to have their own chances as the agme wore on .
the home team , however , were single-minded in their approach and had many good efforts - and even more terrible , wasted chances - to go ahead .
the best falling to roy makaay in the final minute after bayern had been reduced to 10 men .
in the end , the grinding , physical nature of the game was detrimental to the spectacle and had worn the players down by the time it came to make a difference .
berlin looked happy with their draw but munich looked frustrated by their own wasted chances to push for the top spot in the bundesliga .

in germany , many people are rethinking their relationship between work and free time .
but what 's the recipe for success ? most people draw positive emotions and self-affirmation from their work .
it 's also where they place the bulk of their energy .
german researchers recently delved into this seeming paradox and came up with some interesting results .
nowadays , more than ever before , having fun with friends , leisure time and free time is more highly valued than ever before .
even professionals in the it sector , once known as people who burned the midnight oil , have discovered the concept of leisure time .
where are the workaholics ?
munich researchers contracted by the hans böckler foundation recently conducted interviews with software developers , consultants , executives and administrative workers from it companies .
the results ?
people these days are seeking a greater division between their work and private lives .
spending a long evening or even an entire night in front of the screen has fallen out of vogue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people have abandoned entrepreneurship for more stabile working hours others have long appreciated the art of shutting down their computers and leaving work promptly at the end of the day , like angelika .
after years of burning the candle at both ends , the former entrepreneur gave up her independent job to take up a position as an accountant , where she has fixed office hours .
now , angelika 's work gives her the opportunity to use her time a little better .
" my favorite thing is to meet up with nice people and entertain myself , " she says .
" i think it 's great to just be together with other people , but i also need lots of quiet time for myself and like to stay home , too , " the 50-year-old said .
angelika is far from alone .
recent studies have pointed to the new trend of a " comfort culture " among germans .
being comfortable at home is the top priority for most germans surveyed .
in one study , 68 percent of those surveyed said they were satisfied at home if they had a television .
forty percent said all they needed was a radio to be content .
another 46 percent said a newspaper and good food was all they needed .
today 's modern , almost unavoidable amount of possibilities during one 's free time are attracting a lot more people towards leisure - a word that for a long time seemed almost forgotten in germany .
but few will admit that - even today .
" for a long time , i thought , i absolutely have to have a hobby , " said angelika .
" i thought about it a lot with my friends but still found myself unable to find anything .
we were feeling some pretty low self-esteem because we had n't found a hobby .
but then we noticed that we did n't even need one .
we 're happy just wasting our free time - and that 's just fine . "
hobbies can be expensive , but not stressful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at a tango class in münster but some still let the pressure to peform control their free time .
inline skating on mondays , jogging on tuesdays and thursdays and then maybe a dance class and an english brush up course once a week .
however , people who lead that kind of lifestyle must also organize their lives exactly as they do their jobs , and that has its own set of limitations .
on the scale between idleness and someone who pursues many activities during his free time , 48-year-old dental technician norbert says he falls somewhere in between .
" my free time is really valuable to me and i have to admit that i also work to help finance some of my hobbies , " he said .
" i get a certain amount of fulfillment out of my job because i feel a lot of responsibility .
but i can also experience that in my free time . "
at times , norbert says he would like to do more to live out his creative side .
he 's already in a part-time rock band .
but he 's also aware that working as a professional musician he would also experience the same kind of work pressure he has as a dental technician .
the exception : hobby as career others have gone to the other extreme and turned their hobbies into careers .
but with growing labor market crisis , that 's mostly the exception .
take cabaret artist stefan reusch , for example .
in his life , the borders between work and play are completely blurred .
" that 's not really normal free time , " he says .
" when i watch television at night , it 's also part of my work - at least partly . "
the evening news often includes items about chancellor gerhard schröder or opposition leader angela merkel that reusch will later comment on in his comedy show .
" you 're always watching it with one professional ear listening , " too .
if reusch is able to work three days and then have a long break , then he 's quite happy .
to be able to go jogging now and then , ride his bike or play a bit of soccer - there 's no lack of free time activity for reusch on the days he does n't have any work .
" i 'm not saying these are the best ways of using my free time or that i recharge my energy this way , " he says .
" you can also muddle through your spare time . "
most germans do n't want pressure reusch already knows that most germans do n't ideally like to mix their work and free time is .
he also understands the kind of pressure many fall under both before and after work .
" our society is n't ill because of a division of free time and career , rather because both are carried out with such fear .
people jog so they wo n't get too fat or look too old .
they do n't jog for fun , " reusch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for example , if someone works too much during the week , then that person is under more pressure to have fun on saturdays or during free time .
younger people then tend to party through the whole weekend .
fathers tend to do more with their children during that time .
" that means that when the weather is bad and people sit at home , he 's still under pressure and has no way to burn off the steam , " said reusche .

in germany , many people are rethinking their relationship between work and free time .

it 's also where they place the bulk of their energy .
german researchers recently delved into this seeming paradox and came up with some interesting results .
nowadays , more than ever before , having fun with friends , leisure time and free time is more highly valued than ever before .
even professionals in the it sector , once known as people who burned the midnight oil , have discovered the concept of leisure time .
where are the workaholics ?
munich researchers contracted by the hans böckler foundation recently conducted interviews with software developers , consultants , executives and administrative workers from it companies .

angelika is far from alone .
recent studies have pointed to the new trend of a " comfort culture " among germans .
being comfortable at home is the top priority for most germans surveyed .
in one study , 68 percent of those surveyed said they were satisfied at home if they had a television .
forty percent said all they needed was a radio to be content .
another 46 percent said a newspaper and good food was all they needed .
today 's modern , almost unavoidable amount of possibilities during one 's free time are attracting a lot more people towards leisure - a word that for a long time seemed almost forgotten in germany .
but few will admit that - even today .
" for a long time , i thought , i absolutely have to have a hobby , " said angelika .
" i thought about it a lot with my friends but still found myself unable to find anything .

in germany , many people are rethinking their relationship between work and free time .
but what 's the recipe for success ? most people draw positive emotions and self-affirmation from their work .
it 's also where they place the bulk of their energy .
german researchers recently delved into this seeming paradox and came up with some interesting results .
nowadays , more than ever before , having fun with friends , leisure time and free time is more highly valued than ever before .
even professionals in the it sector , once known as people who burned the midnight oil , have discovered the concept of leisure time .
where are the workaholics ?
munich researchers contracted by the hans böckler foundation recently conducted interviews with software developers , consultants , executives and administrative workers from it companies .
the results ?
people these days are seeking a greater division between their work and private lives .
spending a long evening or even an entire night in front of the screen has fallen out of vogue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people have abandoned entrepreneurship for more stabile working hours others have long appreciated the art of shutting down their computers and leaving work promptly at the end of the day , like angelika .
after years of burning the candle at both ends , the former entrepreneur gave up her independent job to take up a position as an accountant , where she has fixed office hours .
now , angelika 's work gives her the opportunity to use her time a little better .
" my favorite thing is to meet up with nice people and entertain myself , " she says .
" i think it 's great to just be together with other people , but i also need lots of quiet time for myself and like to stay home , too , " the 50-year-old said .
angelika is far from alone .
recent studies have pointed to the new trend of a " comfort culture " among germans .
being comfortable at home is the top priority for most germans surveyed .
in one study , 68 percent of those surveyed said they were satisfied at home if they had a television .
forty percent said all they needed was a radio to be content .
another 46 percent said a newspaper and good food was all they needed .
today 's modern , almost unavoidable amount of possibilities during one 's free time are attracting a lot more people towards leisure - a word that for a long time seemed almost forgotten in germany .
but few will admit that - even today .

" i think it 's great to just be together with other people , but i also need lots of quiet time for myself and like to stay home , too , " the 50-year-old said .
angelika is far from alone .
recent studies have pointed to the new trend of a " comfort culture " among germans .
being comfortable at home is the top priority for most germans surveyed .
in one study , 68 percent of those surveyed said they were satisfied at home if they had a television .
forty percent said all they needed was a radio to be content .
another 46 percent said a newspaper and good food was all they needed .
today 's modern , almost unavoidable amount of possibilities during one 's free time are attracting a lot more people towards leisure - a word that for a long time seemed almost forgotten in germany .
but few will admit that - even today .
" for a long time , i thought , i absolutely have to have a hobby , " said angelika .
" i thought about it a lot with my friends but still found myself unable to find anything .
we were feeling some pretty low self-esteem because we had n't found a hobby .
but then we noticed that we did n't even need one .
we 're happy just wasting our free time - and that 's just fine . "
hobbies can be expensive , but not stressful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at a tango class in münster but some still let the pressure to peform control their free time .
inline skating on mondays , jogging on tuesdays and thursdays and then maybe a dance class and an english brush up course once a week .
however , people who lead that kind of lifestyle must also organize their lives exactly as they do their jobs , and that has its own set of limitations .
on the scale between idleness and someone who pursues many activities during his free time , 48-year-old dental technician norbert says he falls somewhere in between .
" my free time is really valuable to me and i have to admit that i also work to help finance some of my hobbies , " he said .
" i get a certain amount of fulfillment out of my job because i feel a lot of responsibility .
but i can also experience that in my free time . "
at times , norbert says he would like to do more to live out his creative side .
he 's already in a part-time rock band .
but he 's also aware that working as a professional musician he would also experience the same kind of work pressure he has as a dental technician .
the exception : hobby as career others have gone to the other extreme and turned their hobbies into careers .
but with growing labor market crisis , that 's mostly the exception .
take cabaret artist stefan reusch , for example .
in his life , the borders between work and play are completely blurred .
" that 's not really normal free time , " he says .
" when i watch television at night , it 's also part of my work - at least partly . "
the evening news often includes items about chancellor gerhard schröder or opposition leader angela merkel that reusch will later comment on in his comedy show .
" you 're always watching it with one professional ear listening , " too .
if reusch is able to work three days and then have a long break , then he 's quite happy .
to be able to go jogging now and then , ride his bike or play a bit of soccer - there 's no lack of free time activity for reusch on the days he does n't have any work .
" i 'm not saying these are the best ways of using my free time or that i recharge my energy this way , " he says .
" you can also muddle through your spare time . "
most germans do n't want pressure reusch already knows that most germans do n't ideally like to mix their work and free time is .
he also understands the kind of pressure many fall under both before and after work .
" our society is n't ill because of a division of free time and career , rather because both are carried out with such fear .
people jog so they wo n't get too fat or look too old .
they do n't jog for fun , " reusch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for example , if someone works too much during the week , then that person is under more pressure to have fun on saturdays or during free time .
younger people then tend to party through the whole weekend .
fathers tend to do more with their children during that time .
" that means that when the weather is bad and people sit at home , he 's still under pressure and has no way to burn off the steam , " said reusche .

the jet has been designed by aviation pioneer burt rutan , the man behind the first private spacecraft , spaceshipone .
his company , scaled composites , was also responsible for designing voyager , a two-person aircraft that set the record for the challenge in 1986 .
on that occasion burt rutan 's 66-year-old brother , dick , was one of the pilots , along with jeana yeager .
no licence to fly sir richard and mr fossett 's attempt to break the record had originally been pencilled in for april or october 2004 .
" i think it will most likely fly early in the new year , " said sir richard .
" there are a few teething problems when you have an experimental craft , but nothing that 's going to be a showstopper . "
sir richard was mr fossett 's partner in previous global balloon attempts , so he has a ballooning licence .
but he told bbc news online that if were to take the pilot 's seat should anything happen to mr fossett before the attempt , he would have to delay the mission in order to get his jet pilot 's licence .
although , he added , he was not " itching " to take the controls .
" steve is one of the greatest adventurers on earth today and is a very , very capable pilot , " he said .
he also paid tribute to mr rutan , who has used advanced composite materials so that globalflyer can carry more than four times its own weight in fuel on its 40,000km -lrb- 25,000 mile -rrb- journey .
" burt 's achievements are just breathtaking , " said sir richard , adding that he was a " super genius guy " .
globalflyer definitely had the technology to complete the record attempt , he said .
fuel wings while in london last week as part of the manx aviation festival , the rutans showed off video of globalflyer 's test flights during a lecture at the royal aeronautical society .
a couple of weeks ago , it flew an eight-hour test flight .
" it is one of the prettiest airplanes in the world , " burt rutan said proudly .
the jet has a 34.5-metre -lrb- 114ft -rrb- wingspan and is powered by a single turbofan williams fj44-3 atw jet engine , which sits above the one-seater , pressurised cockpit .
its booms will carry the fuel , making up 82 % of the craft 's body weight , which totals 10,000kg -lrb- 22,000lbs -rrb- .
" we did n't dream we could do a plane with 82 % fuel , " said burt rutan .
" but the propulsion system on globalflyer is considerably lighter than that on voyager . "
the ultralight carbon fibre materials used in the construction of the craft have been key to making it as efficient as possible .
despite its massive wingspan , the craft can be wheeled out of the hangar with one hand when it is empty .
it is so light , it will need help coming down after its epic voyage , so will need some extra drag from parachutes , mr rutan said .
during the flight , which is expected to take 80 hours , the plane will fly in the stratosphere , reaching around 12km -lrb- 38,000ft -rrb- then close to 14km -lrb- 45,000ft -rrb- within hours .
it will make use of the northern hemisphere 's jet stream winds , which have to be powerful enough to carry the extremely light craft .
