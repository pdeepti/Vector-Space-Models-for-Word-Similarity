eu foreign ministers will meet in brussels on monday to deal with the situation in sudan .
they plan to harmonize their policy towards the sudanese government that 's accused of doing too little to end the darfur crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer on sunday strongly advocated political sanctions against khartoum , should the government there not step up efforts to disarm the janjaweed militia and bring them before the courts . in an interview with german public television , fischer said on sunday that since his return from khartoum he â d been following very closely the sudanese government â s efforts to end the crisis in darfur .
he said that despite the promises made by the sudanese president and the foreign minister , a solution to the conflict was not yet in sight . â violence continues in the region , " he said .
" i â ve heard terrible reports about looting and burning in villages , about rape on a massive scale .
on the other hand , it â s easier now for humanitarian aid organizations to do their job on the ground , but that â s certainly not enough . " fischer added that countries were cooperating on a un resolution on sudan , calling on the sudanese government to disarm the militia , bring their leaders to justice and stop the killing . " we â ll no doubt keep up the pressure on the government together with our european partners and the united states , â he said . fischer and powell coordinate in a telephone conversation on sunday with his us counterpart colin powell , fischer agreed that khartoum should face international sanctions , if it didn â t live up to its commitments . bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese refugee children walk past a dead donkey powell and fischer said no more time must be wasted to end the conflict which has left some 30,000 people dead , one million people displaced and another 2.2 million living in desperate need of food and medicine . â the sudanese government knows full well that the international community is no longer willing to just look on , " fischer said . " the un resolution is in the making , and sudan is facing political sanctions .
having said that , i want to emphasize that we â ll of course step up our efforts in the humanitarian field . â ahead of the eu foreign ministers â meeting in brussels , the sudanese foreign minister mustafa osman ismail met with eu foreign policy chief javier solana , claiming that his government was doing what was expected of it by the international community . ismail said sanctions against his country would therefore send out the wrong signal .
he added that increased dialogue would be the better option to get on top of the crisis . britain favors sending troops eu foreign ministers will have to debate the option of sending peace-enforcing troops to the darfur region .
britain seems to favour such a move .
at the weekend , a top military commander said he could muster 5,000 troops for a darfur mission .
british prime minister tony blair has not ruled out military intervention . the position of the german government on such a mission remains unclear .
fischer wants to place responsibility for peace-keeping with the organization of african unity -lrb- oau -rrb- . but greens co-leader angelika beer said earlier this year that the option of contributing troops to an international peace-keeping force should be left open . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de europe applies pressure to sudan germany and the us agreed to keep up pressure on sudan on the eve of a meeting in which european ministers will discuss the humanitarian crisis in the western darfur region .
-lrb- july 25 , 2004 -rrb- fischer pressures sudan to act to avert tragedy german foreign minister joschka fischer has held discussions with the sudanese president and foreign minister , saying the eu and germany will only provide aid if sudan acts to resolve the crisis in the darfur region .

the reform will completely change the way the eu supports its farm sector .
the new cap will be geared towards consumers and taxpayers , while giving eu farmers the freedom to produce what the market wants .
in future , the vast majority of subsidies will be paid independently from the volume of production .
to avoid abandonment of production , member states may choose to maintain a limited link between subsidy and production under well defined conditions and within clear limits .
these new " single farm payments " will be linked to the respect of environmental , food safety and animal welfare standards .
severing the link between subsidies and production will make eu farmers more competitive and market orientated , while providing the necessary income stability .
more money will be available to farmers for environmental , quality or animal welfare programs by reducing direct payments for bigger farms .
the council further decided to revise the milk , rice , cereals , durum wheat , dried fodder and nut sectors .
in order to respect the tight budgetary ceiling for the eu-25 until 2013 , ministers agreed to introduce a financial discipline mechanism .
this reform will also strengthen the eu 's negotiating hand in the ongoing wto trade talks .
the different elements of the reform will enter into force in 2004 and 2005 .
the single farm payment will enter into force in 2005 .
if a member state needs a transitional period due to its specific agricultural conditions , it may apply the single farm payment from 2007 at the latest .
key elements of the reformed cap * a single farm payment for eu farmers , independent from production ; limited coupled elements may be maintained to avoid abandonment of production , * this payment will be linked to the respect of environmental , food safety , animal and plant health and animal welfare standards , as well as the requirement to keep all farmland in good agricultural and environmental condition -lrb- " cross-compliance " -rrb- , * a strengthened rural development policy with more eu money , new measures to promote the environment , quality and animal welfare and to help farmers to meet eu production standards starting in 2005 , * a reduction in direct payments -lrb- " modulation " -rrb- for bigger farms to finance the new rural development policy , * a mechanism for financial discipline to ensure that the farm budget fixed until 2013 is not overshot , revisions to the market policy of the cap : * asymmetric price cuts in the milk sector : the intervention price for butter will be reduced by 25 % over four years , which is an additional price cut of 10 % compared to agenda 2000 , for skimmed milk powder a 15 % reduction over three years , as agreed in agenda 2000 , is retained , * reduction of the monthly increments in the cereals sector by half , the current intervention price will be maintained , * reforms in the rice , durum wheat , nuts , starch potatoes and dried fodder sectors .

the mini summit is aimed at getting the derailed doha round of trade talks back on track . as ministers and delegates of the 147 world trade organization member states converge on the shores of lake geneva on tuesday , the main issue on the agenda will be agricultural policies - an issue that pitted the developing world against rich industrial nations at last year 's failed summit in cancun .
this time around , the european union is offering to eliminate subsidies on its agricultural exports and brussels has called on the us to do the same .
" the council -lrb- of ministers -rrb- confirmed the union 's commitment for an agreement on a balanced framework on future dda -lrb- doha development agenda -rrb- negotiations , " read a statement issued by the eu 's top trade ministers on monday after a meeting held in advance of the summit .
at the same time , the eu trade ministers wrote , there was a need to " improve the balance " of the draft .
top eu trade official pascal lamy said he would not agree to concessions on farm subsidies that went beyond hard-won reforms to the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- agreed to last year .
additionally , lamy said the eu would seek more concessions from the united states , its most important trading partner , on farm reform .
so far , the us has not stated whether or not it would cut its own subsidy regime .
trying to get back on track bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing nations accused first-world leaders of turning a deaf ear to poor countries in cancun .
the doha round first commenced three years ago in the qatar capital .
the aim was to reach an agreement that would eliminate the â¬ 300 billion -lrb- $ 364.25 billion -rrb- in agricultural subsidies used by the richest countries to shore up their farming industry in order to provide developing countries with access to global agricultural markets .
doha talks at a major wto summit in cancun , mexico , ended in september without any deal after poorer countries walked out on the negotiations , alleging industrial nations had no interest in helping their developing neighbors .
seeking to avoid a repeat of the diplomatic catastrophe in cancun , europe in recent months has shown more willingness to budge on the subsidies issue .
on july 16 , wto director-general supachai panitchpakdi and general council head shotaro oshima introduced a proposal for the future treaty that calls for all agricultural subsidies to be eliminated by a " date to be agreed . "
german economics minister wolfgang clement called the wto draft of the negotiating plan for the elimination of subsidies and trade barriers a " usable foundation " and for a deal on the negotiating schedule to be reached this week in switzerland . bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france gets more agricultural subsidies from brussels than any other eu country however , france reiterated its concerns that the draft " is deeply unbalanced to the disadvantage of the eu . "
with more than 2 million workers in the farming industry , france is the greatest beneficiary of the eu 's generous agricultural subsidies .
chirac has publicly expressed his concerns that the eu will concede too much ground in the wto talks .
bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister michel barnier but french foreign minister michel barnier -lrb- photo -rrb- seemed largely pleased with monday 's statement by lamy that he would not allow any changes beyond last year 's cap reforms .
" the draft on the table in geneva today does not conform to the aims or the interests of the eu , " he said .
" we need a rebalancing of this draft .
the commission agrees and will work for this . "
in june 2003 , the eu agreed to a sweeping reform of its â¬ 40 billion a year agricultural policy -lrb- see related story below -rrb- that de-linked subsidies from production .
at the request of france , the ministers will meet again friday for a briefing from trade commissioner lamy over the concrete negotiations .
lamy has said it is important that the eu , despite france 's objections , stand behind its offer of eliminating export subsidies for agricultural products , step-by-step , until they reach zero .
because trade policy is a central eu competency , unanimous votes are not required in the council of ministers , and france can not exercise the veto power it enjoys in other policy areas . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de commentary : doha 's last stand this week 's talks in geneva will be the last opportunity the world trade organization has to salvage the doha round of trade after their spectacular collapse in mexico last year .

the mini summit is aimed at getting the derailed doha round of trade talks back on track . as ministers and delegates of the 147 world trade organization member states converge on the shores of lake geneva on tuesday , the main issue on the agenda will be agricultural policies - an issue that pitted the developing world against rich industrial nations at last year 's failed summit in cancun .
this time around , the european union is offering to eliminate subsidies on its agricultural exports and brussels has called on the us to do the same .
" the council -lrb- of ministers -rrb- confirmed the union 's commitment for an agreement on a balanced framework on future dda -lrb- doha development agenda -rrb- negotiations , " read a statement issued by the eu 's top trade ministers on monday after a meeting held in advance of the summit .
at the same time , the eu trade ministers wrote , there was a need to " improve the balance " of the draft .
top eu trade official pascal lamy said he would not agree to concessions on farm subsidies that went beyond hard-won reforms to the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- agreed to last year .
additionally , lamy said the eu would seek more concessions from the united states , its most important trading partner , on farm reform .
so far , the us has not stated whether or not it would cut its own subsidy regime .
trying to get back on track bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing nations accused first-world leaders of turning a deaf ear to poor countries in cancun .
the doha round first commenced three years ago in the qatar capital .
the aim was to reach an agreement that would eliminate the â¬ 300 billion -lrb- $ 364.25 billion -rrb- in agricultural subsidies used by the richest countries to shore up their farming industry in order to provide developing countries with access to global agricultural markets .
doha talks at a major wto summit in cancun , mexico , ended in september without any deal after poorer countries walked out on the negotiations , alleging industrial nations had no interest in helping their developing neighbors .
seeking to avoid a repeat of the diplomatic catastrophe in cancun , europe in recent months has shown more willingness to budge on the subsidies issue .
on july 16 , wto director-general supachai panitchpakdi and general council head shotaro oshima introduced a proposal for the future treaty that calls for all agricultural subsidies to be eliminated by a " date to be agreed . "
german economics minister wolfgang clement called the wto draft of the negotiating plan for the elimination of subsidies and trade barriers a " usable foundation " and for a deal on the negotiating schedule to be reached this week in switzerland . bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france gets more agricultural subsidies from brussels than any other eu country however , france reiterated its concerns that the draft " is deeply unbalanced to the disadvantage of the eu . "
with more than 2 million workers in the farming industry , france is the greatest beneficiary of the eu 's generous agricultural subsidies .
chirac has publicly expressed his concerns that the eu will concede too much ground in the wto talks .
bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister michel barnier but french foreign minister michel barnier -lrb- photo -rrb- seemed largely pleased with monday 's statement by lamy that he would not allow any changes beyond last year 's cap reforms .
" the draft on the table in geneva today does not conform to the aims or the interests of the eu , " he said .
" we need a rebalancing of this draft .
the commission agrees and will work for this . "
in june 2003 , the eu agreed to a sweeping reform of its â¬ 40 billion a year agricultural policy -lrb- see related story below -rrb- that de-linked subsidies from production .
at the request of france , the ministers will meet again friday for a briefing from trade commissioner lamy over the concrete negotiations .
lamy has said it is important that the eu , despite france 's objections , stand behind its offer of eliminating export subsidies for agricultural products , step-by-step , until they reach zero .
because trade policy is a central eu competency , unanimous votes are not required in the council of ministers , and france can not exercise the veto power it enjoys in other policy areas . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de commentary : doha 's last stand this week 's talks in geneva will be the last opportunity the world trade organization has to salvage the doha round of trade after their spectacular collapse in mexico last year .

german economics minister wolfgang clement called the wto draft of the negotiating plan for the elimination of subsidies and trade barriers a " usable foundation " and for a deal on the negotiating schedule to be reached this week in switzerland . bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france gets more agricultural subsidies from brussels than any other eu country however , france reiterated its concerns that the draft " is deeply unbalanced to the disadvantage of the eu . "
with more than 2 million workers in the farming industry , france is the greatest beneficiary of the eu 's generous agricultural subsidies .
chirac has publicly expressed his concerns that the eu will concede too much ground in the wto talks .
bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister michel barnier but french foreign minister michel barnier -lrb- photo -rrb- seemed largely pleased with monday 's statement by lamy that he would not allow any changes beyond last year 's cap reforms .
" the draft on the table in geneva today does not conform to the aims or the interests of the eu , " he said .
" we need a rebalancing of this draft .
the commission agrees and will work for this . "
in june 2003 , the eu agreed to a sweeping reform of its â¬ 40 billion a year agricultural policy -lrb- see related story below -rrb- that de-linked subsidies from production .
at the request of france , the ministers will meet again friday for a briefing from trade commissioner lamy over the concrete negotiations .
lamy has said it is important that the eu , despite france 's objections , stand behind its offer of eliminating export subsidies for agricultural products , step-by-step , until they reach zero .
because trade policy is a central eu competency , unanimous votes are not required in the council of ministers , and france can not exercise the veto power it enjoys in other policy areas . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de commentary : doha 's last stand this week 's talks in geneva will be the last opportunity the world trade organization has to salvage the doha round of trade after their spectacular collapse in mexico last year .

wto general director panitchpakdi supachai confirmed last week that all parties have pledged to agree to a skeleton accord by the end of the week .
the foundation is a draft produced by supachai that would demand the elimination of contested export subsidies for farm products .
the paper also calls for widespread and worldwide liberalization of goods traffic and services .
the fight over agricultural subsidies in rich industrial countries , which total about $ 300 billion a year led to the collapse of talks in cancun , mexico , last september .
ever since , talks have been placed on the back burner .
few thrilled by compromise but on tuesday , a last attempt will be made by wto 's 147 member states to reach a deal , thus completing the work they were unable to finish in cancun 10 months ago .
if broad enough support can be found , the goal this week is to reach a deal that will lay out a timeframe and the foundations for negotiations of a new world trade accord .
whether sufficient support can be found is far from certain - the compromise proposal placed on the table last week by supachai was met with little enthusiasm .
for some , the proposal goes too far , and for others it does n't go far enough .
if an agreement ca n't be found in the coming days , the negotiations will likely cease , and no one knows if it will be possible to resuscitate them in the future .
opponents of globalization would most certainly celebrate another collapse of the trade round .

nevertheless , a breakdown of the talks would n't stop the process of globalization , it would just slow it down .
the consequences of a weakened wto the immediate consequence of a collapse would be a weakening of the wto .
the member states would stay on board and the treaties would remain in effect , but that 's not enough to ensure the wto 's long-term authority .
and such authority is necessary for the mediation of trade disputes .
without the wto , these problems would again fall into the hands of diplomats , and that would put smaller countries at an even greater disadvantage .
nor would the superpowers of the world economy benefit .
without the mediation of the geneva-based wto , trade disputes between the european union , the united states , japan and , eventually , china , would escalate more frequently and could spin out of control far more easily .
a breakdown could also have immediate consequences for growth and the global economy .
but there 's a huge disparity of opinions when it comes to measuring the impact a general liberalization would have .
the world bank has estimated it would generate $ 350 billion in new wealth , with more than half of that going to the developing nations since they would have the most to gain from an opening of their markets .
however , the wto is no development agency .
it 's an event that takes place within the confines of political reality . for the negotiators in geneva , the challenge is to find a multilateral way out of the current labyrinth of conflicting political interests by the end of the week . tom weingÃ¤rtner -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de eu prepares for wto agriculture talks the eu is going to the wto talks in geneva on tuesday with a common position , despite resistance from france .

wto general director panitchpakdi supachai confirmed last week that all parties have pledged to agree to a skeleton accord by the end of the week .
the foundation is a draft produced by supachai that would demand the elimination of contested export subsidies for farm products .
the paper also calls for widespread and worldwide liberalization of goods traffic and services .
the fight over agricultural subsidies in rich industrial countries , which total about $ 300 billion a year led to the collapse of talks in cancun , mexico , last september .
ever since , talks have been placed on the back burner .
few thrilled by compromise but on tuesday , a last attempt will be made by wto 's 147 member states to reach a deal , thus completing the work they were unable to finish in cancun 10 months ago .
if broad enough support can be found , the goal this week is to reach a deal that will lay out a timeframe and the foundations for negotiations of a new world trade accord .
whether sufficient support can be found is far from certain - the compromise proposal placed on the table last week by supachai was met with little enthusiasm .
for some , the proposal goes too far , and for others it does n't go far enough .
if an agreement ca n't be found in the coming days , the negotiations will likely cease , and no one knows if it will be possible to resuscitate them in the future .
opponents of globalization would most certainly celebrate another collapse of the trade round .
in their eyes , the wto is a rogue body in the global economy .
nevertheless , a breakdown of the talks would n't stop the process of globalization , it would just slow it down .
the consequences of a weakened wto the immediate consequence of a collapse would be a weakening of the wto .
the member states would stay on board and the treaties would remain in effect , but that 's not enough to ensure the wto 's long-term authority .
and such authority is necessary for the mediation of trade disputes .
without the wto , these problems would again fall into the hands of diplomats , and that would put smaller countries at an even greater disadvantage .
nor would the superpowers of the world economy benefit .
without the mediation of the geneva-based wto , trade disputes between the european union , the united states , japan and , eventually , china , would escalate more frequently and could spin out of control far more easily .
a breakdown could also have immediate consequences for growth and the global economy .
but there 's a huge disparity of opinions when it comes to measuring the impact a general liberalization would have .
the world bank has estimated it would generate $ 350 billion in new wealth , with more than half of that going to the developing nations since they would have the most to gain from an opening of their markets .
however , the wto is no development agency .
it 's an event that takes place within the confines of political reality . for the negotiators in geneva , the challenge is to find a multilateral way out of the current labyrinth of conflicting political interests by the end of the week . tom weingÃ¤rtner -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de eu prepares for wto agriculture talks the eu is going to the wto talks in geneva on tuesday with a common position , despite resistance from france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.07.2004 -pipe- 16:00 utc key elements of the reformed eu agricultural policy on june 26 , 2003 , eu farm ministers adopted a fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
the reform will completely change the way the eu supports its farm sector .
the new cap will be geared towards consumers and taxpayers , while giving eu farmers the freedom to produce what the market wants .
in future , the vast majority of subsidies will be paid independently from the volume of production .
to avoid abandonment of production , member states may choose to maintain a limited link between subsidy and production under well defined conditions and within clear limits .
these new " single farm payments " will be linked to the respect of environmental , food safety and animal welfare standards .
severing the link between subsidies and production will make eu farmers more competitive and market orientated , while providing the necessary income stability .
more money will be available to farmers for environmental , quality or animal welfare programs by reducing direct payments for bigger farms .
the council further decided to revise the milk , rice , cereals , durum wheat , dried fodder and nut sectors .
in order to respect the tight budgetary ceiling for the eu-25 until 2013 , ministers agreed to introduce a financial discipline mechanism .
this reform will also strengthen the eu 's negotiating hand in the ongoing wto trade talks .
the different elements of the reform will enter into force in 2004 and 2005 .
the single farm payment will enter into force in 2005 .
if a member state needs a transitional period due to its specific agricultural conditions , it may apply the single farm payment from 2007 at the latest .
key elements of the reformed cap * a single farm payment for eu farmers , independent from production ; limited coupled elements may be maintained to avoid abandonment of production , * this payment will be linked to the respect of environmental , food safety , animal and plant health and animal welfare standards , as well as the requirement to keep all farmland in good agricultural and environmental condition -lrb- " cross-compliance " -rrb- , * a strengthened rural development policy with more eu money , new measures to promote the environment , quality and animal welfare and to help farmers to meet eu production standards starting in 2005 , * a reduction in direct payments -lrb- " modulation " -rrb- for bigger farms to finance the new rural development policy , * a mechanism for financial discipline to ensure that the farm budget fixed until 2013 is not overshot , revisions to the market policy of the cap : * asymmetric price cuts in the milk sector : the intervention price for butter will be reduced by 25 % over four years , which is an additional price cut of 10 % compared to agenda 2000 , for skimmed milk powder a 15 % reduction over three years , as agreed in agenda 2000 , is retained , * reduction of the monthly increments in the cereals sector by half , the current intervention price will be maintained , * reforms in the rice , durum wheat , nuts , starch potatoes and dried fodder sectors .

eu foreign ministers will meet in brussels on monday to deal with the situation in sudan .
they plan to harmonize their policy towards the sudanese government that 's accused of doing too little to end the darfur crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer on sunday strongly advocated political sanctions against khartoum , should the government there not step up efforts to disarm the janjaweed militia and bring them before the courts . in an interview with german public television , fischer said on sunday that since his return from khartoum he â d been following very closely the sudanese government â s efforts to end the crisis in darfur .
he said that despite the promises made by the sudanese president and the foreign minister , a solution to the conflict was not yet in sight . â violence continues in the region , " he said .
" i â ve heard terrible reports about looting and burning in villages , about rape on a massive scale .
on the other hand , it â s easier now for humanitarian aid organizations to do their job on the ground , but that â s certainly not enough . " fischer added that countries were cooperating on a un resolution on sudan , calling on the sudanese government to disarm the militia , bring their leaders to justice and stop the killing . " we â ll no doubt keep up the pressure on the government together with our european partners and the united states , â he said . fischer and powell coordinate in a telephone conversation on sunday with his us counterpart colin powell , fischer agreed that khartoum should face international sanctions , if it didn â t live up to its commitments . bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese refugee children walk past a dead donkey powell and fischer said no more time must be wasted to end the conflict which has left some 30,000 people dead , one million people displaced and another 2.2 million living in desperate need of food and medicine . â the sudanese government knows full well that the international community is no longer willing to just look on , " fischer said . " the un resolution is in the making , and sudan is facing political sanctions .
having said that , i want to emphasize that we â ll of course step up our efforts in the humanitarian field . â ahead of the eu foreign ministers â meeting in brussels , the sudanese foreign minister mustafa osman ismail met with eu foreign policy chief javier solana , claiming that his government was doing what was expected of it by the international community . ismail said sanctions against his country would therefore send out the wrong signal .
he added that increased dialogue would be the better option to get on top of the crisis . britain favors sending troops eu foreign ministers will have to debate the option of sending peace-enforcing troops to the darfur region .
britain seems to favour such a move .
at the weekend , a top military commander said he could muster 5,000 troops for a darfur mission .
british prime minister tony blair has not ruled out military intervention . the position of the german government on such a mission remains unclear .
fischer wants to place responsibility for peace-keeping with the organization of african unity -lrb- oau -rrb- . but greens co-leader angelika beer said earlier this year that the option of contributing troops to an international peace-keeping force should be left open . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de europe applies pressure to sudan germany and the us agreed to keep up pressure on sudan on the eve of a meeting in which european ministers will discuss the humanitarian crisis in the western darfur region .
-lrb- july 25 , 2004 -rrb- fischer pressures sudan to act to avert tragedy german foreign minister joschka fischer has held discussions with the sudanese president and foreign minister , saying the eu and germany will only provide aid if sudan acts to resolve the crisis in the darfur region .

eu foreign ministers will meet in brussels on monday to deal with the situation in sudan .
they plan to harmonize their policy towards the sudanese government that 's accused of doing too little to end the darfur crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer on sunday strongly advocated political sanctions against khartoum , should the government there not step up efforts to disarm the janjaweed militia and bring them before the courts . in an interview with german public television , fischer said on sunday that since his return from khartoum he â d been following very closely the sudanese government â s efforts to end the crisis in darfur .
he said that despite the promises made by the sudanese president and the foreign minister , a solution to the conflict was not yet in sight . â violence continues in the region , " he said .
" i â ve heard terrible reports about looting and burning in villages , about rape on a massive scale .
on the other hand , it â s easier now for humanitarian aid organizations to do their job on the ground , but that â s certainly not enough . " fischer added that countries were cooperating on a un resolution on sudan , calling on the sudanese government to disarm the militia , bring their leaders to justice and stop the killing . " we â ll no doubt keep up the pressure on the government together with our european partners and the united states , â he said . fischer and powell coordinate in a telephone conversation on sunday with his us counterpart colin powell , fischer agreed that khartoum should face international sanctions , if it didn â t live up to its commitments . bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese refugee children walk past a dead donkey powell and fischer said no more time must be wasted to end the conflict which has left some 30,000 people dead , one million people displaced and another 2.2 million living in desperate need of food and medicine . â the sudanese government knows full well that the international community is no longer willing to just look on , " fischer said . " the un resolution is in the making , and sudan is facing political sanctions .
having said that , i want to emphasize that we â ll of course step up our efforts in the humanitarian field . â ahead of the eu foreign ministers â meeting in brussels , the sudanese foreign minister mustafa osman ismail met with eu foreign policy chief javier solana , claiming that his government was doing what was expected of it by the international community . ismail said sanctions against his country would therefore send out the wrong signal .
he added that increased dialogue would be the better option to get on top of the crisis . britain favors sending troops eu foreign ministers will have to debate the option of sending peace-enforcing troops to the darfur region .
britain seems to favour such a move .
at the weekend , a top military commander said he could muster 5,000 troops for a darfur mission .
british prime minister tony blair has not ruled out military intervention . the position of the german government on such a mission remains unclear .

but despite some booing , many in the audience agreed that the director 's work was an interesting and courageous interpretation . christoph schlingensief had prepared for the worst . prior to sunday 's performance , the enfant terrible among germany 's theater directors had talked about plans to hide after sunday to escape the wrath of his critics . bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph schlingensief schlingensief -lrb- photo -rrb- had expected the opening night to end in scandal after the lead tenor had called the production an abomination in a radio interview and festival director wolfgang wagner had asked that the use of a video depicting a decaying rabbit be toned down . but the closest schlingensief got to a scandal was a round of heavy booing as the director appeared on stage for a curtain call .
at the official reception that followed the festival 's opening in the northern bavarian town of bayreuth , the director and his team were cheered and welcomed with fanfares . wolfgang wagner , the grandson of richard wagner , talked about a " successful performance .

" this is not a scandal , but a very , very courageous staging , " who had brought along jose barroso -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former portuguese premier who will take over as european commission president in november . schlingensief himself told reporters that he had not hoped for a scandal . " we 're relieved and very proud , " he said .
" we fought a lot and it 's been worth it .
we wanted to show bayreuth unusual images and we 've accomplished that . " bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rehearsal for parsifal french composer and conductor pierre boulez conducted the festival 's opening night .
he returned after a break of 24 years .

but despite some booing , many in the audience agreed that the director 's work was an interesting and courageous interpretation . christoph schlingensief had prepared for the worst . prior to sunday 's performance , the enfant terrible among germany 's theater directors had talked about plans to hide after sunday to escape the wrath of his critics . bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph schlingensief schlingensief -lrb- photo -rrb- had expected the opening night to end in scandal after the lead tenor had called the production an abomination in a radio interview and festival director wolfgang wagner had asked that the use of a video depicting a decaying rabbit be toned down . but the closest schlingensief got to a scandal was a round of heavy booing as the director appeared on stage for a curtain call .
at the official reception that followed the festival 's opening in the northern bavarian town of bayreuth , the director and his team were cheered and welcomed with fanfares . wolfgang wagner , the grandson of richard wagner , talked about a " successful performance . " " a very courageous staging " bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber -lrb- left -rrb- with jose barroso even bavaria 's conservative political leaders were full of praise .

" this is not a scandal , but a very , very courageous staging , " who had brought along jose barroso -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former portuguese premier who will take over as european commission president in november . schlingensief himself told reporters that he had not hoped for a scandal . " we 're relieved and very proud , " he said .

eu foreign ministers will meet in brussels on monday to deal with the situation in sudan .
they plan to harmonize their policy towards the sudanese government that 's accused of doing too little to end the darfur crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer on sunday strongly advocated political sanctions against khartoum , should the government there not step up efforts to disarm the janjaweed militia and bring them before the courts . in an interview with german public television , fischer said on sunday that since his return from khartoum he â d been following very closely the sudanese government â s efforts to end the crisis in darfur .
he said that despite the promises made by the sudanese president and the foreign minister , a solution to the conflict was not yet in sight . â violence continues in the region , " he said .
" i â ve heard terrible reports about looting and burning in villages , about rape on a massive scale .

eu foreign ministers will meet in brussels on monday to deal with the situation in sudan .
they plan to harmonize their policy towards the sudanese government that 's accused of doing too little to end the darfur crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer on sunday strongly advocated political sanctions against khartoum , should the government there not step up efforts to disarm the janjaweed militia and bring them before the courts . in an interview with german public television , fischer said on sunday that since his return from khartoum he â d been following very closely the sudanese government â s efforts to end the crisis in darfur .
he said that despite the promises made by the sudanese president and the foreign minister , a solution to the conflict was not yet in sight . â violence continues in the region , " he said .
" i â ve heard terrible reports about looting and burning in villages , about rape on a massive scale .
on the other hand , it â s easier now for humanitarian aid organizations to do their job on the ground , but that â s certainly not enough . " fischer added that countries were cooperating on a un resolution on sudan , calling on the sudanese government to disarm the militia , bring their leaders to justice and stop the killing .

the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .
but the german market remains troubled . the shock waves unleashed from the announcement that spain 's santander central hispana would buy britain 's abbey national were n't restricted to the towering , glass and steel punctuated urban landscape of the city of london .
the ripples could also be felt in offices that make up frankfurt 's skyline , where many observers see this sparking a wave of consolidation in the european banking sector .
britain 's abbey national said monday it would approve a proposed takeover offer from spain 's biggest bank , santander central hispana .
the deal would create the world 's 10th largest bank , and experts believe it could be first bang of a long-awaited consolidation trend in the european banking sector .
santander 's board of directors approved the purchase on sunday evening , seeking to pay â¬ 13.6 billion to buy abbey , britain 's sixth-largest bank .
if the deal goes through , it will mark the first time a british bank has been taken over by a european competitor .

though the talks ended without any action , a wave of consolidation could give new impetus to foreign investors seeking discounts in germany .
hurdles make buyouts less attractive however , recent gains in share prices at hvb and commerzbank could make them less attractive targets .
additionally , structural barriers also make the german banking market less attractive to foreign investors .
for one , the private banking market here is dominated by the state-protected sparkassen , or savings banks .
because of the deeply segmented market , most of the private banks in germany have profit margins that are too weak to interest many foreign banks .
another factor in germany is that workers ' councils are given powerful seats on the board of major german banks and have voting rights in major strategic decisions .
and germany 's biggest private player , deutsche bank , has indicated it wants to increase its own profits before entering into the european consolidation game .
upside potential yet despite the difficulty in making structural changes in the german banking system , foreign investors say the relative bargain prices or upside potential of banks here make them attractive takeover targets .

the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .

the ripples could also be felt in offices that make up frankfurt 's skyline , where many observers see this sparking a wave of consolidation in the european banking sector .
britain 's abbey national said monday it would approve a proposed takeover offer from spain 's biggest bank , santander central hispana .
the deal would create the world 's 10th largest bank , and experts believe it could be first bang of a long-awaited consolidation trend in the european banking sector .
santander 's board of directors approved the purchase on sunday evening , seeking to pay â¬ 13.6 billion to buy abbey , britain 's sixth-largest bank .

the former star striker becomes the ninth coach of the three-time world cup champions and the youngest to fill the spot , at 39 , in the country 's history . " the subject of the continuing talks is now strictly about the sports side , " said harald stenger , a spokesman for dfb .
klinsmann had not confirmed until the final moment which role he would play in the new coaching line-up after flying back to germany from his home in los angeles for final negotiations on saturday .

fellow retired striking icon oliver bierhoff , who played alongside klinsmann when germany were crowned european champions in 1996 , is expected to take over the new post of team manager , a liaison job between the coach , media and dfb officials .
klinsmann has long been one of the most outspoken critics of the creaking dfb and his appointment is likely to be the start of a major overhaul in german soccer .
he is already asking the organization to augment his staff with experts in areas like psychology and speed training , copying the training techniques used in the american basketball leagues .

the former star striker becomes the ninth coach of the three-time world cup champions and the youngest to fill the spot , at 39 , in the country 's history . " the subject of the continuing talks is now strictly about the sports side , " said harald stenger , a spokesman for dfb .
klinsmann had not confirmed until the final moment which role he would play in the new coaching line-up after flying back to germany from his home in los angeles for final negotiations on saturday .
now it is clear that the former stuttgart , monaco and inter milan forward will take the lead in a new coaching team that hopes to turn around the slumping national side in time for the 2006 world cup , which germany will host .
klinsmann , who won the world cup and european championships along the way to collecting 108 cups for his country , has a valid coaching license , but has n't led a team since retiring from the pitch in 1998 .
experience coupled with innovative approach bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann worked under osieck in the world cup winning team .
his coaching team is expected to include former canadian national team coach holger osieck as assistant coach .
the 56-year-old veteran held that job on the 1990 team under franz beckenbauer , who also never guided a side before leading the german team to its third world cup crown .
fellow retired striking icon oliver bierhoff , who played alongside klinsmann when germany were crowned european champions in 1996 , is expected to take over the new post of team manager , a liaison job between the coach , media and dfb officials .
klinsmann has long been one of the most outspoken critics of the creaking dfb and his appointment is likely to be the start of a major overhaul in german soccer .
he is already asking the organization to augment his staff with experts in areas like psychology and speed training , copying the training techniques used in the american basketball leagues .
" the most important thing is the dfb needs to develop dynamism .
we have to look around the world , " klinsmann said recently .

klinsmann 's new employers have long been accused of sleeping through soccer 's modern developments and have been publicly embarrassed by the saga surrounding rudi vÃ¶ller 's resignation after the disastrous euro 2004 campaign .
the red faces deepened when germany 's top two coaches , ottmar hitzfeld -lrb- photo -rrb- and otto rehhagel , turned down the job after a public courtship .
now it hopes that lining up klinsmann will undo some of the damage .
his selection came as a huge surprise in germany , since the striker 's name had never been raised in connection with the job but those in the game have endorsed his appointment .
" this is an ingenious solution .
it 's a very good choice , " said hitzfeld , who turned down the job to take a year off coaching .
klinsmann said he also hopes to rely on the experience of the previous coach in his new role .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.07.2004 -pipe- 16:00 utc key elements of the reformed eu agricultural policy on june 26 , 2003 , eu farm ministers adopted a fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
the reform will completely change the way the eu supports its farm sector .
the new cap will be geared towards consumers and taxpayers , while giving eu farmers the freedom to produce what the market wants .
in future , the vast majority of subsidies will be paid independently from the volume of production .
to avoid abandonment of production , member states may choose to maintain a limited link between subsidy and production under well defined conditions and within clear limits .
these new " single farm payments " will be linked to the respect of environmental , food safety and animal welfare standards .
severing the link between subsidies and production will make eu farmers more competitive and market orientated , while providing the necessary income stability .
more money will be available to farmers for environmental , quality or animal welfare programs by reducing direct payments for bigger farms .
the council further decided to revise the milk , rice , cereals , durum wheat , dried fodder and nut sectors .
in order to respect the tight budgetary ceiling for the eu-25 until 2013 , ministers agreed to introduce a financial discipline mechanism .
this reform will also strengthen the eu 's negotiating hand in the ongoing wto trade talks .
the different elements of the reform will enter into force in 2004 and 2005 .
the single farm payment will enter into force in 2005 .
if a member state needs a transitional period due to its specific agricultural conditions , it may apply the single farm payment from 2007 at the latest .
key elements of the reformed cap * a single farm payment for eu farmers , independent from production ; limited coupled elements may be maintained to avoid abandonment of production , * this payment will be linked to the respect of environmental , food safety , animal and plant health and animal welfare standards , as well as the requirement to keep all farmland in good agricultural and environmental condition -lrb- " cross-compliance " -rrb- , * a strengthened rural development policy with more eu money , new measures to promote the environment , quality and animal welfare and to help farmers to meet eu production standards starting in 2005 , * a reduction in direct payments -lrb- " modulation " -rrb- for bigger farms to finance the new rural development policy , * a mechanism for financial discipline to ensure that the farm budget fixed until 2013 is not overshot , revisions to the market policy of the cap : * asymmetric price cuts in the milk sector : the intervention price for butter will be reduced by 25 % over four years , which is an additional price cut of 10 % compared to agenda 2000 , for skimmed milk powder a 15 % reduction over three years , as agreed in agenda 2000 , is retained , * reduction of the monthly increments in the cereals sector by half , the current intervention price will be maintained , * reforms in the rice , durum wheat , nuts , starch potatoes and dried fodder sectors .

the reform will completely change the way the eu supports its farm sector .
the new cap will be geared towards consumers and taxpayers , while giving eu farmers the freedom to produce what the market wants .
in future , the vast majority of subsidies will be paid independently from the volume of production .
to avoid abandonment of production , member states may choose to maintain a limited link between subsidy and production under well defined conditions and within clear limits .
these new " single farm payments " will be linked to the respect of environmental , food safety and animal welfare standards .
severing the link between subsidies and production will make eu farmers more competitive and market orientated , while providing the necessary income stability .
more money will be available to farmers for environmental , quality or animal welfare programs by reducing direct payments for bigger farms .
the council further decided to revise the milk , rice , cereals , durum wheat , dried fodder and nut sectors .
in order to respect the tight budgetary ceiling for the eu-25 until 2013 , ministers agreed to introduce a financial discipline mechanism .
this reform will also strengthen the eu 's negotiating hand in the ongoing wto trade talks .
the different elements of the reform will enter into force in 2004 and 2005 .
the single farm payment will enter into force in 2005 .
if a member state needs a transitional period due to its specific agricultural conditions , it may apply the single farm payment from 2007 at the latest .
key elements of the reformed cap * a single farm payment for eu farmers , independent from production ; limited coupled elements may be maintained to avoid abandonment of production , * this payment will be linked to the respect of environmental , food safety , animal and plant health and animal welfare standards , as well as the requirement to keep all farmland in good agricultural and environmental condition -lrb- " cross-compliance " -rrb- , * a strengthened rural development policy with more eu money , new measures to promote the environment , quality and animal welfare and to help farmers to meet eu production standards starting in 2005 , * a reduction in direct payments -lrb- " modulation " -rrb- for bigger farms to finance the new rural development policy , * a mechanism for financial discipline to ensure that the farm budget fixed until 2013 is not overshot , revisions to the market policy of the cap : * asymmetric price cuts in the milk sector : the intervention price for butter will be reduced by 25 % over four years , which is an additional price cut of 10 % compared to agenda 2000 , for skimmed milk powder a 15 % reduction over three years , as agreed in agenda 2000 , is retained , * reduction of the monthly increments in the cereals sector by half , the current intervention price will be maintained , * reforms in the rice , durum wheat , nuts , starch potatoes and dried fodder sectors .

" the foreign ministers said they expect the government in khartoum to ensure that violations cease " with immediate effect " or the eu would take " appropriate steps . " though the word " sanctions " was n't specifically mentioned in the draft statement , the eu said it had started drawing up a list of janjaweed arab militia leaders " responsible for breaches and violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , and those guiding and supporting them . " the eu said the sudanese government " will be pressed to arrest those persons or suspend them from office and to bring them to justice . " " the sudanese government has to deliver " bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foriegn minister joschka fischer , left , meets his sudanese counterpart mostafa osman ismail in khartoum .
" they need to be disarmed and the responsible need to go to trial , " german foreign minister joschka fischer , back from a recent trip to sudan , said .
" unity in the international community is very , very important , " fischer added .
" the sudanese government has to deliver . " speaking on german television earlier on sunday , fischer said his return from khartoum he â d been following very closely the sudanese government â s efforts to end the crisis in darfur .
he said that despite the promises made by the sudanese president and the foreign minister , a solution to the conflict was not yet in sight . â violence continues in the region , " he said .
" i â ve heard terrible reports about looting and burning in villages , about rape on a massive scale , " fischer said .
" we â ll no doubt keep up the pressure on the government together with our european partners and the united states , â he added . more than 1 million people displaced bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sudanese refugee child prepares in the desert outside tine on the chad side of the sudan border .
the conflict in sudan 's western darfur region began in february 2003 with a rebel uprising against khartoum , protesting that the largely black african region had been ignored by the arab government . up to 30,000 people , most of them black africans , have been killed in darfur , and an estimated 2.2 million in urgent need of food and medical attention . eu foreign ministers on monday also urged sudan to admit more aid workers to provide emergency food and shelter for more than 1 million people displaced in darfur .
" the -lrb- humanitarian -rrb- situation is slightly better , but that does n't mean the problem is solved , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" the risk is very high for a potential catastrophe . " the eu , the united states and humanitarian groups have accused the sudanese government of backing the militias - a claim denied by khartoum . khartoum rejects " genocide " charge ahead of the eu foreign ministers â meeting in brussels , the sudanese foreign minister mustafa osman ismail met with solana , claiming that his government was doing what was expected of it by the international community . ismail said sanctions against his country would therefore send out the wrong signal .
he added that increased dialogue would be the better option to get on top of the crisis . the us congress passed a resolution last week describing as " genocide " the atrocities committed in darfur . but ismail rejected the charge . " what is happening in darfur is not genocide .
it is a humanitarian crisis provoked by fighting which is not our fault ... the sudanese government did not start the fighting , " he told belgian daily de staandard . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de sudan at center of eu meeting eu foreign ministers will meet in brussels on monday to deal with the situation in sudan .

eu foreign ministers will meet in brussels on monday to deal with the situation in sudan .
they plan to harmonize their policy towards the sudanese government that 's accused of doing too little to end the darfur crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer on sunday strongly advocated political sanctions against khartoum , should the government there not step up efforts to disarm the janjaweed militia and bring them before the courts . in an interview with german public television , fischer said on sunday that since his return from khartoum he â d been following very closely the sudanese government â s efforts to end the crisis in darfur .
he said that despite the promises made by the sudanese president and the foreign minister , a solution to the conflict was not yet in sight . â violence continues in the region , " he said .
" i â ve heard terrible reports about looting and burning in villages , about rape on a massive scale .
on the other hand , it â s easier now for humanitarian aid organizations to do their job on the ground , but that â s certainly not enough . " fischer added that countries were cooperating on a un resolution on sudan , calling on the sudanese government to disarm the militia , bring their leaders to justice and stop the killing . " we â ll no doubt keep up the pressure on the government together with our european partners and the united states , â he said . fischer and powell coordinate in a telephone conversation on sunday with his us counterpart colin powell , fischer agreed that khartoum should face international sanctions , if it didn â t live up to its commitments . bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese refugee children walk past a dead donkey powell and fischer said no more time must be wasted to end the conflict which has left some 30,000 people dead , one million people displaced and another 2.2 million living in desperate need of food and medicine . â the sudanese government knows full well that the international community is no longer willing to just look on , " fischer said . " the un resolution is in the making , and sudan is facing political sanctions .
having said that , i want to emphasize that we â ll of course step up our efforts in the humanitarian field . â ahead of the eu foreign ministers â meeting in brussels , the sudanese foreign minister mustafa osman ismail met with eu foreign policy chief javier solana , claiming that his government was doing what was expected of it by the international community . ismail said sanctions against his country would therefore send out the wrong signal .
he added that increased dialogue would be the better option to get on top of the crisis . britain favors sending troops eu foreign ministers will have to debate the option of sending peace-enforcing troops to the darfur region .
britain seems to favour such a move .
at the weekend , a top military commander said he could muster 5,000 troops for a darfur mission .
british prime minister tony blair has not ruled out military intervention . the position of the german government on such a mission remains unclear .
fischer wants to place responsibility for peace-keeping with the organization of african unity -lrb- oau -rrb- . but greens co-leader angelika beer said earlier this year that the option of contributing troops to an international peace-keeping force should be left open . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de europe applies pressure to sudan germany and the us agreed to keep up pressure on sudan on the eve of a meeting in which european ministers will discuss the humanitarian crisis in the western darfur region .

but chances for success are limited as only berlin would benefit from the change . a newfound self-confidence has been spurring on german politicians since the end of the cold war and the country 's reunification that followed .
" we 're somebody again " is a rallying cry that 's become popular again . during the 1960s , germany 's economic boom justified such a sentiment .
today , german leaders argue that the country 's growing role in supporting peace-keeping missions should be recognized by including germany in the exclusive circle of countries . the timing seems right : un secretary general plans to finally go ahead with the organization 's long-awaited reform .
he 's put in place a committee of experts that will come up with proposals by the beginning of december . a permanent security council seat for germany could be on the agenda , the german government hopes .
but unfortunately none of the committee 's members come from germany . us likely against proposal the german government should n't lose sight of reality despite its hopes .
it would almost be a miracle if germany could get enough votes to make its wish come true . in order to succeed , two thirds of the 191 un member states have to approve the change , along with all five current permanent security council members : britain , china , france , russia and the united states . the germans might argue that they have shown great commitment but they are unlikely to achieve more than friendly praise from most other countries : after all , a permanent security council seat does n't get awarded like an honorary service medal . enough back and forth already it has more to do with power , and veto power at that : un resolutions regarding numerous crises have always lacked poignancy because one of the permanent members felt otherwise . there 's more than enough examples to prove this .
israel , chechnya and iraq are just some of the most striking ones .
should another veto power be added - even one like germany , which tries to resolve crises in a peaceful , diplomatic way - the dragging back and forth would only increase . on top of that , the us is unlikely to be interested in making a war opponent a veto power after a failed attempt to get un approval for the invasion of iraq . limited seats all other un members , who can only take turns at the table for two-year periods , have little interest in supporting the german plan as it would give them access to the security council even less frequently unless the number of seats -lrb- currently 15 -rrb- is increased . berlin has already given up on an alternative idea : a permanent seat for the european union .
that proposal failed because neither britain nor france want to give up their privileged status . but calling for a permanent seat for germany doesn â t have a bigger chance of success as no one - except germany - would benefit from it . klaus dahmann -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de fischer finds few backers for un seat german foreign minister joschka fischer wrapped up his 10-day trip to asia on friday .

but despite some booing , many in the audience agreed that the director 's work was an interesting and courageous interpretation . christoph schlingensief had prepared for the worst . prior to sunday 's performance , the enfant terrible among germany 's theater directors had talked about plans to hide after sunday to escape the wrath of his critics . bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph schlingensief schlingensief -lrb- photo -rrb- had expected the opening night to end in scandal after the lead tenor had called the production an abomination in a radio interview and festival director wolfgang wagner had asked that the use of a video depicting a decaying rabbit be toned down . but the closest schlingensief got to a scandal was a round of heavy booing as the director appeared on stage for a curtain call .
at the official reception that followed the festival 's opening in the northern bavarian town of bayreuth , the director and his team were cheered and welcomed with fanfares . wolfgang wagner , the grandson of richard wagner , talked about a " successful performance . " " a very courageous staging " bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber -lrb- left -rrb- with jose barroso even bavaria 's conservative political leaders were full of praise .
while admitting that he needed some time to get his head around what he 'd seen , bavarian premier edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- seemed pleased with schlingensief 's work . " this is not a scandal , but a very , very courageous staging , " who had brought along jose barroso -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former portuguese premier who will take over as european commission president in november . schlingensief himself told reporters that he had not hoped for a scandal . " we 're relieved and very proud , " he said .
" we fought a lot and it 's been worth it .
we wanted to show bayreuth unusual images and we 've accomplished that . " bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rehearsal for parsifal french composer and conductor pierre boulez conducted the festival 's opening night .
he returned after a break of 24 years .

but despite some booing , many in the audience agreed that the director 's work was an interesting and courageous interpretation . christoph schlingensief had prepared for the worst . prior to sunday 's performance , the enfant terrible among germany 's theater directors had talked about plans to hide after sunday to escape the wrath of his critics . bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph schlingensief schlingensief -lrb- photo -rrb- had expected the opening night to end in scandal after the lead tenor had called the production an abomination in a radio interview and festival director wolfgang wagner had asked that the use of a video depicting a decaying rabbit be toned down . but the closest schlingensief got to a scandal was a round of heavy booing as the director appeared on stage for a curtain call .
at the official reception that followed the festival 's opening in the northern bavarian town of bayreuth , the director and his team were cheered and welcomed with fanfares . wolfgang wagner , the grandson of richard wagner , talked about a " successful performance . " " a very courageous staging " bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber -lrb- left -rrb- with jose barroso even bavaria 's conservative political leaders were full of praise .
while admitting that he needed some time to get his head around what he 'd seen , bavarian premier edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- seemed pleased with schlingensief 's work . " this is not a scandal , but a very , very courageous staging , " who had brought along jose barroso -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former portuguese premier who will take over as european commission president in november . schlingensief himself told reporters that he had not hoped for a scandal . " we 're relieved and very proud , " he said .
" we fought a lot and it 's been worth it .
we wanted to show bayreuth unusual images and we 've accomplished that . " bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rehearsal for parsifal french composer and conductor pierre boulez conducted the festival 's opening night .
he returned after a break of 24 years .
boulez conducted patrice chereau 's legendary " ring " between 1976 and 1980 and also a previous staging of " parsifal " in 1966-1970 . a crowd puller the festival will continue on monday with the second revival of frenchman philippe arlaud 's staging of " tannhÃ¤user " under the baton of star conductor christian thielemann . wagner 's mammoth four-opera " ring " will follow , with " rheingold " on tuesday , " die walkÃ¼re " on wednesday , " siegfried " on friday and " goetterdÃ¤mmerung " on sunday . altogether , the festival will include 30 performances until aug .

eu foreign ministers will meet in brussels on monday to deal with the situation in sudan .
they plan to harmonize their policy towards the sudanese government that 's accused of doing too little to end the darfur crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer on sunday strongly advocated political sanctions against khartoum , should the government there not step up efforts to disarm the janjaweed militia and bring them before the courts . in an interview with german public television , fischer said on sunday that since his return from khartoum he â d been following very closely the sudanese government â s efforts to end the crisis in darfur .
he said that despite the promises made by the sudanese president and the foreign minister , a solution to the conflict was not yet in sight . â violence continues in the region , " he said .
" i â ve heard terrible reports about looting and burning in villages , about rape on a massive scale .
on the other hand , it â s easier now for humanitarian aid organizations to do their job on the ground , but that â s certainly not enough . " fischer added that countries were cooperating on a un resolution on sudan , calling on the sudanese government to disarm the militia , bring their leaders to justice and stop the killing . " we â ll no doubt keep up the pressure on the government together with our european partners and the united states , â he said . fischer and powell coordinate in a telephone conversation on sunday with his us counterpart colin powell , fischer agreed that khartoum should face international sanctions , if it didn â t live up to its commitments . bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese refugee children walk past a dead donkey powell and fischer said no more time must be wasted to end the conflict which has left some 30,000 people dead , one million people displaced and another 2.2 million living in desperate need of food and medicine . â the sudanese government knows full well that the international community is no longer willing to just look on , " fischer said .

eu foreign ministers will meet in brussels on monday to deal with the situation in sudan .
they plan to harmonize their policy towards the sudanese government that 's accused of doing too little to end the darfur crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer on sunday strongly advocated political sanctions against khartoum , should the government there not step up efforts to disarm the janjaweed militia and bring them before the courts . in an interview with german public television , fischer said on sunday that since his return from khartoum he â d been following very closely the sudanese government â s efforts to end the crisis in darfur .
he said that despite the promises made by the sudanese president and the foreign minister , a solution to the conflict was not yet in sight . â violence continues in the region , " he said .
" i â ve heard terrible reports about looting and burning in villages , about rape on a massive scale .
on the other hand , it â s easier now for humanitarian aid organizations to do their job on the ground , but that â s certainly not enough . " fischer added that countries were cooperating on a un resolution on sudan , calling on the sudanese government to disarm the militia , bring their leaders to justice and stop the killing . " we â ll no doubt keep up the pressure on the government together with our european partners and the united states , â he said . fischer and powell coordinate in a telephone conversation on sunday with his us counterpart colin powell , fischer agreed that khartoum should face international sanctions , if it didn â t live up to its commitments . bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese refugee children walk past a dead donkey powell and fischer said no more time must be wasted to end the conflict which has left some 30,000 people dead , one million people displaced and another 2.2 million living in desperate need of food and medicine . â the sudanese government knows full well that the international community is no longer willing to just look on , " fischer said . " the un resolution is in the making , and sudan is facing political sanctions .
having said that , i want to emphasize that we â ll of course step up our efforts in the humanitarian field . â ahead of the eu foreign ministers â meeting in brussels , the sudanese foreign minister mustafa osman ismail met with eu foreign policy chief javier solana , claiming that his government was doing what was expected of it by the international community . ismail said sanctions against his country would therefore send out the wrong signal .
he added that increased dialogue would be the better option to get on top of the crisis . britain favors sending troops eu foreign ministers will have to debate the option of sending peace-enforcing troops to the darfur region .
britain seems to favour such a move .
at the weekend , a top military commander said he could muster 5,000 troops for a darfur mission .
british prime minister tony blair has not ruled out military intervention . the position of the german government on such a mission remains unclear .
fischer wants to place responsibility for peace-keeping with the organization of african unity -lrb- oau -rrb- . but greens co-leader angelika beer said earlier this year that the option of contributing troops to an international peace-keeping force should be left open . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de europe applies pressure to sudan germany and the us agreed to keep up pressure on sudan on the eve of a meeting in which european ministers will discuss the humanitarian crisis in the western darfur region .
-lrb- july 25 , 2004 -rrb- fischer pressures sudan to act to avert tragedy german foreign minister joschka fischer has held discussions with the sudanese president and foreign minister , saying the eu and germany will only provide aid if sudan acts to resolve the crisis in the darfur region .
-lrb- july 12 , 2004 -rrb- feedback should the eu send troops to sudan ?

today , german leaders argue that the country 's growing role in supporting peace-keeping missions should be recognized by including germany in the exclusive circle of countries . the timing seems right : un secretary general plans to finally go ahead with the organization 's long-awaited reform .
he 's put in place a committee of experts that will come up with proposals by the beginning of december . a permanent security council seat for germany could be on the agenda , the german government hopes .
but unfortunately none of the committee 's members come from germany . us likely against proposal the german government should n't lose sight of reality despite its hopes .
it would almost be a miracle if germany could get enough votes to make its wish come true . in order to succeed , two thirds of the 191 un member states have to approve the change , along with all five current permanent security council members : britain , china , france , russia and the united states . the germans might argue that they have shown great commitment but they are unlikely to achieve more than friendly praise from most other countries : after all , a permanent security council seat does n't get awarded like an honorary service medal . enough back and forth already it has more to do with power , and veto power at that : un resolutions regarding numerous crises have always lacked poignancy because one of the permanent members felt otherwise . there 's more than enough examples to prove this .
israel , chechnya and iraq are just some of the most striking ones .
should another veto power be added - even one like germany , which tries to resolve crises in a peaceful , diplomatic way - the dragging back and forth would only increase . on top of that , the us is unlikely to be interested in making a war opponent a veto power after a failed attempt to get un approval for the invasion of iraq . limited seats all other un members , who can only take turns at the table for two-year periods , have little interest in supporting the german plan as it would give them access to the security council even less frequently unless the number of seats -lrb- currently 15 -rrb- is increased . berlin has already given up on an alternative idea : a permanent seat for the european union .
that proposal failed because neither britain nor france want to give up their privileged status . but calling for a permanent seat for germany doesn â t have a bigger chance of success as no one - except germany - would benefit from it . klaus dahmann -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de fischer finds few backers for un seat german foreign minister joschka fischer wrapped up his 10-day trip to asia on friday .

the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .

additionally , structural barriers also make the german banking market less attractive to foreign investors .
for one , the private banking market here is dominated by the state-protected sparkassen , or savings banks .
because of the deeply segmented market , most of the private banks in germany have profit margins that are too weak to interest many foreign banks .
another factor in germany is that workers ' councils are given powerful seats on the board of major german banks and have voting rights in major strategic decisions .
and germany 's biggest private player , deutsche bank , has indicated it wants to increase its own profits before entering into the european consolidation game .
upside potential yet despite the difficulty in making structural changes in the german banking system , foreign investors say the relative bargain prices or upside potential of banks here make them attractive takeover targets .
for example , hough it has a relatively low market capitalization of around â¬ 11 billion , hvb holds a potentially lucrative 78-percent ownership of bank austria , which is strong in eastern europe . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de postbank goes public after a bumpy start , germany 's largest retail bank , postbank , successfully launched its initial public offering , though share prices were well below initial forecasts .

they plan to harmonize their policy towards the sudanese government that 's accused of doing too little to end the darfur crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer on sunday strongly advocated political sanctions against khartoum , should the government there not step up efforts to disarm the janjaweed militia and bring them before the courts . in an interview with german public television , fischer said on sunday that since his return from khartoum he â d been following very closely the sudanese government â s efforts to end the crisis in darfur .

" we â ll no doubt keep up the pressure on the government together with our european partners and the united states , â he said . fischer and powell coordinate in a telephone conversation on sunday with his us counterpart colin powell , fischer agreed that khartoum should face international sanctions , if it didn â t live up to its commitments . bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese refugee children walk past a dead donkey powell and fischer said no more time must be wasted to end the conflict which has left some 30,000 people dead , one million people displaced and another 2.2 million living in desperate need of food and medicine . â the sudanese government knows full well that the international community is no longer willing to just look on , " fischer said .

eu foreign ministers will meet in brussels on monday to deal with the situation in sudan .
they plan to harmonize their policy towards the sudanese government that 's accused of doing too little to end the darfur crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer on sunday strongly advocated political sanctions against khartoum , should the government there not step up efforts to disarm the janjaweed militia and bring them before the courts . in an interview with german public television , fischer said on sunday that since his return from khartoum he â d been following very closely the sudanese government â s efforts to end the crisis in darfur .
he said that despite the promises made by the sudanese president and the foreign minister , a solution to the conflict was not yet in sight . â violence continues in the region , " he said .
" i â ve heard terrible reports about looting and burning in villages , about rape on a massive scale .
on the other hand , it â s easier now for humanitarian aid organizations to do their job on the ground , but that â s certainly not enough . " fischer added that countries were cooperating on a un resolution on sudan , calling on the sudanese government to disarm the militia , bring their leaders to justice and stop the killing . " we â ll no doubt keep up the pressure on the government together with our european partners and the united states , â he said . fischer and powell coordinate in a telephone conversation on sunday with his us counterpart colin powell , fischer agreed that khartoum should face international sanctions , if it didn â t live up to its commitments . bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese refugee children walk past a dead donkey powell and fischer said no more time must be wasted to end the conflict which has left some 30,000 people dead , one million people displaced and another 2.2 million living in desperate need of food and medicine . â the sudanese government knows full well that the international community is no longer willing to just look on , " fischer said . " the un resolution is in the making , and sudan is facing political sanctions .
having said that , i want to emphasize that we â ll of course step up our efforts in the humanitarian field . â ahead of the eu foreign ministers â meeting in brussels , the sudanese foreign minister mustafa osman ismail met with eu foreign policy chief javier solana , claiming that his government was doing what was expected of it by the international community . ismail said sanctions against his country would therefore send out the wrong signal .
he added that increased dialogue would be the better option to get on top of the crisis . britain favors sending troops eu foreign ministers will have to debate the option of sending peace-enforcing troops to the darfur region .
britain seems to favour such a move .
at the weekend , a top military commander said he could muster 5,000 troops for a darfur mission .
british prime minister tony blair has not ruled out military intervention . the position of the german government on such a mission remains unclear .

wto general director panitchpakdi supachai confirmed last week that all parties have pledged to agree to a skeleton accord by the end of the week .
the foundation is a draft produced by supachai that would demand the elimination of contested export subsidies for farm products .
the paper also calls for widespread and worldwide liberalization of goods traffic and services .
the fight over agricultural subsidies in rich industrial countries , which total about $ 300 billion a year led to the collapse of talks in cancun , mexico , last september .
ever since , talks have been placed on the back burner .
few thrilled by compromise but on tuesday , a last attempt will be made by wto 's 147 member states to reach a deal , thus completing the work they were unable to finish in cancun 10 months ago .
if broad enough support can be found , the goal this week is to reach a deal that will lay out a timeframe and the foundations for negotiations of a new world trade accord .
whether sufficient support can be found is far from certain - the compromise proposal placed on the table last week by supachai was met with little enthusiasm .
for some , the proposal goes too far , and for others it does n't go far enough .
if an agreement ca n't be found in the coming days , the negotiations will likely cease , and no one knows if it will be possible to resuscitate them in the future .
opponents of globalization would most certainly celebrate another collapse of the trade round .
in their eyes , the wto is a rogue body in the global economy .
nevertheless , a breakdown of the talks would n't stop the process of globalization , it would just slow it down .
the consequences of a weakened wto the immediate consequence of a collapse would be a weakening of the wto .
the member states would stay on board and the treaties would remain in effect , but that 's not enough to ensure the wto 's long-term authority .
and such authority is necessary for the mediation of trade disputes .
without the wto , these problems would again fall into the hands of diplomats , and that would put smaller countries at an even greater disadvantage .
nor would the superpowers of the world economy benefit .
without the mediation of the geneva-based wto , trade disputes between the european union , the united states , japan and , eventually , china , would escalate more frequently and could spin out of control far more easily .
a breakdown could also have immediate consequences for growth and the global economy .
but there 's a huge disparity of opinions when it comes to measuring the impact a general liberalization would have .
the world bank has estimated it would generate $ 350 billion in new wealth , with more than half of that going to the developing nations since they would have the most to gain from an opening of their markets .
however , the wto is no development agency .
it 's an event that takes place within the confines of political reality . for the negotiators in geneva , the challenge is to find a multilateral way out of the current labyrinth of conflicting political interests by the end of the week . tom weingÃ¤rtner -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de eu prepares for wto agriculture talks the eu is going to the wto talks in geneva on tuesday with a common position , despite resistance from france .

the former star striker becomes the ninth coach of the three-time world cup champions and the youngest to fill the spot , at 39 , in the country 's history . " the subject of the continuing talks is now strictly about the sports side , " said harald stenger , a spokesman for dfb .
klinsmann had not confirmed until the final moment which role he would play in the new coaching line-up after flying back to germany from his home in los angeles for final negotiations on saturday .
now it is clear that the former stuttgart , monaco and inter milan forward will take the lead in a new coaching team that hopes to turn around the slumping national side in time for the 2006 world cup , which germany will host .
klinsmann , who won the world cup and european championships along the way to collecting 108 cups for his country , has a valid coaching license , but has n't led a team since retiring from the pitch in 1998 .
experience coupled with innovative approach bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann worked under osieck in the world cup winning team .
his coaching team is expected to include former canadian national team coach holger osieck as assistant coach .
the 56-year-old veteran held that job on the 1990 team under franz beckenbauer , who also never guided a side before leading the german team to its third world cup crown .
fellow retired striking icon oliver bierhoff , who played alongside klinsmann when germany were crowned european champions in 1996 , is expected to take over the new post of team manager , a liaison job between the coach , media and dfb officials .
klinsmann has long been one of the most outspoken critics of the creaking dfb and his appointment is likely to be the start of a major overhaul in german soccer .
he is already asking the organization to augment his staff with experts in areas like psychology and speed training , copying the training techniques used in the american basketball leagues .
" the most important thing is the dfb needs to develop dynamism .
we have to look around the world , " klinsmann said recently .
german soccer ready to wake up to new dawn bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld preferred to take a break .
klinsmann 's new employers have long been accused of sleeping through soccer 's modern developments and have been publicly embarrassed by the saga surrounding rudi vÃ¶ller 's resignation after the disastrous euro 2004 campaign .
the red faces deepened when germany 's top two coaches , ottmar hitzfeld -lrb- photo -rrb- and otto rehhagel , turned down the job after a public courtship .
now it hopes that lining up klinsmann will undo some of the damage .
his selection came as a huge surprise in germany , since the striker 's name had never been raised in connection with the job but those in the game have endorsed his appointment .
" this is an ingenious solution .
it 's a very good choice , " said hitzfeld , who turned down the job to take a year off coaching .
klinsmann said he also hopes to rely on the experience of the previous coach in his new role .
former team mate vÃ¶ller , another member of the 1990 world champions , is a close friend and will be able to pass on valuable knowledge on the pitfalls klinsmann should avoid . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann ready to take charge of team germany german soccer should n't hail its new national coach yet .

the former star striker becomes the ninth coach of the three-time world cup champions and the youngest to fill the spot , at 39 , in the country 's history . " the subject of the continuing talks is now strictly about the sports side , " said harald stenger , a spokesman for dfb .
klinsmann had not confirmed until the final moment which role he would play in the new coaching line-up after flying back to germany from his home in los angeles for final negotiations on saturday .
now it is clear that the former stuttgart , monaco and inter milan forward will take the lead in a new coaching team that hopes to turn around the slumping national side in time for the 2006 world cup , which germany will host .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.07.2004 eu prepares for wto agriculture talks groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the focus will be on farm trade policies the eu is going to the wto talks in geneva on tuesday with a common position , despite resistance from france .
the mini summit is aimed at getting the derailed doha round of trade talks back on track . as ministers and delegates of the 147 world trade organization member states converge on the shores of lake geneva on tuesday , the main issue on the agenda will be agricultural policies - an issue that pitted the developing world against rich industrial nations at last year 's failed summit in cancun .
this time around , the european union is offering to eliminate subsidies on its agricultural exports and brussels has called on the us to do the same .
" the council -lrb- of ministers -rrb- confirmed the union 's commitment for an agreement on a balanced framework on future dda -lrb- doha development agenda -rrb- negotiations , " read a statement issued by the eu 's top trade ministers on monday after a meeting held in advance of the summit .
at the same time , the eu trade ministers wrote , there was a need to " improve the balance " of the draft .
top eu trade official pascal lamy said he would not agree to concessions on farm subsidies that went beyond hard-won reforms to the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- agreed to last year .
additionally , lamy said the eu would seek more concessions from the united states , its most important trading partner , on farm reform .
so far , the us has not stated whether or not it would cut its own subsidy regime .
trying to get back on track bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing nations accused first-world leaders of turning a deaf ear to poor countries in cancun .
the doha round first commenced three years ago in the qatar capital .
the aim was to reach an agreement that would eliminate the â¬ 300 billion -lrb- $ 364.25 billion -rrb- in agricultural subsidies used by the richest countries to shore up their farming industry in order to provide developing countries with access to global agricultural markets .
doha talks at a major wto summit in cancun , mexico , ended in september without any deal after poorer countries walked out on the negotiations , alleging industrial nations had no interest in helping their developing neighbors .
seeking to avoid a repeat of the diplomatic catastrophe in cancun , europe in recent months has shown more willingness to budge on the subsidies issue .
on july 16 , wto director-general supachai panitchpakdi and general council head shotaro oshima introduced a proposal for the future treaty that calls for all agricultural subsidies to be eliminated by a " date to be agreed . "
german economics minister wolfgang clement called the wto draft of the negotiating plan for the elimination of subsidies and trade barriers a " usable foundation " and for a deal on the negotiating schedule to be reached this week in switzerland . bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france gets more agricultural subsidies from brussels than any other eu country however , france reiterated its concerns that the draft " is deeply unbalanced to the disadvantage of the eu . "
with more than 2 million workers in the farming industry , france is the greatest beneficiary of the eu 's generous agricultural subsidies .
chirac has publicly expressed his concerns that the eu will concede too much ground in the wto talks .
bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister michel barnier but french foreign minister michel barnier -lrb- photo -rrb- seemed largely pleased with monday 's statement by lamy that he would not allow any changes beyond last year 's cap reforms .
" the draft on the table in geneva today does not conform to the aims or the interests of the eu , " he said .
" we need a rebalancing of this draft .
the commission agrees and will work for this . "
in june 2003 , the eu agreed to a sweeping reform of its â¬ 40 billion a year agricultural policy -lrb- see related story below -rrb- that de-linked subsidies from production .
at the request of france , the ministers will meet again friday for a briefing from trade commissioner lamy over the concrete negotiations .
lamy has said it is important that the eu , despite france 's objections , stand behind its offer of eliminating export subsidies for agricultural products , step-by-step , until they reach zero .
because trade policy is a central eu competency , unanimous votes are not required in the council of ministers , and france can not exercise the veto power it enjoys in other policy areas . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de commentary : doha 's last stand this week 's talks in geneva will be the last opportunity the world trade organization has to salvage the doha round of trade after their spectacular collapse in mexico last year .

the reform will completely change the way the eu supports its farm sector .
wto talks collapse in cancun disappointment reigned among the world 's richer countries after world trade organization talks in cancun collapsed .
but delegates from poorer countries celebrated their ability to block proposals from the eu and others .

the former star striker becomes the ninth coach of the three-time world cup champions and the youngest to fill the spot , at 39 , in the country 's history . " the subject of the continuing talks is now strictly about the sports side , " said harald stenger , a spokesman for dfb .
klinsmann had not confirmed until the final moment which role he would play in the new coaching line-up after flying back to germany from his home in los angeles for final negotiations on saturday .
now it is clear that the former stuttgart , monaco and inter milan forward will take the lead in a new coaching team that hopes to turn around the slumping national side in time for the 2006 world cup , which germany will host .
klinsmann , who won the world cup and european championships along the way to collecting 108 cups for his country , has a valid coaching license , but has n't led a team since retiring from the pitch in 1998 .
experience coupled with innovative approach bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann worked under osieck in the world cup winning team .
his coaching team is expected to include former canadian national team coach holger osieck as assistant coach .
the 56-year-old veteran held that job on the 1990 team under franz beckenbauer , who also never guided a side before leading the german team to its third world cup crown .
fellow retired striking icon oliver bierhoff , who played alongside klinsmann when germany were crowned european champions in 1996 , is expected to take over the new post of team manager , a liaison job between the coach , media and dfb officials .
klinsmann has long been one of the most outspoken critics of the creaking dfb and his appointment is likely to be the start of a major overhaul in german soccer .
he is already asking the organization to augment his staff with experts in areas like psychology and speed training , copying the training techniques used in the american basketball leagues .
" the most important thing is the dfb needs to develop dynamism .
we have to look around the world , " klinsmann said recently .
german soccer ready to wake up to new dawn bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld preferred to take a break .
klinsmann 's new employers have long been accused of sleeping through soccer 's modern developments and have been publicly embarrassed by the saga surrounding rudi vÃ¶ller 's resignation after the disastrous euro 2004 campaign .
the red faces deepened when germany 's top two coaches , ottmar hitzfeld -lrb- photo -rrb- and otto rehhagel , turned down the job after a public courtship .
now it hopes that lining up klinsmann will undo some of the damage .
his selection came as a huge surprise in germany , since the striker 's name had never been raised in connection with the job but those in the game have endorsed his appointment .
" this is an ingenious solution .
it 's a very good choice , " said hitzfeld , who turned down the job to take a year off coaching .
klinsmann said he also hopes to rely on the experience of the previous coach in his new role .

" though the word " sanctions " was n't specifically mentioned in the draft statement , the eu said it had started drawing up a list of janjaweed arab militia leaders " responsible for breaches and violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , and those guiding and supporting them . " the eu said the sudanese government " will be pressed to arrest those persons or suspend them from office and to bring them to justice . " " the sudanese government has to deliver " bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foriegn minister joschka fischer , left , meets his sudanese counterpart mostafa osman ismail in khartoum .
" they need to be disarmed and the responsible need to go to trial , " german foreign minister joschka fischer , back from a recent trip to sudan , said .
" unity in the international community is very , very important , " fischer added .
" the sudanese government has to deliver . " speaking on german television earlier on sunday , fischer said his return from khartoum he â d been following very closely the sudanese government â s efforts to end the crisis in darfur .
he said that despite the promises made by the sudanese president and the foreign minister , a solution to the conflict was not yet in sight . â violence continues in the region , " he said .
" i â ve heard terrible reports about looting and burning in villages , about rape on a massive scale , " fischer said .
" we â ll no doubt keep up the pressure on the government together with our european partners and the united states , â he added . more than 1 million people displaced bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sudanese refugee child prepares in the desert outside tine on the chad side of the sudan border .
the conflict in sudan 's western darfur region began in february 2003 with a rebel uprising against khartoum , protesting that the largely black african region had been ignored by the arab government . up to 30,000 people , most of them black africans , have been killed in darfur , and an estimated 2.2 million in urgent need of food and medical attention . eu foreign ministers on monday also urged sudan to admit more aid workers to provide emergency food and shelter for more than 1 million people displaced in darfur .
" the -lrb- humanitarian -rrb- situation is slightly better , but that does n't mean the problem is solved , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" the risk is very high for a potential catastrophe . " the eu , the united states and humanitarian groups have accused the sudanese government of backing the militias - a claim denied by khartoum . khartoum rejects " genocide " charge ahead of the eu foreign ministers â meeting in brussels , the sudanese foreign minister mustafa osman ismail met with solana , claiming that his government was doing what was expected of it by the international community . ismail said sanctions against his country would therefore send out the wrong signal .
he added that increased dialogue would be the better option to get on top of the crisis . the us congress passed a resolution last week describing as " genocide " the atrocities committed in darfur . but ismail rejected the charge . " what is happening in darfur is not genocide .
it is a humanitarian crisis provoked by fighting which is not our fault ... the sudanese government did not start the fighting , " he told belgian daily de staandard . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de sudan at center of eu meeting eu foreign ministers will meet in brussels on monday to deal with the situation in sudan .

the mini summit is aimed at getting the derailed doha round of trade talks back on track . as ministers and delegates of the 147 world trade organization member states converge on the shores of lake geneva on tuesday , the main issue on the agenda will be agricultural policies - an issue that pitted the developing world against rich industrial nations at last year 's failed summit in cancun .
this time around , the european union is offering to eliminate subsidies on its agricultural exports and brussels has called on the us to do the same .
" the council -lrb- of ministers -rrb- confirmed the union 's commitment for an agreement on a balanced framework on future dda -lrb- doha development agenda -rrb- negotiations , " read a statement issued by the eu 's top trade ministers on monday after a meeting held in advance of the summit .
at the same time , the eu trade ministers wrote , there was a need to " improve the balance " of the draft .
top eu trade official pascal lamy said he would not agree to concessions on farm subsidies that went beyond hard-won reforms to the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- agreed to last year .
additionally , lamy said the eu would seek more concessions from the united states , its most important trading partner , on farm reform .

doha talks at a major wto summit in cancun , mexico , ended in september without any deal after poorer countries walked out on the negotiations , alleging industrial nations had no interest in helping their developing neighbors .
seeking to avoid a repeat of the diplomatic catastrophe in cancun , europe in recent months has shown more willingness to budge on the subsidies issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.07.2004 -pipe- 16:00 utc key elements of the reformed eu agricultural policy on june 26 , 2003 , eu farm ministers adopted a fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
the reform will completely change the way the eu supports its farm sector .
the new cap will be geared towards consumers and taxpayers , while giving eu farmers the freedom to produce what the market wants .
in future , the vast majority of subsidies will be paid independently from the volume of production .
to avoid abandonment of production , member states may choose to maintain a limited link between subsidy and production under well defined conditions and within clear limits .
these new " single farm payments " will be linked to the respect of environmental , food safety and animal welfare standards .
severing the link between subsidies and production will make eu farmers more competitive and market orientated , while providing the necessary income stability .
more money will be available to farmers for environmental , quality or animal welfare programs by reducing direct payments for bigger farms .
the council further decided to revise the milk , rice , cereals , durum wheat , dried fodder and nut sectors .
in order to respect the tight budgetary ceiling for the eu-25 until 2013 , ministers agreed to introduce a financial discipline mechanism .
this reform will also strengthen the eu 's negotiating hand in the ongoing wto trade talks .
the different elements of the reform will enter into force in 2004 and 2005 .
the single farm payment will enter into force in 2005 .

the reform will completely change the way the eu supports its farm sector .
the new cap will be geared towards consumers and taxpayers , while giving eu farmers the freedom to produce what the market wants .
in future , the vast majority of subsidies will be paid independently from the volume of production .
to avoid abandonment of production , member states may choose to maintain a limited link between subsidy and production under well defined conditions and within clear limits .
these new " single farm payments " will be linked to the respect of environmental , food safety and animal welfare standards .
severing the link between subsidies and production will make eu farmers more competitive and market orientated , while providing the necessary income stability .
more money will be available to farmers for environmental , quality or animal welfare programs by reducing direct payments for bigger farms .
the council further decided to revise the milk , rice , cereals , durum wheat , dried fodder and nut sectors .
in order to respect the tight budgetary ceiling for the eu-25 until 2013 , ministers agreed to introduce a financial discipline mechanism .
this reform will also strengthen the eu 's negotiating hand in the ongoing wto trade talks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.07.2004 -pipe- 11:00 utc rome ditches current eu commissioner the next european commission president , jose barroso , is said to have given his approval to the nomination of centrist european affairs minister rocco buttiglione instead of current commissioner mario monti .
however , berlusconi 's choice is being seen by the opposition as an attempt by the prime minister to hold together his fractured coalition , after recent clashes with the centrist union of the christian democrats udc .
the udc has been pushing for more influence in the coalition after doing well in the recent european elections , and has been objecting to a bill supported by the right-wing lega nord that gives more self-rule to the country 's prosperous northern regions .
" -lsb- this -rsb- gesture has important political significance and it 's a gesture of great generosity on the part of the prime minister , one that warrants attention , " buttiglione told reporters in rome .
current italian commissioner mario monti , who is well respected in brussels , had turned down a recent offer to become italy 's finance minister to remain in brussels .
the financial times said barroso would have given monti a high-profile portfolio but it is seen as unlikely that buttiglione will get such a brief .

according to the survey , most of the states favor allowing stores to open around the clock from monday to saturday .
this follows reports last week from the states of bayern and hesse which quoted local businesses which wanted to liberalize opening hours .
according to the accompanying report in the paper , longer opening hours will create more job opportunities .
the paper also cites gÃ¼nter basske , labor minister for the state of brandenburg , who has called for stores to be allowed to open on sundays if retailers promise to hire more people in a bid to address germany 's unemployment situation . more briefs 26.07.2004 -pipe- consumers in germany hit by oil price hike 26.07.2004 -pipe- ex-east german brown coal firm marks 10-year milestone 26.07.2004 -pipe- germany starts first unofficial summer sale 23.07.2004 -pipe- economist : longer workweek risks deflation 23.07.2004 -pipe- german air traffic controllers allowed to strike 23.07.2004 -pipe- greens : no record deficit in 2004 22.07.2004 -pipe- east germans should counsel own unemployed 22.07.2004 -pipe- german microsoft dealer convicted for fraud radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .
but the german market remains troubled . the shock waves unleashed from the announcement that spain 's santander central hispana would buy britain 's abbey national were n't restricted to the towering , glass and steel punctuated urban landscape of the city of london .
the ripples could also be felt in offices that make up frankfurt 's skyline , where many observers see this sparking a wave of consolidation in the european banking sector .
britain 's abbey national said monday it would approve a proposed takeover offer from spain 's biggest bank , santander central hispana .
the deal would create the world 's 10th largest bank , and experts believe it could be first bang of a long-awaited consolidation trend in the european banking sector .
santander 's board of directors approved the purchase on sunday evening , seeking to pay â¬ 13.6 billion to buy abbey , britain 's sixth-largest bank .
if the deal goes through , it will mark the first time a british bank has been taken over by a european competitor .

" following today 's offer from santander for abbey , the banks will all become clearly become takeover candidates again , " a stock trader in frankfurt told the reuters news agency .
another broker told the agency : " this is going to spark speculation about german banks as the subjects of takeovers and mergers again . "
on monday , the stock prices of hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , which has been shopping for a buyer , commerzbank and deutsche bank all rose by about 1 percent on the news .

hvb has reportedly been searching for a partner in recent months with at least four different banks , including the abn amro , bnp paribas , credit suisse and santander .
though the talks ended without any action , a wave of consolidation could give new impetus to foreign investors seeking discounts in germany .
hurdles make buyouts less attractive however , recent gains in share prices at hvb and commerzbank could make them less attractive targets .
additionally , structural barriers also make the german banking market less attractive to foreign investors .
for one , the private banking market here is dominated by the state-protected sparkassen , or savings banks .
because of the deeply segmented market , most of the private banks in germany have profit margins that are too weak to interest many foreign banks .
another factor in germany is that workers ' councils are given powerful seats on the board of major german banks and have voting rights in major strategic decisions .
and germany 's biggest private player , deutsche bank , has indicated it wants to increase its own profits before entering into the european consolidation game .
upside potential yet despite the difficulty in making structural changes in the german banking system , foreign investors say the relative bargain prices or upside potential of banks here make them attractive takeover targets .

the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .
but the german market remains troubled . the shock waves unleashed from the announcement that spain 's santander central hispana would buy britain 's abbey national were n't restricted to the towering , glass and steel punctuated urban landscape of the city of london .
the ripples could also be felt in offices that make up frankfurt 's skyline , where many observers see this sparking a wave of consolidation in the european banking sector .
britain 's abbey national said monday it would approve a proposed takeover offer from spain 's biggest bank , santander central hispana .
the deal would create the world 's 10th largest bank , and experts believe it could be first bang of a long-awaited consolidation trend in the european banking sector .
santander 's board of directors approved the purchase on sunday evening , seeking to pay â¬ 13.6 billion to buy abbey , britain 's sixth-largest bank .
if the deal goes through , it will mark the first time a british bank has been taken over by a european competitor .
is germany next ?
bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's skyscraper 's are the headquarters to germany 's biggest banks the move has led to new speculation of high-level mergers in germany , where the fractured banking landscape has languished in recent years .
" following today 's offer from santander for abbey , the banks will all become clearly become takeover candidates again , " a stock trader in frankfurt told the reuters news agency .
another broker told the agency : " this is going to spark speculation about german banks as the subjects of takeovers and mergers again . "
on monday , the stock prices of hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , which has been shopping for a buyer , commerzbank and deutsche bank all rose by about 1 percent on the news .
bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank headquarters in frankfurt deutsche bank -lrb- photo -rrb- held merger talks earlier this year with the us-based citigroup .
and munich-based hvb and frankfurt 's commerzbank are have often taken part in merger or takeover talks .
hvb has reportedly been searching for a partner in recent months with at least four different banks , including the abn amro , bnp paribas , credit suisse and santander .
though the talks ended without any action , a wave of consolidation could give new impetus to foreign investors seeking discounts in germany .
hurdles make buyouts less attractive however , recent gains in share prices at hvb and commerzbank could make them less attractive targets .
additionally , structural barriers also make the german banking market less attractive to foreign investors .
for one , the private banking market here is dominated by the state-protected sparkassen , or savings banks .
because of the deeply segmented market , most of the private banks in germany have profit margins that are too weak to interest many foreign banks .
another factor in germany is that workers ' councils are given powerful seats on the board of major german banks and have voting rights in major strategic decisions .
and germany 's biggest private player , deutsche bank , has indicated it wants to increase its own profits before entering into the european consolidation game .
upside potential yet despite the difficulty in making structural changes in the german banking system , foreign investors say the relative bargain prices or upside potential of banks here make them attractive takeover targets .

the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .
but the german market remains troubled . the shock waves unleashed from the announcement that spain 's santander central hispana would buy britain 's abbey national were n't restricted to the towering , glass and steel punctuated urban landscape of the city of london .
the ripples could also be felt in offices that make up frankfurt 's skyline , where many observers see this sparking a wave of consolidation in the european banking sector .
britain 's abbey national said monday it would approve a proposed takeover offer from spain 's biggest bank , santander central hispana .
the deal would create the world 's 10th largest bank , and experts believe it could be first bang of a long-awaited consolidation trend in the european banking sector .
santander 's board of directors approved the purchase on sunday evening , seeking to pay â¬ 13.6 billion to buy abbey , britain 's sixth-largest bank .
if the deal goes through , it will mark the first time a british bank has been taken over by a european competitor .

" following today 's offer from santander for abbey , the banks will all become clearly become takeover candidates again , " a stock trader in frankfurt told the reuters news agency .
another broker told the agency : " this is going to spark speculation about german banks as the subjects of takeovers and mergers again . "

now it is clear that the former stuttgart , monaco and inter milan forward will take the lead in a new coaching team that hopes to turn around the slumping national side in time for the 2006 world cup , which germany will host .
klinsmann , who won the world cup and european championships along the way to collecting 108 cups for his country , has a valid coaching license , but has n't led a team since retiring from the pitch in 1998 .
experience coupled with innovative approach bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann worked under osieck in the world cup winning team .
his coaching team is expected to include former canadian national team coach holger osieck as assistant coach .
the 56-year-old veteran held that job on the 1990 team under franz beckenbauer , who also never guided a side before leading the german team to its third world cup crown .
fellow retired striking icon oliver bierhoff , who played alongside klinsmann when germany were crowned european champions in 1996 , is expected to take over the new post of team manager , a liaison job between the coach , media and dfb officials .
klinsmann has long been one of the most outspoken critics of the creaking dfb and his appointment is likely to be the start of a major overhaul in german soccer .
he is already asking the organization to augment his staff with experts in areas like psychology and speed training , copying the training techniques used in the american basketball leagues .
" the most important thing is the dfb needs to develop dynamism .

klinsmann 's new employers have long been accused of sleeping through soccer 's modern developments and have been publicly embarrassed by the saga surrounding rudi vÃ¶ller 's resignation after the disastrous euro 2004 campaign .

the former star striker becomes the ninth coach of the three-time world cup champions and the youngest to fill the spot , at 39 , in the country 's history . " the subject of the continuing talks is now strictly about the sports side , " said harald stenger , a spokesman for dfb .
klinsmann had not confirmed until the final moment which role he would play in the new coaching line-up after flying back to germany from his home in los angeles for final negotiations on saturday .
now it is clear that the former stuttgart , monaco and inter milan forward will take the lead in a new coaching team that hopes to turn around the slumping national side in time for the 2006 world cup , which germany will host .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.07.2004 -pipe- 16:00 utc key elements of the reformed eu agricultural policy on june 26 , 2003 , eu farm ministers adopted a fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
the reform will completely change the way the eu supports its farm sector .
the new cap will be geared towards consumers and taxpayers , while giving eu farmers the freedom to produce what the market wants .
in future , the vast majority of subsidies will be paid independently from the volume of production .
to avoid abandonment of production , member states may choose to maintain a limited link between subsidy and production under well defined conditions and within clear limits .
these new " single farm payments " will be linked to the respect of environmental , food safety and animal welfare standards .
severing the link between subsidies and production will make eu farmers more competitive and market orientated , while providing the necessary income stability .
more money will be available to farmers for environmental , quality or animal welfare programs by reducing direct payments for bigger farms .
the council further decided to revise the milk , rice , cereals , durum wheat , dried fodder and nut sectors .
in order to respect the tight budgetary ceiling for the eu-25 until 2013 , ministers agreed to introduce a financial discipline mechanism .
this reform will also strengthen the eu 's negotiating hand in the ongoing wto trade talks .
the different elements of the reform will enter into force in 2004 and 2005 .
the single farm payment will enter into force in 2005 .
if a member state needs a transitional period due to its specific agricultural conditions , it may apply the single farm payment from 2007 at the latest .
key elements of the reformed cap * a single farm payment for eu farmers , independent from production ; limited coupled elements may be maintained to avoid abandonment of production , * this payment will be linked to the respect of environmental , food safety , animal and plant health and animal welfare standards , as well as the requirement to keep all farmland in good agricultural and environmental condition -lrb- " cross-compliance " -rrb- , * a strengthened rural development policy with more eu money , new measures to promote the environment , quality and animal welfare and to help farmers to meet eu production standards starting in 2005 , * a reduction in direct payments -lrb- " modulation " -rrb- for bigger farms to finance the new rural development policy , * a mechanism for financial discipline to ensure that the farm budget fixed until 2013 is not overshot , revisions to the market policy of the cap : * asymmetric price cuts in the milk sector : the intervention price for butter will be reduced by 25 % over four years , which is an additional price cut of 10 % compared to agenda 2000 , for skimmed milk powder a 15 % reduction over three years , as agreed in agenda 2000 , is retained , * reduction of the monthly increments in the cereals sector by half , the current intervention price will be maintained , * reforms in the rice , durum wheat , nuts , starch potatoes and dried fodder sectors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.07.2004 -pipe- 16:00 utc key elements of the reformed eu agricultural policy on june 26 , 2003 , eu farm ministers adopted a fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
the reform will completely change the way the eu supports its farm sector .
the new cap will be geared towards consumers and taxpayers , while giving eu farmers the freedom to produce what the market wants .
in future , the vast majority of subsidies will be paid independently from the volume of production .
to avoid abandonment of production , member states may choose to maintain a limited link between subsidy and production under well defined conditions and within clear limits .
these new " single farm payments " will be linked to the respect of environmental , food safety and animal welfare standards .
severing the link between subsidies and production will make eu farmers more competitive and market orientated , while providing the necessary income stability .
more money will be available to farmers for environmental , quality or animal welfare programs by reducing direct payments for bigger farms .
the council further decided to revise the milk , rice , cereals , durum wheat , dried fodder and nut sectors .
in order to respect the tight budgetary ceiling for the eu-25 until 2013 , ministers agreed to introduce a financial discipline mechanism .
this reform will also strengthen the eu 's negotiating hand in the ongoing wto trade talks .
the different elements of the reform will enter into force in 2004 and 2005 .
the single farm payment will enter into force in 2005 .
if a member state needs a transitional period due to its specific agricultural conditions , it may apply the single farm payment from 2007 at the latest .
key elements of the reformed cap * a single farm payment for eu farmers , independent from production ; limited coupled elements may be maintained to avoid abandonment of production , * this payment will be linked to the respect of environmental , food safety , animal and plant health and animal welfare standards , as well as the requirement to keep all farmland in good agricultural and environmental condition -lrb- " cross-compliance " -rrb- , * a strengthened rural development policy with more eu money , new measures to promote the environment , quality and animal welfare and to help farmers to meet eu production standards starting in 2005 , * a reduction in direct payments -lrb- " modulation " -rrb- for bigger farms to finance the new rural development policy , * a mechanism for financial discipline to ensure that the farm budget fixed until 2013 is not overshot , revisions to the market policy of the cap : * asymmetric price cuts in the milk sector : the intervention price for butter will be reduced by 25 % over four years , which is an additional price cut of 10 % compared to agenda 2000 , for skimmed milk powder a 15 % reduction over three years , as agreed in agenda 2000 , is retained , * reduction of the monthly increments in the cereals sector by half , the current intervention price will be maintained , * reforms in the rice , durum wheat , nuts , starch potatoes and dried fodder sectors .

the reform will completely change the way the eu supports its farm sector .
the new cap will be geared towards consumers and taxpayers , while giving eu farmers the freedom to produce what the market wants .
in future , the vast majority of subsidies will be paid independently from the volume of production .
to avoid abandonment of production , member states may choose to maintain a limited link between subsidy and production under well defined conditions and within clear limits .
these new " single farm payments " will be linked to the respect of environmental , food safety and animal welfare standards .
severing the link between subsidies and production will make eu farmers more competitive and market orientated , while providing the necessary income stability .
more money will be available to farmers for environmental , quality or animal welfare programs by reducing direct payments for bigger farms .
the council further decided to revise the milk , rice , cereals , durum wheat , dried fodder and nut sectors .
in order to respect the tight budgetary ceiling for the eu-25 until 2013 , ministers agreed to introduce a financial discipline mechanism .
this reform will also strengthen the eu 's negotiating hand in the ongoing wto trade talks .
the different elements of the reform will enter into force in 2004 and 2005 .
the single farm payment will enter into force in 2005 .
if a member state needs a transitional period due to its specific agricultural conditions , it may apply the single farm payment from 2007 at the latest .
key elements of the reformed cap * a single farm payment for eu farmers , independent from production ; limited coupled elements may be maintained to avoid abandonment of production , * this payment will be linked to the respect of environmental , food safety , animal and plant health and animal welfare standards , as well as the requirement to keep all farmland in good agricultural and environmental condition -lrb- " cross-compliance " -rrb- , * a strengthened rural development policy with more eu money , new measures to promote the environment , quality and animal welfare and to help farmers to meet eu production standards starting in 2005 , * a reduction in direct payments -lrb- " modulation " -rrb- for bigger farms to finance the new rural development policy , * a mechanism for financial discipline to ensure that the farm budget fixed until 2013 is not overshot , revisions to the market policy of the cap : * asymmetric price cuts in the milk sector : the intervention price for butter will be reduced by 25 % over four years , which is an additional price cut of 10 % compared to agenda 2000 , for skimmed milk powder a 15 % reduction over three years , as agreed in agenda 2000 , is retained , * reduction of the monthly increments in the cereals sector by half , the current intervention price will be maintained , * reforms in the rice , durum wheat , nuts , starch potatoes and dried fodder sectors .

the mini summit is aimed at getting the derailed doha round of trade talks back on track . as ministers and delegates of the 147 world trade organization member states converge on the shores of lake geneva on tuesday , the main issue on the agenda will be agricultural policies - an issue that pitted the developing world against rich industrial nations at last year 's failed summit in cancun .
this time around , the european union is offering to eliminate subsidies on its agricultural exports and brussels has called on the us to do the same .
" the council -lrb- of ministers -rrb- confirmed the union 's commitment for an agreement on a balanced framework on future dda -lrb- doha development agenda -rrb- negotiations , " read a statement issued by the eu 's top trade ministers on monday after a meeting held in advance of the summit .
at the same time , the eu trade ministers wrote , there was a need to " improve the balance " of the draft .
top eu trade official pascal lamy said he would not agree to concessions on farm subsidies that went beyond hard-won reforms to the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- agreed to last year .
additionally , lamy said the eu would seek more concessions from the united states , its most important trading partner , on farm reform .

doha talks at a major wto summit in cancun , mexico , ended in september without any deal after poorer countries walked out on the negotiations , alleging industrial nations had no interest in helping their developing neighbors .
seeking to avoid a repeat of the diplomatic catastrophe in cancun , europe in recent months has shown more willingness to budge on the subsidies issue .
on july 16 , wto director-general supachai panitchpakdi and general council head shotaro oshima introduced a proposal for the future treaty that calls for all agricultural subsidies to be eliminated by a " date to be agreed . "

in june 2003 , the eu agreed to a sweeping reform of its â¬ 40 billion a year agricultural policy -lrb- see related story below -rrb- that de-linked subsidies from production .
at the request of france , the ministers will meet again friday for a briefing from trade commissioner lamy over the concrete negotiations .
lamy has said it is important that the eu , despite france 's objections , stand behind its offer of eliminating export subsidies for agricultural products , step-by-step , until they reach zero .

the mini summit is aimed at getting the derailed doha round of trade talks back on track . as ministers and delegates of the 147 world trade organization member states converge on the shores of lake geneva on tuesday , the main issue on the agenda will be agricultural policies - an issue that pitted the developing world against rich industrial nations at last year 's failed summit in cancun .
this time around , the european union is offering to eliminate subsidies on its agricultural exports and brussels has called on the us to do the same .
" the council -lrb- of ministers -rrb- confirmed the union 's commitment for an agreement on a balanced framework on future dda -lrb- doha development agenda -rrb- negotiations , " read a statement issued by the eu 's top trade ministers on monday after a meeting held in advance of the summit .
at the same time , the eu trade ministers wrote , there was a need to " improve the balance " of the draft .
top eu trade official pascal lamy said he would not agree to concessions on farm subsidies that went beyond hard-won reforms to the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- agreed to last year .
additionally , lamy said the eu would seek more concessions from the united states , its most important trading partner , on farm reform .
so far , the us has not stated whether or not it would cut its own subsidy regime .
trying to get back on track bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing nations accused first-world leaders of turning a deaf ear to poor countries in cancun .
the doha round first commenced three years ago in the qatar capital .
the aim was to reach an agreement that would eliminate the â¬ 300 billion -lrb- $ 364.25 billion -rrb- in agricultural subsidies used by the richest countries to shore up their farming industry in order to provide developing countries with access to global agricultural markets .
doha talks at a major wto summit in cancun , mexico , ended in september without any deal after poorer countries walked out on the negotiations , alleging industrial nations had no interest in helping their developing neighbors .
seeking to avoid a repeat of the diplomatic catastrophe in cancun , europe in recent months has shown more willingness to budge on the subsidies issue .
on july 16 , wto director-general supachai panitchpakdi and general council head shotaro oshima introduced a proposal for the future treaty that calls for all agricultural subsidies to be eliminated by a " date to be agreed . "
german economics minister wolfgang clement called the wto draft of the negotiating plan for the elimination of subsidies and trade barriers a " usable foundation " and for a deal on the negotiating schedule to be reached this week in switzerland . bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france gets more agricultural subsidies from brussels than any other eu country however , france reiterated its concerns that the draft " is deeply unbalanced to the disadvantage of the eu . "
with more than 2 million workers in the farming industry , france is the greatest beneficiary of the eu 's generous agricultural subsidies .
chirac has publicly expressed his concerns that the eu will concede too much ground in the wto talks .

" the draft on the table in geneva today does not conform to the aims or the interests of the eu , " he said .
" we need a rebalancing of this draft .
the commission agrees and will work for this . "
in june 2003 , the eu agreed to a sweeping reform of its â¬ 40 billion a year agricultural policy -lrb- see related story below -rrb- that de-linked subsidies from production .
at the request of france , the ministers will meet again friday for a briefing from trade commissioner lamy over the concrete negotiations .
lamy has said it is important that the eu , despite france 's objections , stand behind its offer of eliminating export subsidies for agricultural products , step-by-step , until they reach zero .
because trade policy is a central eu competency , unanimous votes are not required in the council of ministers , and france can not exercise the veto power it enjoys in other policy areas . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de commentary : doha 's last stand this week 's talks in geneva will be the last opportunity the world trade organization has to salvage the doha round of trade after their spectacular collapse in mexico last year .

the mini summit is aimed at getting the derailed doha round of trade talks back on track . as ministers and delegates of the 147 world trade organization member states converge on the shores of lake geneva on tuesday , the main issue on the agenda will be agricultural policies - an issue that pitted the developing world against rich industrial nations at last year 's failed summit in cancun .
this time around , the european union is offering to eliminate subsidies on its agricultural exports and brussels has called on the us to do the same .
" the council -lrb- of ministers -rrb- confirmed the union 's commitment for an agreement on a balanced framework on future dda -lrb- doha development agenda -rrb- negotiations , " read a statement issued by the eu 's top trade ministers on monday after a meeting held in advance of the summit .
at the same time , the eu trade ministers wrote , there was a need to " improve the balance " of the draft .

wto general director panitchpakdi supachai confirmed last week that all parties have pledged to agree to a skeleton accord by the end of the week .
the foundation is a draft produced by supachai that would demand the elimination of contested export subsidies for farm products .
the paper also calls for widespread and worldwide liberalization of goods traffic and services .
the fight over agricultural subsidies in rich industrial countries , which total about $ 300 billion a year led to the collapse of talks in cancun , mexico , last september .
ever since , talks have been placed on the back burner .
few thrilled by compromise but on tuesday , a last attempt will be made by wto 's 147 member states to reach a deal , thus completing the work they were unable to finish in cancun 10 months ago .
if broad enough support can be found , the goal this week is to reach a deal that will lay out a timeframe and the foundations for negotiations of a new world trade accord .
whether sufficient support can be found is far from certain - the compromise proposal placed on the table last week by supachai was met with little enthusiasm .
for some , the proposal goes too far , and for others it does n't go far enough .
if an agreement ca n't be found in the coming days , the negotiations will likely cease , and no one knows if it will be possible to resuscitate them in the future .

without the wto , these problems would again fall into the hands of diplomats , and that would put smaller countries at an even greater disadvantage .

the world bank has estimated it would generate $ 350 billion in new wealth , with more than half of that going to the developing nations since they would have the most to gain from an opening of their markets .
however , the wto is no development agency .

wto general director panitchpakdi supachai confirmed last week that all parties have pledged to agree to a skeleton accord by the end of the week .
the foundation is a draft produced by supachai that would demand the elimination of contested export subsidies for farm products .
the paper also calls for widespread and worldwide liberalization of goods traffic and services .
the fight over agricultural subsidies in rich industrial countries , which total about $ 300 billion a year led to the collapse of talks in cancun , mexico , last september .
ever since , talks have been placed on the back burner .
few thrilled by compromise but on tuesday , a last attempt will be made by wto 's 147 member states to reach a deal , thus completing the work they were unable to finish in cancun 10 months ago .
if broad enough support can be found , the goal this week is to reach a deal that will lay out a timeframe and the foundations for negotiations of a new world trade accord .
whether sufficient support can be found is far from certain - the compromise proposal placed on the table last week by supachai was met with little enthusiasm .
for some , the proposal goes too far , and for others it does n't go far enough .
if an agreement ca n't be found in the coming days , the negotiations will likely cease , and no one knows if it will be possible to resuscitate them in the future .
opponents of globalization would most certainly celebrate another collapse of the trade round .
in their eyes , the wto is a rogue body in the global economy .
nevertheless , a breakdown of the talks would n't stop the process of globalization , it would just slow it down .
the consequences of a weakened wto the immediate consequence of a collapse would be a weakening of the wto .
the member states would stay on board and the treaties would remain in effect , but that 's not enough to ensure the wto 's long-term authority .
and such authority is necessary for the mediation of trade disputes .
without the wto , these problems would again fall into the hands of diplomats , and that would put smaller countries at an even greater disadvantage .
nor would the superpowers of the world economy benefit .
without the mediation of the geneva-based wto , trade disputes between the european union , the united states , japan and , eventually , china , would escalate more frequently and could spin out of control far more easily .
a breakdown could also have immediate consequences for growth and the global economy .
but there 's a huge disparity of opinions when it comes to measuring the impact a general liberalization would have .
the world bank has estimated it would generate $ 350 billion in new wealth , with more than half of that going to the developing nations since they would have the most to gain from an opening of their markets .
however , the wto is no development agency .
it 's an event that takes place within the confines of political reality . for the negotiators in geneva , the challenge is to find a multilateral way out of the current labyrinth of conflicting political interests by the end of the week . tom weingÃ¤rtner -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de eu prepares for wto agriculture talks the eu is going to the wto talks in geneva on tuesday with a common position , despite resistance from france .

eu foreign ministers will meet in brussels on monday to deal with the situation in sudan .
they plan to harmonize their policy towards the sudanese government that 's accused of doing too little to end the darfur crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer on sunday strongly advocated political sanctions against khartoum , should the government there not step up efforts to disarm the janjaweed militia and bring them before the courts . in an interview with german public television , fischer said on sunday that since his return from khartoum he â d been following very closely the sudanese government â s efforts to end the crisis in darfur .
he said that despite the promises made by the sudanese president and the foreign minister , a solution to the conflict was not yet in sight . â violence continues in the region , " he said .
" i â ve heard terrible reports about looting and burning in villages , about rape on a massive scale .
on the other hand , it â s easier now for humanitarian aid organizations to do their job on the ground , but that â s certainly not enough . " fischer added that countries were cooperating on a un resolution on sudan , calling on the sudanese government to disarm the militia , bring their leaders to justice and stop the killing . " we â ll no doubt keep up the pressure on the government together with our european partners and the united states , â he said . fischer and powell coordinate in a telephone conversation on sunday with his us counterpart colin powell , fischer agreed that khartoum should face international sanctions , if it didn â t live up to its commitments . bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese refugee children walk past a dead donkey powell and fischer said no more time must be wasted to end the conflict which has left some 30,000 people dead , one million people displaced and another 2.2 million living in desperate need of food and medicine . â the sudanese government knows full well that the international community is no longer willing to just look on , " fischer said . " the un resolution is in the making , and sudan is facing political sanctions .

after the abolition of the official sale , more than two thirds of all businesses will take part in this first voluntary one , according to a survey by the federation of german retail trade -lrb- hde -rrb- .

the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .
but the german market remains troubled . the shock waves unleashed from the announcement that spain 's santander central hispana would buy britain 's abbey national were n't restricted to the towering , glass and steel punctuated urban landscape of the city of london .
the ripples could also be felt in offices that make up frankfurt 's skyline , where many observers see this sparking a wave of consolidation in the european banking sector .
britain 's abbey national said monday it would approve a proposed takeover offer from spain 's biggest bank , santander central hispana .
the deal would create the world 's 10th largest bank , and experts believe it could be first bang of a long-awaited consolidation trend in the european banking sector .
santander 's board of directors approved the purchase on sunday evening , seeking to pay â¬ 13.6 billion to buy abbey , britain 's sixth-largest bank .
if the deal goes through , it will mark the first time a british bank has been taken over by a european competitor .
is germany next ?
bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's skyscraper 's are the headquarters to germany 's biggest banks the move has led to new speculation of high-level mergers in germany , where the fractured banking landscape has languished in recent years .
" following today 's offer from santander for abbey , the banks will all become clearly become takeover candidates again , " a stock trader in frankfurt told the reuters news agency .
another broker told the agency : " this is going to spark speculation about german banks as the subjects of takeovers and mergers again . "
on monday , the stock prices of hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , which has been shopping for a buyer , commerzbank and deutsche bank all rose by about 1 percent on the news .
bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank headquarters in frankfurt deutsche bank -lrb- photo -rrb- held merger talks earlier this year with the us-based citigroup .
and munich-based hvb and frankfurt 's commerzbank are have often taken part in merger or takeover talks .
hvb has reportedly been searching for a partner in recent months with at least four different banks , including the abn amro , bnp paribas , credit suisse and santander .
though the talks ended without any action , a wave of consolidation could give new impetus to foreign investors seeking discounts in germany .
hurdles make buyouts less attractive however , recent gains in share prices at hvb and commerzbank could make them less attractive targets .
additionally , structural barriers also make the german banking market less attractive to foreign investors .
for one , the private banking market here is dominated by the state-protected sparkassen , or savings banks .
because of the deeply segmented market , most of the private banks in germany have profit margins that are too weak to interest many foreign banks .
another factor in germany is that workers ' councils are given powerful seats on the board of major german banks and have voting rights in major strategic decisions .
and germany 's biggest private player , deutsche bank , has indicated it wants to increase its own profits before entering into the european consolidation game .
upside potential yet despite the difficulty in making structural changes in the german banking system , foreign investors say the relative bargain prices or upside potential of banks here make them attractive takeover targets .
for example , hough it has a relatively low market capitalization of around â¬ 11 billion , hvb holds a potentially lucrative 78-percent ownership of bank austria , which is strong in eastern europe . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de postbank goes public after a bumpy start , germany 's largest retail bank , postbank , successfully launched its initial public offering , though share prices were well below initial forecasts .

wto general director panitchpakdi supachai confirmed last week that all parties have pledged to agree to a skeleton accord by the end of the week .
the foundation is a draft produced by supachai that would demand the elimination of contested export subsidies for farm products .
the paper also calls for widespread and worldwide liberalization of goods traffic and services .
the fight over agricultural subsidies in rich industrial countries , which total about $ 300 billion a year led to the collapse of talks in cancun , mexico , last september .
ever since , talks have been placed on the back burner .
few thrilled by compromise but on tuesday , a last attempt will be made by wto 's 147 member states to reach a deal , thus completing the work they were unable to finish in cancun 10 months ago .
if broad enough support can be found , the goal this week is to reach a deal that will lay out a timeframe and the foundations for negotiations of a new world trade accord .
whether sufficient support can be found is far from certain - the compromise proposal placed on the table last week by supachai was met with little enthusiasm .
for some , the proposal goes too far , and for others it does n't go far enough .
if an agreement ca n't be found in the coming days , the negotiations will likely cease , and no one knows if it will be possible to resuscitate them in the future .
opponents of globalization would most certainly celebrate another collapse of the trade round .
in their eyes , the wto is a rogue body in the global economy .
nevertheless , a breakdown of the talks would n't stop the process of globalization , it would just slow it down .
the consequences of a weakened wto the immediate consequence of a collapse would be a weakening of the wto .
the member states would stay on board and the treaties would remain in effect , but that 's not enough to ensure the wto 's long-term authority .
and such authority is necessary for the mediation of trade disputes .
without the wto , these problems would again fall into the hands of diplomats , and that would put smaller countries at an even greater disadvantage .
nor would the superpowers of the world economy benefit .
without the mediation of the geneva-based wto , trade disputes between the european union , the united states , japan and , eventually , china , would escalate more frequently and could spin out of control far more easily .
a breakdown could also have immediate consequences for growth and the global economy .
but there 's a huge disparity of opinions when it comes to measuring the impact a general liberalization would have .
the world bank has estimated it would generate $ 350 billion in new wealth , with more than half of that going to the developing nations since they would have the most to gain from an opening of their markets .
however , the wto is no development agency .

wto general director panitchpakdi supachai confirmed last week that all parties have pledged to agree to a skeleton accord by the end of the week .
the foundation is a draft produced by supachai that would demand the elimination of contested export subsidies for farm products .
the paper also calls for widespread and worldwide liberalization of goods traffic and services .
the fight over agricultural subsidies in rich industrial countries , which total about $ 300 billion a year led to the collapse of talks in cancun , mexico , last september .
ever since , talks have been placed on the back burner .
few thrilled by compromise but on tuesday , a last attempt will be made by wto 's 147 member states to reach a deal , thus completing the work they were unable to finish in cancun 10 months ago .
if broad enough support can be found , the goal this week is to reach a deal that will lay out a timeframe and the foundations for negotiations of a new world trade accord .
whether sufficient support can be found is far from certain - the compromise proposal placed on the table last week by supachai was met with little enthusiasm .
for some , the proposal goes too far , and for others it does n't go far enough .
if an agreement ca n't be found in the coming days , the negotiations will likely cease , and no one knows if it will be possible to resuscitate them in the future .
opponents of globalization would most certainly celebrate another collapse of the trade round .
in their eyes , the wto is a rogue body in the global economy .
nevertheless , a breakdown of the talks would n't stop the process of globalization , it would just slow it down .
the consequences of a weakened wto the immediate consequence of a collapse would be a weakening of the wto .
the member states would stay on board and the treaties would remain in effect , but that 's not enough to ensure the wto 's long-term authority .
and such authority is necessary for the mediation of trade disputes .

the mini summit is aimed at getting the derailed doha round of trade talks back on track . as ministers and delegates of the 147 world trade organization member states converge on the shores of lake geneva on tuesday , the main issue on the agenda will be agricultural policies - an issue that pitted the developing world against rich industrial nations at last year 's failed summit in cancun .
this time around , the european union is offering to eliminate subsidies on its agricultural exports and brussels has called on the us to do the same .
" the council -lrb- of ministers -rrb- confirmed the union 's commitment for an agreement on a balanced framework on future dda -lrb- doha development agenda -rrb- negotiations , " read a statement issued by the eu 's top trade ministers on monday after a meeting held in advance of the summit .
at the same time , the eu trade ministers wrote , there was a need to " improve the balance " of the draft .
top eu trade official pascal lamy said he would not agree to concessions on farm subsidies that went beyond hard-won reforms to the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- agreed to last year .
additionally , lamy said the eu would seek more concessions from the united states , its most important trading partner , on farm reform .
so far , the us has not stated whether or not it would cut its own subsidy regime .
trying to get back on track bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing nations accused first-world leaders of turning a deaf ear to poor countries in cancun .
the doha round first commenced three years ago in the qatar capital .
the aim was to reach an agreement that would eliminate the â¬ 300 billion -lrb- $ 364.25 billion -rrb- in agricultural subsidies used by the richest countries to shore up their farming industry in order to provide developing countries with access to global agricultural markets .
doha talks at a major wto summit in cancun , mexico , ended in september without any deal after poorer countries walked out on the negotiations , alleging industrial nations had no interest in helping their developing neighbors .
seeking to avoid a repeat of the diplomatic catastrophe in cancun , europe in recent months has shown more willingness to budge on the subsidies issue .
on july 16 , wto director-general supachai panitchpakdi and general council head shotaro oshima introduced a proposal for the future treaty that calls for all agricultural subsidies to be eliminated by a " date to be agreed . "
german economics minister wolfgang clement called the wto draft of the negotiating plan for the elimination of subsidies and trade barriers a " usable foundation " and for a deal on the negotiating schedule to be reached this week in switzerland . bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france gets more agricultural subsidies from brussels than any other eu country however , france reiterated its concerns that the draft " is deeply unbalanced to the disadvantage of the eu . "
with more than 2 million workers in the farming industry , france is the greatest beneficiary of the eu 's generous agricultural subsidies .
chirac has publicly expressed his concerns that the eu will concede too much ground in the wto talks .
bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister michel barnier but french foreign minister michel barnier -lrb- photo -rrb- seemed largely pleased with monday 's statement by lamy that he would not allow any changes beyond last year 's cap reforms .
" the draft on the table in geneva today does not conform to the aims or the interests of the eu , " he said .
" we need a rebalancing of this draft .
the commission agrees and will work for this . "
in june 2003 , the eu agreed to a sweeping reform of its â¬ 40 billion a year agricultural policy -lrb- see related story below -rrb- that de-linked subsidies from production .
at the request of france , the ministers will meet again friday for a briefing from trade commissioner lamy over the concrete negotiations .
lamy has said it is important that the eu , despite france 's objections , stand behind its offer of eliminating export subsidies for agricultural products , step-by-step , until they reach zero .
because trade policy is a central eu competency , unanimous votes are not required in the council of ministers , and france can not exercise the veto power it enjoys in other policy areas . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de commentary : doha 's last stand this week 's talks in geneva will be the last opportunity the world trade organization has to salvage the doha round of trade after their spectacular collapse in mexico last year .

the mini summit is aimed at getting the derailed doha round of trade talks back on track . as ministers and delegates of the 147 world trade organization member states converge on the shores of lake geneva on tuesday , the main issue on the agenda will be agricultural policies - an issue that pitted the developing world against rich industrial nations at last year 's failed summit in cancun .
this time around , the european union is offering to eliminate subsidies on its agricultural exports and brussels has called on the us to do the same .
" the council -lrb- of ministers -rrb- confirmed the union 's commitment for an agreement on a balanced framework on future dda -lrb- doha development agenda -rrb- negotiations , " read a statement issued by the eu 's top trade ministers on monday after a meeting held in advance of the summit .
at the same time , the eu trade ministers wrote , there was a need to " improve the balance " of the draft .
top eu trade official pascal lamy said he would not agree to concessions on farm subsidies that went beyond hard-won reforms to the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- agreed to last year .
additionally , lamy said the eu would seek more concessions from the united states , its most important trading partner , on farm reform .
so far , the us has not stated whether or not it would cut its own subsidy regime .
trying to get back on track bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing nations accused first-world leaders of turning a deaf ear to poor countries in cancun .
the doha round first commenced three years ago in the qatar capital .
the aim was to reach an agreement that would eliminate the â¬ 300 billion -lrb- $ 364.25 billion -rrb- in agricultural subsidies used by the richest countries to shore up their farming industry in order to provide developing countries with access to global agricultural markets .
doha talks at a major wto summit in cancun , mexico , ended in september without any deal after poorer countries walked out on the negotiations , alleging industrial nations had no interest in helping their developing neighbors .
seeking to avoid a repeat of the diplomatic catastrophe in cancun , europe in recent months has shown more willingness to budge on the subsidies issue .
on july 16 , wto director-general supachai panitchpakdi and general council head shotaro oshima introduced a proposal for the future treaty that calls for all agricultural subsidies to be eliminated by a " date to be agreed . "
german economics minister wolfgang clement called the wto draft of the negotiating plan for the elimination of subsidies and trade barriers a " usable foundation " and for a deal on the negotiating schedule to be reached this week in switzerland . bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france gets more agricultural subsidies from brussels than any other eu country however , france reiterated its concerns that the draft " is deeply unbalanced to the disadvantage of the eu . "
with more than 2 million workers in the farming industry , france is the greatest beneficiary of the eu 's generous agricultural subsidies .
chirac has publicly expressed his concerns that the eu will concede too much ground in the wto talks .
bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister michel barnier but french foreign minister michel barnier -lrb- photo -rrb- seemed largely pleased with monday 's statement by lamy that he would not allow any changes beyond last year 's cap reforms .
" the draft on the table in geneva today does not conform to the aims or the interests of the eu , " he said .
" we need a rebalancing of this draft .
the commission agrees and will work for this . "
in june 2003 , the eu agreed to a sweeping reform of its â¬ 40 billion a year agricultural policy -lrb- see related story below -rrb- that de-linked subsidies from production .
at the request of france , the ministers will meet again friday for a briefing from trade commissioner lamy over the concrete negotiations .
lamy has said it is important that the eu , despite france 's objections , stand behind its offer of eliminating export subsidies for agricultural products , step-by-step , until they reach zero .
because trade policy is a central eu competency , unanimous votes are not required in the council of ministers , and france can not exercise the veto power it enjoys in other policy areas . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de commentary : doha 's last stand this week 's talks in geneva will be the last opportunity the world trade organization has to salvage the doha round of trade after their spectacular collapse in mexico last year .

the reform will completely change the way the eu supports its farm sector .
the new cap will be geared towards consumers and taxpayers , while giving eu farmers the freedom to produce what the market wants .
in future , the vast majority of subsidies will be paid independently from the volume of production .
to avoid abandonment of production , member states may choose to maintain a limited link between subsidy and production under well defined conditions and within clear limits .
these new " single farm payments " will be linked to the respect of environmental , food safety and animal welfare standards .
severing the link between subsidies and production will make eu farmers more competitive and market orientated , while providing the necessary income stability .
more money will be available to farmers for environmental , quality or animal welfare programs by reducing direct payments for bigger farms .

the reform will completely change the way the eu supports its farm sector .
the new cap will be geared towards consumers and taxpayers , while giving eu farmers the freedom to produce what the market wants .
in future , the vast majority of subsidies will be paid independently from the volume of production .
to avoid abandonment of production , member states may choose to maintain a limited link between subsidy and production under well defined conditions and within clear limits .
these new " single farm payments " will be linked to the respect of environmental , food safety and animal welfare standards .
severing the link between subsidies and production will make eu farmers more competitive and market orientated , while providing the necessary income stability .
more money will be available to farmers for environmental , quality or animal welfare programs by reducing direct payments for bigger farms .
the council further decided to revise the milk , rice , cereals , durum wheat , dried fodder and nut sectors .
in order to respect the tight budgetary ceiling for the eu-25 until 2013 , ministers agreed to introduce a financial discipline mechanism .
this reform will also strengthen the eu 's negotiating hand in the ongoing wto trade talks .
the different elements of the reform will enter into force in 2004 and 2005 .
the single farm payment will enter into force in 2005 .
if a member state needs a transitional period due to its specific agricultural conditions , it may apply the single farm payment from 2007 at the latest .
key elements of the reformed cap * a single farm payment for eu farmers , independent from production ; limited coupled elements may be maintained to avoid abandonment of production , * this payment will be linked to the respect of environmental , food safety , animal and plant health and animal welfare standards , as well as the requirement to keep all farmland in good agricultural and environmental condition -lrb- " cross-compliance " -rrb- , * a strengthened rural development policy with more eu money , new measures to promote the environment , quality and animal welfare and to help farmers to meet eu production standards starting in 2005 , * a reduction in direct payments -lrb- " modulation " -rrb- for bigger farms to finance the new rural development policy , * a mechanism for financial discipline to ensure that the farm budget fixed until 2013 is not overshot , revisions to the market policy of the cap : * asymmetric price cuts in the milk sector : the intervention price for butter will be reduced by 25 % over four years , which is an additional price cut of 10 % compared to agenda 2000 , for skimmed milk powder a 15 % reduction over three years , as agreed in agenda 2000 , is retained , * reduction of the monthly increments in the cereals sector by half , the current intervention price will be maintained , * reforms in the rice , durum wheat , nuts , starch potatoes and dried fodder sectors .

" the foreign ministers said they expect the government in khartoum to ensure that violations cease " with immediate effect " or the eu would take " appropriate steps . " though the word " sanctions " was n't specifically mentioned in the draft statement , the eu said it had started drawing up a list of janjaweed arab militia leaders " responsible for breaches and violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , and those guiding and supporting them . " the eu said the sudanese government " will be pressed to arrest those persons or suspend them from office and to bring them to justice . " " the sudanese government has to deliver " bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foriegn minister joschka fischer , left , meets his sudanese counterpart mostafa osman ismail in khartoum .
" they need to be disarmed and the responsible need to go to trial , " german foreign minister joschka fischer , back from a recent trip to sudan , said .
" unity in the international community is very , very important , " fischer added .
" the sudanese government has to deliver . " speaking on german television earlier on sunday , fischer said his return from khartoum he â d been following very closely the sudanese government â s efforts to end the crisis in darfur .
he said that despite the promises made by the sudanese president and the foreign minister , a solution to the conflict was not yet in sight . â violence continues in the region , " he said .
" i â ve heard terrible reports about looting and burning in villages , about rape on a massive scale , " fischer said .
" we â ll no doubt keep up the pressure on the government together with our european partners and the united states , â he added . more than 1 million people displaced bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sudanese refugee child prepares in the desert outside tine on the chad side of the sudan border .
the conflict in sudan 's western darfur region began in february 2003 with a rebel uprising against khartoum , protesting that the largely black african region had been ignored by the arab government . up to 30,000 people , most of them black africans , have been killed in darfur , and an estimated 2.2 million in urgent need of food and medical attention . eu foreign ministers on monday also urged sudan to admit more aid workers to provide emergency food and shelter for more than 1 million people displaced in darfur .
" the -lrb- humanitarian -rrb- situation is slightly better , but that does n't mean the problem is solved , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" the risk is very high for a potential catastrophe . " the eu , the united states and humanitarian groups have accused the sudanese government of backing the militias - a claim denied by khartoum . khartoum rejects " genocide " charge ahead of the eu foreign ministers â meeting in brussels , the sudanese foreign minister mustafa osman ismail met with solana , claiming that his government was doing what was expected of it by the international community . ismail said sanctions against his country would therefore send out the wrong signal .
he added that increased dialogue would be the better option to get on top of the crisis . the us congress passed a resolution last week describing as " genocide " the atrocities committed in darfur . but ismail rejected the charge . " what is happening in darfur is not genocide .
it is a humanitarian crisis provoked by fighting which is not our fault ... the sudanese government did not start the fighting , " he told belgian daily de staandard . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de sudan at center of eu meeting eu foreign ministers will meet in brussels on monday to deal with the situation in sudan .

the former star striker becomes the ninth coach of the three-time world cup champions and the youngest to fill the spot , at 39 , in the country 's history . " the subject of the continuing talks is now strictly about the sports side , " said harald stenger , a spokesman for dfb .
klinsmann had not confirmed until the final moment which role he would play in the new coaching line-up after flying back to germany from his home in los angeles for final negotiations on saturday .
now it is clear that the former stuttgart , monaco and inter milan forward will take the lead in a new coaching team that hopes to turn around the slumping national side in time for the 2006 world cup , which germany will host .

fellow retired striking icon oliver bierhoff , who played alongside klinsmann when germany were crowned european champions in 1996 , is expected to take over the new post of team manager , a liaison job between the coach , media and dfb officials .
klinsmann has long been one of the most outspoken critics of the creaking dfb and his appointment is likely to be the start of a major overhaul in german soccer .
he is already asking the organization to augment his staff with experts in areas like psychology and speed training , copying the training techniques used in the american basketball leagues .

they plan to harmonize their policy towards the sudanese government that 's accused of doing too little to end the darfur crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer on sunday strongly advocated political sanctions against khartoum , should the government there not step up efforts to disarm the janjaweed militia and bring them before the courts . in an interview with german public television , fischer said on sunday that since his return from khartoum he â d been following very closely the sudanese government â s efforts to end the crisis in darfur .

on the other hand , it â s easier now for humanitarian aid organizations to do their job on the ground , but that â s certainly not enough .

" we â ll no doubt keep up the pressure on the government together with our european partners and the united states , â he said . fischer and powell coordinate in a telephone conversation on sunday with his us counterpart colin powell , fischer agreed that khartoum should face international sanctions , if it didn â t live up to its commitments . bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese refugee children walk past a dead donkey powell and fischer said no more time must be wasted to end the conflict which has left some 30,000 people dead , one million people displaced and another 2.2 million living in desperate need of food and medicine . â the sudanese government knows full well that the international community is no longer willing to just look on , " fischer said .

eu foreign ministers will meet in brussels on monday to deal with the situation in sudan .
they plan to harmonize their policy towards the sudanese government that 's accused of doing too little to end the darfur crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer on sunday strongly advocated political sanctions against khartoum , should the government there not step up efforts to disarm the janjaweed militia and bring them before the courts . in an interview with german public television , fischer said on sunday that since his return from khartoum he â d been following very closely the sudanese government â s efforts to end the crisis in darfur .
he said that despite the promises made by the sudanese president and the foreign minister , a solution to the conflict was not yet in sight . â violence continues in the region , " he said .
" i â ve heard terrible reports about looting and burning in villages , about rape on a massive scale .
on the other hand , it â s easier now for humanitarian aid organizations to do their job on the ground , but that â s certainly not enough . " fischer added that countries were cooperating on a un resolution on sudan , calling on the sudanese government to disarm the militia , bring their leaders to justice and stop the killing . " we â ll no doubt keep up the pressure on the government together with our european partners and the united states , â he said . fischer and powell coordinate in a telephone conversation on sunday with his us counterpart colin powell , fischer agreed that khartoum should face international sanctions , if it didn â t live up to its commitments . bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese refugee children walk past a dead donkey powell and fischer said no more time must be wasted to end the conflict which has left some 30,000 people dead , one million people displaced and another 2.2 million living in desperate need of food and medicine . â the sudanese government knows full well that the international community is no longer willing to just look on , " fischer said . " the un resolution is in the making , and sudan is facing political sanctions .
having said that , i want to emphasize that we â ll of course step up our efforts in the humanitarian field . â ahead of the eu foreign ministers â meeting in brussels , the sudanese foreign minister mustafa osman ismail met with eu foreign policy chief javier solana , claiming that his government was doing what was expected of it by the international community . ismail said sanctions against his country would therefore send out the wrong signal .
he added that increased dialogue would be the better option to get on top of the crisis . britain favors sending troops eu foreign ministers will have to debate the option of sending peace-enforcing troops to the darfur region .
britain seems to favour such a move .
at the weekend , a top military commander said he could muster 5,000 troops for a darfur mission .
british prime minister tony blair has not ruled out military intervention . the position of the german government on such a mission remains unclear .
fischer wants to place responsibility for peace-keeping with the organization of african unity -lrb- oau -rrb- . but greens co-leader angelika beer said earlier this year that the option of contributing troops to an international peace-keeping force should be left open . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de europe applies pressure to sudan germany and the us agreed to keep up pressure on sudan on the eve of a meeting in which european ministers will discuss the humanitarian crisis in the western darfur region .

but chances for success are limited as only berlin would benefit from the change . a newfound self-confidence has been spurring on german politicians since the end of the cold war and the country 's reunification that followed .
" we 're somebody again " is a rallying cry that 's become popular again . during the 1960s , germany 's economic boom justified such a sentiment .
today , german leaders argue that the country 's growing role in supporting peace-keeping missions should be recognized by including germany in the exclusive circle of countries . the timing seems right : un secretary general plans to finally go ahead with the organization 's long-awaited reform .
he 's put in place a committee of experts that will come up with proposals by the beginning of december . a permanent security council seat for germany could be on the agenda , the german government hopes .
but unfortunately none of the committee 's members come from germany . us likely against proposal the german government should n't lose sight of reality despite its hopes .
it would almost be a miracle if germany could get enough votes to make its wish come true . in order to succeed , two thirds of the 191 un member states have to approve the change , along with all five current permanent security council members : britain , china , france , russia and the united states . the germans might argue that they have shown great commitment but they are unlikely to achieve more than friendly praise from most other countries : after all , a permanent security council seat does n't get awarded like an honorary service medal . enough back and forth already it has more to do with power , and veto power at that : un resolutions regarding numerous crises have always lacked poignancy because one of the permanent members felt otherwise . there 's more than enough examples to prove this .
israel , chechnya and iraq are just some of the most striking ones .
should another veto power be added - even one like germany , which tries to resolve crises in a peaceful , diplomatic way - the dragging back and forth would only increase . on top of that , the us is unlikely to be interested in making a war opponent a veto power after a failed attempt to get un approval for the invasion of iraq . limited seats all other un members , who can only take turns at the table for two-year periods , have little interest in supporting the german plan as it would give them access to the security council even less frequently unless the number of seats -lrb- currently 15 -rrb- is increased . berlin has already given up on an alternative idea : a permanent seat for the european union .
that proposal failed because neither britain nor france want to give up their privileged status . but calling for a permanent seat for germany doesn â t have a bigger chance of success as no one - except germany - would benefit from it . klaus dahmann -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de fischer finds few backers for un seat german foreign minister joschka fischer wrapped up his 10-day trip to asia on friday .

the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .
but the german market remains troubled . the shock waves unleashed from the announcement that spain 's santander central hispana would buy britain 's abbey national were n't restricted to the towering , glass and steel punctuated urban landscape of the city of london .
the ripples could also be felt in offices that make up frankfurt 's skyline , where many observers see this sparking a wave of consolidation in the european banking sector .
britain 's abbey national said monday it would approve a proposed takeover offer from spain 's biggest bank , santander central hispana .
the deal would create the world 's 10th largest bank , and experts believe it could be first bang of a long-awaited consolidation trend in the european banking sector .
santander 's board of directors approved the purchase on sunday evening , seeking to pay â¬ 13.6 billion to buy abbey , britain 's sixth-largest bank .
if the deal goes through , it will mark the first time a british bank has been taken over by a european competitor .
is germany next ?
bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's skyscraper 's are the headquarters to germany 's biggest banks the move has led to new speculation of high-level mergers in germany , where the fractured banking landscape has languished in recent years .
" following today 's offer from santander for abbey , the banks will all become clearly become takeover candidates again , " a stock trader in frankfurt told the reuters news agency .
another broker told the agency : " this is going to spark speculation about german banks as the subjects of takeovers and mergers again . "
on monday , the stock prices of hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , which has been shopping for a buyer , commerzbank and deutsche bank all rose by about 1 percent on the news .
bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank headquarters in frankfurt deutsche bank -lrb- photo -rrb- held merger talks earlier this year with the us-based citigroup .
and munich-based hvb and frankfurt 's commerzbank are have often taken part in merger or takeover talks .
hvb has reportedly been searching for a partner in recent months with at least four different banks , including the abn amro , bnp paribas , credit suisse and santander .
though the talks ended without any action , a wave of consolidation could give new impetus to foreign investors seeking discounts in germany .
hurdles make buyouts less attractive however , recent gains in share prices at hvb and commerzbank could make them less attractive targets .
additionally , structural barriers also make the german banking market less attractive to foreign investors .
for one , the private banking market here is dominated by the state-protected sparkassen , or savings banks .
because of the deeply segmented market , most of the private banks in germany have profit margins that are too weak to interest many foreign banks .
another factor in germany is that workers ' councils are given powerful seats on the board of major german banks and have voting rights in major strategic decisions .
and germany 's biggest private player , deutsche bank , has indicated it wants to increase its own profits before entering into the european consolidation game .
upside potential yet despite the difficulty in making structural changes in the german banking system , foreign investors say the relative bargain prices or upside potential of banks here make them attractive takeover targets .
for example , hough it has a relatively low market capitalization of around â¬ 11 billion , hvb holds a potentially lucrative 78-percent ownership of bank austria , which is strong in eastern europe . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de postbank goes public after a bumpy start , germany 's largest retail bank , postbank , successfully launched its initial public offering , though share prices were well below initial forecasts .

the mini summit is aimed at getting the derailed doha round of trade talks back on track . as ministers and delegates of the 147 world trade organization member states converge on the shores of lake geneva on tuesday , the main issue on the agenda will be agricultural policies - an issue that pitted the developing world against rich industrial nations at last year 's failed summit in cancun .
this time around , the european union is offering to eliminate subsidies on its agricultural exports and brussels has called on the us to do the same .
" the council -lrb- of ministers -rrb- confirmed the union 's commitment for an agreement on a balanced framework on future dda -lrb- doha development agenda -rrb- negotiations , " read a statement issued by the eu 's top trade ministers on monday after a meeting held in advance of the summit .
at the same time , the eu trade ministers wrote , there was a need to " improve the balance " of the draft .
top eu trade official pascal lamy said he would not agree to concessions on farm subsidies that went beyond hard-won reforms to the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- agreed to last year .
additionally , lamy said the eu would seek more concessions from the united states , its most important trading partner , on farm reform .
so far , the us has not stated whether or not it would cut its own subsidy regime .

the mini summit is aimed at getting the derailed doha round of trade talks back on track . as ministers and delegates of the 147 world trade organization member states converge on the shores of lake geneva on tuesday , the main issue on the agenda will be agricultural policies - an issue that pitted the developing world against rich industrial nations at last year 's failed summit in cancun .

" the council -lrb- of ministers -rrb- confirmed the union 's commitment for an agreement on a balanced framework on future dda -lrb- doha development agenda -rrb- negotiations , " read a statement issued by the eu 's top trade ministers on monday after a meeting held in advance of the summit .

top eu trade official pascal lamy said he would not agree to concessions on farm subsidies that went beyond hard-won reforms to the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- agreed to last year .
additionally , lamy said the eu would seek more concessions from the united states , its most important trading partner , on farm reform .
so far , the us has not stated whether or not it would cut its own subsidy regime .

the mini summit is aimed at getting the derailed doha round of trade talks back on track . as ministers and delegates of the 147 world trade organization member states converge on the shores of lake geneva on tuesday , the main issue on the agenda will be agricultural policies - an issue that pitted the developing world against rich industrial nations at last year 's failed summit in cancun .
this time around , the european union is offering to eliminate subsidies on its agricultural exports and brussels has called on the us to do the same .
" the council -lrb- of ministers -rrb- confirmed the union 's commitment for an agreement on a balanced framework on future dda -lrb- doha development agenda -rrb- negotiations , " read a statement issued by the eu 's top trade ministers on monday after a meeting held in advance of the summit .
at the same time , the eu trade ministers wrote , there was a need to " improve the balance " of the draft .
top eu trade official pascal lamy said he would not agree to concessions on farm subsidies that went beyond hard-won reforms to the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- agreed to last year .
additionally , lamy said the eu would seek more concessions from the united states , its most important trading partner , on farm reform .
so far , the us has not stated whether or not it would cut its own subsidy regime .
trying to get back on track bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing nations accused first-world leaders of turning a deaf ear to poor countries in cancun .
the doha round first commenced three years ago in the qatar capital .
the aim was to reach an agreement that would eliminate the â¬ 300 billion -lrb- $ 364.25 billion -rrb- in agricultural subsidies used by the richest countries to shore up their farming industry in order to provide developing countries with access to global agricultural markets .
doha talks at a major wto summit in cancun , mexico , ended in september without any deal after poorer countries walked out on the negotiations , alleging industrial nations had no interest in helping their developing neighbors .
seeking to avoid a repeat of the diplomatic catastrophe in cancun , europe in recent months has shown more willingness to budge on the subsidies issue .
on july 16 , wto director-general supachai panitchpakdi and general council head shotaro oshima introduced a proposal for the future treaty that calls for all agricultural subsidies to be eliminated by a " date to be agreed . "
german economics minister wolfgang clement called the wto draft of the negotiating plan for the elimination of subsidies and trade barriers a " usable foundation " and for a deal on the negotiating schedule to be reached this week in switzerland . bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france gets more agricultural subsidies from brussels than any other eu country however , france reiterated its concerns that the draft " is deeply unbalanced to the disadvantage of the eu . "
with more than 2 million workers in the farming industry , france is the greatest beneficiary of the eu 's generous agricultural subsidies .
chirac has publicly expressed his concerns that the eu will concede too much ground in the wto talks .
bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister michel barnier but french foreign minister michel barnier -lrb- photo -rrb- seemed largely pleased with monday 's statement by lamy that he would not allow any changes beyond last year 's cap reforms .
" the draft on the table in geneva today does not conform to the aims or the interests of the eu , " he said .
" we need a rebalancing of this draft .
the commission agrees and will work for this . "
in june 2003 , the eu agreed to a sweeping reform of its â¬ 40 billion a year agricultural policy -lrb- see related story below -rrb- that de-linked subsidies from production .
at the request of france , the ministers will meet again friday for a briefing from trade commissioner lamy over the concrete negotiations .
lamy has said it is important that the eu , despite france 's objections , stand behind its offer of eliminating export subsidies for agricultural products , step-by-step , until they reach zero .

the former star striker becomes the ninth coach of the three-time world cup champions and the youngest to fill the spot , at 39 , in the country 's history . " the subject of the continuing talks is now strictly about the sports side , " said harald stenger , a spokesman for dfb .
klinsmann had not confirmed until the final moment which role he would play in the new coaching line-up after flying back to germany from his home in los angeles for final negotiations on saturday .
now it is clear that the former stuttgart , monaco and inter milan forward will take the lead in a new coaching team that hopes to turn around the slumping national side in time for the 2006 world cup , which germany will host .
klinsmann , who won the world cup and european championships along the way to collecting 108 cups for his country , has a valid coaching license , but has n't led a team since retiring from the pitch in 1998 .
experience coupled with innovative approach bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann worked under osieck in the world cup winning team .
his coaching team is expected to include former canadian national team coach holger osieck as assistant coach .
the 56-year-old veteran held that job on the 1990 team under franz beckenbauer , who also never guided a side before leading the german team to its third world cup crown .
fellow retired striking icon oliver bierhoff , who played alongside klinsmann when germany were crowned european champions in 1996 , is expected to take over the new post of team manager , a liaison job between the coach , media and dfb officials .
klinsmann has long been one of the most outspoken critics of the creaking dfb and his appointment is likely to be the start of a major overhaul in german soccer .
he is already asking the organization to augment his staff with experts in areas like psychology and speed training , copying the training techniques used in the american basketball leagues .
" the most important thing is the dfb needs to develop dynamism .
we have to look around the world , " klinsmann said recently .

his selection came as a huge surprise in germany , since the striker 's name had never been raised in connection with the job but those in the game have endorsed his appointment .
" this is an ingenious solution .
it 's a very good choice , " said hitzfeld , who turned down the job to take a year off coaching .
klinsmann said he also hopes to rely on the experience of the previous coach in his new role .

the former star striker becomes the ninth coach of the three-time world cup champions and the youngest to fill the spot , at 39 , in the country 's history . " the subject of the continuing talks is now strictly about the sports side , " said harald stenger , a spokesman for dfb .
klinsmann had not confirmed until the final moment which role he would play in the new coaching line-up after flying back to germany from his home in los angeles for final negotiations on saturday .
now it is clear that the former stuttgart , monaco and inter milan forward will take the lead in a new coaching team that hopes to turn around the slumping national side in time for the 2006 world cup , which germany will host .
klinsmann , who won the world cup and european championships along the way to collecting 108 cups for his country , has a valid coaching license , but has n't led a team since retiring from the pitch in 1998 .

his coaching team is expected to include former canadian national team coach holger osieck as assistant coach .
the 56-year-old veteran held that job on the 1990 team under franz beckenbauer , who also never guided a side before leading the german team to its third world cup crown .
fellow retired striking icon oliver bierhoff , who played alongside klinsmann when germany were crowned european champions in 1996 , is expected to take over the new post of team manager , a liaison job between the coach , media and dfb officials .
klinsmann has long been one of the most outspoken critics of the creaking dfb and his appointment is likely to be the start of a major overhaul in german soccer .
he is already asking the organization to augment his staff with experts in areas like psychology and speed training , copying the training techniques used in the american basketball leagues .

wto general director panitchpakdi supachai confirmed last week that all parties have pledged to agree to a skeleton accord by the end of the week .
the foundation is a draft produced by supachai that would demand the elimination of contested export subsidies for farm products .
the paper also calls for widespread and worldwide liberalization of goods traffic and services .
the fight over agricultural subsidies in rich industrial countries , which total about $ 300 billion a year led to the collapse of talks in cancun , mexico , last september .
ever since , talks have been placed on the back burner .
few thrilled by compromise but on tuesday , a last attempt will be made by wto 's 147 member states to reach a deal , thus completing the work they were unable to finish in cancun 10 months ago .
if broad enough support can be found , the goal this week is to reach a deal that will lay out a timeframe and the foundations for negotiations of a new world trade accord .
whether sufficient support can be found is far from certain - the compromise proposal placed on the table last week by supachai was met with little enthusiasm .
for some , the proposal goes too far , and for others it does n't go far enough .
if an agreement ca n't be found in the coming days , the negotiations will likely cease , and no one knows if it will be possible to resuscitate them in the future .
opponents of globalization would most certainly celebrate another collapse of the trade round .
in their eyes , the wto is a rogue body in the global economy .
nevertheless , a breakdown of the talks would n't stop the process of globalization , it would just slow it down .
the consequences of a weakened wto the immediate consequence of a collapse would be a weakening of the wto .
the member states would stay on board and the treaties would remain in effect , but that 's not enough to ensure the wto 's long-term authority .
and such authority is necessary for the mediation of trade disputes .
without the wto , these problems would again fall into the hands of diplomats , and that would put smaller countries at an even greater disadvantage .
nor would the superpowers of the world economy benefit .
without the mediation of the geneva-based wto , trade disputes between the european union , the united states , japan and , eventually , china , would escalate more frequently and could spin out of control far more easily .
a breakdown could also have immediate consequences for growth and the global economy .
but there 's a huge disparity of opinions when it comes to measuring the impact a general liberalization would have .
the world bank has estimated it would generate $ 350 billion in new wealth , with more than half of that going to the developing nations since they would have the most to gain from an opening of their markets .
however , the wto is no development agency .
it 's an event that takes place within the confines of political reality . for the negotiators in geneva , the challenge is to find a multilateral way out of the current labyrinth of conflicting political interests by the end of the week . tom weingÃ¤rtner -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de eu prepares for wto agriculture talks the eu is going to the wto talks in geneva on tuesday with a common position , despite resistance from france .

the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .
but the german market remains troubled . the shock waves unleashed from the announcement that spain 's santander central hispana would buy britain 's abbey national were n't restricted to the towering , glass and steel punctuated urban landscape of the city of london .
the ripples could also be felt in offices that make up frankfurt 's skyline , where many observers see this sparking a wave of consolidation in the european banking sector .
britain 's abbey national said monday it would approve a proposed takeover offer from spain 's biggest bank , santander central hispana .
the deal would create the world 's 10th largest bank , and experts believe it could be first bang of a long-awaited consolidation trend in the european banking sector .
santander 's board of directors approved the purchase on sunday evening , seeking to pay â¬ 13.6 billion to buy abbey , britain 's sixth-largest bank .
if the deal goes through , it will mark the first time a british bank has been taken over by a european competitor .
is germany next ?
bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's skyscraper 's are the headquarters to germany 's biggest banks the move has led to new speculation of high-level mergers in germany , where the fractured banking landscape has languished in recent years .
" following today 's offer from santander for abbey , the banks will all become clearly become takeover candidates again , " a stock trader in frankfurt told the reuters news agency .
another broker told the agency : " this is going to spark speculation about german banks as the subjects of takeovers and mergers again . "
on monday , the stock prices of hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , which has been shopping for a buyer , commerzbank and deutsche bank all rose by about 1 percent on the news .
bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank headquarters in frankfurt deutsche bank -lrb- photo -rrb- held merger talks earlier this year with the us-based citigroup .
and munich-based hvb and frankfurt 's commerzbank are have often taken part in merger or takeover talks .
hvb has reportedly been searching for a partner in recent months with at least four different banks , including the abn amro , bnp paribas , credit suisse and santander .
though the talks ended without any action , a wave of consolidation could give new impetus to foreign investors seeking discounts in germany .
hurdles make buyouts less attractive however , recent gains in share prices at hvb and commerzbank could make them less attractive targets .
additionally , structural barriers also make the german banking market less attractive to foreign investors .
for one , the private banking market here is dominated by the state-protected sparkassen , or savings banks .
because of the deeply segmented market , most of the private banks in germany have profit margins that are too weak to interest many foreign banks .
another factor in germany is that workers ' councils are given powerful seats on the board of major german banks and have voting rights in major strategic decisions .
and germany 's biggest private player , deutsche bank , has indicated it wants to increase its own profits before entering into the european consolidation game .
upside potential yet despite the difficulty in making structural changes in the german banking system , foreign investors say the relative bargain prices or upside potential of banks here make them attractive takeover targets .
for example , hough it has a relatively low market capitalization of around â¬ 11 billion , hvb holds a potentially lucrative 78-percent ownership of bank austria , which is strong in eastern europe . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de postbank goes public after a bumpy start , germany 's largest retail bank , postbank , successfully launched its initial public offering , though share prices were well below initial forecasts .

the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .

the ripples could also be felt in offices that make up frankfurt 's skyline , where many observers see this sparking a wave of consolidation in the european banking sector .
britain 's abbey national said monday it would approve a proposed takeover offer from spain 's biggest bank , santander central hispana .
the deal would create the world 's 10th largest bank , and experts believe it could be first bang of a long-awaited consolidation trend in the european banking sector .

but chances for success are limited as only berlin would benefit from the change . a newfound self-confidence has been spurring on german politicians since the end of the cold war and the country 's reunification that followed .
" we 're somebody again " is a rallying cry that 's become popular again . during the 1960s , germany 's economic boom justified such a sentiment .
today , german leaders argue that the country 's growing role in supporting peace-keeping missions should be recognized by including germany in the exclusive circle of countries . the timing seems right : un secretary general plans to finally go ahead with the organization 's long-awaited reform .
he 's put in place a committee of experts that will come up with proposals by the beginning of december . a permanent security council seat for germany could be on the agenda , the german government hopes .
but unfortunately none of the committee 's members come from germany . us likely against proposal the german government should n't lose sight of reality despite its hopes .
it would almost be a miracle if germany could get enough votes to make its wish come true . in order to succeed , two thirds of the 191 un member states have to approve the change , along with all five current permanent security council members : britain , china , france , russia and the united states . the germans might argue that they have shown great commitment but they are unlikely to achieve more than friendly praise from most other countries : after all , a permanent security council seat does n't get awarded like an honorary service medal . enough back and forth already it has more to do with power , and veto power at that : un resolutions regarding numerous crises have always lacked poignancy because one of the permanent members felt otherwise . there 's more than enough examples to prove this .
israel , chechnya and iraq are just some of the most striking ones .
should another veto power be added - even one like germany , which tries to resolve crises in a peaceful , diplomatic way - the dragging back and forth would only increase . on top of that , the us is unlikely to be interested in making a war opponent a veto power after a failed attempt to get un approval for the invasion of iraq . limited seats all other un members , who can only take turns at the table for two-year periods , have little interest in supporting the german plan as it would give them access to the security council even less frequently unless the number of seats -lrb- currently 15 -rrb- is increased . berlin has already given up on an alternative idea : a permanent seat for the european union .
that proposal failed because neither britain nor france want to give up their privileged status . but calling for a permanent seat for germany doesn â t have a bigger chance of success as no one - except germany - would benefit from it . klaus dahmann -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de fischer finds few backers for un seat german foreign minister joschka fischer wrapped up his 10-day trip to asia on friday .

" the foreign ministers said they expect the government in khartoum to ensure that violations cease " with immediate effect " or the eu would take " appropriate steps . " though the word " sanctions " was n't specifically mentioned in the draft statement , the eu said it had started drawing up a list of janjaweed arab militia leaders " responsible for breaches and violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , and those guiding and supporting them . " the eu said the sudanese government " will be pressed to arrest those persons or suspend them from office and to bring them to justice . " " the sudanese government has to deliver " bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foriegn minister joschka fischer , left , meets his sudanese counterpart mostafa osman ismail in khartoum .
" they need to be disarmed and the responsible need to go to trial , " german foreign minister joschka fischer , back from a recent trip to sudan , said .
" unity in the international community is very , very important , " fischer added .
" the sudanese government has to deliver . " speaking on german television earlier on sunday , fischer said his return from khartoum he â d been following very closely the sudanese government â s efforts to end the crisis in darfur .
he said that despite the promises made by the sudanese president and the foreign minister , a solution to the conflict was not yet in sight . â violence continues in the region , " he said .
" i â ve heard terrible reports about looting and burning in villages , about rape on a massive scale , " fischer said .
" we â ll no doubt keep up the pressure on the government together with our european partners and the united states , â he added . more than 1 million people displaced bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sudanese refugee child prepares in the desert outside tine on the chad side of the sudan border .
the conflict in sudan 's western darfur region began in february 2003 with a rebel uprising against khartoum , protesting that the largely black african region had been ignored by the arab government . up to 30,000 people , most of them black africans , have been killed in darfur , and an estimated 2.2 million in urgent need of food and medical attention . eu foreign ministers on monday also urged sudan to admit more aid workers to provide emergency food and shelter for more than 1 million people displaced in darfur .
" the -lrb- humanitarian -rrb- situation is slightly better , but that does n't mean the problem is solved , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" the risk is very high for a potential catastrophe . " the eu , the united states and humanitarian groups have accused the sudanese government of backing the militias - a claim denied by khartoum . khartoum rejects " genocide " charge ahead of the eu foreign ministers â meeting in brussels , the sudanese foreign minister mustafa osman ismail met with solana , claiming that his government was doing what was expected of it by the international community . ismail said sanctions against his country would therefore send out the wrong signal .
he added that increased dialogue would be the better option to get on top of the crisis . the us congress passed a resolution last week describing as " genocide " the atrocities committed in darfur . but ismail rejected the charge . " what is happening in darfur is not genocide .
it is a humanitarian crisis provoked by fighting which is not our fault ... the sudanese government did not start the fighting , " he told belgian daily de staandard . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de sudan at center of eu meeting eu foreign ministers will meet in brussels on monday to deal with the situation in sudan .

eu foreign ministers will meet in brussels on monday to deal with the situation in sudan .
they plan to harmonize their policy towards the sudanese government that 's accused of doing too little to end the darfur crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer on sunday strongly advocated political sanctions against khartoum , should the government there not step up efforts to disarm the janjaweed militia and bring them before the courts . in an interview with german public television , fischer said on sunday that since his return from khartoum he â d been following very closely the sudanese government â s efforts to end the crisis in darfur .
he said that despite the promises made by the sudanese president and the foreign minister , a solution to the conflict was not yet in sight . â violence continues in the region , " he said .
" i â ve heard terrible reports about looting and burning in villages , about rape on a massive scale .
on the other hand , it â s easier now for humanitarian aid organizations to do their job on the ground , but that â s certainly not enough . " fischer added that countries were cooperating on a un resolution on sudan , calling on the sudanese government to disarm the militia , bring their leaders to justice and stop the killing . " we â ll no doubt keep up the pressure on the government together with our european partners and the united states , â he said . fischer and powell coordinate in a telephone conversation on sunday with his us counterpart colin powell , fischer agreed that khartoum should face international sanctions , if it didn â t live up to its commitments . bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese refugee children walk past a dead donkey powell and fischer said no more time must be wasted to end the conflict which has left some 30,000 people dead , one million people displaced and another 2.2 million living in desperate need of food and medicine . â the sudanese government knows full well that the international community is no longer willing to just look on , " fischer said . " the un resolution is in the making , and sudan is facing political sanctions .
having said that , i want to emphasize that we â ll of course step up our efforts in the humanitarian field . â ahead of the eu foreign ministers â meeting in brussels , the sudanese foreign minister mustafa osman ismail met with eu foreign policy chief javier solana , claiming that his government was doing what was expected of it by the international community . ismail said sanctions against his country would therefore send out the wrong signal .

the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .
but the german market remains troubled . the shock waves unleashed from the announcement that spain 's santander central hispana would buy britain 's abbey national were n't restricted to the towering , glass and steel punctuated urban landscape of the city of london .
the ripples could also be felt in offices that make up frankfurt 's skyline , where many observers see this sparking a wave of consolidation in the european banking sector .
britain 's abbey national said monday it would approve a proposed takeover offer from spain 's biggest bank , santander central hispana .
the deal would create the world 's 10th largest bank , and experts believe it could be first bang of a long-awaited consolidation trend in the european banking sector .
santander 's board of directors approved the purchase on sunday evening , seeking to pay â¬ 13.6 billion to buy abbey , britain 's sixth-largest bank .
if the deal goes through , it will mark the first time a british bank has been taken over by a european competitor .
is germany next ?
bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's skyscraper 's are the headquarters to germany 's biggest banks the move has led to new speculation of high-level mergers in germany , where the fractured banking landscape has languished in recent years .
" following today 's offer from santander for abbey , the banks will all become clearly become takeover candidates again , " a stock trader in frankfurt told the reuters news agency .
another broker told the agency : " this is going to spark speculation about german banks as the subjects of takeovers and mergers again . "
on monday , the stock prices of hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , which has been shopping for a buyer , commerzbank and deutsche bank all rose by about 1 percent on the news .
bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank headquarters in frankfurt deutsche bank -lrb- photo -rrb- held merger talks earlier this year with the us-based citigroup .
and munich-based hvb and frankfurt 's commerzbank are have often taken part in merger or takeover talks .
hvb has reportedly been searching for a partner in recent months with at least four different banks , including the abn amro , bnp paribas , credit suisse and santander .
though the talks ended without any action , a wave of consolidation could give new impetus to foreign investors seeking discounts in germany .
hurdles make buyouts less attractive however , recent gains in share prices at hvb and commerzbank could make them less attractive targets .
additionally , structural barriers also make the german banking market less attractive to foreign investors .
for one , the private banking market here is dominated by the state-protected sparkassen , or savings banks .
because of the deeply segmented market , most of the private banks in germany have profit margins that are too weak to interest many foreign banks .
another factor in germany is that workers ' councils are given powerful seats on the board of major german banks and have voting rights in major strategic decisions .
and germany 's biggest private player , deutsche bank , has indicated it wants to increase its own profits before entering into the european consolidation game .
upside potential yet despite the difficulty in making structural changes in the german banking system , foreign investors say the relative bargain prices or upside potential of banks here make them attractive takeover targets .
for example , hough it has a relatively low market capitalization of around â¬ 11 billion , hvb holds a potentially lucrative 78-percent ownership of bank austria , which is strong in eastern europe . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de postbank goes public after a bumpy start , germany 's largest retail bank , postbank , successfully launched its initial public offering , though share prices were well below initial forecasts .

the reform will completely change the way the eu supports its farm sector .
the new cap will be geared towards consumers and taxpayers , while giving eu farmers the freedom to produce what the market wants .
in future , the vast majority of subsidies will be paid independently from the volume of production .
to avoid abandonment of production , member states may choose to maintain a limited link between subsidy and production under well defined conditions and within clear limits .
these new " single farm payments " will be linked to the respect of environmental , food safety and animal welfare standards .
severing the link between subsidies and production will make eu farmers more competitive and market orientated , while providing the necessary income stability .
more money will be available to farmers for environmental , quality or animal welfare programs by reducing direct payments for bigger farms .
the council further decided to revise the milk , rice , cereals , durum wheat , dried fodder and nut sectors .
in order to respect the tight budgetary ceiling for the eu-25 until 2013 , ministers agreed to introduce a financial discipline mechanism .
this reform will also strengthen the eu 's negotiating hand in the ongoing wto trade talks .

" the foreign ministers said they expect the government in khartoum to ensure that violations cease " with immediate effect " or the eu would take " appropriate steps . " though the word " sanctions " was n't specifically mentioned in the draft statement , the eu said it had started drawing up a list of janjaweed arab militia leaders " responsible for breaches and violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , and those guiding and supporting them . " the eu said the sudanese government " will be pressed to arrest those persons or suspend them from office and to bring them to justice . " " the sudanese government has to deliver " bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foriegn minister joschka fischer , left , meets his sudanese counterpart mostafa osman ismail in khartoum .
" they need to be disarmed and the responsible need to go to trial , " german foreign minister joschka fischer , back from a recent trip to sudan , said .
" unity in the international community is very , very important , " fischer added .
" the sudanese government has to deliver . " speaking on german television earlier on sunday , fischer said his return from khartoum he â d been following very closely the sudanese government â s efforts to end the crisis in darfur .
he said that despite the promises made by the sudanese president and the foreign minister , a solution to the conflict was not yet in sight . â violence continues in the region , " he said .
" i â ve heard terrible reports about looting and burning in villages , about rape on a massive scale , " fischer said .
" we â ll no doubt keep up the pressure on the government together with our european partners and the united states , â he added . more than 1 million people displaced bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sudanese refugee child prepares in the desert outside tine on the chad side of the sudan border .
the conflict in sudan 's western darfur region began in february 2003 with a rebel uprising against khartoum , protesting that the largely black african region had been ignored by the arab government . up to 30,000 people , most of them black africans , have been killed in darfur , and an estimated 2.2 million in urgent need of food and medical attention . eu foreign ministers on monday also urged sudan to admit more aid workers to provide emergency food and shelter for more than 1 million people displaced in darfur .
" the -lrb- humanitarian -rrb- situation is slightly better , but that does n't mean the problem is solved , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" the risk is very high for a potential catastrophe . " the eu , the united states and humanitarian groups have accused the sudanese government of backing the militias - a claim denied by khartoum . khartoum rejects " genocide " charge ahead of the eu foreign ministers â meeting in brussels , the sudanese foreign minister mustafa osman ismail met with solana , claiming that his government was doing what was expected of it by the international community . ismail said sanctions against his country would therefore send out the wrong signal .
he added that increased dialogue would be the better option to get on top of the crisis . the us congress passed a resolution last week describing as " genocide " the atrocities committed in darfur . but ismail rejected the charge . " what is happening in darfur is not genocide .

the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .
but the german market remains troubled . the shock waves unleashed from the announcement that spain 's santander central hispana would buy britain 's abbey national were n't restricted to the towering , glass and steel punctuated urban landscape of the city of london .
the ripples could also be felt in offices that make up frankfurt 's skyline , where many observers see this sparking a wave of consolidation in the european banking sector .
britain 's abbey national said monday it would approve a proposed takeover offer from spain 's biggest bank , santander central hispana .
the deal would create the world 's 10th largest bank , and experts believe it could be first bang of a long-awaited consolidation trend in the european banking sector .
santander 's board of directors approved the purchase on sunday evening , seeking to pay â¬ 13.6 billion to buy abbey , britain 's sixth-largest bank .
if the deal goes through , it will mark the first time a british bank has been taken over by a european competitor .
is germany next ?
bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's skyscraper 's are the headquarters to germany 's biggest banks the move has led to new speculation of high-level mergers in germany , where the fractured banking landscape has languished in recent years .
" following today 's offer from santander for abbey , the banks will all become clearly become takeover candidates again , " a stock trader in frankfurt told the reuters news agency .
another broker told the agency : " this is going to spark speculation about german banks as the subjects of takeovers and mergers again . "
on monday , the stock prices of hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , which has been shopping for a buyer , commerzbank and deutsche bank all rose by about 1 percent on the news .
bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank headquarters in frankfurt deutsche bank -lrb- photo -rrb- held merger talks earlier this year with the us-based citigroup .
and munich-based hvb and frankfurt 's commerzbank are have often taken part in merger or takeover talks .
hvb has reportedly been searching for a partner in recent months with at least four different banks , including the abn amro , bnp paribas , credit suisse and santander .
though the talks ended without any action , a wave of consolidation could give new impetus to foreign investors seeking discounts in germany .
hurdles make buyouts less attractive however , recent gains in share prices at hvb and commerzbank could make them less attractive targets .
additionally , structural barriers also make the german banking market less attractive to foreign investors .
for one , the private banking market here is dominated by the state-protected sparkassen , or savings banks .
because of the deeply segmented market , most of the private banks in germany have profit margins that are too weak to interest many foreign banks .
another factor in germany is that workers ' councils are given powerful seats on the board of major german banks and have voting rights in major strategic decisions .
and germany 's biggest private player , deutsche bank , has indicated it wants to increase its own profits before entering into the european consolidation game .
upside potential yet despite the difficulty in making structural changes in the german banking system , foreign investors say the relative bargain prices or upside potential of banks here make them attractive takeover targets .
for example , hough it has a relatively low market capitalization of around â¬ 11 billion , hvb holds a potentially lucrative 78-percent ownership of bank austria , which is strong in eastern europe . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de postbank goes public after a bumpy start , germany 's largest retail bank , postbank , successfully launched its initial public offering , though share prices were well below initial forecasts .

wto general director panitchpakdi supachai confirmed last week that all parties have pledged to agree to a skeleton accord by the end of the week .
the foundation is a draft produced by supachai that would demand the elimination of contested export subsidies for farm products .
the paper also calls for widespread and worldwide liberalization of goods traffic and services .
the fight over agricultural subsidies in rich industrial countries , which total about $ 300 billion a year led to the collapse of talks in cancun , mexico , last september .
ever since , talks have been placed on the back burner .
few thrilled by compromise but on tuesday , a last attempt will be made by wto 's 147 member states to reach a deal , thus completing the work they were unable to finish in cancun 10 months ago .
if broad enough support can be found , the goal this week is to reach a deal that will lay out a timeframe and the foundations for negotiations of a new world trade accord .
whether sufficient support can be found is far from certain - the compromise proposal placed on the table last week by supachai was met with little enthusiasm .
for some , the proposal goes too far , and for others it does n't go far enough .
if an agreement ca n't be found in the coming days , the negotiations will likely cease , and no one knows if it will be possible to resuscitate them in the future .
opponents of globalization would most certainly celebrate another collapse of the trade round .
in their eyes , the wto is a rogue body in the global economy .
nevertheless , a breakdown of the talks would n't stop the process of globalization , it would just slow it down .
the consequences of a weakened wto the immediate consequence of a collapse would be a weakening of the wto .
the member states would stay on board and the treaties would remain in effect , but that 's not enough to ensure the wto 's long-term authority .
and such authority is necessary for the mediation of trade disputes .
without the wto , these problems would again fall into the hands of diplomats , and that would put smaller countries at an even greater disadvantage .
nor would the superpowers of the world economy benefit .
without the mediation of the geneva-based wto , trade disputes between the european union , the united states , japan and , eventually , china , would escalate more frequently and could spin out of control far more easily .
a breakdown could also have immediate consequences for growth and the global economy .
but there 's a huge disparity of opinions when it comes to measuring the impact a general liberalization would have .
the world bank has estimated it would generate $ 350 billion in new wealth , with more than half of that going to the developing nations since they would have the most to gain from an opening of their markets .
however , the wto is no development agency .
it 's an event that takes place within the confines of political reality . for the negotiators in geneva , the challenge is to find a multilateral way out of the current labyrinth of conflicting political interests by the end of the week . tom weingÃ¤rtner -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de eu prepares for wto agriculture talks the eu is going to the wto talks in geneva on tuesday with a common position , despite resistance from france .

the mini summit is aimed at getting the derailed doha round of trade talks back on track . as ministers and delegates of the 147 world trade organization member states converge on the shores of lake geneva on tuesday , the main issue on the agenda will be agricultural policies - an issue that pitted the developing world against rich industrial nations at last year 's failed summit in cancun .
this time around , the european union is offering to eliminate subsidies on its agricultural exports and brussels has called on the us to do the same .
" the council -lrb- of ministers -rrb- confirmed the union 's commitment for an agreement on a balanced framework on future dda -lrb- doha development agenda -rrb- negotiations , " read a statement issued by the eu 's top trade ministers on monday after a meeting held in advance of the summit .
at the same time , the eu trade ministers wrote , there was a need to " improve the balance " of the draft .
top eu trade official pascal lamy said he would not agree to concessions on farm subsidies that went beyond hard-won reforms to the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- agreed to last year .
additionally , lamy said the eu would seek more concessions from the united states , its most important trading partner , on farm reform .
so far , the us has not stated whether or not it would cut its own subsidy regime .
trying to get back on track bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing nations accused first-world leaders of turning a deaf ear to poor countries in cancun .
the doha round first commenced three years ago in the qatar capital .
the aim was to reach an agreement that would eliminate the â¬ 300 billion -lrb- $ 364.25 billion -rrb- in agricultural subsidies used by the richest countries to shore up their farming industry in order to provide developing countries with access to global agricultural markets .
doha talks at a major wto summit in cancun , mexico , ended in september without any deal after poorer countries walked out on the negotiations , alleging industrial nations had no interest in helping their developing neighbors .
seeking to avoid a repeat of the diplomatic catastrophe in cancun , europe in recent months has shown more willingness to budge on the subsidies issue .
on july 16 , wto director-general supachai panitchpakdi and general council head shotaro oshima introduced a proposal for the future treaty that calls for all agricultural subsidies to be eliminated by a " date to be agreed . "
german economics minister wolfgang clement called the wto draft of the negotiating plan for the elimination of subsidies and trade barriers a " usable foundation " and for a deal on the negotiating schedule to be reached this week in switzerland . bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france gets more agricultural subsidies from brussels than any other eu country however , france reiterated its concerns that the draft " is deeply unbalanced to the disadvantage of the eu . "
with more than 2 million workers in the farming industry , france is the greatest beneficiary of the eu 's generous agricultural subsidies .
chirac has publicly expressed his concerns that the eu will concede too much ground in the wto talks .
bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister michel barnier but french foreign minister michel barnier -lrb- photo -rrb- seemed largely pleased with monday 's statement by lamy that he would not allow any changes beyond last year 's cap reforms .
" the draft on the table in geneva today does not conform to the aims or the interests of the eu , " he said .
" we need a rebalancing of this draft .
the commission agrees and will work for this . "
in june 2003 , the eu agreed to a sweeping reform of its â¬ 40 billion a year agricultural policy -lrb- see related story below -rrb- that de-linked subsidies from production .
at the request of france , the ministers will meet again friday for a briefing from trade commissioner lamy over the concrete negotiations .
lamy has said it is important that the eu , despite france 's objections , stand behind its offer of eliminating export subsidies for agricultural products , step-by-step , until they reach zero .
because trade policy is a central eu competency , unanimous votes are not required in the council of ministers , and france can not exercise the veto power it enjoys in other policy areas . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de commentary : doha 's last stand this week 's talks in geneva will be the last opportunity the world trade organization has to salvage the doha round of trade after their spectacular collapse in mexico last year .

but chances for success are limited as only berlin would benefit from the change . a newfound self-confidence has been spurring on german politicians since the end of the cold war and the country 's reunification that followed .
" we 're somebody again " is a rallying cry that 's become popular again . during the 1960s , germany 's economic boom justified such a sentiment .
today , german leaders argue that the country 's growing role in supporting peace-keeping missions should be recognized by including germany in the exclusive circle of countries . the timing seems right : un secretary general plans to finally go ahead with the organization 's long-awaited reform .
he 's put in place a committee of experts that will come up with proposals by the beginning of december . a permanent security council seat for germany could be on the agenda , the german government hopes .
but unfortunately none of the committee 's members come from germany . us likely against proposal the german government should n't lose sight of reality despite its hopes .

but despite some booing , many in the audience agreed that the director 's work was an interesting and courageous interpretation . christoph schlingensief had prepared for the worst . prior to sunday 's performance , the enfant terrible among germany 's theater directors had talked about plans to hide after sunday to escape the wrath of his critics . bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph schlingensief schlingensief -lrb- photo -rrb- had expected the opening night to end in scandal after the lead tenor had called the production an abomination in a radio interview and festival director wolfgang wagner had asked that the use of a video depicting a decaying rabbit be toned down . but the closest schlingensief got to a scandal was a round of heavy booing as the director appeared on stage for a curtain call .
at the official reception that followed the festival 's opening in the northern bavarian town of bayreuth , the director and his team were cheered and welcomed with fanfares . wolfgang wagner , the grandson of richard wagner , talked about a " successful performance .

" this is not a scandal , but a very , very courageous staging , " who had brought along jose barroso -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former portuguese premier who will take over as european commission president in november . schlingensief himself told reporters that he had not hoped for a scandal . " we 're relieved and very proud , " he said .
" we fought a lot and it 's been worth it .
we wanted to show bayreuth unusual images and we 've accomplished that . " bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rehearsal for parsifal french composer and conductor pierre boulez conducted the festival 's opening night .

eu foreign ministers will meet in brussels on monday to deal with the situation in sudan .
they plan to harmonize their policy towards the sudanese government that 's accused of doing too little to end the darfur crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer on sunday strongly advocated political sanctions against khartoum , should the government there not step up efforts to disarm the janjaweed militia and bring them before the courts . in an interview with german public television , fischer said on sunday that since his return from khartoum he â d been following very closely the sudanese government â s efforts to end the crisis in darfur .

eu foreign ministers will meet in brussels on monday to deal with the situation in sudan .
they plan to harmonize their policy towards the sudanese government that 's accused of doing too little to end the darfur crisis . german foreign minister joschka fischer on sunday strongly advocated political sanctions against khartoum , should the government there not step up efforts to disarm the janjaweed militia and bring them before the courts . in an interview with german public television , fischer said on sunday that since his return from khartoum he â d been following very closely the sudanese government â s efforts to end the crisis in darfur .

the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .
but the german market remains troubled . the shock waves unleashed from the announcement that spain 's santander central hispana would buy britain 's abbey national were n't restricted to the towering , glass and steel punctuated urban landscape of the city of london .
the ripples could also be felt in offices that make up frankfurt 's skyline , where many observers see this sparking a wave of consolidation in the european banking sector .
britain 's abbey national said monday it would approve a proposed takeover offer from spain 's biggest bank , santander central hispana .
the deal would create the world 's 10th largest bank , and experts believe it could be first bang of a long-awaited consolidation trend in the european banking sector .
santander 's board of directors approved the purchase on sunday evening , seeking to pay â¬ 13.6 billion to buy abbey , britain 's sixth-largest bank .
if the deal goes through , it will mark the first time a british bank has been taken over by a european competitor .
is germany next ?
bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's skyscraper 's are the headquarters to germany 's biggest banks the move has led to new speculation of high-level mergers in germany , where the fractured banking landscape has languished in recent years .
" following today 's offer from santander for abbey , the banks will all become clearly become takeover candidates again , " a stock trader in frankfurt told the reuters news agency .
another broker told the agency : " this is going to spark speculation about german banks as the subjects of takeovers and mergers again . "
on monday , the stock prices of hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , which has been shopping for a buyer , commerzbank and deutsche bank all rose by about 1 percent on the news .
bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank headquarters in frankfurt deutsche bank -lrb- photo -rrb- held merger talks earlier this year with the us-based citigroup .
and munich-based hvb and frankfurt 's commerzbank are have often taken part in merger or takeover talks .
hvb has reportedly been searching for a partner in recent months with at least four different banks , including the abn amro , bnp paribas , credit suisse and santander .
though the talks ended without any action , a wave of consolidation could give new impetus to foreign investors seeking discounts in germany .
hurdles make buyouts less attractive however , recent gains in share prices at hvb and commerzbank could make them less attractive targets .
additionally , structural barriers also make the german banking market less attractive to foreign investors .
for one , the private banking market here is dominated by the state-protected sparkassen , or savings banks .
because of the deeply segmented market , most of the private banks in germany have profit margins that are too weak to interest many foreign banks .
another factor in germany is that workers ' councils are given powerful seats on the board of major german banks and have voting rights in major strategic decisions .
and germany 's biggest private player , deutsche bank , has indicated it wants to increase its own profits before entering into the european consolidation game .
upside potential yet despite the difficulty in making structural changes in the german banking system , foreign investors say the relative bargain prices or upside potential of banks here make them attractive takeover targets .
for example , hough it has a relatively low market capitalization of around â¬ 11 billion , hvb holds a potentially lucrative 78-percent ownership of bank austria , which is strong in eastern europe . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de postbank goes public after a bumpy start , germany 's largest retail bank , postbank , successfully launched its initial public offering , though share prices were well below initial forecasts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.07.2004 eu prepares for wto agriculture talks groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the focus will be on farm trade policies the eu is going to the wto talks in geneva on tuesday with a common position , despite resistance from france .
the mini summit is aimed at getting the derailed doha round of trade talks back on track . as ministers and delegates of the 147 world trade organization member states converge on the shores of lake geneva on tuesday , the main issue on the agenda will be agricultural policies - an issue that pitted the developing world against rich industrial nations at last year 's failed summit in cancun .
this time around , the european union is offering to eliminate subsidies on its agricultural exports and brussels has called on the us to do the same .
" the council -lrb- of ministers -rrb- confirmed the union 's commitment for an agreement on a balanced framework on future dda -lrb- doha development agenda -rrb- negotiations , " read a statement issued by the eu 's top trade ministers on monday after a meeting held in advance of the summit .
at the same time , the eu trade ministers wrote , there was a need to " improve the balance " of the draft .
top eu trade official pascal lamy said he would not agree to concessions on farm subsidies that went beyond hard-won reforms to the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- agreed to last year .
additionally , lamy said the eu would seek more concessions from the united states , its most important trading partner , on farm reform .
so far , the us has not stated whether or not it would cut its own subsidy regime .
trying to get back on track bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing nations accused first-world leaders of turning a deaf ear to poor countries in cancun .
the doha round first commenced three years ago in the qatar capital .
the aim was to reach an agreement that would eliminate the â¬ 300 billion -lrb- $ 364.25 billion -rrb- in agricultural subsidies used by the richest countries to shore up their farming industry in order to provide developing countries with access to global agricultural markets .
doha talks at a major wto summit in cancun , mexico , ended in september without any deal after poorer countries walked out on the negotiations , alleging industrial nations had no interest in helping their developing neighbors .
seeking to avoid a repeat of the diplomatic catastrophe in cancun , europe in recent months has shown more willingness to budge on the subsidies issue .
on july 16 , wto director-general supachai panitchpakdi and general council head shotaro oshima introduced a proposal for the future treaty that calls for all agricultural subsidies to be eliminated by a " date to be agreed . "
german economics minister wolfgang clement called the wto draft of the negotiating plan for the elimination of subsidies and trade barriers a " usable foundation " and for a deal on the negotiating schedule to be reached this week in switzerland . bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france gets more agricultural subsidies from brussels than any other eu country however , france reiterated its concerns that the draft " is deeply unbalanced to the disadvantage of the eu . "
with more than 2 million workers in the farming industry , france is the greatest beneficiary of the eu 's generous agricultural subsidies .
chirac has publicly expressed his concerns that the eu will concede too much ground in the wto talks .
bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister michel barnier but french foreign minister michel barnier -lrb- photo -rrb- seemed largely pleased with monday 's statement by lamy that he would not allow any changes beyond last year 's cap reforms .
" the draft on the table in geneva today does not conform to the aims or the interests of the eu , " he said .
" we need a rebalancing of this draft .
the commission agrees and will work for this . "
in june 2003 , the eu agreed to a sweeping reform of its â¬ 40 billion a year agricultural policy -lrb- see related story below -rrb- that de-linked subsidies from production .

the mini summit is aimed at getting the derailed doha round of trade talks back on track . as ministers and delegates of the 147 world trade organization member states converge on the shores of lake geneva on tuesday , the main issue on the agenda will be agricultural policies - an issue that pitted the developing world against rich industrial nations at last year 's failed summit in cancun .
this time around , the european union is offering to eliminate subsidies on its agricultural exports and brussels has called on the us to do the same .
" the council -lrb- of ministers -rrb- confirmed the union 's commitment for an agreement on a balanced framework on future dda -lrb- doha development agenda -rrb- negotiations , " read a statement issued by the eu 's top trade ministers on monday after a meeting held in advance of the summit .
at the same time , the eu trade ministers wrote , there was a need to " improve the balance " of the draft .
top eu trade official pascal lamy said he would not agree to concessions on farm subsidies that went beyond hard-won reforms to the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- agreed to last year .
additionally , lamy said the eu would seek more concessions from the united states , its most important trading partner , on farm reform .
so far , the us has not stated whether or not it would cut its own subsidy regime .
trying to get back on track bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing nations accused first-world leaders of turning a deaf ear to poor countries in cancun .
the doha round first commenced three years ago in the qatar capital .
the aim was to reach an agreement that would eliminate the â¬ 300 billion -lrb- $ 364.25 billion -rrb- in agricultural subsidies used by the richest countries to shore up their farming industry in order to provide developing countries with access to global agricultural markets .
doha talks at a major wto summit in cancun , mexico , ended in september without any deal after poorer countries walked out on the negotiations , alleging industrial nations had no interest in helping their developing neighbors .
seeking to avoid a repeat of the diplomatic catastrophe in cancun , europe in recent months has shown more willingness to budge on the subsidies issue .
on july 16 , wto director-general supachai panitchpakdi and general council head shotaro oshima introduced a proposal for the future treaty that calls for all agricultural subsidies to be eliminated by a " date to be agreed . "
german economics minister wolfgang clement called the wto draft of the negotiating plan for the elimination of subsidies and trade barriers a " usable foundation " and for a deal on the negotiating schedule to be reached this week in switzerland . bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france gets more agricultural subsidies from brussels than any other eu country however , france reiterated its concerns that the draft " is deeply unbalanced to the disadvantage of the eu . "
with more than 2 million workers in the farming industry , france is the greatest beneficiary of the eu 's generous agricultural subsidies .
chirac has publicly expressed his concerns that the eu will concede too much ground in the wto talks .
bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister michel barnier but french foreign minister michel barnier -lrb- photo -rrb- seemed largely pleased with monday 's statement by lamy that he would not allow any changes beyond last year 's cap reforms .
" the draft on the table in geneva today does not conform to the aims or the interests of the eu , " he said .
" we need a rebalancing of this draft .
the commission agrees and will work for this . "
in june 2003 , the eu agreed to a sweeping reform of its â¬ 40 billion a year agricultural policy -lrb- see related story below -rrb- that de-linked subsidies from production .
at the request of france , the ministers will meet again friday for a briefing from trade commissioner lamy over the concrete negotiations .
lamy has said it is important that the eu , despite france 's objections , stand behind its offer of eliminating export subsidies for agricultural products , step-by-step , until they reach zero .

the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .
but the german market remains troubled . the shock waves unleashed from the announcement that spain 's santander central hispana would buy britain 's abbey national were n't restricted to the towering , glass and steel punctuated urban landscape of the city of london .
the ripples could also be felt in offices that make up frankfurt 's skyline , where many observers see this sparking a wave of consolidation in the european banking sector .
britain 's abbey national said monday it would approve a proposed takeover offer from spain 's biggest bank , santander central hispana .
the deal would create the world 's 10th largest bank , and experts believe it could be first bang of a long-awaited consolidation trend in the european banking sector .
santander 's board of directors approved the purchase on sunday evening , seeking to pay â¬ 13.6 billion to buy abbey , britain 's sixth-largest bank .
if the deal goes through , it will mark the first time a british bank has been taken over by a european competitor .

the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .
but the german market remains troubled . the shock waves unleashed from the announcement that spain 's santander central hispana would buy britain 's abbey national were n't restricted to the towering , glass and steel punctuated urban landscape of the city of london .
the ripples could also be felt in offices that make up frankfurt 's skyline , where many observers see this sparking a wave of consolidation in the european banking sector .
britain 's abbey national said monday it would approve a proposed takeover offer from spain 's biggest bank , santander central hispana .
the deal would create the world 's 10th largest bank , and experts believe it could be first bang of a long-awaited consolidation trend in the european banking sector .
santander 's board of directors approved the purchase on sunday evening , seeking to pay â¬ 13.6 billion to buy abbey , britain 's sixth-largest bank .
if the deal goes through , it will mark the first time a british bank has been taken over by a european competitor .
is germany next ?
bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's skyscraper 's are the headquarters to germany 's biggest banks the move has led to new speculation of high-level mergers in germany , where the fractured banking landscape has languished in recent years .
" following today 's offer from santander for abbey , the banks will all become clearly become takeover candidates again , " a stock trader in frankfurt told the reuters news agency .
another broker told the agency : " this is going to spark speculation about german banks as the subjects of takeovers and mergers again . "
on monday , the stock prices of hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , which has been shopping for a buyer , commerzbank and deutsche bank all rose by about 1 percent on the news .
bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank headquarters in frankfurt deutsche bank -lrb- photo -rrb- held merger talks earlier this year with the us-based citigroup .
and munich-based hvb and frankfurt 's commerzbank are have often taken part in merger or takeover talks .
hvb has reportedly been searching for a partner in recent months with at least four different banks , including the abn amro , bnp paribas , credit suisse and santander .
though the talks ended without any action , a wave of consolidation could give new impetus to foreign investors seeking discounts in germany .
hurdles make buyouts less attractive however , recent gains in share prices at hvb and commerzbank could make them less attractive targets .
additionally , structural barriers also make the german banking market less attractive to foreign investors .
for one , the private banking market here is dominated by the state-protected sparkassen , or savings banks .
because of the deeply segmented market , most of the private banks in germany have profit margins that are too weak to interest many foreign banks .
another factor in germany is that workers ' councils are given powerful seats on the board of major german banks and have voting rights in major strategic decisions .
and germany 's biggest private player , deutsche bank , has indicated it wants to increase its own profits before entering into the european consolidation game .
upside potential yet despite the difficulty in making structural changes in the german banking system , foreign investors say the relative bargain prices or upside potential of banks here make them attractive takeover targets .

wto general director panitchpakdi supachai confirmed last week that all parties have pledged to agree to a skeleton accord by the end of the week .
the foundation is a draft produced by supachai that would demand the elimination of contested export subsidies for farm products .
the paper also calls for widespread and worldwide liberalization of goods traffic and services .
the fight over agricultural subsidies in rich industrial countries , which total about $ 300 billion a year led to the collapse of talks in cancun , mexico , last september .
ever since , talks have been placed on the back burner .
few thrilled by compromise but on tuesday , a last attempt will be made by wto 's 147 member states to reach a deal , thus completing the work they were unable to finish in cancun 10 months ago .
if broad enough support can be found , the goal this week is to reach a deal that will lay out a timeframe and the foundations for negotiations of a new world trade accord .
whether sufficient support can be found is far from certain - the compromise proposal placed on the table last week by supachai was met with little enthusiasm .
for some , the proposal goes too far , and for others it does n't go far enough .
if an agreement ca n't be found in the coming days , the negotiations will likely cease , and no one knows if it will be possible to resuscitate them in the future .
opponents of globalization would most certainly celebrate another collapse of the trade round .
in their eyes , the wto is a rogue body in the global economy .
nevertheless , a breakdown of the talks would n't stop the process of globalization , it would just slow it down .
the consequences of a weakened wto the immediate consequence of a collapse would be a weakening of the wto .
the member states would stay on board and the treaties would remain in effect , but that 's not enough to ensure the wto 's long-term authority .
and such authority is necessary for the mediation of trade disputes .
without the wto , these problems would again fall into the hands of diplomats , and that would put smaller countries at an even greater disadvantage .
nor would the superpowers of the world economy benefit .
without the mediation of the geneva-based wto , trade disputes between the european union , the united states , japan and , eventually , china , would escalate more frequently and could spin out of control far more easily .
a breakdown could also have immediate consequences for growth and the global economy .
but there 's a huge disparity of opinions when it comes to measuring the impact a general liberalization would have .
the world bank has estimated it would generate $ 350 billion in new wealth , with more than half of that going to the developing nations since they would have the most to gain from an opening of their markets .
however , the wto is no development agency .
it 's an event that takes place within the confines of political reality . for the negotiators in geneva , the challenge is to find a multilateral way out of the current labyrinth of conflicting political interests by the end of the week . tom weingÃ¤rtner -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de eu prepares for wto agriculture talks the eu is going to the wto talks in geneva on tuesday with a common position , despite resistance from france .

the mini summit is aimed at getting the derailed doha round of trade talks back on track . as ministers and delegates of the 147 world trade organization member states converge on the shores of lake geneva on tuesday , the main issue on the agenda will be agricultural policies - an issue that pitted the developing world against rich industrial nations at last year 's failed summit in cancun .
this time around , the european union is offering to eliminate subsidies on its agricultural exports and brussels has called on the us to do the same .
" the council -lrb- of ministers -rrb- confirmed the union 's commitment for an agreement on a balanced framework on future dda -lrb- doha development agenda -rrb- negotiations , " read a statement issued by the eu 's top trade ministers on monday after a meeting held in advance of the summit .
at the same time , the eu trade ministers wrote , there was a need to " improve the balance " of the draft .
top eu trade official pascal lamy said he would not agree to concessions on farm subsidies that went beyond hard-won reforms to the eu 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- agreed to last year .
additionally , lamy said the eu would seek more concessions from the united states , its most important trading partner , on farm reform .
so far , the us has not stated whether or not it would cut its own subsidy regime .
trying to get back on track bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing nations accused first-world leaders of turning a deaf ear to poor countries in cancun .
the doha round first commenced three years ago in the qatar capital .
the aim was to reach an agreement that would eliminate the â¬ 300 billion -lrb- $ 364.25 billion -rrb- in agricultural subsidies used by the richest countries to shore up their farming industry in order to provide developing countries with access to global agricultural markets .
doha talks at a major wto summit in cancun , mexico , ended in september without any deal after poorer countries walked out on the negotiations , alleging industrial nations had no interest in helping their developing neighbors .
seeking to avoid a repeat of the diplomatic catastrophe in cancun , europe in recent months has shown more willingness to budge on the subsidies issue .
on july 16 , wto director-general supachai panitchpakdi and general council head shotaro oshima introduced a proposal for the future treaty that calls for all agricultural subsidies to be eliminated by a " date to be agreed . "
german economics minister wolfgang clement called the wto draft of the negotiating plan for the elimination of subsidies and trade barriers a " usable foundation " and for a deal on the negotiating schedule to be reached this week in switzerland . bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france gets more agricultural subsidies from brussels than any other eu country however , france reiterated its concerns that the draft " is deeply unbalanced to the disadvantage of the eu .

chirac has publicly expressed his concerns that the eu will concede too much ground in the wto talks .

" we need a rebalancing of this draft .
the commission agrees and will work for this . "
in june 2003 , the eu agreed to a sweeping reform of its â¬ 40 billion a year agricultural policy -lrb- see related story below -rrb- that de-linked subsidies from production .
at the request of france , the ministers will meet again friday for a briefing from trade commissioner lamy over the concrete negotiations .
lamy has said it is important that the eu , despite france 's objections , stand behind its offer of eliminating export subsidies for agricultural products , step-by-step , until they reach zero .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.07.2004 -pipe- 16:00 utc key elements of the reformed eu agricultural policy on june 26 , 2003 , eu farm ministers adopted a fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
the reform will completely change the way the eu supports its farm sector .
the new cap will be geared towards consumers and taxpayers , while giving eu farmers the freedom to produce what the market wants .
in future , the vast majority of subsidies will be paid independently from the volume of production .
to avoid abandonment of production , member states may choose to maintain a limited link between subsidy and production under well defined conditions and within clear limits .
these new " single farm payments " will be linked to the respect of environmental , food safety and animal welfare standards .
severing the link between subsidies and production will make eu farmers more competitive and market orientated , while providing the necessary income stability .
more money will be available to farmers for environmental , quality or animal welfare programs by reducing direct payments for bigger farms .
the council further decided to revise the milk , rice , cereals , durum wheat , dried fodder and nut sectors .
in order to respect the tight budgetary ceiling for the eu-25 until 2013 , ministers agreed to introduce a financial discipline mechanism .
this reform will also strengthen the eu 's negotiating hand in the ongoing wto trade talks .
the different elements of the reform will enter into force in 2004 and 2005 .

the former star striker becomes the ninth coach of the three-time world cup champions and the youngest to fill the spot , at 39 , in the country 's history . " the subject of the continuing talks is now strictly about the sports side , " said harald stenger , a spokesman for dfb .
klinsmann had not confirmed until the final moment which role he would play in the new coaching line-up after flying back to germany from his home in los angeles for final negotiations on saturday .
now it is clear that the former stuttgart , monaco and inter milan forward will take the lead in a new coaching team that hopes to turn around the slumping national side in time for the 2006 world cup , which germany will host .
klinsmann , who won the world cup and european championships along the way to collecting 108 cups for his country , has a valid coaching license , but has n't led a team since retiring from the pitch in 1998 .
experience coupled with innovative approach bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann worked under osieck in the world cup winning team .
his coaching team is expected to include former canadian national team coach holger osieck as assistant coach .
the 56-year-old veteran held that job on the 1990 team under franz beckenbauer , who also never guided a side before leading the german team to its third world cup crown .
fellow retired striking icon oliver bierhoff , who played alongside klinsmann when germany were crowned european champions in 1996 , is expected to take over the new post of team manager , a liaison job between the coach , media and dfb officials .
klinsmann has long been one of the most outspoken critics of the creaking dfb and his appointment is likely to be the start of a major overhaul in german soccer .
he is already asking the organization to augment his staff with experts in areas like psychology and speed training , copying the training techniques used in the american basketball leagues .
" the most important thing is the dfb needs to develop dynamism .
we have to look around the world , " klinsmann said recently .
german soccer ready to wake up to new dawn bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld preferred to take a break .
klinsmann 's new employers have long been accused of sleeping through soccer 's modern developments and have been publicly embarrassed by the saga surrounding rudi vÃ¶ller 's resignation after the disastrous euro 2004 campaign .
the red faces deepened when germany 's top two coaches , ottmar hitzfeld -lrb- photo -rrb- and otto rehhagel , turned down the job after a public courtship .
now it hopes that lining up klinsmann will undo some of the damage .
his selection came as a huge surprise in germany , since the striker 's name had never been raised in connection with the job but those in the game have endorsed his appointment .
" this is an ingenious solution .
it 's a very good choice , " said hitzfeld , who turned down the job to take a year off coaching .
klinsmann said he also hopes to rely on the experience of the previous coach in his new role .
former team mate vÃ¶ller , another member of the 1990 world champions , is a close friend and will be able to pass on valuable knowledge on the pitfalls klinsmann should avoid . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann ready to take charge of team germany german soccer should n't hail its new national coach yet .

the former star striker becomes the ninth coach of the three-time world cup champions and the youngest to fill the spot , at 39 , in the country 's history . " the subject of the continuing talks is now strictly about the sports side , " said harald stenger , a spokesman for dfb .
klinsmann had not confirmed until the final moment which role he would play in the new coaching line-up after flying back to germany from his home in los angeles for final negotiations on saturday .
now it is clear that the former stuttgart , monaco and inter milan forward will take the lead in a new coaching team that hopes to turn around the slumping national side in time for the 2006 world cup , which germany will host .
klinsmann , who won the world cup and european championships along the way to collecting 108 cups for his country , has a valid coaching license , but has n't led a team since retiring from the pitch in 1998 .
experience coupled with innovative approach bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann worked under osieck in the world cup winning team .
his coaching team is expected to include former canadian national team coach holger osieck as assistant coach .
the 56-year-old veteran held that job on the 1990 team under franz beckenbauer , who also never guided a side before leading the german team to its third world cup crown .
fellow retired striking icon oliver bierhoff , who played alongside klinsmann when germany were crowned european champions in 1996 , is expected to take over the new post of team manager , a liaison job between the coach , media and dfb officials .
klinsmann has long been one of the most outspoken critics of the creaking dfb and his appointment is likely to be the start of a major overhaul in german soccer .
he is already asking the organization to augment his staff with experts in areas like psychology and speed training , copying the training techniques used in the american basketball leagues .
" the most important thing is the dfb needs to develop dynamism .
we have to look around the world , " klinsmann said recently .
german soccer ready to wake up to new dawn bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld preferred to take a break .
klinsmann 's new employers have long been accused of sleeping through soccer 's modern developments and have been publicly embarrassed by the saga surrounding rudi vÃ¶ller 's resignation after the disastrous euro 2004 campaign .
the red faces deepened when germany 's top two coaches , ottmar hitzfeld -lrb- photo -rrb- and otto rehhagel , turned down the job after a public courtship .
now it hopes that lining up klinsmann will undo some of the damage .
his selection came as a huge surprise in germany , since the striker 's name had never been raised in connection with the job but those in the game have endorsed his appointment .
" this is an ingenious solution .
it 's a very good choice , " said hitzfeld , who turned down the job to take a year off coaching .
klinsmann said he also hopes to rely on the experience of the previous coach in his new role .
former team mate vÃ¶ller , another member of the 1990 world champions , is a close friend and will be able to pass on valuable knowledge on the pitfalls klinsmann should avoid . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann ready to take charge of team germany german soccer should n't hail its new national coach yet .

the reform will completely change the way the eu supports its farm sector .
the new cap will be geared towards consumers and taxpayers , while giving eu farmers the freedom to produce what the market wants .
in future , the vast majority of subsidies will be paid independently from the volume of production .
to avoid abandonment of production , member states may choose to maintain a limited link between subsidy and production under well defined conditions and within clear limits .
these new " single farm payments " will be linked to the respect of environmental , food safety and animal welfare standards .
severing the link between subsidies and production will make eu farmers more competitive and market orientated , while providing the necessary income stability .
more money will be available to farmers for environmental , quality or animal welfare programs by reducing direct payments for bigger farms .
the council further decided to revise the milk , rice , cereals , durum wheat , dried fodder and nut sectors .
in order to respect the tight budgetary ceiling for the eu-25 until 2013 , ministers agreed to introduce a financial discipline mechanism .
this reform will also strengthen the eu 's negotiating hand in the ongoing wto trade talks .
the different elements of the reform will enter into force in 2004 and 2005 .
the single farm payment will enter into force in 2005 .
if a member state needs a transitional period due to its specific agricultural conditions , it may apply the single farm payment from 2007 at the latest .
key elements of the reformed cap * a single farm payment for eu farmers , independent from production ; limited coupled elements may be maintained to avoid abandonment of production , * this payment will be linked to the respect of environmental , food safety , animal and plant health and animal welfare standards , as well as the requirement to keep all farmland in good agricultural and environmental condition -lrb- " cross-compliance " -rrb- , * a strengthened rural development policy with more eu money , new measures to promote the environment , quality and animal welfare and to help farmers to meet eu production standards starting in 2005 , * a reduction in direct payments -lrb- " modulation " -rrb- for bigger farms to finance the new rural development policy , * a mechanism for financial discipline to ensure that the farm budget fixed until 2013 is not overshot , revisions to the market policy of the cap : * asymmetric price cuts in the milk sector : the intervention price for butter will be reduced by 25 % over four years , which is an additional price cut of 10 % compared to agenda 2000 , for skimmed milk powder a 15 % reduction over three years , as agreed in agenda 2000 , is retained , * reduction of the monthly increments in the cereals sector by half , the current intervention price will be maintained , * reforms in the rice , durum wheat , nuts , starch potatoes and dried fodder sectors .

" the foreign ministers said they expect the government in khartoum to ensure that violations cease " with immediate effect " or the eu would take " appropriate steps . " though the word " sanctions " was n't specifically mentioned in the draft statement , the eu said it had started drawing up a list of janjaweed arab militia leaders " responsible for breaches and violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , and those guiding and supporting them .

" unity in the international community is very , very important , " fischer added .
" the sudanese government has to deliver . " speaking on german television earlier on sunday , fischer said his return from khartoum he â d been following very closely the sudanese government â s efforts to end the crisis in darfur .
he said that despite the promises made by the sudanese president and the foreign minister , a solution to the conflict was not yet in sight . â violence continues in the region , " he said .

" the -lrb- humanitarian -rrb- situation is slightly better , but that does n't mean the problem is solved , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" the risk is very high for a potential catastrophe .

the former star striker becomes the ninth coach of the three-time world cup champions and the youngest to fill the spot , at 39 , in the country 's history . " the subject of the continuing talks is now strictly about the sports side , " said harald stenger , a spokesman for dfb .
klinsmann had not confirmed until the final moment which role he would play in the new coaching line-up after flying back to germany from his home in los angeles for final negotiations on saturday .
now it is clear that the former stuttgart , monaco and inter milan forward will take the lead in a new coaching team that hopes to turn around the slumping national side in time for the 2006 world cup , which germany will host .

the 56-year-old veteran held that job on the 1990 team under franz beckenbauer , who also never guided a side before leading the german team to its third world cup crown .
fellow retired striking icon oliver bierhoff , who played alongside klinsmann when germany were crowned european champions in 1996 , is expected to take over the new post of team manager , a liaison job between the coach , media and dfb officials .
klinsmann has long been one of the most outspoken critics of the creaking dfb and his appointment is likely to be the start of a major overhaul in german soccer .
he is already asking the organization to augment his staff with experts in areas like psychology and speed training , copying the training techniques used in the american basketball leagues .
" the most important thing is the dfb needs to develop dynamism .

wto general director panitchpakdi supachai confirmed last week that all parties have pledged to agree to a skeleton accord by the end of the week .
the foundation is a draft produced by supachai that would demand the elimination of contested export subsidies for farm products .
the paper also calls for widespread and worldwide liberalization of goods traffic and services .
the fight over agricultural subsidies in rich industrial countries , which total about $ 300 billion a year led to the collapse of talks in cancun , mexico , last september .
ever since , talks have been placed on the back burner .
few thrilled by compromise but on tuesday , a last attempt will be made by wto 's 147 member states to reach a deal , thus completing the work they were unable to finish in cancun 10 months ago .
if broad enough support can be found , the goal this week is to reach a deal that will lay out a timeframe and the foundations for negotiations of a new world trade accord .
whether sufficient support can be found is far from certain - the compromise proposal placed on the table last week by supachai was met with little enthusiasm .
for some , the proposal goes too far , and for others it does n't go far enough .
if an agreement ca n't be found in the coming days , the negotiations will likely cease , and no one knows if it will be possible to resuscitate them in the future .
opponents of globalization would most certainly celebrate another collapse of the trade round .
in their eyes , the wto is a rogue body in the global economy .
nevertheless , a breakdown of the talks would n't stop the process of globalization , it would just slow it down .
the consequences of a weakened wto the immediate consequence of a collapse would be a weakening of the wto .
the member states would stay on board and the treaties would remain in effect , but that 's not enough to ensure the wto 's long-term authority .
and such authority is necessary for the mediation of trade disputes .
without the wto , these problems would again fall into the hands of diplomats , and that would put smaller countries at an even greater disadvantage .
nor would the superpowers of the world economy benefit .
without the mediation of the geneva-based wto , trade disputes between the european union , the united states , japan and , eventually , china , would escalate more frequently and could spin out of control far more easily .
a breakdown could also have immediate consequences for growth and the global economy .
but there 's a huge disparity of opinions when it comes to measuring the impact a general liberalization would have .
the world bank has estimated it would generate $ 350 billion in new wealth , with more than half of that going to the developing nations since they would have the most to gain from an opening of their markets .
however , the wto is no development agency .
it 's an event that takes place within the confines of political reality . for the negotiators in geneva , the challenge is to find a multilateral way out of the current labyrinth of conflicting political interests by the end of the week . tom weingÃ¤rtner -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de eu prepares for wto agriculture talks the eu is going to the wto talks in geneva on tuesday with a common position , despite resistance from france .

the former star striker becomes the ninth coach of the three-time world cup champions and the youngest to fill the spot , at 39 , in the country 's history . " the subject of the continuing talks is now strictly about the sports side , " said harald stenger , a spokesman for dfb .
klinsmann had not confirmed until the final moment which role he would play in the new coaching line-up after flying back to germany from his home in los angeles for final negotiations on saturday .
now it is clear that the former stuttgart , monaco and inter milan forward will take the lead in a new coaching team that hopes to turn around the slumping national side in time for the 2006 world cup , which germany will host .
klinsmann , who won the world cup and european championships along the way to collecting 108 cups for his country , has a valid coaching license , but has n't led a team since retiring from the pitch in 1998 .
experience coupled with innovative approach bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann worked under osieck in the world cup winning team .
his coaching team is expected to include former canadian national team coach holger osieck as assistant coach .
the 56-year-old veteran held that job on the 1990 team under franz beckenbauer , who also never guided a side before leading the german team to its third world cup crown .
fellow retired striking icon oliver bierhoff , who played alongside klinsmann when germany were crowned european champions in 1996 , is expected to take over the new post of team manager , a liaison job between the coach , media and dfb officials .
klinsmann has long been one of the most outspoken critics of the creaking dfb and his appointment is likely to be the start of a major overhaul in german soccer .
he is already asking the organization to augment his staff with experts in areas like psychology and speed training , copying the training techniques used in the american basketball leagues .
" the most important thing is the dfb needs to develop dynamism .
we have to look around the world , " klinsmann said recently .
german soccer ready to wake up to new dawn bildunterschrift : groÃansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld preferred to take a break .
klinsmann 's new employers have long been accused of sleeping through soccer 's modern developments and have been publicly embarrassed by the saga surrounding rudi vÃ¶ller 's resignation after the disastrous euro 2004 campaign .
the red faces deepened when germany 's top two coaches , ottmar hitzfeld -lrb- photo -rrb- and otto rehhagel , turned down the job after a public courtship .
now it hopes that lining up klinsmann will undo some of the damage .
his selection came as a huge surprise in germany , since the striker 's name had never been raised in connection with the job but those in the game have endorsed his appointment .
" this is an ingenious solution .
it 's a very good choice , " said hitzfeld , who turned down the job to take a year off coaching .
klinsmann said he also hopes to rely on the experience of the previous coach in his new role .
former team mate vÃ¶ller , another member of the 1990 world champions , is a close friend and will be able to pass on valuable knowledge on the pitfalls klinsmann should avoid . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail Â» -pipe- send Â» -pipe- print Â» more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann ready to take charge of team germany german soccer should n't hail its new national coach yet .

a third was wiped off jarvis 's share value earlier this month following a warning over spiralling debts .
the university 's director of finance and resources , andrew neil , said it was retaining older blocks earmarked for demolition in case of problems .
sixteen hundred rooms are due for completion in september .
it is part of a three-phase development which will eventually lead to more than 3,000 new rooms being built on campus .
campus development the university currently has 600 standby rooms available on campus to ensure no students will be homeless .
jarvis is part of a university partnership initiative that is behind the development .
banks have given the firm until the end of the month to produce a rescue plan , but some city analysts say an assets sale or bankruptcy lies ahead .
mr neil said any problems experienced by jarvis would not leave students without rooms on campus .
" we have put in place a number of plans and we are obviously aiming for as many students as possible to be in the new rooms , " he said .
" but should that not happen for any reason we have contingency plans in place . "
the university has a 30-year lease with jarvis for the project but mr neil said the development was backed by major banks and had a legal framework to protect it from any " potential disruption " .

but in france and germany at least , the talk is all of working harder .
working-time regulations - enforced with varying degrees of rigour around the eu - are at the heart of european social policy .
but over the past few weeks , that achievement has come under deadly assault .
a host of factory owners - renault , siemens , bosch , daimlerchrysler - are pushing to relax rules that limit most staff to a 35-hour week , and threatening to take their business elsewhere .
politicians , including some on the left , are increasingly calling for liberalisation .
and trade unions - even hardliners such as germany 's mighty ig metall - seem willing to compromise .
ups and downs no wonder : many experts agree that working-time restrictions have failed in their basic objectives .
the most zealous fans of the 35-hour week argue that hundreds of thousands of jobs have been created .
but a glance at the unemployment figures disproves that - or at least shows that other jobs are being destroyed just as quickly .
and while public-sector payrolls have grown in france and germany , this is something their cash-strapped governments can barely afford .
like it or lump it there are broader concerns .
the idea of restricting working hours is based on what economists call the " lump of work " fallacy - the idea that there is a fixed amount of activity in the economy which can be chopped up into smaller pieces , creating jobs .
in fact , there is no such correlation .
over the past 30 years , the average working week in france and germany has contracted by about one-fifth , while unemployment has , if anything , risen ; in the us , employment has increased despite a sharp expansion in working hours .
indeed , some analysts argue that restricting working time only constricts an economy 's potential for growth - scarcely good news for sluggish europe .
the 50bn-euro question this is because companies are at liberty to shift jobs overseas , a right frequently exercised by european employers .
mr sarkozy knows what the problem is companies can , of course , come to terms with working-time rules , but they resent any further bureaucratic burden .
in france , where the 35-hour week has been imposed most strictly , employers ' organisation medef calculates the policy has cost the economy 50bn euros -lrb- Â£ 33bn ; $ 61bn -rrb- , plus 15bn euros in direct outlay from the public purse .
" french businesses labour under a unique handicap , " medef says .
" along with the euro and slowing growth , companies are under unbearable competitive pressure . "
nicolas sarkozy , the french finance minister and a likely candidate for even higher office , feels the same .
" we simply have to accept that those who want to work longer to earn more should be allowed to do it , " he says .
choose life not everyone agrees .
working-time restrictions are still popular : a recent poll in newspaper die welt found 62 % of germans still convinced that the policy would create more jobs .
and although the " lump of work " is demonstrably a fallacy , its opposite is not necessarily true .
true , europe 's gross domestic product per head is some 30 % below that in the united states .
but europe 's economy is not significantly less productive - many european economies produce far more per hour than the supposedly slick us .
overall , about half europe 's gdp-per-head deficit is accounted for by shorter working hours , with much of the rest resulting from the eu 's proportionately smaller workforces - in other words , largely the result of cultural factors and conscious life choices .
working smarter , not harder in any case , much of the focus on eu legislation may be misplaced .
flexitime in action working time rules have not , in fact , had a huge effect on europe 's habits : the average working week has only shrunk by half an hour since 1997 , despite a barrage of legislation .
even in france , only one in five workers is below the 35-hour ceiling ; the average week for full-timers - well below the european average - is still about 40 hours .
at the same time , part-time and casual working - which can suit both employer and employee - is rapidly on the rise .
one-fifth of workers are on flexitime .

but in france and germany at least , the talk is all of working harder .
working-time regulations - enforced with varying degrees of rigour around the eu - are at the heart of european social policy .
but over the past few weeks , that achievement has come under deadly assault .
a host of factory owners - renault , siemens , bosch , daimlerchrysler - are pushing to relax rules that limit most staff to a 35-hour week , and threatening to take their business elsewhere .
politicians , including some on the left , are increasingly calling for liberalisation .
and trade unions - even hardliners such as germany 's mighty ig metall - seem willing to compromise .
ups and downs no wonder : many experts agree that working-time restrictions have failed in their basic objectives .
the most zealous fans of the 35-hour week argue that hundreds of thousands of jobs have been created .
but a glance at the unemployment figures disproves that - or at least shows that other jobs are being destroyed just as quickly .
and while public-sector payrolls have grown in france and germany , this is something their cash-strapped governments can barely afford .
like it or lump it there are broader concerns .
the idea of restricting working hours is based on what economists call the " lump of work " fallacy - the idea that there is a fixed amount of activity in the economy which can be chopped up into smaller pieces , creating jobs .
in fact , there is no such correlation .
over the past 30 years , the average working week in france and germany has contracted by about one-fifth , while unemployment has , if anything , risen ; in the us , employment has increased despite a sharp expansion in working hours .
indeed , some analysts argue that restricting working time only constricts an economy 's potential for growth - scarcely good news for sluggish europe .
the 50bn-euro question this is because companies are at liberty to shift jobs overseas , a right frequently exercised by european employers .
companies can , of course , come to terms with working-time rules , but they resent any further bureaucratic burden .
in france , where the 35-hour week has been imposed most strictly , employers ' organisation medef calculates the policy has cost the economy 50bn euros -lrb- Â£ 33bn ; $ 61bn -rrb- , plus 15bn euros in direct outlay from the public purse .
" french businesses labour under a unique handicap , " medef says .
" along with the euro and slowing growth , companies are under unbearable competitive pressure . "
nicolas sarkozy , the french finance minister and a likely candidate for even higher office , feels the same .
" we simply have to accept that those who want to work longer to earn more should be allowed to do it , " he says .
choose life not everyone agrees .
working-time restrictions are still popular : a recent poll in newspaper die welt found 62 % of germans still convinced that the policy would create more jobs .
and although the " lump of work " is demonstrably a fallacy , its opposite is not necessarily true .
true , europe 's gross domestic product per head is some 30 % below that in the united states .
but europe 's economy is not significantly less productive - many european economies produce far more per hour than the supposedly slick us .
overall , about half europe 's gdp-per-head deficit is accounted for by shorter working hours , with much of the rest resulting from the eu 's proportionately smaller workforces - in other words , largely the result of cultural factors and conscious life choices .
working smarter , not harder in any case , much of the focus on eu legislation may be misplaced .
working time rules have not , in fact , had a huge effect on europe 's habits : the average working week has only shrunk by half an hour since 1997 , despite a barrage of legislation .
even in france , only one in five workers is below the 35-hour ceiling ; the average week for full-timers - well below the european average - is still about 40 hours .
at the same time , part-time and casual working - which can suit both employer and employee - is rapidly on the rise .
one-fifth of workers are on flexitime .
and while eu rules have been fairly toothless , abolishing them is not going to turn europe into a continent of workaholics - especially when the sun 's shining .
