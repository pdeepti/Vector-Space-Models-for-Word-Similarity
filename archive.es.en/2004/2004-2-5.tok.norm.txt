the french-german pharmaceutical company aventis announced growing profits for 2003 in an effort to ward off a hostile takeover bid from a smaller french drug firm . aventis reported that net profits for 2003 had increased by 17.5 percent to € 2.44 billion -lrb- $ 3.07 billion -rrb- .
earnings per share had also risen by 18.6 percent although a weakening dollar had led to a 4.5 percent drop in sales .
aventis chief executive igor landau presented the 2003 profits at a press conference in london to make the case that the company is strong enough to stand on its own and can reject a € 48 billion -lrb- $ 60.4 billion -rrb- hostile takeover bid from the french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthélabo .
" today 's announcement highlights how sanofi 's offer fundamentally undervalues aventis , " said landau .
" their hostile bid is a cheap attempt to transfer their risks to our shareholders , " he added .
landau had previously hinted that there were other drug firms that would make better partners for aventis , suggesting that sanofi was using the hostile bid to avoid becoming a target of a takeover itself – a fact not disputed by sanofi 's executive board .
" they need us , but we do n't need them , ” said landau last week .
merger to create european drug giant sanofi-synthélabo made the grab for aventis on monday offering five of its shares and € 69 for every six aventis shares .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquarters of french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo sa in paris .
dealers and analysts said the franco-german company 's concerted attempt to fend off sanofi 's bid would ultimately fail , but aventis would force its french rival to increase its offer by at least 15 percent .
sanofi is pushing for the creation of a new european drug giant which would have a stronger combined presence on the lucrative u.s. market .
aventis pointed out on thursday that it already has a strong presence there ; 38 percent of its core sales are made in the us .
a merger with sanofi would create the third largest pharmaceutical company in terms of global sales behind the u.s. giant pfizer inc. and the british firm glaxosmithkline plc .
with a combined net worth of € 16.6 billion , aventis currently ranks as the sixth largest pharmaceutical company in the world .
the other well known german chemical firm , bayer , comes in at place 18 with a combined net worth of € 4.3 billion .
france enthusiastic , germany worried about job losses the french government is said to be enthusiastic about the takeover bid which would create a pharmaceutical giant based in paris .
germany is less excited about the prospect .
federal economics minister wolfgang clement warned last week that a merger could result in job losses in germany if the company moves its focus to paris .
" the german government has a strong interest in strengthening aventis ' position in germany rather than weakening it , " he said .
a combination of sanofi 's 70,000 strong workforce with aventis ' 69,000 employees could result in as many as 10,000 job cuts in both germany and france .
trade unions have said the number of lost jobs could be closer to 25,000 .
aventis now employs some 9,000 german workers who loyally support their chief executive igor landau .
michael klippel the head of the works committee at aventis said , " we are confident because we believe he will fight .
he is not one of these managers who will sell out for a few marks . "
analysts say the takeover battle is extremely personal for the 59 year old igor landau .
he was instrumental in the merger of the french drug firm rhône-poulenc , where he had been an executive for many years , with one of germany 's largest pharmaceutical companies , hoechst .
the deal was the pinnacle of three decades of work and landau shed the firm 's chemical and agricultural operation to focus solely on drugs .
hostile takeovers rare in europe the battle being played out in london between aventis and sanofi is unusual for europe , where hostile takeover attempts are extremely rare .
while experts do n't expect there to be an increase in hostile bids , they do believe friendly mergers , like the one that created aventis , will continue .
according to some experts , smaller pharmaceuticals in europe soon wo n't be able to keep up with the giants .
professor klaus pohle sits on the board of directors of lion bioscience ag , a german software provider for drug companies .
he said german drug companies have lost their title as " chemists of the world " because of a research policy burdened with too much bureaucracy that serves to stifles innovation .
research and development vital to drug firms surviving the research , development and release of a new drug onto the market takes approximately 12 years .
then it takes another six to nine years before substantial profits are made .
pohle said the larger the pharmaceutical company , the more money and time it can invest in new projects and the less money is lost when a project fails .
experts say even if sanofi 's offer transforms itself into a friendly one , landau , like many chief executives whose company has been targeted by a hostile buyer , is unlikely to gain control of the new company .
if the sanofi bid fails , the smaller french firm is likely to be next in line for a hostile takeover bid .
aventis shares on thursday were up 0.7 percent after comfortably beating forecast profits , while suitor sanofi-synthélabo stayed at 2.8 percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis moves to prevent hostile takeover french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo wants to acquire the franco-german drug-maker aventis in a hostile takeover .
if the € 50 billion merger is successful , it would create the world 's third-largest pharmaceuticals firm .

dealers and analysts said the franco-german company 's concerted attempt to fend off sanofi 's bid would ultimately fail , but aventis would force its french rival to increase its offer by at least 15 percent .
sanofi is pushing for the creation of a new european drug giant which would have a stronger combined presence on the lucrative u.s. market .
aventis pointed out on thursday that it already has a strong presence there ; 38 percent of its core sales are made in the us .
a merger with sanofi would create the third largest pharmaceutical company in terms of global sales behind the u.s. giant pfizer inc. and the british firm glaxosmithkline plc .
with a combined net worth of € 16.6 billion , aventis currently ranks as the sixth largest pharmaceutical company in the world .

federal economics minister wolfgang clement warned last week that a merger could result in job losses in germany if the company moves its focus to paris .
" the german government has a strong interest in strengthening aventis ' position in germany rather than weakening it , " he said .
a combination of sanofi 's 70,000 strong workforce with aventis ' 69,000 employees could result in as many as 10,000 job cuts in both germany and france .
trade unions have said the number of lost jobs could be closer to 25,000 .
aventis now employs some 9,000 german workers who loyally support their chief executive igor landau .
michael klippel the head of the works committee at aventis said , " we are confident because we believe he will fight .

the deal was the pinnacle of three decades of work and landau shed the firm 's chemical and agricultural operation to focus solely on drugs .
hostile takeovers rare in europe the battle being played out in london between aventis and sanofi is unusual for europe , where hostile takeover attempts are extremely rare .
while experts do n't expect there to be an increase in hostile bids , they do believe friendly mergers , like the one that created aventis , will continue .

experts say even if sanofi 's offer transforms itself into a friendly one , landau , like many chief executives whose company has been targeted by a hostile buyer , is unlikely to gain control of the new company .

the french-german pharmaceutical company aventis announced growing profits for 2003 in an effort to ward off a hostile takeover bid from a smaller french drug firm . aventis reported that net profits for 2003 had increased by 17.5 percent to € 2.44 billion -lrb- $ 3.07 billion -rrb- .
earnings per share had also risen by 18.6 percent although a weakening dollar had led to a 4.5 percent drop in sales .
aventis chief executive igor landau presented the 2003 profits at a press conference in london to make the case that the company is strong enough to stand on its own and can reject a € 48 billion -lrb- $ 60.4 billion -rrb- hostile takeover bid from the french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthélabo .
" today 's announcement highlights how sanofi 's offer fundamentally undervalues aventis , " said landau .
" their hostile bid is a cheap attempt to transfer their risks to our shareholders , " he added .
landau had previously hinted that there were other drug firms that would make better partners for aventis , suggesting that sanofi was using the hostile bid to avoid becoming a target of a takeover itself – a fact not disputed by sanofi 's executive board .
" they need us , but we do n't need them , ” said landau last week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.02.2004 eu countries fear mass migration from the east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current eu members fear a sudden large influx of easterners .
british prime minister tony blair has said he might join an increasing number of eu countries that want to initially bar low-cost workers from new european union countries from working in the west . while the expansion of the eu by ten member states in may this year is seen by many as a historical milestone , it has also raised fears of mass migration of labor from the poorer , mostly ex-communist new members to the more affluent west .
eu skeptics say a large influx of low-wage workers would prove devastating to current members of the bloc , who are already facing stubbornly high unemployment rates .
prime minister tony blair told parliament on wednesday that he was re-evaluating his earlier stance on the issue , and might advocate imposing immigration controls and welfare benefit restrictions on immigrants from the 10 new countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair “ it is important that we recognize that there is a potential risk from these accession countries , ” blair -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliament .
“ we will take whatever measures are necessary to make sure that the ‘ pull factor ’ which might draw people here is closed off . ”
the draw , he said , could be britain ’ s welfare benefit system , and it would be re-examined to determined whether it was “ too generous . ”
change of heart britain ’ s new jumpiness about eastern migration comes in the wake of sweden ’ s decision last week to impose limits on workers from the new eu countries .
the netherlands also said recently it would impose a limit on the number of immigrant workers it would accept .
norway , though not an eu member but with close ties to the bloc , said on thursday it is also exploring possible restrictions , although it has previously stated its borders would be open to new eu citizens .
“ we now see that some of our neighboring countries , and now sweden , state that they will have some exceptions for some years , for an interim period , ” prime minister kjell magne bondevik told reporters on thursday after talks with european commission president romano prodi .
“ so we also now … intend to make a proposal for parliament about some possible exceptions for an interim period so we are more in line with our neighboring countries . ” for two years after enlargement , labor market access with depend on national policies , and not be dictated by brussels .
according to the european commission , only about half the 15 member states have told the eu about their plans .
austria , finland , belgium , france and denmark are planning limits , in some cases for up to seven years .
only ireland and spain have said they will keep their borders open .
germany , with its high unemployment and generous welfare system , insisted in 2002 during entry negotiations for the new candidate countries on a clause that would allow it to impose restrictions to its market for citizens from central and eastern europe until 2011 .
second-class citizens ?
malta , cyprus , estonia , latvia , lithuania , hungary , poland , slovakia , slovenia and the czech republic will become official members of the eu in may of this year . in the past months , tension between current and future members of the eu has increased on a number of issues .
the about-turns on work policy are likely to deepen the fear among many in the accession countries that they will be treated as second-class european citizens .
“ the thinking that we need long transition periods 14 years after the fall of the berlin wall shows a lack of solidarity , ” jan figiel , slovakia ’ s candidate for the european commission , told reuters .
the new members point to one of the fundaments of the eu project — free movement of persons including the right to live and work in another member state .
but as the eu prepares to take in 75 million new people , mostly from countries formerly part of the soviet bloc where wages were lower , fears have been growing of an influx of labor in search of a better standard of living .
the unease has been especially strong in germany , which , since 1990 , has attracted about 75 percent of the migrants to the eu from application countries .
unfounded fears experts , however , note that history teaches that such fears have generally been without foundation .
in previous eu enlargement periods , such as greece in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 , transitional measures such as labor restrictions were put into place , largely unnecessarily .

british prime minister tony blair has said he might join an increasing number of eu countries that want to initially bar low-cost workers from new european union countries from working in the west . while the expansion of the eu by ten member states in may this year is seen by many as a historical milestone , it has also raised fears of mass migration of labor from the poorer , mostly ex-communist new members to the more affluent west .
eu skeptics say a large influx of low-wage workers would prove devastating to current members of the bloc , who are already facing stubbornly high unemployment rates .
prime minister tony blair told parliament on wednesday that he was re-evaluating his earlier stance on the issue , and might advocate imposing immigration controls and welfare benefit restrictions on immigrants from the 10 new countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair “ it is important that we recognize that there is a potential risk from these accession countries , ” blair -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliament .
“ we will take whatever measures are necessary to make sure that the ‘ pull factor ’ which might draw people here is closed off . ”
the draw , he said , could be britain ’ s welfare benefit system , and it would be re-examined to determined whether it was “ too generous . ”
change of heart britain ’ s new jumpiness about eastern migration comes in the wake of sweden ’ s decision last week to impose limits on workers from the new eu countries .
the netherlands also said recently it would impose a limit on the number of immigrant workers it would accept .
norway , though not an eu member but with close ties to the bloc , said on thursday it is also exploring possible restrictions , although it has previously stated its borders would be open to new eu citizens .
“ we now see that some of our neighboring countries , and now sweden , state that they will have some exceptions for some years , for an interim period , ” prime minister kjell magne bondevik told reporters on thursday after talks with european commission president romano prodi .
“ so we also now … intend to make a proposal for parliament about some possible exceptions for an interim period so we are more in line with our neighboring countries . ” for two years after enlargement , labor market access with depend on national policies , and not be dictated by brussels .
according to the european commission , only about half the 15 member states have told the eu about their plans .
austria , finland , belgium , france and denmark are planning limits , in some cases for up to seven years .
only ireland and spain have said they will keep their borders open .
germany , with its high unemployment and generous welfare system , insisted in 2002 during entry negotiations for the new candidate countries on a clause that would allow it to impose restrictions to its market for citizens from central and eastern europe until 2011 .
second-class citizens ?
malta , cyprus , estonia , latvia , lithuania , hungary , poland , slovakia , slovenia and the czech republic will become official members of the eu in may of this year . in the past months , tension between current and future members of the eu has increased on a number of issues .
the about-turns on work policy are likely to deepen the fear among many in the accession countries that they will be treated as second-class european citizens .
“ the thinking that we need long transition periods 14 years after the fall of the berlin wall shows a lack of solidarity , ” jan figiel , slovakia ’ s candidate for the european commission , told reuters .
the new members point to one of the fundaments of the eu project — free movement of persons including the right to live and work in another member state .
but as the eu prepares to take in 75 million new people , mostly from countries formerly part of the soviet bloc where wages were lower , fears have been growing of an influx of labor in search of a better standard of living .
the unease has been especially strong in germany , which , since 1990 , has attracted about 75 percent of the migrants to the eu from application countries .
unfounded fears experts , however , note that history teaches that such fears have generally been without foundation .
in previous eu enlargement periods , such as greece in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 , transitional measures such as labor restrictions were put into place , largely unnecessarily .

last year was an outstanding year for german cinema .
now , as the 54th international film festival berlin kicks off , it ’ s time for the stars of germany ’ s film industry to sit back and enjoy the attention . the berlinale gets underway on thursday with film fans flocking to the german capital to bask in the warm celebrity glow of the global stars and directors who will be arriving throughout the ten days of glamour and glitz .
but it will not only be the heat from the bright lights that will warm berliners attending the shows and events that make up the festival circus .
germans from all over the country can also revel in the feeling of pride that berlin ’ s film gala and the german movie industry as a whole is currently enjoying a surge in international profile , popularity and profit .
“ it 's been one of the best years ever for cinema in germany , ” said dieter kosslick , the festival ’ s director who has turned the berlinale into a showcase for german productions and has helped it secure its place behind cannes and alongside venice as one of europe 's three most important film festivals .
“ as long as i 'm the head of this festival , its backing for german films will remain high , ” kosslick said in an interview with reporters in the run-up to the festival ’ s opening .
“ i 've never had to push for german films because i 've always found them to be very good .
it was always other people who had problems with them . ”
from nowhere to a miracle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german director caroline link holds the oscar for " nowhere in africa . "
those problems have been fading ever since “ nowhere in africa , ” a film about the challenges facing a jewish family who flee to kenya after the nazis take power , won the academy award for best foreign language movie last march .
that oscar and a string of domestic box office hits have put germany ’ s film industry back into the international spotlight .
“ it 's obviously been a great year for german film , ” said rolf baehr , chairman of the german film board , in an interview with reuters .
“ german films are now reaching audiences with good stories . ”
“ film makers are concentrating on viewers more and not focused on their own self-realization .

british prime minister tony blair has said he might join an increasing number of eu countries that want to initially bar low-cost workers from new european union countries from working in the west . while the expansion of the eu by ten member states in may this year is seen by many as a historical milestone , it has also raised fears of mass migration of labor from the poorer , mostly ex-communist new members to the more affluent west .
eu skeptics say a large influx of low-wage workers would prove devastating to current members of the bloc , who are already facing stubbornly high unemployment rates .
prime minister tony blair told parliament on wednesday that he was re-evaluating his earlier stance on the issue , and might advocate imposing immigration controls and welfare benefit restrictions on immigrants from the 10 new countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair “ it is important that we recognize that there is a potential risk from these accession countries , ” blair -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliament .
“ we will take whatever measures are necessary to make sure that the ‘ pull factor ’ which might draw people here is closed off . ”
the draw , he said , could be britain ’ s welfare benefit system , and it would be re-examined to determined whether it was “ too generous . ”
change of heart britain ’ s new jumpiness about eastern migration comes in the wake of sweden ’ s decision last week to impose limits on workers from the new eu countries .
the netherlands also said recently it would impose a limit on the number of immigrant workers it would accept .
norway , though not an eu member but with close ties to the bloc , said on thursday it is also exploring possible restrictions , although it has previously stated its borders would be open to new eu citizens .
“ we now see that some of our neighboring countries , and now sweden , state that they will have some exceptions for some years , for an interim period , ” prime minister kjell magne bondevik told reporters on thursday after talks with european commission president romano prodi .
“ so we also now … intend to make a proposal for parliament about some possible exceptions for an interim period so we are more in line with our neighboring countries . ” for two years after enlargement , labor market access with depend on national policies , and not be dictated by brussels .
according to the european commission , only about half the 15 member states have told the eu about their plans .
austria , finland , belgium , france and denmark are planning limits , in some cases for up to seven years .
only ireland and spain have said they will keep their borders open .
germany , with its high unemployment and generous welfare system , insisted in 2002 during entry negotiations for the new candidate countries on a clause that would allow it to impose restrictions to its market for citizens from central and eastern europe until 2011 .
second-class citizens ?
malta , cyprus , estonia , latvia , lithuania , hungary , poland , slovakia , slovenia and the czech republic will become official members of the eu in may of this year . in the past months , tension between current and future members of the eu has increased on a number of issues .
the about-turns on work policy are likely to deepen the fear among many in the accession countries that they will be treated as second-class european citizens .
“ the thinking that we need long transition periods 14 years after the fall of the berlin wall shows a lack of solidarity , ” jan figiel , slovakia ’ s candidate for the european commission , told reuters .
the new members point to one of the fundaments of the eu project — free movement of persons including the right to live and work in another member state .
but as the eu prepares to take in 75 million new people , mostly from countries formerly part of the soviet bloc where wages were lower , fears have been growing of an influx of labor in search of a better standard of living .
the unease has been especially strong in germany , which , since 1990 , has attracted about 75 percent of the migrants to the eu from application countries .
unfounded fears experts , however , note that history teaches that such fears have generally been without foundation .
in previous eu enlargement periods , such as greece in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 , transitional measures such as labor restrictions were put into place , largely unnecessarily .
other alarms about east-west migration have proven false .
one example is a 1989 study by the u.n. high commission for refugees which estimated that 25 million people from the eastern europe would move to the west in the 1990s .

nato defense chiefs will meet in munich this weekend to discuss the alliance 's role in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere .
the hope is that the meeting will be more cordial than last year . nato defense and foreign ministers will gather in munich on friday to discuss the lingering fallout from the iraq war and the future direction of the alliance .
it will be the 40th annual meeting for the german security conference . the big names of the defense world , an estimated 250 officials including pentagon chief donald rumsfeld are due to attend , will use the informal get-together to address transatlantic relations , the future of nato , and current developments in the middle east . they will also likely to take the opportunity to discuss extending the alliance 's role in afghanistan while in the bavarian capital , according to diplomats in brussels . iraq situation will again dominate agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the main focus will undoubtedly be the situation in iraq , even more so now inquiries have been launched into intelligence failures in the united states and britain regarding the lack of evidence in the search for weapons of mass destruction a year after the war began . the u.s. delegation is also likely to continue with its pressure to get nato to play a role in iraq as part of washington ’ s current initiative to solicit wider contributions from its member states . last year 's munich conference was a highly tense affair with officials from washington , paris and berlin on edge as a un security council vote on a new iraq resolution loomed ominously near .
rumsfeld and german foreign minister joschka fischer famously clashed at the event and will meet again on friday with hopefully less static in the air between them . security conference host horst teltschik told reporters in munich that some reconciliation is likely .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish soldiers in the ancient city of babylon , 80 kilometers south of baghdad , iraq .
new nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer said last week that the alliance , which is supporting the polish-led division in iraq , is ready and able to do the job .
" if the question comes , it goes without saying that i 'm very much in favour of a nato role , " he told journalists , before adding : " it 's too early to say exactly what that role will be . " despite making favourable noises in the direction of the united states in the form of low-key discussions , most nato officials remain resolute that no action will be taken before sovereignty is transferred from the u.s.-appointed interim leadership to the iraqis , a move that has been pencilled in for june . isaf 's afghan mission to be addressed the defense ministers will also consider the success of its continuing mission in afghanistan .
when the alliance took over command last august of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- it was nato 's first mission outside europe .
since then , the command of the mission , which has until now been centered on the capital kabul , has been rotated between member countries , with canada currently in control . nato wants to extend isaf 's operations beyond the capital kabul , notably using german troops , but it is having trouble with resources .

the landscape of nato ’ s role in afghanistan is likely to change further after officials announced on wednesday that the five-nation eurocorps army is ready to take the lead in the afghan peacekeeping mission later this year .
the eurocorps was recognized in 2002 as a nato high readiness force and has already carried out peacekeeping duties in kosovo and bosnia . with plans to be released and confirmed in the coming days , the 60,000-strong force - made up of troops from germany , france , spain , belgium and luxembourg - would more than likely be ready to assume control of the kabul-based mission by the summer .
it was not immediately clear how many of its soldiers would leave for afghanistan , as part of the 5,500-strong isaf . ministers from the five eurocorps nations are scheduled to meet on the margins of the munich meeting to discuss taking on the headquarters role . washington calls for nato engagement in mid-east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the middle east situation is also on the agenda .
elsewhere at the munich conference , officials will analyze the possibilities of nato involvement in the middle east - a topic that could both provide grounds for transatlantic consensus but may also be a source of further tensions . the united states is eager for nato to engage in the middle east to help build regional stability , and around six middle east and northern african nations , including israel and egypt , are being invited to the alliance summit in istanbul in june . observers expect lively discussion to be generated by the attendance of several middle east delegations in munich , discussions on developments in iran , israel 's " security fence " in and around the west bank and its decision to dismantle some jewish settlements . the fireworks may not be solely reserved for the conference either .
protests are expected and around 21 rallies have been planned before the meeting finishes on sunday with some 4,000 police being mobilized in munich .

nato defense chiefs will meet in munich this weekend to discuss the alliance 's role in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere .
the hope is that the meeting will be more cordial than last year . nato defense and foreign ministers will gather in munich on friday to discuss the lingering fallout from the iraq war and the future direction of the alliance .
it will be the 40th annual meeting for the german security conference . the big names of the defense world , an estimated 250 officials including pentagon chief donald rumsfeld are due to attend , will use the informal get-together to address transatlantic relations , the future of nato , and current developments in the middle east . they will also likely to take the opportunity to discuss extending the alliance 's role in afghanistan while in the bavarian capital , according to diplomats in brussels . iraq situation will again dominate agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the main focus will undoubtedly be the situation in iraq , even more so now inquiries have been launched into intelligence failures in the united states and britain regarding the lack of evidence in the search for weapons of mass destruction a year after the war began . the u.s. delegation is also likely to continue with its pressure to get nato to play a role in iraq as part of washington ’ s current initiative to solicit wider contributions from its member states . last year 's munich conference was a highly tense affair with officials from washington , paris and berlin on edge as a un security council vote on a new iraq resolution loomed ominously near .
rumsfeld and german foreign minister joschka fischer famously clashed at the event and will meet again on friday with hopefully less static in the air between them . security conference host horst teltschik told reporters in munich that some reconciliation is likely .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish soldiers in the ancient city of babylon , 80 kilometers south of baghdad , iraq .
new nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer said last week that the alliance , which is supporting the polish-led division in iraq , is ready and able to do the job .
" if the question comes , it goes without saying that i 'm very much in favour of a nato role , " he told journalists , before adding : " it 's too early to say exactly what that role will be .

since then , the command of the mission , which has until now been centered on the capital kabul , has been rotated between member countries , with canada currently in control . nato wants to extend isaf 's operations beyond the capital kabul , notably using german troops , but it is having trouble with resources .

nato defense chiefs will meet in munich this weekend to discuss the alliance 's role in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere .
the hope is that the meeting will be more cordial than last year . nato defense and foreign ministers will gather in munich on friday to discuss the lingering fallout from the iraq war and the future direction of the alliance .
it will be the 40th annual meeting for the german security conference . the big names of the defense world , an estimated 250 officials including pentagon chief donald rumsfeld are due to attend , will use the informal get-together to address transatlantic relations , the future of nato , and current developments in the middle east . they will also likely to take the opportunity to discuss extending the alliance 's role in afghanistan while in the bavarian capital , according to diplomats in brussels . iraq situation will again dominate agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the main focus will undoubtedly be the situation in iraq , even more so now inquiries have been launched into intelligence failures in the united states and britain regarding the lack of evidence in the search for weapons of mass destruction a year after the war began . the u.s. delegation is also likely to continue with its pressure to get nato to play a role in iraq as part of washington ’ s current initiative to solicit wider contributions from its member states . last year 's munich conference was a highly tense affair with officials from washington , paris and berlin on edge as a un security council vote on a new iraq resolution loomed ominously near .
rumsfeld and german foreign minister joschka fischer famously clashed at the event and will meet again on friday with hopefully less static in the air between them . security conference host horst teltschik told reporters in munich that some reconciliation is likely .
" i get the impression that the americans want to give us a sign that they are prepared to talk so that both sides can get back to a ' normal ' relationship . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish soldiers in the ancient city of babylon , 80 kilometers south of baghdad , iraq .
new nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer said last week that the alliance , which is supporting the polish-led division in iraq , is ready and able to do the job .
" if the question comes , it goes without saying that i 'm very much in favour of a nato role , " he told journalists , before adding : " it 's too early to say exactly what that role will be . " despite making favourable noises in the direction of the united states in the form of low-key discussions , most nato officials remain resolute that no action will be taken before sovereignty is transferred from the u.s.-appointed interim leadership to the iraqis , a move that has been pencilled in for june . isaf 's afghan mission to be addressed the defense ministers will also consider the success of its continuing mission in afghanistan .
when the alliance took over command last august of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- it was nato 's first mission outside europe .
since then , the command of the mission , which has until now been centered on the capital kabul , has been rotated between member countries , with canada currently in control . nato wants to extend isaf 's operations beyond the capital kabul , notably using german troops , but it is having trouble with resources .
" i think that there is political will , but translating it into terms of concrete forces on the ground is more difficult and that is our challenge " said britain 's ambassador to nato peter ricketts in a press conference in brussels this week . eurocorps ready to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurocorps in mülheim , germany .
the landscape of nato ’ s role in afghanistan is likely to change further after officials announced on wednesday that the five-nation eurocorps army is ready to take the lead in the afghan peacekeeping mission later this year .
the eurocorps was recognized in 2002 as a nato high readiness force and has already carried out peacekeeping duties in kosovo and bosnia . with plans to be released and confirmed in the coming days , the 60,000-strong force - made up of troops from germany , france , spain , belgium and luxembourg - would more than likely be ready to assume control of the kabul-based mission by the summer .
it was not immediately clear how many of its soldiers would leave for afghanistan , as part of the 5,500-strong isaf . ministers from the five eurocorps nations are scheduled to meet on the margins of the munich meeting to discuss taking on the headquarters role . washington calls for nato engagement in mid-east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the middle east situation is also on the agenda .
elsewhere at the munich conference , officials will analyze the possibilities of nato involvement in the middle east - a topic that could both provide grounds for transatlantic consensus but may also be a source of further tensions . the united states is eager for nato to engage in the middle east to help build regional stability , and around six middle east and northern african nations , including israel and egypt , are being invited to the alliance summit in istanbul in june . observers expect lively discussion to be generated by the attendance of several middle east delegations in munich , discussions on developments in iran , israel 's " security fence " in and around the west bank and its decision to dismantle some jewish settlements . the fireworks may not be solely reserved for the conference either .
protests are expected and around 21 rallies have been planned before the meeting finishes on sunday with some 4,000 police being mobilized in munich .
the united states are so concerned that the protests may turn violent that washington has urged u.s. citizens around munich to be vigilant for possible unrest . dw staff -lrb- na -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de munich conference opens with sharp differences over iraq both u.s. defense secretary rumsfeld and german foreign minister fischer delivered strongly-worded speeches in which they staked out their positions and crossed verbal swords over the pressing issue of iraq in munich .

last year was an outstanding year for german cinema .
now , as the 54th international film festival berlin kicks off , it ’ s time for the stars of germany ’ s film industry to sit back and enjoy the attention . the berlinale gets underway on thursday with film fans flocking to the german capital to bask in the warm celebrity glow of the global stars and directors who will be arriving throughout the ten days of glamour and glitz .
but it will not only be the heat from the bright lights that will warm berliners attending the shows and events that make up the festival circus .
germans from all over the country can also revel in the feeling of pride that berlin ’ s film gala and the german movie industry as a whole is currently enjoying a surge in international profile , popularity and profit .
“ it 's been one of the best years ever for cinema in germany , ” said dieter kosslick , the festival ’ s director who has turned the berlinale into a showcase for german productions and has helped it secure its place behind cannes and alongside venice as one of europe 's three most important film festivals .
“ as long as i 'm the head of this festival , its backing for german films will remain high , ” kosslick said in an interview with reporters in the run-up to the festival ’ s opening .
“ i 've never had to push for german films because i 've always found them to be very good .
it was always other people who had problems with them . ”
from nowhere to a miracle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german director caroline link holds the oscar for " nowhere in africa . "
those problems have been fading ever since “ nowhere in africa , ” a film about the challenges facing a jewish family who flee to kenya after the nazis take power , won the academy award for best foreign language movie last march .
that oscar and a string of domestic box office hits have put germany ’ s film industry back into the international spotlight .
“ it 's obviously been a great year for german film , ” said rolf baehr , chairman of the german film board , in an interview with reuters .
“ german films are now reaching audiences with good stories . ”
“ film makers are concentrating on viewers more and not focused on their own self-realization .
the experience and training are also greatly improved .
it 's all coming together . ”
the successes of films such as “ good bye , lenin ” - the comedy about a son who conceals the fall of the berlin wall from his ailing mother , and the world war ii drama “ rosenstrasse " , has helped the domestic market share climb to about 15 percent in 2003 from around 11 percent the year before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good bye , lenin .
hello success .
“ good bye , lenin , ” which won six european film awards in december , topped germany 's box office last year with over 6.5 million people turning out to see the film , generating nearly € 31.9 million -lrb- $ 40 million -rrb- .
“ the miracle of bern ” , a film about west germany 's 1954 world cup winning soccer team , and the biopic “ luther ” also scored with audiences inside and outside germany , and film makers are hopeful the festival will herald another big year .
interest in german films rises “ thanks to caroline link 's oscar -lrb- for nowhere in africa -rrb- , there 's now a lot more interest in german films from abroad , " said romuald karmaker , a german director whose film “ nightsongs ” is one of 23 competing for the top golden bear awards .
the director told reporters : “ the entire atmosphere is completely different now , ” referring to the past when the berlinale featured very few german films in its program .
“ the attention we 're getting now is absolutely essential . ”

european papers on thursday focused on u.s. democratic presidential front-runner john kerry ’ s success on the campaign trail .
most warned kerry had his work cut out if he was to dislodge bush from the white house . u.s. presidential candidate john kerry won five of seven democratic primaries on tuesday .
dutch left-leaning paper volkskrant wrote that kerry ’ s success was based on the fact that " he ’ s trusted and seen as capable of being elected by many " as well as on his prestige that he built up as a vietnam veteran and during his long stint in the u.s. senate .
" but so far his election campaign has seldom witnessed sweeping enthusiasm .
one is still waiting for a political message that can stir american voters to entrust the highest post in the country to an acting senator for the first time since the days of john f. kennedy , " the daily concluded .
" can john kerry chase george w. bush out of the white house ? "
french daily liberation asked and added that the question had taken on new urgency since kerry appeared to have good chances of being pitched as the democrats ’ presidential candidate .
the paper mused that if the voters had already made kerry a favorite or planned to do so , it was because they are convinced that he can be elected .
" in paris kerry has already been declared as the most likely democratic presidential hopeful , " it wrote .
" but to defeat an acting president , even a beleaguered one , the candidate must have outstanding qualities and the circumstances need to be exceptional , " the broadsheet cautioned .
the independent in london said if there is one lesson to be drawn from past american president campaigns , it is that favorites whether for nominations or for the white house become the target of brickbats as soon as they are identified .
the paper expected the other democrat hopefuls to turn their fire on the front-runner .
" kerry has proved his appeal to voters in the north , east , center and southwest of the country , he has attracted all classes , white americans and hispanics . "
but the daily warned , " kerry must prepare himself for whatever the other candidates may dig up to use against him and dampen his voter appeal . "
belgian daily le soir was optimistic that kerry ’ s surging popularity had the potential to unseat president bush .
" everywhere the voter turnout has broken records , a sign for the mobilization of democrat followers to remove the president from the white house , " the paper wrote .
" but more than the surveys that show that john kerry and john edwards will defeat him , it ’ s this resoluteness that must be unnerving george bush because if affects states -lrb- missouri and arizona -rrb- that he -lrb- bush -rrb- won only narrowly in 2000 . "
" a democratic people , who are in unanimous agreement that george w. bush must go , are pinning their hopes on john kerry and to a lesser extent on john edwards .
but is john kerry really the man to execute that goal ? " asked zürich-based swiss daily tages-anzeiger .
the paper pointed out that though kerry had acquired the reputation of a solid and sound politician during his long years in the washington senate , he was definitely not a visionary .
the senator may possess the necessary stature , but his readiness to take on political risks still needs to be proven , the daily stressed .
liberal austrian daily der standard opined that john kerry had hit the right note in his election campaign .
" kerry has – just like his rival john edwards – always struck a mildly populist tone in his campaign and portrayed bush , not without reason , as the president of ‘ corporate america ’ , of the rich and the powerful , " it wrote .
the daily added that as the husband of a rich heiress who owns a billion-dollar ketchup company , kerry wasn ’ t exactly in danger of ending up on the streets anytime soon .
" but he -lrb- kerry -rrb- has still understood the importance of profiling himself as the advocate of the lower and middle classes in the u.s. , who are reeling from the enron scandal and the latest tax cuts by the government and do n't have much to laugh about under bush . "
norway ’ s conservative aftenposten observed that john kerry seems to have the tail wind behind him , judging by his success so far in the primary elections .
" however , kerry must master a difficult balancing act with regard to wooing voters and keeping the ones who support him already , " the paper warned .
" the key is the level of criticism kerry may use against the other candidates , which if too personal and petty , could repel voters , " the daily wrote .
germany ’ s conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung admired the activist zeal the democrats have shown in recent months .
" they ’ re positively burning with the desire to get george bush out of the white house with a fury that is strategically focussed , " the paper wrote .
but it added , " the democrats are seeking the most electable candidate which will be quite a challenge in a country that is so deeply divided . "
italian daily la repubblica reflected that it ’ s still a long way off till the u.s. presidential election and the fortunes of the democrats could rise and fall by then .
" this long journey to the american presidential polls is marked by tides that rise and devour candidates and their hopes everyday .
today they appear to let bush sink and let his two opponents rise , the nth ‘ new kennedy ’ , senator john forbes kerry and right after him the ‘ new clinton ’ , southerner john edwards .
the winds of optimism are allowing the hopes of the democrats to take off right now . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback do you think kerry can beat bush ?

dutch left-leaning paper volkskrant wrote that kerry ’ s success was based on the fact that " he ’ s trusted and seen as capable of being elected by many " as well as on his prestige that he built up as a vietnam veteran and during his long stint in the u.s. senate .
" but so far his election campaign has seldom witnessed sweeping enthusiasm .
one is still waiting for a political message that can stir american voters to entrust the highest post in the country to an acting senator for the first time since the days of john f. kennedy , " the daily concluded .
" can john kerry chase george w. bush out of the white house ? "
french daily liberation asked and added that the question had taken on new urgency since kerry appeared to have good chances of being pitched as the democrats ’ presidential candidate .
the paper mused that if the voters had already made kerry a favorite or planned to do so , it was because they are convinced that he can be elected .
" in paris kerry has already been declared as the most likely democratic presidential hopeful , " it wrote .
" but to defeat an acting president , even a beleaguered one , the candidate must have outstanding qualities and the circumstances need to be exceptional , " the broadsheet cautioned .
the independent in london said if there is one lesson to be drawn from past american president campaigns , it is that favorites whether for nominations or for the white house become the target of brickbats as soon as they are identified .
the paper expected the other democrat hopefuls to turn their fire on the front-runner .
" kerry has proved his appeal to voters in the north , east , center and southwest of the country , he has attracted all classes , white americans and hispanics . "
but the daily warned , " kerry must prepare himself for whatever the other candidates may dig up to use against him and dampen his voter appeal . "
belgian daily le soir was optimistic that kerry ’ s surging popularity had the potential to unseat president bush .
" everywhere the voter turnout has broken records , a sign for the mobilization of democrat followers to remove the president from the white house , " the paper wrote .
" but more than the surveys that show that john kerry and john edwards will defeat him , it ’ s this resoluteness that must be unnerving george bush because if affects states -lrb- missouri and arizona -rrb- that he -lrb- bush -rrb- won only narrowly in 2000 . "
" a democratic people , who are in unanimous agreement that george w. bush must go , are pinning their hopes on john kerry and to a lesser extent on john edwards .
but is john kerry really the man to execute that goal ? " asked zürich-based swiss daily tages-anzeiger .
the paper pointed out that though kerry had acquired the reputation of a solid and sound politician during his long years in the washington senate , he was definitely not a visionary .
the senator may possess the necessary stature , but his readiness to take on political risks still needs to be proven , the daily stressed .
liberal austrian daily der standard opined that john kerry had hit the right note in his election campaign .
" kerry has – just like his rival john edwards – always struck a mildly populist tone in his campaign and portrayed bush , not without reason , as the president of ‘ corporate america ’ , of the rich and the powerful , " it wrote .
the daily added that as the husband of a rich heiress who owns a billion-dollar ketchup company , kerry wasn ’ t exactly in danger of ending up on the streets anytime soon .
" but he -lrb- kerry -rrb- has still understood the importance of profiling himself as the advocate of the lower and middle classes in the u.s. , who are reeling from the enron scandal and the latest tax cuts by the government and do n't have much to laugh about under bush . "
norway ’ s conservative aftenposten observed that john kerry seems to have the tail wind behind him , judging by his success so far in the primary elections .
" however , kerry must master a difficult balancing act with regard to wooing voters and keeping the ones who support him already , " the paper warned .
" the key is the level of criticism kerry may use against the other candidates , which if too personal and petty , could repel voters , " the daily wrote .
germany ’ s conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung admired the activist zeal the democrats have shown in recent months .
" they ’ re positively burning with the desire to get george bush out of the white house with a fury that is strategically focussed , " the paper wrote .
but it added , " the democrats are seeking the most electable candidate which will be quite a challenge in a country that is so deeply divided . "
italian daily la repubblica reflected that it ’ s still a long way off till the u.s. presidential election and the fortunes of the democrats could rise and fall by then .
" this long journey to the american presidential polls is marked by tides that rise and devour candidates and their hopes everyday .
today they appear to let bush sink and let his two opponents rise , the nth ‘ new kennedy ’ , senator john forbes kerry and right after him the ‘ new clinton ’ , southerner john edwards .
the winds of optimism are allowing the hopes of the democrats to take off right now . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback do you think kerry can beat bush ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.02.2004 opinion : the only verdict possible großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutors were unable to prove mzoudi 's guilt .
the roller-coaster course of the five-month trial against abdelghani mzoudi left judges no choice but to acquit him , deutsche welle 's peter phillip writes in a commentary on thursday 's verdict . moroccan abdelghani mzoudi would have had to be extremely unlucky to be convicted of abetting the sept .
11 attacks in the united states .
germany ’ s federal prosecutors had charged him with exactly that and blamed the student for playing a role in the deaths of 3,066 people .
but the hamburg judges were n't convinced and they came back with the only verdict that seemed possible after the trial ’ s somewhat haphazard course : an acquittal . the trial became unfocused because politics and the legal system kept clashing .
supporting the fight against terrorism wholeheartedly is certainly backed by germans across the political spectrum , but this consensus starts crumbling as soon as this support requires blindly following the u.s. ’ s leadership .
especially if such allegiance requires throwing out the founding principles of the constitutional state . a hastened search for terrorists since the perpetrators of the sept .
11 attacks had stayed in germany as inconspicuous “ sleepers ” before the attacks , it was only natural that the german authorities would investigate their surroundings and search for accomplices to put them on trial .
one escaped – ramzi binalshibh – another , mounir al motassadeq , has been sentenced to 15 years in prison . whether this verdict will hold up is more than questionable after mzoudi ’ s acquittal .
real proof for motassadeq ’ s guilt does not exist .

the roller-coaster course of the five-month trial against abdelghani mzoudi left judges no choice but to acquit him , deutsche welle 's peter phillip writes in a commentary on thursday 's verdict . moroccan abdelghani mzoudi would have had to be extremely unlucky to be convicted of abetting the sept .

supporting the fight against terrorism wholeheartedly is certainly backed by germans across the political spectrum , but this consensus starts crumbling as soon as this support requires blindly following the u.s. ’ s leadership .
especially if such allegiance requires throwing out the founding principles of the constitutional state . a hastened search for terrorists since the perpetrators of the sept .
11 attacks had stayed in germany as inconspicuous “ sleepers ” before the attacks , it was only natural that the german authorities would investigate their surroundings and search for accomplices to put them on trial .
one escaped – ramzi binalshibh – another , mounir al motassadeq , has been sentenced to 15 years in prison . whether this verdict will hold up is more than questionable after mzoudi ’ s acquittal .

what ’ s even more significant , much that normally would not have been accepted by a court seems to have been tolerated out of consideration for washington : the u.s. didn ’ t offer any legal assistance ; they didn ’ t allow interrogations of binalshibh or other incarcerated suspects and instead simply handed the german authorities quotes from their own interrogations , according to the sink-or-swim principle . prosecutors ridicule themselves the judge was already so annoyed by this in december that he released mzoudi from jail .
prosecutors didn ’ t like this at all and were led to ridicule themselves : one day before the verdict was supposed to be announced , they tried to turn the trial in a different direction by conjuring up an alleged witness .
the same happened again on thursday : hours before the verdict , supposedly new evidence was offered to the court . the judges stayed their course , as that ’ s no way to convict someone .
obviously this doesn ’ t say anything about mzoudi ’ s guilt or innocence , nor does it guarantee him a life in freedom .
he could be deported to his homeland , where he is likely to be arrested or even extradited to the united states . peter phillip send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .
11 terror suspect acquitted a hamburg court on thursday acquitted a moroccan charged with helping to prepare the sept .
11 attacks .
german officials have already said they plan to deport abdelghani mzoudi to his home country .

hardly .
the four men are members of the cologne police force , and they are committed to encouraging moral courage in local youth .
along the way , they are changing the way young people think about the cops .
they call themselves p.i.4 — an abbreviation for police inspection four .
the 25- to 30-year-old policemen shake their hips and raise their arms in sync with the beat while dressed in their standard issue , green police uniforms .

it 's a creative way of dealing with youth violence that brings young people into contact with authority figures who they often look upon with distrust .
faced with rising crime and a lack of resources in the german metropolis , many cologne police officers have come to the conclusion that prevention is the best answer to youth violence . three years ago , four such policemen formed a band of their own , and set out to transmit a positive message that might help stop the violent brawls which have become a daily feature of the officers ' work . today their lyrics can be heard at live performances across the city — in youth homes , at football games , demonstrations and concerts : " is it really so bad , things on a new path , bringing people together who were n't together before / it 's not about this crew winning a battle or having their single on the number one charts ... " the young civil servants take their mission seriously , which is one reason why hip hopper mr. man q.x. , also known as philip schwieren lent the dancing police officers his voice .
with schwieren 's help , the band has gone from corny wannabees to respectable hip hoppers . according to schwieren , the opportunity to work closely with the police has changed his opinion about them : " before , you 'd see a police car and a police officer and first you 'd think skeptically , ' what do they want from me , did i do something ? '
since then , i 've realized that you can talk with them like normal people , you can talk about whatever and it does n't have to be so hostile or against each other , " said schwieren . building bridges and trust still , dancing policemen on stage is an unusual sight , and the police officers do n't always have it easy with critical spectators , who wonder what the police are doing acting like rap stars .
but the police officers turned rappers see it differently , as they express in their lyrics " i tell you , hip hop has a job , hip hop has a job , a job , what 's hip hop got , hip hop has a job . "
indeed , for the officers , hip hop 's task is building bridges and trust .
their motto is , " look , act , call for help " against violence . andrea löhr , band member and police officer says the group gives their free time and energy to practicing their act in hopes it will have some positive effect on the communities they serve .
it 's not a professional act , but they give it their best shot , says löhr . " there is a large conference room at the station where we meet .
there are speakers in the room and we put the music on and we try and see how we can do it .
we also had some professional help , a choreographer who helped us , and some things we have tried out ourselves . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking the part the choreography is n't perfect and the police are only able to practice outside of work hours .
and whether or not their message has helped prevent violence may be difficult to measure .
however , members of p.i.4 say what matters is coming into contact with young people and encouraging positive attitudes about life such as in one of their four original songs : " i love life , i want to give it away and protect it , i have so much hope , maybe somebody could use some . " going beyond hip hop at a recent p.i.4 performance , there were mixed reviews for the police officers , but most young people seemed to appreciate the officers ' attempt at developing a relationship with young people on young people 's turf .
those skeptics who turn up for the concerts often come away surprised .
" i personally do n't find it so bad , i liked the lyrics and that they 're performing here , i think it 's actually a nice idea , " said one spectator .
and another young listener agreed , " i think you have to find a way to get closer to the public and i do n't have a problem with it at all . " still , some say hip hop just is n't the place for a policeman — particularly because of the often negative associations found in hip hop music when it comes to the police authorities .
one concert go-er commented that " hip hop is n't the right choice of music for them , because they are n't going to find a lot of sympathizers among hip-hoppers , i just ca n't imagine that . " but band leader michael mannheim says hip hop is just the beginning .
" we are n't fixed to hip-hop , " he said . " we worked well with our rapper and if tomorrow i find another singer with current music — be it rock , pop or soul , then we 'll do that too .
the only requirements are that it 's german music and that it has the right message . " although some critics suggest that it is n't the role of upstanding police officers to get up on stage and perform hip hop tunes , the foursome insists their message is worth it : " i wish you a voice , when you 're lying on the ground , when you are afraid and you ca n't get anymore air , yeah , yeah ...

the court decided that life-long preventative detention in extreme cases like child molesters and murderers was constitutional and did not breach the right of human dignity or the right to freedom .
the ruling comes after a 46-year-old man convicted for theft and two attempted murders appealed after his ten year preventative detention expired .
the man has been imprisoned since he was 15 and only been released for a few months before being placed under preventative detention again .
the defendant 's lawyer condemned the ruling has been a back door way of keeping his client locked up .
currently there are more than 300 criminals locked away in preventative detention mostly for sex crimes . more briefs 05.02.2004 -pipe- nicholson and curtis win golden camera prize 05.02.2004 -pipe- head of germany 's federal police sacked 04.02.2004 -pipe- massive blaze damages historic dresden train station 04.02.2004 -pipe- police investigate torture at german school 04.02.2004 -pipe- jungle stars with eurovision dreams 04.02.2004 -pipe- maximum security terrorist court near düsseldorf hears first case 04.02.2004 -pipe- fischer criticizes israeli fence 03.02.2004 -pipe- fewer traffic accidents and suicides in germany radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the court decided that life-long preventative detention in extreme cases like child molesters and murderers was constitutional and did not breach the right of human dignity or the right to freedom .
the ruling comes after a 46-year-old man convicted for theft and two attempted murders appealed after his ten year preventative detention expired .
the man has been imprisoned since he was 15 and only been released for a few months before being placed under preventative detention again .
the defendant 's lawyer condemned the ruling has been a back door way of keeping his client locked up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.02.2004 nato defense chiefs return to munich großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld and joschka fischer got hot under the collar last year in munich .
nato defense chiefs will meet in munich this weekend to discuss the alliance 's role in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere .
the hope is that the meeting will be more cordial than last year . nato defense and foreign ministers will gather in munich on friday to discuss the lingering fallout from the iraq war and the future direction of the alliance .
it will be the 40th annual meeting for the german security conference . the big names of the defense world , an estimated 250 officials including pentagon chief donald rumsfeld are due to attend , will use the informal get-together to address transatlantic relations , the future of nato , and current developments in the middle east . they will also likely to take the opportunity to discuss extending the alliance 's role in afghanistan while in the bavarian capital , according to diplomats in brussels . iraq situation will again dominate agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the main focus will undoubtedly be the situation in iraq , even more so now inquiries have been launched into intelligence failures in the united states and britain regarding the lack of evidence in the search for weapons of mass destruction a year after the war began . the u.s. delegation is also likely to continue with its pressure to get nato to play a role in iraq as part of washington ’ s current initiative to solicit wider contributions from its member states . last year 's munich conference was a highly tense affair with officials from washington , paris and berlin on edge as a un security council vote on a new iraq resolution loomed ominously near .
rumsfeld and german foreign minister joschka fischer famously clashed at the event and will meet again on friday with hopefully less static in the air between them . security conference host horst teltschik told reporters in munich that some reconciliation is likely .
" i get the impression that the americans want to give us a sign that they are prepared to talk so that both sides can get back to a ' normal ' relationship . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish soldiers in the ancient city of babylon , 80 kilometers south of baghdad , iraq .
new nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer said last week that the alliance , which is supporting the polish-led division in iraq , is ready and able to do the job .
" if the question comes , it goes without saying that i 'm very much in favour of a nato role , " he told journalists , before adding : " it 's too early to say exactly what that role will be . " despite making favourable noises in the direction of the united states in the form of low-key discussions , most nato officials remain resolute that no action will be taken before sovereignty is transferred from the u.s.-appointed interim leadership to the iraqis , a move that has been pencilled in for june . isaf 's afghan mission to be addressed the defense ministers will also consider the success of its continuing mission in afghanistan .
when the alliance took over command last august of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- it was nato 's first mission outside europe .
since then , the command of the mission , which has until now been centered on the capital kabul , has been rotated between member countries , with canada currently in control . nato wants to extend isaf 's operations beyond the capital kabul , notably using german troops , but it is having trouble with resources .
" i think that there is political will , but translating it into terms of concrete forces on the ground is more difficult and that is our challenge " said britain 's ambassador to nato peter ricketts in a press conference in brussels this week . eurocorps ready to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurocorps in mülheim , germany .
the landscape of nato ’ s role in afghanistan is likely to change further after officials announced on wednesday that the five-nation eurocorps army is ready to take the lead in the afghan peacekeeping mission later this year .
the eurocorps was recognized in 2002 as a nato high readiness force and has already carried out peacekeeping duties in kosovo and bosnia . with plans to be released and confirmed in the coming days , the 60,000-strong force - made up of troops from germany , france , spain , belgium and luxembourg - would more than likely be ready to assume control of the kabul-based mission by the summer .
it was not immediately clear how many of its soldiers would leave for afghanistan , as part of the 5,500-strong isaf . ministers from the five eurocorps nations are scheduled to meet on the margins of the munich meeting to discuss taking on the headquarters role . washington calls for nato engagement in mid-east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the middle east situation is also on the agenda .
elsewhere at the munich conference , officials will analyze the possibilities of nato involvement in the middle east - a topic that could both provide grounds for transatlantic consensus but may also be a source of further tensions . the united states is eager for nato to engage in the middle east to help build regional stability , and around six middle east and northern african nations , including israel and egypt , are being invited to the alliance summit in istanbul in june . observers expect lively discussion to be generated by the attendance of several middle east delegations in munich , discussions on developments in iran , israel 's " security fence " in and around the west bank and its decision to dismantle some jewish settlements . the fireworks may not be solely reserved for the conference either .
protests are expected and around 21 rallies have been planned before the meeting finishes on sunday with some 4,000 police being mobilized in munich .
the united states are so concerned that the protests may turn violent that washington has urged u.s. citizens around munich to be vigilant for possible unrest . dw staff -lrb- na -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de munich conference opens with sharp differences over iraq both u.s. defense secretary rumsfeld and german foreign minister fischer delivered strongly-worded speeches in which they staked out their positions and crossed verbal swords over the pressing issue of iraq in munich .

british prime minister tony blair has said he might join an increasing number of eu countries that want to initially bar low-cost workers from new european union countries from working in the west . while the expansion of the eu by ten member states in may this year is seen by many as a historical milestone , it has also raised fears of mass migration of labor from the poorer , mostly ex-communist new members to the more affluent west .
eu skeptics say a large influx of low-wage workers would prove devastating to current members of the bloc , who are already facing stubbornly high unemployment rates .
prime minister tony blair told parliament on wednesday that he was re-evaluating his earlier stance on the issue , and might advocate imposing immigration controls and welfare benefit restrictions on immigrants from the 10 new countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair “ it is important that we recognize that there is a potential risk from these accession countries , ” blair -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliament .
“ we will take whatever measures are necessary to make sure that the ‘ pull factor ’ which might draw people here is closed off . ”
the draw , he said , could be britain ’ s welfare benefit system , and it would be re-examined to determined whether it was “ too generous . ”
change of heart britain ’ s new jumpiness about eastern migration comes in the wake of sweden ’ s decision last week to impose limits on workers from the new eu countries .
the netherlands also said recently it would impose a limit on the number of immigrant workers it would accept .
norway , though not an eu member but with close ties to the bloc , said on thursday it is also exploring possible restrictions , although it has previously stated its borders would be open to new eu citizens .
“ we now see that some of our neighboring countries , and now sweden , state that they will have some exceptions for some years , for an interim period , ” prime minister kjell magne bondevik told reporters on thursday after talks with european commission president romano prodi .
“ so we also now … intend to make a proposal for parliament about some possible exceptions for an interim period so we are more in line with our neighboring countries . ” for two years after enlargement , labor market access with depend on national policies , and not be dictated by brussels .
according to the european commission , only about half the 15 member states have told the eu about their plans .
austria , finland , belgium , france and denmark are planning limits , in some cases for up to seven years .
only ireland and spain have said they will keep their borders open .
germany , with its high unemployment and generous welfare system , insisted in 2002 during entry negotiations for the new candidate countries on a clause that would allow it to impose restrictions to its market for citizens from central and eastern europe until 2011 .

british prime minister tony blair has said he might join an increasing number of eu countries that want to initially bar low-cost workers from new european union countries from working in the west . while the expansion of the eu by ten member states in may this year is seen by many as a historical milestone , it has also raised fears of mass migration of labor from the poorer , mostly ex-communist new members to the more affluent west .
eu skeptics say a large influx of low-wage workers would prove devastating to current members of the bloc , who are already facing stubbornly high unemployment rates .
prime minister tony blair told parliament on wednesday that he was re-evaluating his earlier stance on the issue , and might advocate imposing immigration controls and welfare benefit restrictions on immigrants from the 10 new countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair “ it is important that we recognize that there is a potential risk from these accession countries , ” blair -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliament .
“ we will take whatever measures are necessary to make sure that the ‘ pull factor ’ which might draw people here is closed off . ”
the draw , he said , could be britain ’ s welfare benefit system , and it would be re-examined to determined whether it was “ too generous . ”
change of heart britain ’ s new jumpiness about eastern migration comes in the wake of sweden ’ s decision last week to impose limits on workers from the new eu countries .
the netherlands also said recently it would impose a limit on the number of immigrant workers it would accept .
norway , though not an eu member but with close ties to the bloc , said on thursday it is also exploring possible restrictions , although it has previously stated its borders would be open to new eu citizens .
“ we now see that some of our neighboring countries , and now sweden , state that they will have some exceptions for some years , for an interim period , ” prime minister kjell magne bondevik told reporters on thursday after talks with european commission president romano prodi .
“ so we also now … intend to make a proposal for parliament about some possible exceptions for an interim period so we are more in line with our neighboring countries . ” for two years after enlargement , labor market access with depend on national policies , and not be dictated by brussels .
according to the european commission , only about half the 15 member states have told the eu about their plans .
austria , finland , belgium , france and denmark are planning limits , in some cases for up to seven years .
only ireland and spain have said they will keep their borders open .
germany , with its high unemployment and generous welfare system , insisted in 2002 during entry negotiations for the new candidate countries on a clause that would allow it to impose restrictions to its market for citizens from central and eastern europe until 2011 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair “ it is important that we recognize that there is a potential risk from these accession countries , ” blair -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliament .
“ we will take whatever measures are necessary to make sure that the ‘ pull factor ’ which might draw people here is closed off . ”
the draw , he said , could be britain ’ s welfare benefit system , and it would be re-examined to determined whether it was “ too generous . ”
change of heart britain ’ s new jumpiness about eastern migration comes in the wake of sweden ’ s decision last week to impose limits on workers from the new eu countries .
the netherlands also said recently it would impose a limit on the number of immigrant workers it would accept .
norway , though not an eu member but with close ties to the bloc , said on thursday it is also exploring possible restrictions , although it has previously stated its borders would be open to new eu citizens .
“ we now see that some of our neighboring countries , and now sweden , state that they will have some exceptions for some years , for an interim period , ” prime minister kjell magne bondevik told reporters on thursday after talks with european commission president romano prodi .
“ so we also now … intend to make a proposal for parliament about some possible exceptions for an interim period so we are more in line with our neighboring countries . ” for two years after enlargement , labor market access with depend on national policies , and not be dictated by brussels .
according to the european commission , only about half the 15 member states have told the eu about their plans .
austria , finland , belgium , france and denmark are planning limits , in some cases for up to seven years .
only ireland and spain have said they will keep their borders open .
germany , with its high unemployment and generous welfare system , insisted in 2002 during entry negotiations for the new candidate countries on a clause that would allow it to impose restrictions to its market for citizens from central and eastern europe until 2011 .
second-class citizens ?
malta , cyprus , estonia , latvia , lithuania , hungary , poland , slovakia , slovenia and the czech republic will become official members of the eu in may of this year . in the past months , tension between current and future members of the eu has increased on a number of issues .
the about-turns on work policy are likely to deepen the fear among many in the accession countries that they will be treated as second-class european citizens .
“ the thinking that we need long transition periods 14 years after the fall of the berlin wall shows a lack of solidarity , ” jan figiel , slovakia ’ s candidate for the european commission , told reuters .
the new members point to one of the fundaments of the eu project — free movement of persons including the right to live and work in another member state .
but as the eu prepares to take in 75 million new people , mostly from countries formerly part of the soviet bloc where wages were lower , fears have been growing of an influx of labor in search of a better standard of living .
the unease has been especially strong in germany , which , since 1990 , has attracted about 75 percent of the migrants to the eu from application countries .
unfounded fears experts , however , note that history teaches that such fears have generally been without foundation .
in previous eu enlargement periods , such as greece in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 , transitional measures such as labor restrictions were put into place , largely unnecessarily .
other alarms about east-west migration have proven false .
one example is a 1989 study by the u.n. high commission for refugees which estimated that 25 million people from the eastern europe would move to the west in the 1990s .

the french-german pharmaceutical company aventis announced growing profits for 2003 in an effort to ward off a hostile takeover bid from a smaller french drug firm . aventis reported that net profits for 2003 had increased by 17.5 percent to € 2.44 billion -lrb- $ 3.07 billion -rrb- .
earnings per share had also risen by 18.6 percent although a weakening dollar had led to a 4.5 percent drop in sales .
aventis chief executive igor landau presented the 2003 profits at a press conference in london to make the case that the company is strong enough to stand on its own and can reject a € 48 billion -lrb- $ 60.4 billion -rrb- hostile takeover bid from the french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthélabo .
" today 's announcement highlights how sanofi 's offer fundamentally undervalues aventis , " said landau .
" their hostile bid is a cheap attempt to transfer their risks to our shareholders , " he added .
landau had previously hinted that there were other drug firms that would make better partners for aventis , suggesting that sanofi was using the hostile bid to avoid becoming a target of a takeover itself – a fact not disputed by sanofi 's executive board .
" they need us , but we do n't need them , ” said landau last week .
merger to create european drug giant sanofi-synthélabo made the grab for aventis on monday offering five of its shares and € 69 for every six aventis shares .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquarters of french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo sa in paris .
dealers and analysts said the franco-german company 's concerted attempt to fend off sanofi 's bid would ultimately fail , but aventis would force its french rival to increase its offer by at least 15 percent .
sanofi is pushing for the creation of a new european drug giant which would have a stronger combined presence on the lucrative u.s. market .
aventis pointed out on thursday that it already has a strong presence there ; 38 percent of its core sales are made in the us .
a merger with sanofi would create the third largest pharmaceutical company in terms of global sales behind the u.s. giant pfizer inc. and the british firm glaxosmithkline plc .
with a combined net worth of € 16.6 billion , aventis currently ranks as the sixth largest pharmaceutical company in the world .
the other well known german chemical firm , bayer , comes in at place 18 with a combined net worth of € 4.3 billion .
france enthusiastic , germany worried about job losses the french government is said to be enthusiastic about the takeover bid which would create a pharmaceutical giant based in paris .
germany is less excited about the prospect .
federal economics minister wolfgang clement warned last week that a merger could result in job losses in germany if the company moves its focus to paris .
" the german government has a strong interest in strengthening aventis ' position in germany rather than weakening it , " he said .
a combination of sanofi 's 70,000 strong workforce with aventis ' 69,000 employees could result in as many as 10,000 job cuts in both germany and france .
trade unions have said the number of lost jobs could be closer to 25,000 .
aventis now employs some 9,000 german workers who loyally support their chief executive igor landau .
michael klippel the head of the works committee at aventis said , " we are confident because we believe he will fight .
he is not one of these managers who will sell out for a few marks . "
analysts say the takeover battle is extremely personal for the 59 year old igor landau .
he was instrumental in the merger of the french drug firm rhône-poulenc , where he had been an executive for many years , with one of germany 's largest pharmaceutical companies , hoechst .
the deal was the pinnacle of three decades of work and landau shed the firm 's chemical and agricultural operation to focus solely on drugs .
hostile takeovers rare in europe the battle being played out in london between aventis and sanofi is unusual for europe , where hostile takeover attempts are extremely rare .
while experts do n't expect there to be an increase in hostile bids , they do believe friendly mergers , like the one that created aventis , will continue .
according to some experts , smaller pharmaceuticals in europe soon wo n't be able to keep up with the giants .
professor klaus pohle sits on the board of directors of lion bioscience ag , a german software provider for drug companies .
he said german drug companies have lost their title as " chemists of the world " because of a research policy burdened with too much bureaucracy that serves to stifles innovation .
research and development vital to drug firms surviving the research , development and release of a new drug onto the market takes approximately 12 years .
then it takes another six to nine years before substantial profits are made .
pohle said the larger the pharmaceutical company , the more money and time it can invest in new projects and the less money is lost when a project fails .
experts say even if sanofi 's offer transforms itself into a friendly one , landau , like many chief executives whose company has been targeted by a hostile buyer , is unlikely to gain control of the new company .
if the sanofi bid fails , the smaller french firm is likely to be next in line for a hostile takeover bid .
aventis shares on thursday were up 0.7 percent after comfortably beating forecast profits , while suitor sanofi-synthélabo stayed at 2.8 percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis moves to prevent hostile takeover french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo wants to acquire the franco-german drug-maker aventis in a hostile takeover .
if the € 50 billion merger is successful , it would create the world 's third-largest pharmaceuticals firm .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquarters of french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo sa in paris .
dealers and analysts said the franco-german company 's concerted attempt to fend off sanofi 's bid would ultimately fail , but aventis would force its french rival to increase its offer by at least 15 percent .
sanofi is pushing for the creation of a new european drug giant which would have a stronger combined presence on the lucrative u.s. market .
aventis pointed out on thursday that it already has a strong presence there ; 38 percent of its core sales are made in the us .
a merger with sanofi would create the third largest pharmaceutical company in terms of global sales behind the u.s. giant pfizer inc. and the british firm glaxosmithkline plc .
with a combined net worth of € 16.6 billion , aventis currently ranks as the sixth largest pharmaceutical company in the world .
the other well known german chemical firm , bayer , comes in at place 18 with a combined net worth of € 4.3 billion .
france enthusiastic , germany worried about job losses the french government is said to be enthusiastic about the takeover bid which would create a pharmaceutical giant based in paris .
germany is less excited about the prospect .
federal economics minister wolfgang clement warned last week that a merger could result in job losses in germany if the company moves its focus to paris .
" the german government has a strong interest in strengthening aventis ' position in germany rather than weakening it , " he said .
a combination of sanofi 's 70,000 strong workforce with aventis ' 69,000 employees could result in as many as 10,000 job cuts in both germany and france .
trade unions have said the number of lost jobs could be closer to 25,000 .
aventis now employs some 9,000 german workers who loyally support their chief executive igor landau .
michael klippel the head of the works committee at aventis said , " we are confident because we believe he will fight .
he is not one of these managers who will sell out for a few marks . "
analysts say the takeover battle is extremely personal for the 59 year old igor landau .
he was instrumental in the merger of the french drug firm rhône-poulenc , where he had been an executive for many years , with one of germany 's largest pharmaceutical companies , hoechst .
the deal was the pinnacle of three decades of work and landau shed the firm 's chemical and agricultural operation to focus solely on drugs .
hostile takeovers rare in europe the battle being played out in london between aventis and sanofi is unusual for europe , where hostile takeover attempts are extremely rare .
while experts do n't expect there to be an increase in hostile bids , they do believe friendly mergers , like the one that created aventis , will continue .
according to some experts , smaller pharmaceuticals in europe soon wo n't be able to keep up with the giants .
professor klaus pohle sits on the board of directors of lion bioscience ag , a german software provider for drug companies .
he said german drug companies have lost their title as " chemists of the world " because of a research policy burdened with too much bureaucracy that serves to stifles innovation .
research and development vital to drug firms surviving the research , development and release of a new drug onto the market takes approximately 12 years .
then it takes another six to nine years before substantial profits are made .
pohle said the larger the pharmaceutical company , the more money and time it can invest in new projects and the less money is lost when a project fails .
experts say even if sanofi 's offer transforms itself into a friendly one , landau , like many chief executives whose company has been targeted by a hostile buyer , is unlikely to gain control of the new company .
if the sanofi bid fails , the smaller french firm is likely to be next in line for a hostile takeover bid .
aventis shares on thursday were up 0.7 percent after comfortably beating forecast profits , while suitor sanofi-synthélabo stayed at 2.8 percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis moves to prevent hostile takeover french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo wants to acquire the franco-german drug-maker aventis in a hostile takeover .
if the € 50 billion merger is successful , it would create the world 's third-largest pharmaceuticals firm .

“ it 's been one of the best years ever for cinema in germany , ” said dieter kosslick , the festival ’ s director who has turned the berlinale into a showcase for german productions and has helped it secure its place behind cannes and alongside venice as one of europe 's three most important film festivals .

“ german films are now reaching audiences with good stories . ”
“ film makers are concentrating on viewers more and not focused on their own self-realization .

the successes of films such as “ good bye , lenin ” - the comedy about a son who conceals the fall of the berlin wall from his ailing mother , and the world war ii drama “ rosenstrasse " , has helped the domestic market share climb to about 15 percent in 2003 from around 11 percent the year before .

“ good bye , lenin , ” which won six european film awards in december , topped germany 's box office last year with over 6.5 million people turning out to see the film , generating nearly € 31.9 million -lrb- $ 40 million -rrb- .
“ the miracle of bern ” , a film about west germany 's 1954 world cup winning soccer team , and the biopic “ luther ” also scored with audiences inside and outside germany , and film makers are hopeful the festival will herald another big year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.02.2004 aventis posts profits to ward off hostile takeover bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aventis says it can stand on its own .
the french-german pharmaceutical company aventis announced growing profits for 2003 in an effort to ward off a hostile takeover bid from a smaller french drug firm . aventis reported that net profits for 2003 had increased by 17.5 percent to € 2.44 billion -lrb- $ 3.07 billion -rrb- .
earnings per share had also risen by 18.6 percent although a weakening dollar had led to a 4.5 percent drop in sales .
aventis chief executive igor landau presented the 2003 profits at a press conference in london to make the case that the company is strong enough to stand on its own and can reject a € 48 billion -lrb- $ 60.4 billion -rrb- hostile takeover bid from the french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthélabo .
" today 's announcement highlights how sanofi 's offer fundamentally undervalues aventis , " said landau .
" their hostile bid is a cheap attempt to transfer their risks to our shareholders , " he added .
landau had previously hinted that there were other drug firms that would make better partners for aventis , suggesting that sanofi was using the hostile bid to avoid becoming a target of a takeover itself – a fact not disputed by sanofi 's executive board .
" they need us , but we do n't need them , ” said landau last week .
merger to create european drug giant sanofi-synthélabo made the grab for aventis on monday offering five of its shares and € 69 for every six aventis shares .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquarters of french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo sa in paris .
dealers and analysts said the franco-german company 's concerted attempt to fend off sanofi 's bid would ultimately fail , but aventis would force its french rival to increase its offer by at least 15 percent .
sanofi is pushing for the creation of a new european drug giant which would have a stronger combined presence on the lucrative u.s. market .
aventis pointed out on thursday that it already has a strong presence there ; 38 percent of its core sales are made in the us .
a merger with sanofi would create the third largest pharmaceutical company in terms of global sales behind the u.s. giant pfizer inc. and the british firm glaxosmithkline plc .
with a combined net worth of € 16.6 billion , aventis currently ranks as the sixth largest pharmaceutical company in the world .
the other well known german chemical firm , bayer , comes in at place 18 with a combined net worth of € 4.3 billion .
france enthusiastic , germany worried about job losses the french government is said to be enthusiastic about the takeover bid which would create a pharmaceutical giant based in paris .
germany is less excited about the prospect .
federal economics minister wolfgang clement warned last week that a merger could result in job losses in germany if the company moves its focus to paris .
" the german government has a strong interest in strengthening aventis ' position in germany rather than weakening it , " he said .
a combination of sanofi 's 70,000 strong workforce with aventis ' 69,000 employees could result in as many as 10,000 job cuts in both germany and france .
trade unions have said the number of lost jobs could be closer to 25,000 .
aventis now employs some 9,000 german workers who loyally support their chief executive igor landau .
michael klippel the head of the works committee at aventis said , " we are confident because we believe he will fight .
he is not one of these managers who will sell out for a few marks . "
analysts say the takeover battle is extremely personal for the 59 year old igor landau .
he was instrumental in the merger of the french drug firm rhône-poulenc , where he had been an executive for many years , with one of germany 's largest pharmaceutical companies , hoechst .
the deal was the pinnacle of three decades of work and landau shed the firm 's chemical and agricultural operation to focus solely on drugs .
hostile takeovers rare in europe the battle being played out in london between aventis and sanofi is unusual for europe , where hostile takeover attempts are extremely rare .
while experts do n't expect there to be an increase in hostile bids , they do believe friendly mergers , like the one that created aventis , will continue .
according to some experts , smaller pharmaceuticals in europe soon wo n't be able to keep up with the giants .
professor klaus pohle sits on the board of directors of lion bioscience ag , a german software provider for drug companies .
he said german drug companies have lost their title as " chemists of the world " because of a research policy burdened with too much bureaucracy that serves to stifles innovation .
research and development vital to drug firms surviving the research , development and release of a new drug onto the market takes approximately 12 years .
then it takes another six to nine years before substantial profits are made .
pohle said the larger the pharmaceutical company , the more money and time it can invest in new projects and the less money is lost when a project fails .
experts say even if sanofi 's offer transforms itself into a friendly one , landau , like many chief executives whose company has been targeted by a hostile buyer , is unlikely to gain control of the new company .
if the sanofi bid fails , the smaller french firm is likely to be next in line for a hostile takeover bid .
aventis shares on thursday were up 0.7 percent after comfortably beating forecast profits , while suitor sanofi-synthélabo stayed at 2.8 percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis moves to prevent hostile takeover french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo wants to acquire the franco-german drug-maker aventis in a hostile takeover .
if the € 50 billion merger is successful , it would create the world 's third-largest pharmaceuticals firm .

the french-german pharmaceutical company aventis announced growing profits for 2003 in an effort to ward off a hostile takeover bid from a smaller french drug firm . aventis reported that net profits for 2003 had increased by 17.5 percent to € 2.44 billion -lrb- $ 3.07 billion -rrb- .
earnings per share had also risen by 18.6 percent although a weakening dollar had led to a 4.5 percent drop in sales .
aventis chief executive igor landau presented the 2003 profits at a press conference in london to make the case that the company is strong enough to stand on its own and can reject a € 48 billion -lrb- $ 60.4 billion -rrb- hostile takeover bid from the french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthélabo .
" today 's announcement highlights how sanofi 's offer fundamentally undervalues aventis , " said landau .
" their hostile bid is a cheap attempt to transfer their risks to our shareholders , " he added .
landau had previously hinted that there were other drug firms that would make better partners for aventis , suggesting that sanofi was using the hostile bid to avoid becoming a target of a takeover itself – a fact not disputed by sanofi 's executive board .
" they need us , but we do n't need them , ” said landau last week .
merger to create european drug giant sanofi-synthélabo made the grab for aventis on monday offering five of its shares and € 69 for every six aventis shares .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquarters of french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo sa in paris .
dealers and analysts said the franco-german company 's concerted attempt to fend off sanofi 's bid would ultimately fail , but aventis would force its french rival to increase its offer by at least 15 percent .
sanofi is pushing for the creation of a new european drug giant which would have a stronger combined presence on the lucrative u.s. market .
aventis pointed out on thursday that it already has a strong presence there ; 38 percent of its core sales are made in the us .
a merger with sanofi would create the third largest pharmaceutical company in terms of global sales behind the u.s. giant pfizer inc. and the british firm glaxosmithkline plc .
with a combined net worth of € 16.6 billion , aventis currently ranks as the sixth largest pharmaceutical company in the world .
the other well known german chemical firm , bayer , comes in at place 18 with a combined net worth of € 4.3 billion .
france enthusiastic , germany worried about job losses the french government is said to be enthusiastic about the takeover bid which would create a pharmaceutical giant based in paris .
germany is less excited about the prospect .
federal economics minister wolfgang clement warned last week that a merger could result in job losses in germany if the company moves its focus to paris .
" the german government has a strong interest in strengthening aventis ' position in germany rather than weakening it , " he said .
a combination of sanofi 's 70,000 strong workforce with aventis ' 69,000 employees could result in as many as 10,000 job cuts in both germany and france .
trade unions have said the number of lost jobs could be closer to 25,000 .
aventis now employs some 9,000 german workers who loyally support their chief executive igor landau .
michael klippel the head of the works committee at aventis said , " we are confident because we believe he will fight .
he is not one of these managers who will sell out for a few marks . "
analysts say the takeover battle is extremely personal for the 59 year old igor landau .
he was instrumental in the merger of the french drug firm rhône-poulenc , where he had been an executive for many years , with one of germany 's largest pharmaceutical companies , hoechst .
the deal was the pinnacle of three decades of work and landau shed the firm 's chemical and agricultural operation to focus solely on drugs .
hostile takeovers rare in europe the battle being played out in london between aventis and sanofi is unusual for europe , where hostile takeover attempts are extremely rare .
while experts do n't expect there to be an increase in hostile bids , they do believe friendly mergers , like the one that created aventis , will continue .
according to some experts , smaller pharmaceuticals in europe soon wo n't be able to keep up with the giants .
professor klaus pohle sits on the board of directors of lion bioscience ag , a german software provider for drug companies .
he said german drug companies have lost their title as " chemists of the world " because of a research policy burdened with too much bureaucracy that serves to stifles innovation .
research and development vital to drug firms surviving the research , development and release of a new drug onto the market takes approximately 12 years .
then it takes another six to nine years before substantial profits are made .
pohle said the larger the pharmaceutical company , the more money and time it can invest in new projects and the less money is lost when a project fails .
experts say even if sanofi 's offer transforms itself into a friendly one , landau , like many chief executives whose company has been targeted by a hostile buyer , is unlikely to gain control of the new company .
if the sanofi bid fails , the smaller french firm is likely to be next in line for a hostile takeover bid .
aventis shares on thursday were up 0.7 percent after comfortably beating forecast profits , while suitor sanofi-synthélabo stayed at 2.8 percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis moves to prevent hostile takeover french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo wants to acquire the franco-german drug-maker aventis in a hostile takeover .
if the € 50 billion merger is successful , it would create the world 's third-largest pharmaceuticals firm .

european papers on thursday focused on u.s. democratic presidential front-runner john kerry ’ s success on the campaign trail .
most warned kerry had his work cut out if he was to dislodge bush from the white house . u.s. presidential candidate john kerry won five of seven democratic primaries on tuesday .
dutch left-leaning paper volkskrant wrote that kerry ’ s success was based on the fact that " he ’ s trusted and seen as capable of being elected by many " as well as on his prestige that he built up as a vietnam veteran and during his long stint in the u.s. senate .
" but so far his election campaign has seldom witnessed sweeping enthusiasm .
one is still waiting for a political message that can stir american voters to entrust the highest post in the country to an acting senator for the first time since the days of john f. kennedy , " the daily concluded .
" can john kerry chase george w. bush out of the white house ? "
french daily liberation asked and added that the question had taken on new urgency since kerry appeared to have good chances of being pitched as the democrats ’ presidential candidate .
the paper mused that if the voters had already made kerry a favorite or planned to do so , it was because they are convinced that he can be elected .
" in paris kerry has already been declared as the most likely democratic presidential hopeful , " it wrote .
" but to defeat an acting president , even a beleaguered one , the candidate must have outstanding qualities and the circumstances need to be exceptional , " the broadsheet cautioned .
the independent in london said if there is one lesson to be drawn from past american president campaigns , it is that favorites whether for nominations or for the white house become the target of brickbats as soon as they are identified .
the paper expected the other democrat hopefuls to turn their fire on the front-runner .
" kerry has proved his appeal to voters in the north , east , center and southwest of the country , he has attracted all classes , white americans and hispanics . "
but the daily warned , " kerry must prepare himself for whatever the other candidates may dig up to use against him and dampen his voter appeal . "
belgian daily le soir was optimistic that kerry ’ s surging popularity had the potential to unseat president bush .
" everywhere the voter turnout has broken records , a sign for the mobilization of democrat followers to remove the president from the white house , " the paper wrote .
" but more than the surveys that show that john kerry and john edwards will defeat him , it ’ s this resoluteness that must be unnerving george bush because if affects states -lrb- missouri and arizona -rrb- that he -lrb- bush -rrb- won only narrowly in 2000 . "
" a democratic people , who are in unanimous agreement that george w. bush must go , are pinning their hopes on john kerry and to a lesser extent on john edwards .
but is john kerry really the man to execute that goal ? " asked zürich-based swiss daily tages-anzeiger .
the paper pointed out that though kerry had acquired the reputation of a solid and sound politician during his long years in the washington senate , he was definitely not a visionary .
the senator may possess the necessary stature , but his readiness to take on political risks still needs to be proven , the daily stressed .
liberal austrian daily der standard opined that john kerry had hit the right note in his election campaign .
" kerry has – just like his rival john edwards – always struck a mildly populist tone in his campaign and portrayed bush , not without reason , as the president of ‘ corporate america ’ , of the rich and the powerful , " it wrote .
the daily added that as the husband of a rich heiress who owns a billion-dollar ketchup company , kerry wasn ’ t exactly in danger of ending up on the streets anytime soon .
" but he -lrb- kerry -rrb- has still understood the importance of profiling himself as the advocate of the lower and middle classes in the u.s. , who are reeling from the enron scandal and the latest tax cuts by the government and do n't have much to laugh about under bush . "
norway ’ s conservative aftenposten observed that john kerry seems to have the tail wind behind him , judging by his success so far in the primary elections .
" however , kerry must master a difficult balancing act with regard to wooing voters and keeping the ones who support him already , " the paper warned .
" the key is the level of criticism kerry may use against the other candidates , which if too personal and petty , could repel voters , " the daily wrote .
germany ’ s conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung admired the activist zeal the democrats have shown in recent months .
" they ’ re positively burning with the desire to get george bush out of the white house with a fury that is strategically focussed , " the paper wrote .
but it added , " the democrats are seeking the most electable candidate which will be quite a challenge in a country that is so deeply divided . "
italian daily la repubblica reflected that it ’ s still a long way off till the u.s. presidential election and the fortunes of the democrats could rise and fall by then .
" this long journey to the american presidential polls is marked by tides that rise and devour candidates and their hopes everyday .
today they appear to let bush sink and let his two opponents rise , the nth ‘ new kennedy ’ , senator john forbes kerry and right after him the ‘ new clinton ’ , southerner john edwards .
the winds of optimism are allowing the hopes of the democrats to take off right now . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback do you think kerry can beat bush ?

european papers on thursday focused on u.s. democratic presidential front-runner john kerry ’ s success on the campaign trail .
most warned kerry had his work cut out if he was to dislodge bush from the white house . u.s. presidential candidate john kerry won five of seven democratic primaries on tuesday .
dutch left-leaning paper volkskrant wrote that kerry ’ s success was based on the fact that " he ’ s trusted and seen as capable of being elected by many " as well as on his prestige that he built up as a vietnam veteran and during his long stint in the u.s. senate .
" but so far his election campaign has seldom witnessed sweeping enthusiasm .
one is still waiting for a political message that can stir american voters to entrust the highest post in the country to an acting senator for the first time since the days of john f. kennedy , " the daily concluded .
" can john kerry chase george w. bush out of the white house ? "
french daily liberation asked and added that the question had taken on new urgency since kerry appeared to have good chances of being pitched as the democrats ’ presidential candidate .
the paper mused that if the voters had already made kerry a favorite or planned to do so , it was because they are convinced that he can be elected .
" in paris kerry has already been declared as the most likely democratic presidential hopeful , " it wrote .
" but to defeat an acting president , even a beleaguered one , the candidate must have outstanding qualities and the circumstances need to be exceptional , " the broadsheet cautioned .
the independent in london said if there is one lesson to be drawn from past american president campaigns , it is that favorites whether for nominations or for the white house become the target of brickbats as soon as they are identified .
the paper expected the other democrat hopefuls to turn their fire on the front-runner .
" kerry has proved his appeal to voters in the north , east , center and southwest of the country , he has attracted all classes , white americans and hispanics . "
but the daily warned , " kerry must prepare himself for whatever the other candidates may dig up to use against him and dampen his voter appeal . "
belgian daily le soir was optimistic that kerry ’ s surging popularity had the potential to unseat president bush .
" everywhere the voter turnout has broken records , a sign for the mobilization of democrat followers to remove the president from the white house , " the paper wrote .
" but more than the surveys that show that john kerry and john edwards will defeat him , it ’ s this resoluteness that must be unnerving george bush because if affects states -lrb- missouri and arizona -rrb- that he -lrb- bush -rrb- won only narrowly in 2000 . "
" a democratic people , who are in unanimous agreement that george w. bush must go , are pinning their hopes on john kerry and to a lesser extent on john edwards .
but is john kerry really the man to execute that goal ? " asked zürich-based swiss daily tages-anzeiger .
the paper pointed out that though kerry had acquired the reputation of a solid and sound politician during his long years in the washington senate , he was definitely not a visionary .

european papers on thursday focused on u.s. democratic presidential front-runner john kerry ’ s success on the campaign trail .
most warned kerry had his work cut out if he was to dislodge bush from the white house . u.s. presidential candidate john kerry won five of seven democratic primaries on tuesday .
dutch left-leaning paper volkskrant wrote that kerry ’ s success was based on the fact that " he ’ s trusted and seen as capable of being elected by many " as well as on his prestige that he built up as a vietnam veteran and during his long stint in the u.s. senate .
" but so far his election campaign has seldom witnessed sweeping enthusiasm .
one is still waiting for a political message that can stir american voters to entrust the highest post in the country to an acting senator for the first time since the days of john f. kennedy , " the daily concluded .
" can john kerry chase george w. bush out of the white house ? "
french daily liberation asked and added that the question had taken on new urgency since kerry appeared to have good chances of being pitched as the democrats ’ presidential candidate .
the paper mused that if the voters had already made kerry a favorite or planned to do so , it was because they are convinced that he can be elected .
" in paris kerry has already been declared as the most likely democratic presidential hopeful , " it wrote .
" but to defeat an acting president , even a beleaguered one , the candidate must have outstanding qualities and the circumstances need to be exceptional , " the broadsheet cautioned .
the independent in london said if there is one lesson to be drawn from past american president campaigns , it is that favorites whether for nominations or for the white house become the target of brickbats as soon as they are identified .
the paper expected the other democrat hopefuls to turn their fire on the front-runner .
" kerry has proved his appeal to voters in the north , east , center and southwest of the country , he has attracted all classes , white americans and hispanics . "
but the daily warned , " kerry must prepare himself for whatever the other candidates may dig up to use against him and dampen his voter appeal . "
belgian daily le soir was optimistic that kerry ’ s surging popularity had the potential to unseat president bush .
" everywhere the voter turnout has broken records , a sign for the mobilization of democrat followers to remove the president from the white house , " the paper wrote .
" but more than the surveys that show that john kerry and john edwards will defeat him , it ’ s this resoluteness that must be unnerving george bush because if affects states -lrb- missouri and arizona -rrb- that he -lrb- bush -rrb- won only narrowly in 2000 . "
" a democratic people , who are in unanimous agreement that george w. bush must go , are pinning their hopes on john kerry and to a lesser extent on john edwards .
but is john kerry really the man to execute that goal ? " asked zürich-based swiss daily tages-anzeiger .
the paper pointed out that though kerry had acquired the reputation of a solid and sound politician during his long years in the washington senate , he was definitely not a visionary .
the senator may possess the necessary stature , but his readiness to take on political risks still needs to be proven , the daily stressed .
liberal austrian daily der standard opined that john kerry had hit the right note in his election campaign .
" kerry has – just like his rival john edwards – always struck a mildly populist tone in his campaign and portrayed bush , not without reason , as the president of ‘ corporate america ’ , of the rich and the powerful , " it wrote .
the daily added that as the husband of a rich heiress who owns a billion-dollar ketchup company , kerry wasn ’ t exactly in danger of ending up on the streets anytime soon .
" but he -lrb- kerry -rrb- has still understood the importance of profiling himself as the advocate of the lower and middle classes in the u.s. , who are reeling from the enron scandal and the latest tax cuts by the government and do n't have much to laugh about under bush . "
norway ’ s conservative aftenposten observed that john kerry seems to have the tail wind behind him , judging by his success so far in the primary elections .
" however , kerry must master a difficult balancing act with regard to wooing voters and keeping the ones who support him already , " the paper warned .
" the key is the level of criticism kerry may use against the other candidates , which if too personal and petty , could repel voters , " the daily wrote .
germany ’ s conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung admired the activist zeal the democrats have shown in recent months .
" they ’ re positively burning with the desire to get george bush out of the white house with a fury that is strategically focussed , " the paper wrote .
but it added , " the democrats are seeking the most electable candidate which will be quite a challenge in a country that is so deeply divided . "
italian daily la repubblica reflected that it ’ s still a long way off till the u.s. presidential election and the fortunes of the democrats could rise and fall by then .
" this long journey to the american presidential polls is marked by tides that rise and devour candidates and their hopes everyday .

in a letter seen by the euobserver , spanish prime minister jose maria aznar has asked european commission president romano prodi to comment on plans to create a " high-level bilateral economic committee " to drive a transatlantic economic zone by the end of 2014 .
the spanish government hopes to have the plan approved in time to announce the formation of the committee at the eu-us summit in june .
the spanish proposal would see the committee create an action plan to remove obstacles in the transatlantic market within 12 months , including barriers in the telecoms , digital economy , air transport , financial service and regulation of competition areas by 2010 .
but the commission is split on the matter according to insiders , with questions being raised about the effect upon the multilateral trading system and the attitudes of eu member states .
there are increasing fears that the eu and us would be seen to be setting up a directorate of world trade or a so called " g2 " at a time when the world trade organization 's " development round " has yet to be resuscitated .

nato defense chiefs will meet in munich this weekend to discuss the alliance 's role in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere .
the hope is that the meeting will be more cordial than last year . nato defense and foreign ministers will gather in munich on friday to discuss the lingering fallout from the iraq war and the future direction of the alliance .
it will be the 40th annual meeting for the german security conference . the big names of the defense world , an estimated 250 officials including pentagon chief donald rumsfeld are due to attend , will use the informal get-together to address transatlantic relations , the future of nato , and current developments in the middle east . they will also likely to take the opportunity to discuss extending the alliance 's role in afghanistan while in the bavarian capital , according to diplomats in brussels . iraq situation will again dominate agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the main focus will undoubtedly be the situation in iraq , even more so now inquiries have been launched into intelligence failures in the united states and britain regarding the lack of evidence in the search for weapons of mass destruction a year after the war began . the u.s. delegation is also likely to continue with its pressure to get nato to play a role in iraq as part of washington ’ s current initiative to solicit wider contributions from its member states . last year 's munich conference was a highly tense affair with officials from washington , paris and berlin on edge as a un security council vote on a new iraq resolution loomed ominously near .
rumsfeld and german foreign minister joschka fischer famously clashed at the event and will meet again on friday with hopefully less static in the air between them . security conference host horst teltschik told reporters in munich that some reconciliation is likely .
" i get the impression that the americans want to give us a sign that they are prepared to talk so that both sides can get back to a ' normal ' relationship . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish soldiers in the ancient city of babylon , 80 kilometers south of baghdad , iraq .
new nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer said last week that the alliance , which is supporting the polish-led division in iraq , is ready and able to do the job .
" if the question comes , it goes without saying that i 'm very much in favour of a nato role , " he told journalists , before adding : " it 's too early to say exactly what that role will be . " despite making favourable noises in the direction of the united states in the form of low-key discussions , most nato officials remain resolute that no action will be taken before sovereignty is transferred from the u.s.-appointed interim leadership to the iraqis , a move that has been pencilled in for june . isaf 's afghan mission to be addressed the defense ministers will also consider the success of its continuing mission in afghanistan .
when the alliance took over command last august of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- it was nato 's first mission outside europe .
since then , the command of the mission , which has until now been centered on the capital kabul , has been rotated between member countries , with canada currently in control . nato wants to extend isaf 's operations beyond the capital kabul , notably using german troops , but it is having trouble with resources .
" i think that there is political will , but translating it into terms of concrete forces on the ground is more difficult and that is our challenge " said britain 's ambassador to nato peter ricketts in a press conference in brussels this week . eurocorps ready to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurocorps in mülheim , germany .
the landscape of nato ’ s role in afghanistan is likely to change further after officials announced on wednesday that the five-nation eurocorps army is ready to take the lead in the afghan peacekeeping mission later this year .
the eurocorps was recognized in 2002 as a nato high readiness force and has already carried out peacekeeping duties in kosovo and bosnia . with plans to be released and confirmed in the coming days , the 60,000-strong force - made up of troops from germany , france , spain , belgium and luxembourg - would more than likely be ready to assume control of the kabul-based mission by the summer .
it was not immediately clear how many of its soldiers would leave for afghanistan , as part of the 5,500-strong isaf . ministers from the five eurocorps nations are scheduled to meet on the margins of the munich meeting to discuss taking on the headquarters role . washington calls for nato engagement in mid-east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the middle east situation is also on the agenda .
elsewhere at the munich conference , officials will analyze the possibilities of nato involvement in the middle east - a topic that could both provide grounds for transatlantic consensus but may also be a source of further tensions . the united states is eager for nato to engage in the middle east to help build regional stability , and around six middle east and northern african nations , including israel and egypt , are being invited to the alliance summit in istanbul in june . observers expect lively discussion to be generated by the attendance of several middle east delegations in munich , discussions on developments in iran , israel 's " security fence " in and around the west bank and its decision to dismantle some jewish settlements . the fireworks may not be solely reserved for the conference either .
protests are expected and around 21 rallies have been planned before the meeting finishes on sunday with some 4,000 police being mobilized in munich .
the united states are so concerned that the protests may turn violent that washington has urged u.s. citizens around munich to be vigilant for possible unrest . dw staff -lrb- na -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de munich conference opens with sharp differences over iraq both u.s. defense secretary rumsfeld and german foreign minister fischer delivered strongly-worded speeches in which they staked out their positions and crossed verbal swords over the pressing issue of iraq in munich .

nato defense chiefs will meet in munich this weekend to discuss the alliance 's role in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere .
the hope is that the meeting will be more cordial than last year . nato defense and foreign ministers will gather in munich on friday to discuss the lingering fallout from the iraq war and the future direction of the alliance .
it will be the 40th annual meeting for the german security conference . the big names of the defense world , an estimated 250 officials including pentagon chief donald rumsfeld are due to attend , will use the informal get-together to address transatlantic relations , the future of nato , and current developments in the middle east . they will also likely to take the opportunity to discuss extending the alliance 's role in afghanistan while in the bavarian capital , according to diplomats in brussels . iraq situation will again dominate agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the main focus will undoubtedly be the situation in iraq , even more so now inquiries have been launched into intelligence failures in the united states and britain regarding the lack of evidence in the search for weapons of mass destruction a year after the war began . the u.s. delegation is also likely to continue with its pressure to get nato to play a role in iraq as part of washington ’ s current initiative to solicit wider contributions from its member states . last year 's munich conference was a highly tense affair with officials from washington , paris and berlin on edge as a un security council vote on a new iraq resolution loomed ominously near .
rumsfeld and german foreign minister joschka fischer famously clashed at the event and will meet again on friday with hopefully less static in the air between them . security conference host horst teltschik told reporters in munich that some reconciliation is likely .

new nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer said last week that the alliance , which is supporting the polish-led division in iraq , is ready and able to do the job .

since then , the command of the mission , which has until now been centered on the capital kabul , has been rotated between member countries , with canada currently in control . nato wants to extend isaf 's operations beyond the capital kabul , notably using german troops , but it is having trouble with resources .

nato defense chiefs will meet in munich this weekend to discuss the alliance 's role in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere .
the hope is that the meeting will be more cordial than last year . nato defense and foreign ministers will gather in munich on friday to discuss the lingering fallout from the iraq war and the future direction of the alliance .
it will be the 40th annual meeting for the german security conference . the big names of the defense world , an estimated 250 officials including pentagon chief donald rumsfeld are due to attend , will use the informal get-together to address transatlantic relations , the future of nato , and current developments in the middle east . they will also likely to take the opportunity to discuss extending the alliance 's role in afghanistan while in the bavarian capital , according to diplomats in brussels . iraq situation will again dominate agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the main focus will undoubtedly be the situation in iraq , even more so now inquiries have been launched into intelligence failures in the united states and britain regarding the lack of evidence in the search for weapons of mass destruction a year after the war began . the u.s. delegation is also likely to continue with its pressure to get nato to play a role in iraq as part of washington ’ s current initiative to solicit wider contributions from its member states . last year 's munich conference was a highly tense affair with officials from washington , paris and berlin on edge as a un security council vote on a new iraq resolution loomed ominously near .

the roller-coaster course of the five-month trial against abdelghani mzoudi left judges no choice but to acquit him , deutsche welle 's peter phillip writes in a commentary on thursday 's verdict . moroccan abdelghani mzoudi would have had to be extremely unlucky to be convicted of abetting the sept .
11 attacks in the united states .
germany ’ s federal prosecutors had charged him with exactly that and blamed the student for playing a role in the deaths of 3,066 people .
but the hamburg judges were n't convinced and they came back with the only verdict that seemed possible after the trial ’ s somewhat haphazard course : an acquittal . the trial became unfocused because politics and the legal system kept clashing .
supporting the fight against terrorism wholeheartedly is certainly backed by germans across the political spectrum , but this consensus starts crumbling as soon as this support requires blindly following the u.s. ’ s leadership .
especially if such allegiance requires throwing out the founding principles of the constitutional state . a hastened search for terrorists since the perpetrators of the sept .
11 attacks had stayed in germany as inconspicuous “ sleepers ” before the attacks , it was only natural that the german authorities would investigate their surroundings and search for accomplices to put them on trial .
one escaped – ramzi binalshibh – another , mounir al motassadeq , has been sentenced to 15 years in prison . whether this verdict will hold up is more than questionable after mzoudi ’ s acquittal .
real proof for motassadeq ’ s guilt does not exist .
what ’ s even more significant , much that normally would not have been accepted by a court seems to have been tolerated out of consideration for washington : the u.s. didn ’ t offer any legal assistance ; they didn ’ t allow interrogations of binalshibh or other incarcerated suspects and instead simply handed the german authorities quotes from their own interrogations , according to the sink-or-swim principle . prosecutors ridicule themselves the judge was already so annoyed by this in december that he released mzoudi from jail .
prosecutors didn ’ t like this at all and were led to ridicule themselves : one day before the verdict was supposed to be announced , they tried to turn the trial in a different direction by conjuring up an alleged witness .
the same happened again on thursday : hours before the verdict , supposedly new evidence was offered to the court . the judges stayed their course , as that ’ s no way to convict someone .
obviously this doesn ’ t say anything about mzoudi ’ s guilt or innocence , nor does it guarantee him a life in freedom .

the roller-coaster course of the five-month trial against abdelghani mzoudi left judges no choice but to acquit him , deutsche welle 's peter phillip writes in a commentary on thursday 's verdict . moroccan abdelghani mzoudi would have had to be extremely unlucky to be convicted of abetting the sept .

but the hamburg judges were n't convinced and they came back with the only verdict that seemed possible after the trial ’ s somewhat haphazard course : an acquittal . the trial became unfocused because politics and the legal system kept clashing .
supporting the fight against terrorism wholeheartedly is certainly backed by germans across the political spectrum , but this consensus starts crumbling as soon as this support requires blindly following the u.s. ’ s leadership .
especially if such allegiance requires throwing out the founding principles of the constitutional state . a hastened search for terrorists since the perpetrators of the sept .
11 attacks had stayed in germany as inconspicuous “ sleepers ” before the attacks , it was only natural that the german authorities would investigate their surroundings and search for accomplices to put them on trial .
one escaped – ramzi binalshibh – another , mounir al motassadeq , has been sentenced to 15 years in prison . whether this verdict will hold up is more than questionable after mzoudi ’ s acquittal .

the court decided that life-long preventative detention in extreme cases like child molesters and murderers was constitutional and did not breach the right of human dignity or the right to freedom .
the ruling comes after a 46-year-old man convicted for theft and two attempted murders appealed after his ten year preventative detention expired .
the man has been imprisoned since he was 15 and only been released for a few months before being placed under preventative detention again .
the defendant 's lawyer condemned the ruling has been a back door way of keeping his client locked up .

the court decided that life-long preventative detention in extreme cases like child molesters and murderers was constitutional and did not breach the right of human dignity or the right to freedom .
the ruling comes after a 46-year-old man convicted for theft and two attempted murders appealed after his ten year preventative detention expired .
the man has been imprisoned since he was 15 and only been released for a few months before being placed under preventative detention again .
the defendant 's lawyer condemned the ruling has been a back door way of keeping his client locked up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.02.2004 opinion : the only verdict possible großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutors were unable to prove mzoudi 's guilt .
the roller-coaster course of the five-month trial against abdelghani mzoudi left judges no choice but to acquit him , deutsche welle 's peter phillip writes in a commentary on thursday 's verdict . moroccan abdelghani mzoudi would have had to be extremely unlucky to be convicted of abetting the sept .
11 attacks in the united states .
germany ’ s federal prosecutors had charged him with exactly that and blamed the student for playing a role in the deaths of 3,066 people .
but the hamburg judges were n't convinced and they came back with the only verdict that seemed possible after the trial ’ s somewhat haphazard course : an acquittal . the trial became unfocused because politics and the legal system kept clashing .
supporting the fight against terrorism wholeheartedly is certainly backed by germans across the political spectrum , but this consensus starts crumbling as soon as this support requires blindly following the u.s. ’ s leadership .
especially if such allegiance requires throwing out the founding principles of the constitutional state . a hastened search for terrorists since the perpetrators of the sept .
11 attacks had stayed in germany as inconspicuous “ sleepers ” before the attacks , it was only natural that the german authorities would investigate their surroundings and search for accomplices to put them on trial .
one escaped – ramzi binalshibh – another , mounir al motassadeq , has been sentenced to 15 years in prison . whether this verdict will hold up is more than questionable after mzoudi ’ s acquittal .
real proof for motassadeq ’ s guilt does not exist .
what ’ s even more significant , much that normally would not have been accepted by a court seems to have been tolerated out of consideration for washington : the u.s. didn ’ t offer any legal assistance ; they didn ’ t allow interrogations of binalshibh or other incarcerated suspects and instead simply handed the german authorities quotes from their own interrogations , according to the sink-or-swim principle . prosecutors ridicule themselves the judge was already so annoyed by this in december that he released mzoudi from jail .
prosecutors didn ’ t like this at all and were led to ridicule themselves : one day before the verdict was supposed to be announced , they tried to turn the trial in a different direction by conjuring up an alleged witness .
the same happened again on thursday : hours before the verdict , supposedly new evidence was offered to the court . the judges stayed their course , as that ’ s no way to convict someone .
obviously this doesn ’ t say anything about mzoudi ’ s guilt or innocence , nor does it guarantee him a life in freedom .
he could be deported to his homeland , where he is likely to be arrested or even extradited to the united states . peter phillip send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .
11 terror suspect acquitted a hamburg court on thursday acquitted a moroccan charged with helping to prepare the sept .
11 attacks .
german officials have already said they plan to deport abdelghani mzoudi to his home country .

the same happened again on thursday : hours before the verdict , supposedly new evidence was offered to the court . the judges stayed their course , as that ’ s no way to convict someone .
obviously this doesn ’ t say anything about mzoudi ’ s guilt or innocence , nor does it guarantee him a life in freedom .
he could be deported to his homeland , where he is likely to be arrested or even extradited to the united states . peter phillip send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .
11 terror suspect acquitted a hamburg court on thursday acquitted a moroccan charged with helping to prepare the sept .

german officials have already said they plan to deport abdelghani mzoudi to his home country .

the four men are members of the cologne police force , and they are committed to encouraging moral courage in local youth .
along the way , they are changing the way young people think about the cops .

it 's a creative way of dealing with youth violence that brings young people into contact with authority figures who they often look upon with distrust .
faced with rising crime and a lack of resources in the german metropolis , many cologne police officers have come to the conclusion that prevention is the best answer to youth violence . three years ago , four such policemen formed a band of their own , and set out to transmit a positive message that might help stop the violent brawls which have become a daily feature of the officers ' work . today their lyrics can be heard at live performances across the city — in youth homes , at football games , demonstrations and concerts : " is it really so bad , things on a new path , bringing people together who were n't together before / it 's not about this crew winning a battle or having their single on the number one charts ...

with schwieren 's help , the band has gone from corny wannabees to respectable hip hoppers . according to schwieren , the opportunity to work closely with the police has changed his opinion about them : " before , you 'd see a police car and a police officer and first you 'd think skeptically , ' what do they want from me , did i do something ?

since then , i 've realized that you can talk with them like normal people , you can talk about whatever and it does n't have to be so hostile or against each other , " said schwieren . building bridges and trust still , dancing policemen on stage is an unusual sight , and the police officers do n't always have it easy with critical spectators , who wonder what the police are doing acting like rap stars .
but the police officers turned rappers see it differently , as they express in their lyrics " i tell you , hip hop has a job , hip hop has a job , a job , what 's hip hop got , hip hop has a job . "
indeed , for the officers , hip hop 's task is building bridges and trust .
their motto is , " look , act , call for help " against violence . andrea löhr , band member and police officer says the group gives their free time and energy to practicing their act in hopes it will have some positive effect on the communities they serve .
it 's not a professional act , but they give it their best shot , says löhr . " there is a large conference room at the station where we meet .
there are speakers in the room and we put the music on and we try and see how we can do it .
we also had some professional help , a choreographer who helped us , and some things we have tried out ourselves . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking the part the choreography is n't perfect and the police are only able to practice outside of work hours .
and whether or not their message has helped prevent violence may be difficult to measure .
however , members of p.i.4 say what matters is coming into contact with young people and encouraging positive attitudes about life such as in one of their four original songs : " i love life , i want to give it away and protect it , i have so much hope , maybe somebody could use some . " going beyond hip hop at a recent p.i.4 performance , there were mixed reviews for the police officers , but most young people seemed to appreciate the officers ' attempt at developing a relationship with young people on young people 's turf .
those skeptics who turn up for the concerts often come away surprised .
" i personally do n't find it so bad , i liked the lyrics and that they 're performing here , i think it 's actually a nice idea , " said one spectator .
and another young listener agreed , " i think you have to find a way to get closer to the public and i do n't have a problem with it at all . " still , some say hip hop just is n't the place for a policeman — particularly because of the often negative associations found in hip hop music when it comes to the police authorities .
one concert go-er commented that " hip hop is n't the right choice of music for them , because they are n't going to find a lot of sympathizers among hip-hoppers , i just ca n't imagine that . " but band leader michael mannheim says hip hop is just the beginning .
" we are n't fixed to hip-hop , " he said . " we worked well with our rapper and if tomorrow i find another singer with current music — be it rock , pop or soul , then we 'll do that too .
the only requirements are that it 's german music and that it has the right message . " although some critics suggest that it is n't the role of upstanding police officers to get up on stage and perform hip hop tunes , the foursome insists their message is worth it : " i wish you a voice , when you 're lying on the ground , when you are afraid and you ca n't get anymore air , yeah , yeah ...

a group of police officers in the western german city is trying to reach out to local youth by staging their own hip hop concerts . they rap about love , life and hope .
they dance in unison across the stage and crowds of young people watch them , enraptured at the sight before them .
germany 's next chart topping boy band ?
hardly .
the four men are members of the cologne police force , and they are committed to encouraging moral courage in local youth .
along the way , they are changing the way young people think about the cops .
they call themselves p.i.4 — an abbreviation for police inspection four .
the 25- to 30-year-old policemen shake their hips and raise their arms in sync with the beat while dressed in their standard issue , green police uniforms .
from the microphone the lyrics blast : " some say , i know it already , policemen on stage and an mc on the microphone , and you wanna say something , come to us after the show , you can ask whatever you want ... " preventing youth violence through music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : p.i. 4 at one of their concerts .
it 's a creative way of dealing with youth violence that brings young people into contact with authority figures who they often look upon with distrust .
faced with rising crime and a lack of resources in the german metropolis , many cologne police officers have come to the conclusion that prevention is the best answer to youth violence . three years ago , four such policemen formed a band of their own , and set out to transmit a positive message that might help stop the violent brawls which have become a daily feature of the officers ' work . today their lyrics can be heard at live performances across the city — in youth homes , at football games , demonstrations and concerts : " is it really so bad , things on a new path , bringing people together who were n't together before / it 's not about this crew winning a battle or having their single on the number one charts ... " the young civil servants take their mission seriously , which is one reason why hip hopper mr. man q.x. , also known as philip schwieren lent the dancing police officers his voice .
with schwieren 's help , the band has gone from corny wannabees to respectable hip hoppers . according to schwieren , the opportunity to work closely with the police has changed his opinion about them : " before , you 'd see a police car and a police officer and first you 'd think skeptically , ' what do they want from me , did i do something ? '
since then , i 've realized that you can talk with them like normal people , you can talk about whatever and it does n't have to be so hostile or against each other , " said schwieren . building bridges and trust still , dancing policemen on stage is an unusual sight , and the police officers do n't always have it easy with critical spectators , who wonder what the police are doing acting like rap stars .
but the police officers turned rappers see it differently , as they express in their lyrics " i tell you , hip hop has a job , hip hop has a job , a job , what 's hip hop got , hip hop has a job . "
indeed , for the officers , hip hop 's task is building bridges and trust .
their motto is , " look , act , call for help " against violence . andrea löhr , band member and police officer says the group gives their free time and energy to practicing their act in hopes it will have some positive effect on the communities they serve .
it 's not a professional act , but they give it their best shot , says löhr . " there is a large conference room at the station where we meet .
there are speakers in the room and we put the music on and we try and see how we can do it .
we also had some professional help , a choreographer who helped us , and some things we have tried out ourselves . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking the part the choreography is n't perfect and the police are only able to practice outside of work hours .
and whether or not their message has helped prevent violence may be difficult to measure .
however , members of p.i.4 say what matters is coming into contact with young people and encouraging positive attitudes about life such as in one of their four original songs : " i love life , i want to give it away and protect it , i have so much hope , maybe somebody could use some . " going beyond hip hop at a recent p.i.4 performance , there were mixed reviews for the police officers , but most young people seemed to appreciate the officers ' attempt at developing a relationship with young people on young people 's turf .
those skeptics who turn up for the concerts often come away surprised .
" i personally do n't find it so bad , i liked the lyrics and that they 're performing here , i think it 's actually a nice idea , " said one spectator .
and another young listener agreed , " i think you have to find a way to get closer to the public and i do n't have a problem with it at all .

british prime minister tony blair has said he might join an increasing number of eu countries that want to initially bar low-cost workers from new european union countries from working in the west . while the expansion of the eu by ten member states in may this year is seen by many as a historical milestone , it has also raised fears of mass migration of labor from the poorer , mostly ex-communist new members to the more affluent west .
eu skeptics say a large influx of low-wage workers would prove devastating to current members of the bloc , who are already facing stubbornly high unemployment rates .
prime minister tony blair told parliament on wednesday that he was re-evaluating his earlier stance on the issue , and might advocate imposing immigration controls and welfare benefit restrictions on immigrants from the 10 new countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair “ it is important that we recognize that there is a potential risk from these accession countries , ” blair -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliament .
“ we will take whatever measures are necessary to make sure that the ‘ pull factor ’ which might draw people here is closed off . ”
the draw , he said , could be britain ’ s welfare benefit system , and it would be re-examined to determined whether it was “ too generous . ”
change of heart britain ’ s new jumpiness about eastern migration comes in the wake of sweden ’ s decision last week to impose limits on workers from the new eu countries .
the netherlands also said recently it would impose a limit on the number of immigrant workers it would accept .
norway , though not an eu member but with close ties to the bloc , said on thursday it is also exploring possible restrictions , although it has previously stated its borders would be open to new eu citizens .
“ we now see that some of our neighboring countries , and now sweden , state that they will have some exceptions for some years , for an interim period , ” prime minister kjell magne bondevik told reporters on thursday after talks with european commission president romano prodi .
“ so we also now … intend to make a proposal for parliament about some possible exceptions for an interim period so we are more in line with our neighboring countries . ” for two years after enlargement , labor market access with depend on national policies , and not be dictated by brussels .
according to the european commission , only about half the 15 member states have told the eu about their plans .
austria , finland , belgium , france and denmark are planning limits , in some cases for up to seven years .
only ireland and spain have said they will keep their borders open .
germany , with its high unemployment and generous welfare system , insisted in 2002 during entry negotiations for the new candidate countries on a clause that would allow it to impose restrictions to its market for citizens from central and eastern europe until 2011 .
second-class citizens ?
malta , cyprus , estonia , latvia , lithuania , hungary , poland , slovakia , slovenia and the czech republic will become official members of the eu in may of this year . in the past months , tension between current and future members of the eu has increased on a number of issues .
the about-turns on work policy are likely to deepen the fear among many in the accession countries that they will be treated as second-class european citizens .
“ the thinking that we need long transition periods 14 years after the fall of the berlin wall shows a lack of solidarity , ” jan figiel , slovakia ’ s candidate for the european commission , told reuters .
the new members point to one of the fundaments of the eu project — free movement of persons including the right to live and work in another member state .
but as the eu prepares to take in 75 million new people , mostly from countries formerly part of the soviet bloc where wages were lower , fears have been growing of an influx of labor in search of a better standard of living .
the unease has been especially strong in germany , which , since 1990 , has attracted about 75 percent of the migrants to the eu from application countries .
unfounded fears experts , however , note that history teaches that such fears have generally been without foundation .
in previous eu enlargement periods , such as greece in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 , transitional measures such as labor restrictions were put into place , largely unnecessarily .
other alarms about east-west migration have proven false .
one example is a 1989 study by the u.n. high commission for refugees which estimated that 25 million people from the eastern europe would move to the west in the 1990s .

british prime minister tony blair has said he might join an increasing number of eu countries that want to initially bar low-cost workers from new european union countries from working in the west . while the expansion of the eu by ten member states in may this year is seen by many as a historical milestone , it has also raised fears of mass migration of labor from the poorer , mostly ex-communist new members to the more affluent west .
eu skeptics say a large influx of low-wage workers would prove devastating to current members of the bloc , who are already facing stubbornly high unemployment rates .
prime minister tony blair told parliament on wednesday that he was re-evaluating his earlier stance on the issue , and might advocate imposing immigration controls and welfare benefit restrictions on immigrants from the 10 new countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair “ it is important that we recognize that there is a potential risk from these accession countries , ” blair -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliament .
“ we will take whatever measures are necessary to make sure that the ‘ pull factor ’ which might draw people here is closed off . ”
the draw , he said , could be britain ’ s welfare benefit system , and it would be re-examined to determined whether it was “ too generous . ”
change of heart britain ’ s new jumpiness about eastern migration comes in the wake of sweden ’ s decision last week to impose limits on workers from the new eu countries .
the netherlands also said recently it would impose a limit on the number of immigrant workers it would accept .
norway , though not an eu member but with close ties to the bloc , said on thursday it is also exploring possible restrictions , although it has previously stated its borders would be open to new eu citizens .
“ we now see that some of our neighboring countries , and now sweden , state that they will have some exceptions for some years , for an interim period , ” prime minister kjell magne bondevik told reporters on thursday after talks with european commission president romano prodi .
“ so we also now … intend to make a proposal for parliament about some possible exceptions for an interim period so we are more in line with our neighboring countries . ” for two years after enlargement , labor market access with depend on national policies , and not be dictated by brussels .
according to the european commission , only about half the 15 member states have told the eu about their plans .
austria , finland , belgium , france and denmark are planning limits , in some cases for up to seven years .
only ireland and spain have said they will keep their borders open .
germany , with its high unemployment and generous welfare system , insisted in 2002 during entry negotiations for the new candidate countries on a clause that would allow it to impose restrictions to its market for citizens from central and eastern europe until 2011 .
second-class citizens ?
malta , cyprus , estonia , latvia , lithuania , hungary , poland , slovakia , slovenia and the czech republic will become official members of the eu in may of this year . in the past months , tension between current and future members of the eu has increased on a number of issues .
the about-turns on work policy are likely to deepen the fear among many in the accession countries that they will be treated as second-class european citizens .
“ the thinking that we need long transition periods 14 years after the fall of the berlin wall shows a lack of solidarity , ” jan figiel , slovakia ’ s candidate for the european commission , told reuters .
the new members point to one of the fundaments of the eu project — free movement of persons including the right to live and work in another member state .
but as the eu prepares to take in 75 million new people , mostly from countries formerly part of the soviet bloc where wages were lower , fears have been growing of an influx of labor in search of a better standard of living .
the unease has been especially strong in germany , which , since 1990 , has attracted about 75 percent of the migrants to the eu from application countries .
unfounded fears experts , however , note that history teaches that such fears have generally been without foundation .
in previous eu enlargement periods , such as greece in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 , transitional measures such as labor restrictions were put into place , largely unnecessarily .
other alarms about east-west migration have proven false .
one example is a 1989 study by the u.n. high commission for refugees which estimated that 25 million people from the eastern europe would move to the west in the 1990s .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.02.2004 publisher drops book on nazi porno großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi porn videos enjoyed a healthy trade in the early 1940s across front lines .
a few weeks before it was to hit the presses , a german publishing house pulled a book based on the secret porn industry of the third reich .
the reasons remain unclear . any book that attempts to shed light on the little-known nazi porn industry in the early 1940s is not likely to arrive in bookstores without a hitch .
but when the rowohlt publishing house completely cancelled its contract with author thor kunkel shortly before his new novel , " endstufe " -lrb- final step -rrb- , was to hit the presses , a slight sensation rippled through the industry .
little is being said by rowohlt and its head alexander fest about the reasons for the cancellation of the for-march planned release .
a statement by rowohlt mentioned something about not being able to bridge differences on questions on the " aesthetic and subject matter " in central parts of the book .
the manuscript , which landed in the hands of the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , was apparently not only filled with scenes of vivid sex and brutality , but made some questionable ties between the crimes of the allied army and those of the nazi regime .
kunkel is reportedly devastated by the cancellation of a book he spent three years researching and writing .
" i had the impression at a certain point that -lrb- the book -rrb- was being edited on ideological , not aesthetic levels , " he said in an interview with die welt newspaper .
" and i saw that as censorship .
i 'm 40 years old .
i know what i 'm writing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kunkel , thor : das schwarzlicht-terrarium .
the frankfurt-born kunkel is considered a rising talent in german literary circles following his prize-winning 2000 debut , " das schwarzlicht-terrarium " , about the frankfurt drug and disco scene in the late 1970s .
porn traded for raw materials he came upon the subject material for " endstufe " after watching a documentary in 1991 that looked into the little-known porn industry that apparently flourished during the third reich .
after asking around , he eventually got in contact with someone who had copies of the so-called sachsenwald films .
the films are reportedly filled with with scenes of sex , power relations and violence .
they were rumored to have been part of a flourishing raw materials trade .
kunkel , based in amsterdam , moved to berlin to research the book , drawing upon witness testimony at the time , including a former actress in one of the films .
he forms his novel around a group of nazi scientists who work at a secret service clinic and produce porn films on the side .
the films are soon a major success and part of a trade network that stretches throughout the wider war zone .
the author infuses the description of the group of scientists with an end of the world attitude .
the characters are apparently self-indulgent and blissfully ignorant of the horrors of the concentration camps or battlefield misery , both of which are dealt with only fleetingly , according to the frankfurter allgemeine .
nazi theme should n't be too hot for germany no one seems to know for sure what combination of themes scared the publisher off : whether it was because it was novel that belittled the horrors of the nazi period , or whether kunkel documented the scientific experimentation at the time with a bit too much fascination .
fest , who recently cancelled a book called " i too , had to kill " by an israeli secret service agent , in a letter referred to the fact that kunkel 's work and subject matter could reap a hefty amount of criticism .
but kunkel seems nonplussed by such arguments .
" germany is a very normal european country , " he said in the welt interview .
" i do n't think we should be raised as humiliated , mentally-disturbed garden gnomes .
endstufe is written in a very modern language .
it 's not a historical novel .

a few weeks before it was to hit the presses , a german publishing house pulled a book based on the secret porn industry of the third reich .
the reasons remain unclear . any book that attempts to shed light on the little-known nazi porn industry in the early 1940s is not likely to arrive in bookstores without a hitch .
but when the rowohlt publishing house completely cancelled its contract with author thor kunkel shortly before his new novel , " endstufe " -lrb- final step -rrb- , was to hit the presses , a slight sensation rippled through the industry .
little is being said by rowohlt and its head alexander fest about the reasons for the cancellation of the for-march planned release .
a statement by rowohlt mentioned something about not being able to bridge differences on questions on the " aesthetic and subject matter " in central parts of the book .
the manuscript , which landed in the hands of the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , was apparently not only filled with scenes of vivid sex and brutality , but made some questionable ties between the crimes of the allied army and those of the nazi regime .
kunkel is reportedly devastated by the cancellation of a book he spent three years researching and writing .
" i had the impression at a certain point that -lrb- the book -rrb- was being edited on ideological , not aesthetic levels , " he said in an interview with die welt newspaper .
" and i saw that as censorship .
i 'm 40 years old .
i know what i 'm writing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kunkel , thor : das schwarzlicht-terrarium .
the frankfurt-born kunkel is considered a rising talent in german literary circles following his prize-winning 2000 debut , " das schwarzlicht-terrarium " , about the frankfurt drug and disco scene in the late 1970s .
porn traded for raw materials he came upon the subject material for " endstufe " after watching a documentary in 1991 that looked into the little-known porn industry that apparently flourished during the third reich .
after asking around , he eventually got in contact with someone who had copies of the so-called sachsenwald films .
the films are reportedly filled with with scenes of sex , power relations and violence .
they were rumored to have been part of a flourishing raw materials trade .
kunkel , based in amsterdam , moved to berlin to research the book , drawing upon witness testimony at the time , including a former actress in one of the films .
he forms his novel around a group of nazi scientists who work at a secret service clinic and produce porn films on the side .
the films are soon a major success and part of a trade network that stretches throughout the wider war zone .
the author infuses the description of the group of scientists with an end of the world attitude .
the characters are apparently self-indulgent and blissfully ignorant of the horrors of the concentration camps or battlefield misery , both of which are dealt with only fleetingly , according to the frankfurter allgemeine .
nazi theme should n't be too hot for germany no one seems to know for sure what combination of themes scared the publisher off : whether it was because it was novel that belittled the horrors of the nazi period , or whether kunkel documented the scientific experimentation at the time with a bit too much fascination .
fest , who recently cancelled a book called " i too , had to kill " by an israeli secret service agent , in a letter referred to the fact that kunkel 's work and subject matter could reap a hefty amount of criticism .
but kunkel seems nonplussed by such arguments .
" germany is a very normal european country , " he said in the welt interview .
" i do n't think we should be raised as humiliated , mentally-disturbed garden gnomes .
endstufe is written in a very modern language .
it 's not a historical novel .

the french-german pharmaceutical company aventis announced growing profits for 2003 in an effort to ward off a hostile takeover bid from a smaller french drug firm . aventis reported that net profits for 2003 had increased by 17.5 percent to € 2.44 billion -lrb- $ 3.07 billion -rrb- .
earnings per share had also risen by 18.6 percent although a weakening dollar had led to a 4.5 percent drop in sales .
aventis chief executive igor landau presented the 2003 profits at a press conference in london to make the case that the company is strong enough to stand on its own and can reject a € 48 billion -lrb- $ 60.4 billion -rrb- hostile takeover bid from the french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthélabo .
" today 's announcement highlights how sanofi 's offer fundamentally undervalues aventis , " said landau .
" their hostile bid is a cheap attempt to transfer their risks to our shareholders , " he added .
landau had previously hinted that there were other drug firms that would make better partners for aventis , suggesting that sanofi was using the hostile bid to avoid becoming a target of a takeover itself – a fact not disputed by sanofi 's executive board .
" they need us , but we do n't need them , ” said landau last week .
merger to create european drug giant sanofi-synthélabo made the grab for aventis on monday offering five of its shares and € 69 for every six aventis shares .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquarters of french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo sa in paris .
dealers and analysts said the franco-german company 's concerted attempt to fend off sanofi 's bid would ultimately fail , but aventis would force its french rival to increase its offer by at least 15 percent .
sanofi is pushing for the creation of a new european drug giant which would have a stronger combined presence on the lucrative u.s. market .
aventis pointed out on thursday that it already has a strong presence there ; 38 percent of its core sales are made in the us .
a merger with sanofi would create the third largest pharmaceutical company in terms of global sales behind the u.s. giant pfizer inc. and the british firm glaxosmithkline plc .
with a combined net worth of € 16.6 billion , aventis currently ranks as the sixth largest pharmaceutical company in the world .
the other well known german chemical firm , bayer , comes in at place 18 with a combined net worth of € 4.3 billion .
france enthusiastic , germany worried about job losses the french government is said to be enthusiastic about the takeover bid which would create a pharmaceutical giant based in paris .
germany is less excited about the prospect .
federal economics minister wolfgang clement warned last week that a merger could result in job losses in germany if the company moves its focus to paris .
" the german government has a strong interest in strengthening aventis ' position in germany rather than weakening it , " he said .
a combination of sanofi 's 70,000 strong workforce with aventis ' 69,000 employees could result in as many as 10,000 job cuts in both germany and france .
trade unions have said the number of lost jobs could be closer to 25,000 .
aventis now employs some 9,000 german workers who loyally support their chief executive igor landau .
michael klippel the head of the works committee at aventis said , " we are confident because we believe he will fight .
he is not one of these managers who will sell out for a few marks . "
analysts say the takeover battle is extremely personal for the 59 year old igor landau .
he was instrumental in the merger of the french drug firm rhône-poulenc , where he had been an executive for many years , with one of germany 's largest pharmaceutical companies , hoechst .
the deal was the pinnacle of three decades of work and landau shed the firm 's chemical and agricultural operation to focus solely on drugs .
hostile takeovers rare in europe the battle being played out in london between aventis and sanofi is unusual for europe , where hostile takeover attempts are extremely rare .
while experts do n't expect there to be an increase in hostile bids , they do believe friendly mergers , like the one that created aventis , will continue .
according to some experts , smaller pharmaceuticals in europe soon wo n't be able to keep up with the giants .
professor klaus pohle sits on the board of directors of lion bioscience ag , a german software provider for drug companies .
he said german drug companies have lost their title as " chemists of the world " because of a research policy burdened with too much bureaucracy that serves to stifles innovation .
research and development vital to drug firms surviving the research , development and release of a new drug onto the market takes approximately 12 years .
then it takes another six to nine years before substantial profits are made .
pohle said the larger the pharmaceutical company , the more money and time it can invest in new projects and the less money is lost when a project fails .
experts say even if sanofi 's offer transforms itself into a friendly one , landau , like many chief executives whose company has been targeted by a hostile buyer , is unlikely to gain control of the new company .
if the sanofi bid fails , the smaller french firm is likely to be next in line for a hostile takeover bid .

the french-german pharmaceutical company aventis announced growing profits for 2003 in an effort to ward off a hostile takeover bid from a smaller french drug firm . aventis reported that net profits for 2003 had increased by 17.5 percent to € 2.44 billion -lrb- $ 3.07 billion -rrb- .
earnings per share had also risen by 18.6 percent although a weakening dollar had led to a 4.5 percent drop in sales .
aventis chief executive igor landau presented the 2003 profits at a press conference in london to make the case that the company is strong enough to stand on its own and can reject a € 48 billion -lrb- $ 60.4 billion -rrb- hostile takeover bid from the french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthélabo .
" today 's announcement highlights how sanofi 's offer fundamentally undervalues aventis , " said landau .
" their hostile bid is a cheap attempt to transfer their risks to our shareholders , " he added .
landau had previously hinted that there were other drug firms that would make better partners for aventis , suggesting that sanofi was using the hostile bid to avoid becoming a target of a takeover itself – a fact not disputed by sanofi 's executive board .
" they need us , but we do n't need them , ” said landau last week .
merger to create european drug giant sanofi-synthélabo made the grab for aventis on monday offering five of its shares and € 69 for every six aventis shares .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquarters of french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo sa in paris .
dealers and analysts said the franco-german company 's concerted attempt to fend off sanofi 's bid would ultimately fail , but aventis would force its french rival to increase its offer by at least 15 percent .
sanofi is pushing for the creation of a new european drug giant which would have a stronger combined presence on the lucrative u.s. market .
aventis pointed out on thursday that it already has a strong presence there ; 38 percent of its core sales are made in the us .
a merger with sanofi would create the third largest pharmaceutical company in terms of global sales behind the u.s. giant pfizer inc. and the british firm glaxosmithkline plc .
with a combined net worth of € 16.6 billion , aventis currently ranks as the sixth largest pharmaceutical company in the world .
the other well known german chemical firm , bayer , comes in at place 18 with a combined net worth of € 4.3 billion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.02.2004 nato defense chiefs return to munich großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld and joschka fischer got hot under the collar last year in munich .
nato defense chiefs will meet in munich this weekend to discuss the alliance 's role in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere .
the hope is that the meeting will be more cordial than last year . nato defense and foreign ministers will gather in munich on friday to discuss the lingering fallout from the iraq war and the future direction of the alliance .
it will be the 40th annual meeting for the german security conference . the big names of the defense world , an estimated 250 officials including pentagon chief donald rumsfeld are due to attend , will use the informal get-together to address transatlantic relations , the future of nato , and current developments in the middle east . they will also likely to take the opportunity to discuss extending the alliance 's role in afghanistan while in the bavarian capital , according to diplomats in brussels . iraq situation will again dominate agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the main focus will undoubtedly be the situation in iraq , even more so now inquiries have been launched into intelligence failures in the united states and britain regarding the lack of evidence in the search for weapons of mass destruction a year after the war began . the u.s. delegation is also likely to continue with its pressure to get nato to play a role in iraq as part of washington ’ s current initiative to solicit wider contributions from its member states . last year 's munich conference was a highly tense affair with officials from washington , paris and berlin on edge as a un security council vote on a new iraq resolution loomed ominously near .
rumsfeld and german foreign minister joschka fischer famously clashed at the event and will meet again on friday with hopefully less static in the air between them . security conference host horst teltschik told reporters in munich that some reconciliation is likely .
" i get the impression that the americans want to give us a sign that they are prepared to talk so that both sides can get back to a ' normal ' relationship . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish soldiers in the ancient city of babylon , 80 kilometers south of baghdad , iraq .
new nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer said last week that the alliance , which is supporting the polish-led division in iraq , is ready and able to do the job .
" if the question comes , it goes without saying that i 'm very much in favour of a nato role , " he told journalists , before adding : " it 's too early to say exactly what that role will be . " despite making favourable noises in the direction of the united states in the form of low-key discussions , most nato officials remain resolute that no action will be taken before sovereignty is transferred from the u.s.-appointed interim leadership to the iraqis , a move that has been pencilled in for june . isaf 's afghan mission to be addressed the defense ministers will also consider the success of its continuing mission in afghanistan .
when the alliance took over command last august of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- it was nato 's first mission outside europe .
since then , the command of the mission , which has until now been centered on the capital kabul , has been rotated between member countries , with canada currently in control . nato wants to extend isaf 's operations beyond the capital kabul , notably using german troops , but it is having trouble with resources .
" i think that there is political will , but translating it into terms of concrete forces on the ground is more difficult and that is our challenge " said britain 's ambassador to nato peter ricketts in a press conference in brussels this week . eurocorps ready to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurocorps in mülheim , germany .
the landscape of nato ’ s role in afghanistan is likely to change further after officials announced on wednesday that the five-nation eurocorps army is ready to take the lead in the afghan peacekeeping mission later this year .
the eurocorps was recognized in 2002 as a nato high readiness force and has already carried out peacekeeping duties in kosovo and bosnia . with plans to be released and confirmed in the coming days , the 60,000-strong force - made up of troops from germany , france , spain , belgium and luxembourg - would more than likely be ready to assume control of the kabul-based mission by the summer .
it was not immediately clear how many of its soldiers would leave for afghanistan , as part of the 5,500-strong isaf . ministers from the five eurocorps nations are scheduled to meet on the margins of the munich meeting to discuss taking on the headquarters role . washington calls for nato engagement in mid-east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the middle east situation is also on the agenda .
elsewhere at the munich conference , officials will analyze the possibilities of nato involvement in the middle east - a topic that could both provide grounds for transatlantic consensus but may also be a source of further tensions . the united states is eager for nato to engage in the middle east to help build regional stability , and around six middle east and northern african nations , including israel and egypt , are being invited to the alliance summit in istanbul in june . observers expect lively discussion to be generated by the attendance of several middle east delegations in munich , discussions on developments in iran , israel 's " security fence " in and around the west bank and its decision to dismantle some jewish settlements . the fireworks may not be solely reserved for the conference either .

nato defense chiefs will meet in munich this weekend to discuss the alliance 's role in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere .
the hope is that the meeting will be more cordial than last year . nato defense and foreign ministers will gather in munich on friday to discuss the lingering fallout from the iraq war and the future direction of the alliance .
it will be the 40th annual meeting for the german security conference . the big names of the defense world , an estimated 250 officials including pentagon chief donald rumsfeld are due to attend , will use the informal get-together to address transatlantic relations , the future of nato , and current developments in the middle east . they will also likely to take the opportunity to discuss extending the alliance 's role in afghanistan while in the bavarian capital , according to diplomats in brussels . iraq situation will again dominate agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the main focus will undoubtedly be the situation in iraq , even more so now inquiries have been launched into intelligence failures in the united states and britain regarding the lack of evidence in the search for weapons of mass destruction a year after the war began . the u.s. delegation is also likely to continue with its pressure to get nato to play a role in iraq as part of washington ’ s current initiative to solicit wider contributions from its member states . last year 's munich conference was a highly tense affair with officials from washington , paris and berlin on edge as a un security council vote on a new iraq resolution loomed ominously near .
rumsfeld and german foreign minister joschka fischer famously clashed at the event and will meet again on friday with hopefully less static in the air between them . security conference host horst teltschik told reporters in munich that some reconciliation is likely .

new nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer said last week that the alliance , which is supporting the polish-led division in iraq , is ready and able to do the job .
" if the question comes , it goes without saying that i 'm very much in favour of a nato role , " he told journalists , before adding : " it 's too early to say exactly what that role will be .

when the alliance took over command last august of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- it was nato 's first mission outside europe .
since then , the command of the mission , which has until now been centered on the capital kabul , has been rotated between member countries , with canada currently in control . nato wants to extend isaf 's operations beyond the capital kabul , notably using german troops , but it is having trouble with resources .

the eurocorps was recognized in 2002 as a nato high readiness force and has already carried out peacekeeping duties in kosovo and bosnia . with plans to be released and confirmed in the coming days , the 60,000-strong force - made up of troops from germany , france , spain , belgium and luxembourg - would more than likely be ready to assume control of the kabul-based mission by the summer .

elsewhere at the munich conference , officials will analyze the possibilities of nato involvement in the middle east - a topic that could both provide grounds for transatlantic consensus but may also be a source of further tensions . the united states is eager for nato to engage in the middle east to help build regional stability , and around six middle east and northern african nations , including israel and egypt , are being invited to the alliance summit in istanbul in june . observers expect lively discussion to be generated by the attendance of several middle east delegations in munich , discussions on developments in iran , israel 's " security fence " in and around the west bank and its decision to dismantle some jewish settlements . the fireworks may not be solely reserved for the conference either .

it will be the 40th annual meeting for the german security conference . the big names of the defense world , an estimated 250 officials including pentagon chief donald rumsfeld are due to attend , will use the informal get-together to address transatlantic relations , the future of nato , and current developments in the middle east . they will also likely to take the opportunity to discuss extending the alliance 's role in afghanistan while in the bavarian capital , according to diplomats in brussels . iraq situation will again dominate agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the main focus will undoubtedly be the situation in iraq , even more so now inquiries have been launched into intelligence failures in the united states and britain regarding the lack of evidence in the search for weapons of mass destruction a year after the war began . the u.s. delegation is also likely to continue with its pressure to get nato to play a role in iraq as part of washington ’ s current initiative to solicit wider contributions from its member states . last year 's munich conference was a highly tense affair with officials from washington , paris and berlin on edge as a un security council vote on a new iraq resolution loomed ominously near .
rumsfeld and german foreign minister joschka fischer famously clashed at the event and will meet again on friday with hopefully less static in the air between them . security conference host horst teltschik told reporters in munich that some reconciliation is likely .
" i get the impression that the americans want to give us a sign that they are prepared to talk so that both sides can get back to a ' normal ' relationship . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish soldiers in the ancient city of babylon , 80 kilometers south of baghdad , iraq .
new nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer said last week that the alliance , which is supporting the polish-led division in iraq , is ready and able to do the job .
" if the question comes , it goes without saying that i 'm very much in favour of a nato role , " he told journalists , before adding : " it 's too early to say exactly what that role will be . " despite making favourable noises in the direction of the united states in the form of low-key discussions , most nato officials remain resolute that no action will be taken before sovereignty is transferred from the u.s.-appointed interim leadership to the iraqis , a move that has been pencilled in for june . isaf 's afghan mission to be addressed the defense ministers will also consider the success of its continuing mission in afghanistan .
when the alliance took over command last august of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- it was nato 's first mission outside europe .
since then , the command of the mission , which has until now been centered on the capital kabul , has been rotated between member countries , with canada currently in control . nato wants to extend isaf 's operations beyond the capital kabul , notably using german troops , but it is having trouble with resources .
" i think that there is political will , but translating it into terms of concrete forces on the ground is more difficult and that is our challenge " said britain 's ambassador to nato peter ricketts in a press conference in brussels this week . eurocorps ready to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurocorps in mülheim , germany .
the landscape of nato ’ s role in afghanistan is likely to change further after officials announced on wednesday that the five-nation eurocorps army is ready to take the lead in the afghan peacekeeping mission later this year .
the eurocorps was recognized in 2002 as a nato high readiness force and has already carried out peacekeeping duties in kosovo and bosnia . with plans to be released and confirmed in the coming days , the 60,000-strong force - made up of troops from germany , france , spain , belgium and luxembourg - would more than likely be ready to assume control of the kabul-based mission by the summer .
it was not immediately clear how many of its soldiers would leave for afghanistan , as part of the 5,500-strong isaf . ministers from the five eurocorps nations are scheduled to meet on the margins of the munich meeting to discuss taking on the headquarters role . washington calls for nato engagement in mid-east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the middle east situation is also on the agenda .
elsewhere at the munich conference , officials will analyze the possibilities of nato involvement in the middle east - a topic that could both provide grounds for transatlantic consensus but may also be a source of further tensions . the united states is eager for nato to engage in the middle east to help build regional stability , and around six middle east and northern african nations , including israel and egypt , are being invited to the alliance summit in istanbul in june . observers expect lively discussion to be generated by the attendance of several middle east delegations in munich , discussions on developments in iran , israel 's " security fence " in and around the west bank and its decision to dismantle some jewish settlements . the fireworks may not be solely reserved for the conference either .
protests are expected and around 21 rallies have been planned before the meeting finishes on sunday with some 4,000 police being mobilized in munich .
the united states are so concerned that the protests may turn violent that washington has urged u.s. citizens around munich to be vigilant for possible unrest . dw staff -lrb- na -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de munich conference opens with sharp differences over iraq both u.s. defense secretary rumsfeld and german foreign minister fischer delivered strongly-worded speeches in which they staked out their positions and crossed verbal swords over the pressing issue of iraq in munich .

but it will not only be the heat from the bright lights that will warm berliners attending the shows and events that make up the festival circus .
germans from all over the country can also revel in the feeling of pride that berlin ’ s film gala and the german movie industry as a whole is currently enjoying a surge in international profile , popularity and profit .
“ it 's been one of the best years ever for cinema in germany , ” said dieter kosslick , the festival ’ s director who has turned the berlinale into a showcase for german productions and has helped it secure its place behind cannes and alongside venice as one of europe 's three most important film festivals .
“ as long as i 'm the head of this festival , its backing for german films will remain high , ” kosslick said in an interview with reporters in the run-up to the festival ’ s opening .

the successes of films such as “ good bye , lenin ” - the comedy about a son who conceals the fall of the berlin wall from his ailing mother , and the world war ii drama “ rosenstrasse " , has helped the domestic market share climb to about 15 percent in 2003 from around 11 percent the year before .

“ good bye , lenin , ” which won six european film awards in december , topped germany 's box office last year with over 6.5 million people turning out to see the film , generating nearly € 31.9 million -lrb- $ 40 million -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.02.2004 european press review : can kerry beat bush ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. john kerry is on course in the race to find a democratic challenger to president bush .
european papers on thursday focused on u.s. democratic presidential front-runner john kerry ’ s success on the campaign trail .
most warned kerry had his work cut out if he was to dislodge bush from the white house . u.s. presidential candidate john kerry won five of seven democratic primaries on tuesday .
dutch left-leaning paper volkskrant wrote that kerry ’ s success was based on the fact that " he ’ s trusted and seen as capable of being elected by many " as well as on his prestige that he built up as a vietnam veteran and during his long stint in the u.s. senate .
" but so far his election campaign has seldom witnessed sweeping enthusiasm .
one is still waiting for a political message that can stir american voters to entrust the highest post in the country to an acting senator for the first time since the days of john f. kennedy , " the daily concluded .
" can john kerry chase george w. bush out of the white house ? "
french daily liberation asked and added that the question had taken on new urgency since kerry appeared to have good chances of being pitched as the democrats ’ presidential candidate .
the paper mused that if the voters had already made kerry a favorite or planned to do so , it was because they are convinced that he can be elected .
" in paris kerry has already been declared as the most likely democratic presidential hopeful , " it wrote .
" but to defeat an acting president , even a beleaguered one , the candidate must have outstanding qualities and the circumstances need to be exceptional , " the broadsheet cautioned .
the independent in london said if there is one lesson to be drawn from past american president campaigns , it is that favorites whether for nominations or for the white house become the target of brickbats as soon as they are identified .
the paper expected the other democrat hopefuls to turn their fire on the front-runner .
" kerry has proved his appeal to voters in the north , east , center and southwest of the country , he has attracted all classes , white americans and hispanics . "
but the daily warned , " kerry must prepare himself for whatever the other candidates may dig up to use against him and dampen his voter appeal . "
belgian daily le soir was optimistic that kerry ’ s surging popularity had the potential to unseat president bush .
" everywhere the voter turnout has broken records , a sign for the mobilization of democrat followers to remove the president from the white house , " the paper wrote .
" but more than the surveys that show that john kerry and john edwards will defeat him , it ’ s this resoluteness that must be unnerving george bush because if affects states -lrb- missouri and arizona -rrb- that he -lrb- bush -rrb- won only narrowly in 2000 . "
" a democratic people , who are in unanimous agreement that george w. bush must go , are pinning their hopes on john kerry and to a lesser extent on john edwards .
but is john kerry really the man to execute that goal ? " asked zürich-based swiss daily tages-anzeiger .
the paper pointed out that though kerry had acquired the reputation of a solid and sound politician during his long years in the washington senate , he was definitely not a visionary .
the senator may possess the necessary stature , but his readiness to take on political risks still needs to be proven , the daily stressed .
liberal austrian daily der standard opined that john kerry had hit the right note in his election campaign .
" kerry has – just like his rival john edwards – always struck a mildly populist tone in his campaign and portrayed bush , not without reason , as the president of ‘ corporate america ’ , of the rich and the powerful , " it wrote .
the daily added that as the husband of a rich heiress who owns a billion-dollar ketchup company , kerry wasn ’ t exactly in danger of ending up on the streets anytime soon .
" but he -lrb- kerry -rrb- has still understood the importance of profiling himself as the advocate of the lower and middle classes in the u.s. , who are reeling from the enron scandal and the latest tax cuts by the government and do n't have much to laugh about under bush . "
norway ’ s conservative aftenposten observed that john kerry seems to have the tail wind behind him , judging by his success so far in the primary elections .
" however , kerry must master a difficult balancing act with regard to wooing voters and keeping the ones who support him already , " the paper warned .
" the key is the level of criticism kerry may use against the other candidates , which if too personal and petty , could repel voters , " the daily wrote .
germany ’ s conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung admired the activist zeal the democrats have shown in recent months .
" they ’ re positively burning with the desire to get george bush out of the white house with a fury that is strategically focussed , " the paper wrote .
but it added , " the democrats are seeking the most electable candidate which will be quite a challenge in a country that is so deeply divided . "
italian daily la repubblica reflected that it ’ s still a long way off till the u.s. presidential election and the fortunes of the democrats could rise and fall by then .
" this long journey to the american presidential polls is marked by tides that rise and devour candidates and their hopes everyday .
today they appear to let bush sink and let his two opponents rise , the nth ‘ new kennedy ’ , senator john forbes kerry and right after him the ‘ new clinton ’ , southerner john edwards .
the winds of optimism are allowing the hopes of the democrats to take off right now . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

european papers on thursday focused on u.s. democratic presidential front-runner john kerry ’ s success on the campaign trail .
most warned kerry had his work cut out if he was to dislodge bush from the white house . u.s. presidential candidate john kerry won five of seven democratic primaries on tuesday .
dutch left-leaning paper volkskrant wrote that kerry ’ s success was based on the fact that " he ’ s trusted and seen as capable of being elected by many " as well as on his prestige that he built up as a vietnam veteran and during his long stint in the u.s. senate .
" but so far his election campaign has seldom witnessed sweeping enthusiasm .
one is still waiting for a political message that can stir american voters to entrust the highest post in the country to an acting senator for the first time since the days of john f. kennedy , " the daily concluded .
" can john kerry chase george w. bush out of the white house ? "
french daily liberation asked and added that the question had taken on new urgency since kerry appeared to have good chances of being pitched as the democrats ’ presidential candidate .
the paper mused that if the voters had already made kerry a favorite or planned to do so , it was because they are convinced that he can be elected .
" in paris kerry has already been declared as the most likely democratic presidential hopeful , " it wrote .
" but to defeat an acting president , even a beleaguered one , the candidate must have outstanding qualities and the circumstances need to be exceptional , " the broadsheet cautioned .
the independent in london said if there is one lesson to be drawn from past american president campaigns , it is that favorites whether for nominations or for the white house become the target of brickbats as soon as they are identified .
the paper expected the other democrat hopefuls to turn their fire on the front-runner .
" kerry has proved his appeal to voters in the north , east , center and southwest of the country , he has attracted all classes , white americans and hispanics . "
but the daily warned , " kerry must prepare himself for whatever the other candidates may dig up to use against him and dampen his voter appeal . "
belgian daily le soir was optimistic that kerry ’ s surging popularity had the potential to unseat president bush .
" everywhere the voter turnout has broken records , a sign for the mobilization of democrat followers to remove the president from the white house , " the paper wrote .
" but more than the surveys that show that john kerry and john edwards will defeat him , it ’ s this resoluteness that must be unnerving george bush because if affects states -lrb- missouri and arizona -rrb- that he -lrb- bush -rrb- won only narrowly in 2000 . "
" a democratic people , who are in unanimous agreement that george w. bush must go , are pinning their hopes on john kerry and to a lesser extent on john edwards .
but is john kerry really the man to execute that goal ? " asked zürich-based swiss daily tages-anzeiger .
the paper pointed out that though kerry had acquired the reputation of a solid and sound politician during his long years in the washington senate , he was definitely not a visionary .
the senator may possess the necessary stature , but his readiness to take on political risks still needs to be proven , the daily stressed .
liberal austrian daily der standard opined that john kerry had hit the right note in his election campaign .
" kerry has – just like his rival john edwards – always struck a mildly populist tone in his campaign and portrayed bush , not without reason , as the president of ‘ corporate america ’ , of the rich and the powerful , " it wrote .
the daily added that as the husband of a rich heiress who owns a billion-dollar ketchup company , kerry wasn ’ t exactly in danger of ending up on the streets anytime soon .
" but he -lrb- kerry -rrb- has still understood the importance of profiling himself as the advocate of the lower and middle classes in the u.s. , who are reeling from the enron scandal and the latest tax cuts by the government and do n't have much to laugh about under bush . "
norway ’ s conservative aftenposten observed that john kerry seems to have the tail wind behind him , judging by his success so far in the primary elections .
" however , kerry must master a difficult balancing act with regard to wooing voters and keeping the ones who support him already , " the paper warned .
" the key is the level of criticism kerry may use against the other candidates , which if too personal and petty , could repel voters , " the daily wrote .
germany ’ s conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung admired the activist zeal the democrats have shown in recent months .
" they ’ re positively burning with the desire to get george bush out of the white house with a fury that is strategically focussed , " the paper wrote .
but it added , " the democrats are seeking the most electable candidate which will be quite a challenge in a country that is so deeply divided . "
italian daily la repubblica reflected that it ’ s still a long way off till the u.s. presidential election and the fortunes of the democrats could rise and fall by then .
" this long journey to the american presidential polls is marked by tides that rise and devour candidates and their hopes everyday .
today they appear to let bush sink and let his two opponents rise , the nth ‘ new kennedy ’ , senator john forbes kerry and right after him the ‘ new clinton ’ , southerner john edwards .
the winds of optimism are allowing the hopes of the democrats to take off right now . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

european papers on thursday focused on u.s. democratic presidential front-runner john kerry ’ s success on the campaign trail .
most warned kerry had his work cut out if he was to dislodge bush from the white house . u.s. presidential candidate john kerry won five of seven democratic primaries on tuesday .
dutch left-leaning paper volkskrant wrote that kerry ’ s success was based on the fact that " he ’ s trusted and seen as capable of being elected by many " as well as on his prestige that he built up as a vietnam veteran and during his long stint in the u.s. senate .
" but so far his election campaign has seldom witnessed sweeping enthusiasm .
one is still waiting for a political message that can stir american voters to entrust the highest post in the country to an acting senator for the first time since the days of john f. kennedy , " the daily concluded .
" can john kerry chase george w. bush out of the white house ? "
french daily liberation asked and added that the question had taken on new urgency since kerry appeared to have good chances of being pitched as the democrats ’ presidential candidate .
the paper mused that if the voters had already made kerry a favorite or planned to do so , it was because they are convinced that he can be elected .
" in paris kerry has already been declared as the most likely democratic presidential hopeful , " it wrote .
" but to defeat an acting president , even a beleaguered one , the candidate must have outstanding qualities and the circumstances need to be exceptional , " the broadsheet cautioned .
the independent in london said if there is one lesson to be drawn from past american president campaigns , it is that favorites whether for nominations or for the white house become the target of brickbats as soon as they are identified .
the paper expected the other democrat hopefuls to turn their fire on the front-runner .
" kerry has proved his appeal to voters in the north , east , center and southwest of the country , he has attracted all classes , white americans and hispanics . "
but the daily warned , " kerry must prepare himself for whatever the other candidates may dig up to use against him and dampen his voter appeal . "
belgian daily le soir was optimistic that kerry ’ s surging popularity had the potential to unseat president bush .
" everywhere the voter turnout has broken records , a sign for the mobilization of democrat followers to remove the president from the white house , " the paper wrote .
" but more than the surveys that show that john kerry and john edwards will defeat him , it ’ s this resoluteness that must be unnerving george bush because if affects states -lrb- missouri and arizona -rrb- that he -lrb- bush -rrb- won only narrowly in 2000 . "
" a democratic people , who are in unanimous agreement that george w. bush must go , are pinning their hopes on john kerry and to a lesser extent on john edwards .
but is john kerry really the man to execute that goal ? " asked zürich-based swiss daily tages-anzeiger .
the paper pointed out that though kerry had acquired the reputation of a solid and sound politician during his long years in the washington senate , he was definitely not a visionary .
the senator may possess the necessary stature , but his readiness to take on political risks still needs to be proven , the daily stressed .
liberal austrian daily der standard opined that john kerry had hit the right note in his election campaign .
" kerry has – just like his rival john edwards – always struck a mildly populist tone in his campaign and portrayed bush , not without reason , as the president of ‘ corporate america ’ , of the rich and the powerful , " it wrote .
the daily added that as the husband of a rich heiress who owns a billion-dollar ketchup company , kerry wasn ’ t exactly in danger of ending up on the streets anytime soon .
" but he -lrb- kerry -rrb- has still understood the importance of profiling himself as the advocate of the lower and middle classes in the u.s. , who are reeling from the enron scandal and the latest tax cuts by the government and do n't have much to laugh about under bush . "
norway ’ s conservative aftenposten observed that john kerry seems to have the tail wind behind him , judging by his success so far in the primary elections .
" however , kerry must master a difficult balancing act with regard to wooing voters and keeping the ones who support him already , " the paper warned .
" the key is the level of criticism kerry may use against the other candidates , which if too personal and petty , could repel voters , " the daily wrote .
germany ’ s conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung admired the activist zeal the democrats have shown in recent months .
" they ’ re positively burning with the desire to get george bush out of the white house with a fury that is strategically focussed , " the paper wrote .
but it added , " the democrats are seeking the most electable candidate which will be quite a challenge in a country that is so deeply divided . "
italian daily la repubblica reflected that it ’ s still a long way off till the u.s. presidential election and the fortunes of the democrats could rise and fall by then .
" this long journey to the american presidential polls is marked by tides that rise and devour candidates and their hopes everyday .
today they appear to let bush sink and let his two opponents rise , the nth ‘ new kennedy ’ , senator john forbes kerry and right after him the ‘ new clinton ’ , southerner john edwards .
the winds of optimism are allowing the hopes of the democrats to take off right now . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback do you think kerry can beat bush ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.02.2004 opinion : the only verdict possible großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutors were unable to prove mzoudi 's guilt .
the roller-coaster course of the five-month trial against abdelghani mzoudi left judges no choice but to acquit him , deutsche welle 's peter phillip writes in a commentary on thursday 's verdict . moroccan abdelghani mzoudi would have had to be extremely unlucky to be convicted of abetting the sept .
11 attacks in the united states .
germany ’ s federal prosecutors had charged him with exactly that and blamed the student for playing a role in the deaths of 3,066 people .
but the hamburg judges were n't convinced and they came back with the only verdict that seemed possible after the trial ’ s somewhat haphazard course : an acquittal . the trial became unfocused because politics and the legal system kept clashing .
supporting the fight against terrorism wholeheartedly is certainly backed by germans across the political spectrum , but this consensus starts crumbling as soon as this support requires blindly following the u.s. ’ s leadership .
especially if such allegiance requires throwing out the founding principles of the constitutional state . a hastened search for terrorists since the perpetrators of the sept .
11 attacks had stayed in germany as inconspicuous “ sleepers ” before the attacks , it was only natural that the german authorities would investigate their surroundings and search for accomplices to put them on trial .
one escaped – ramzi binalshibh – another , mounir al motassadeq , has been sentenced to 15 years in prison . whether this verdict will hold up is more than questionable after mzoudi ’ s acquittal .
real proof for motassadeq ’ s guilt does not exist .
what ’ s even more significant , much that normally would not have been accepted by a court seems to have been tolerated out of consideration for washington : the u.s. didn ’ t offer any legal assistance ; they didn ’ t allow interrogations of binalshibh or other incarcerated suspects and instead simply handed the german authorities quotes from their own interrogations , according to the sink-or-swim principle . prosecutors ridicule themselves the judge was already so annoyed by this in december that he released mzoudi from jail .
prosecutors didn ’ t like this at all and were led to ridicule themselves : one day before the verdict was supposed to be announced , they tried to turn the trial in a different direction by conjuring up an alleged witness .
the same happened again on thursday : hours before the verdict , supposedly new evidence was offered to the court . the judges stayed their course , as that ’ s no way to convict someone .
obviously this doesn ’ t say anything about mzoudi ’ s guilt or innocence , nor does it guarantee him a life in freedom .
he could be deported to his homeland , where he is likely to be arrested or even extradited to the united states . peter phillip send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .
11 terror suspect acquitted a hamburg court on thursday acquitted a moroccan charged with helping to prepare the sept .
11 attacks .
german officials have already said they plan to deport abdelghani mzoudi to his home country .

last year was an outstanding year for german cinema .
now , as the 54th international film festival berlin kicks off , it ’ s time for the stars of germany ’ s film industry to sit back and enjoy the attention . the berlinale gets underway on thursday with film fans flocking to the german capital to bask in the warm celebrity glow of the global stars and directors who will be arriving throughout the ten days of glamour and glitz .
but it will not only be the heat from the bright lights that will warm berliners attending the shows and events that make up the festival circus .
germans from all over the country can also revel in the feeling of pride that berlin ’ s film gala and the german movie industry as a whole is currently enjoying a surge in international profile , popularity and profit .
“ it 's been one of the best years ever for cinema in germany , ” said dieter kosslick , the festival ’ s director who has turned the berlinale into a showcase for german productions and has helped it secure its place behind cannes and alongside venice as one of europe 's three most important film festivals .
“ as long as i 'm the head of this festival , its backing for german films will remain high , ” kosslick said in an interview with reporters in the run-up to the festival ’ s opening .
“ i 've never had to push for german films because i 've always found them to be very good .
it was always other people who had problems with them . ”
from nowhere to a miracle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german director caroline link holds the oscar for " nowhere in africa . "
those problems have been fading ever since “ nowhere in africa , ” a film about the challenges facing a jewish family who flee to kenya after the nazis take power , won the academy award for best foreign language movie last march .
that oscar and a string of domestic box office hits have put germany ’ s film industry back into the international spotlight .
“ it 's obviously been a great year for german film , ” said rolf baehr , chairman of the german film board , in an interview with reuters .
“ german films are now reaching audiences with good stories . ”
“ film makers are concentrating on viewers more and not focused on their own self-realization .
the experience and training are also greatly improved .
it 's all coming together . ”
the successes of films such as “ good bye , lenin ” - the comedy about a son who conceals the fall of the berlin wall from his ailing mother , and the world war ii drama “ rosenstrasse " , has helped the domestic market share climb to about 15 percent in 2003 from around 11 percent the year before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good bye , lenin .
hello success .
“ good bye , lenin , ” which won six european film awards in december , topped germany 's box office last year with over 6.5 million people turning out to see the film , generating nearly € 31.9 million -lrb- $ 40 million -rrb- .
“ the miracle of bern ” , a film about west germany 's 1954 world cup winning soccer team , and the biopic “ luther ” also scored with audiences inside and outside germany , and film makers are hopeful the festival will herald another big year .
interest in german films rises “ thanks to caroline link 's oscar -lrb- for nowhere in africa -rrb- , there 's now a lot more interest in german films from abroad , " said romuald karmaker , a german director whose film “ nightsongs ” is one of 23 competing for the top golden bear awards .
the director told reporters : “ the entire atmosphere is completely different now , ” referring to the past when the berlinale featured very few german films in its program .
“ the attention we 're getting now is absolutely essential . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katja riemann holds the " coppa volpi " for best actress at the 60th venice film festival .
apart from director link ’ s oscar , germany ’ s profile has also been raised by performances - katja riemann -lrb- picture -rrb- won a best actress award at the venice film festival in september for her performance in as the aryan wife of a jew in nazi germany in “ rosenstrasse ” - and the use of german locations in major hollywood productions .
location of choice “ enemy at the gates , ” the star-studded depiction of the siege of stalingrad during world war ii , was filmed at the refurbished babelsberg studios south of berlin . hollywood star matt damon has rekindled his german links in the latest installment of his spy franchise by filming “ the bourne supremacy , ” the sequel to the franka potente co-starring original “ the bourne identity , ” in berlin .
oscar winner kevin spacey is also directing his film “ beyond the sea ” in the german capital .
berlin has been in direct competition with the three other major media metropolises in germany - hamburg , cologne and munich - for the favor of the film-makers .
and it seems that the capital is coming out on top in a competition where no one in germany is ultimately losing out .
according to the german institute of economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , more than 1,000 film and television enterprises are currently taking advantage of berlin ’ s allure . all in all , it adds up to a satisfying backdrop for the glamour that the german capital will be host to for the next ten days . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de column : cuddling at the berlinale berlin ’ s film festival is a glamorous affair , but not for this average movie-fan , who is having a tough time getting access .

british prime minister tony blair has said he might join an increasing number of eu countries that want to initially bar low-cost workers from new european union countries from working in the west . while the expansion of the eu by ten member states in may this year is seen by many as a historical milestone , it has also raised fears of mass migration of labor from the poorer , mostly ex-communist new members to the more affluent west .
eu skeptics say a large influx of low-wage workers would prove devastating to current members of the bloc , who are already facing stubbornly high unemployment rates .
prime minister tony blair told parliament on wednesday that he was re-evaluating his earlier stance on the issue , and might advocate imposing immigration controls and welfare benefit restrictions on immigrants from the 10 new countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair “ it is important that we recognize that there is a potential risk from these accession countries , ” blair -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliament .
“ we will take whatever measures are necessary to make sure that the ‘ pull factor ’ which might draw people here is closed off . ”
the draw , he said , could be britain ’ s welfare benefit system , and it would be re-examined to determined whether it was “ too generous . ”
change of heart britain ’ s new jumpiness about eastern migration comes in the wake of sweden ’ s decision last week to impose limits on workers from the new eu countries .
the netherlands also said recently it would impose a limit on the number of immigrant workers it would accept .
norway , though not an eu member but with close ties to the bloc , said on thursday it is also exploring possible restrictions , although it has previously stated its borders would be open to new eu citizens .
“ we now see that some of our neighboring countries , and now sweden , state that they will have some exceptions for some years , for an interim period , ” prime minister kjell magne bondevik told reporters on thursday after talks with european commission president romano prodi .
“ so we also now … intend to make a proposal for parliament about some possible exceptions for an interim period so we are more in line with our neighboring countries . ” for two years after enlargement , labor market access with depend on national policies , and not be dictated by brussels .
according to the european commission , only about half the 15 member states have told the eu about their plans .
austria , finland , belgium , france and denmark are planning limits , in some cases for up to seven years .
only ireland and spain have said they will keep their borders open .
germany , with its high unemployment and generous welfare system , insisted in 2002 during entry negotiations for the new candidate countries on a clause that would allow it to impose restrictions to its market for citizens from central and eastern europe until 2011 .
second-class citizens ?
malta , cyprus , estonia , latvia , lithuania , hungary , poland , slovakia , slovenia and the czech republic will become official members of the eu in may of this year . in the past months , tension between current and future members of the eu has increased on a number of issues .
the about-turns on work policy are likely to deepen the fear among many in the accession countries that they will be treated as second-class european citizens .
“ the thinking that we need long transition periods 14 years after the fall of the berlin wall shows a lack of solidarity , ” jan figiel , slovakia ’ s candidate for the european commission , told reuters .
the new members point to one of the fundaments of the eu project — free movement of persons including the right to live and work in another member state .
but as the eu prepares to take in 75 million new people , mostly from countries formerly part of the soviet bloc where wages were lower , fears have been growing of an influx of labor in search of a better standard of living .
the unease has been especially strong in germany , which , since 1990 , has attracted about 75 percent of the migrants to the eu from application countries .
unfounded fears experts , however , note that history teaches that such fears have generally been without foundation .
in previous eu enlargement periods , such as greece in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 , transitional measures such as labor restrictions were put into place , largely unnecessarily .
other alarms about east-west migration have proven false .

british prime minister tony blair has said he might join an increasing number of eu countries that want to initially bar low-cost workers from new european union countries from working in the west . while the expansion of the eu by ten member states in may this year is seen by many as a historical milestone , it has also raised fears of mass migration of labor from the poorer , mostly ex-communist new members to the more affluent west .
eu skeptics say a large influx of low-wage workers would prove devastating to current members of the bloc , who are already facing stubbornly high unemployment rates .
prime minister tony blair told parliament on wednesday that he was re-evaluating his earlier stance on the issue , and might advocate imposing immigration controls and welfare benefit restrictions on immigrants from the 10 new countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair “ it is important that we recognize that there is a potential risk from these accession countries , ” blair -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliament .
“ we will take whatever measures are necessary to make sure that the ‘ pull factor ’ which might draw people here is closed off . ”
the draw , he said , could be britain ’ s welfare benefit system , and it would be re-examined to determined whether it was “ too generous . ”
change of heart britain ’ s new jumpiness about eastern migration comes in the wake of sweden ’ s decision last week to impose limits on workers from the new eu countries .
the netherlands also said recently it would impose a limit on the number of immigrant workers it would accept .
norway , though not an eu member but with close ties to the bloc , said on thursday it is also exploring possible restrictions , although it has previously stated its borders would be open to new eu citizens .
“ we now see that some of our neighboring countries , and now sweden , state that they will have some exceptions for some years , for an interim period , ” prime minister kjell magne bondevik told reporters on thursday after talks with european commission president romano prodi .
“ so we also now … intend to make a proposal for parliament about some possible exceptions for an interim period so we are more in line with our neighboring countries . ” for two years after enlargement , labor market access with depend on national policies , and not be dictated by brussels .
according to the european commission , only about half the 15 member states have told the eu about their plans .
austria , finland , belgium , france and denmark are planning limits , in some cases for up to seven years .
only ireland and spain have said they will keep their borders open .
germany , with its high unemployment and generous welfare system , insisted in 2002 during entry negotiations for the new candidate countries on a clause that would allow it to impose restrictions to its market for citizens from central and eastern europe until 2011 .
second-class citizens ?
malta , cyprus , estonia , latvia , lithuania , hungary , poland , slovakia , slovenia and the czech republic will become official members of the eu in may of this year . in the past months , tension between current and future members of the eu has increased on a number of issues .
the about-turns on work policy are likely to deepen the fear among many in the accession countries that they will be treated as second-class european citizens .
“ the thinking that we need long transition periods 14 years after the fall of the berlin wall shows a lack of solidarity , ” jan figiel , slovakia ’ s candidate for the european commission , told reuters .
the new members point to one of the fundaments of the eu project — free movement of persons including the right to live and work in another member state .
but as the eu prepares to take in 75 million new people , mostly from countries formerly part of the soviet bloc where wages were lower , fears have been growing of an influx of labor in search of a better standard of living .
the unease has been especially strong in germany , which , since 1990 , has attracted about 75 percent of the migrants to the eu from application countries .
unfounded fears experts , however , note that history teaches that such fears have generally been without foundation .
in previous eu enlargement periods , such as greece in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 , transitional measures such as labor restrictions were put into place , largely unnecessarily .
other alarms about east-west migration have proven false .
one example is a 1989 study by the u.n. high commission for refugees which estimated that 25 million people from the eastern europe would move to the west in the 1990s .
in the end , fewer than one-tenth that number did so . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 2004 expected to be a tough year for eu as the eu expands from 15 to 25 members in may , unity will become more difficult .
already there is substantial dissent from the founding members of the bloc .

30 , 2003 -rrb- eu enlargement : what comes next ?
the yes vote in latvia marks the beginning of the next phase of eu enlargement , culminating in the official entry of 10 new members in may 2004 .

european papers on thursday focused on u.s. democratic presidential front-runner john kerry ’ s success on the campaign trail .
most warned kerry had his work cut out if he was to dislodge bush from the white house . u.s. presidential candidate john kerry won five of seven democratic primaries on tuesday .
dutch left-leaning paper volkskrant wrote that kerry ’ s success was based on the fact that " he ’ s trusted and seen as capable of being elected by many " as well as on his prestige that he built up as a vietnam veteran and during his long stint in the u.s. senate .
" but so far his election campaign has seldom witnessed sweeping enthusiasm .
one is still waiting for a political message that can stir american voters to entrust the highest post in the country to an acting senator for the first time since the days of john f. kennedy , " the daily concluded .
" can john kerry chase george w. bush out of the white house ? "
french daily liberation asked and added that the question had taken on new urgency since kerry appeared to have good chances of being pitched as the democrats ’ presidential candidate .
the paper mused that if the voters had already made kerry a favorite or planned to do so , it was because they are convinced that he can be elected .
" in paris kerry has already been declared as the most likely democratic presidential hopeful , " it wrote .
" but to defeat an acting president , even a beleaguered one , the candidate must have outstanding qualities and the circumstances need to be exceptional , " the broadsheet cautioned .
the independent in london said if there is one lesson to be drawn from past american president campaigns , it is that favorites whether for nominations or for the white house become the target of brickbats as soon as they are identified .
the paper expected the other democrat hopefuls to turn their fire on the front-runner .
" kerry has proved his appeal to voters in the north , east , center and southwest of the country , he has attracted all classes , white americans and hispanics . "
but the daily warned , " kerry must prepare himself for whatever the other candidates may dig up to use against him and dampen his voter appeal . "
belgian daily le soir was optimistic that kerry ’ s surging popularity had the potential to unseat president bush .
" everywhere the voter turnout has broken records , a sign for the mobilization of democrat followers to remove the president from the white house , " the paper wrote .
" but more than the surveys that show that john kerry and john edwards will defeat him , it ’ s this resoluteness that must be unnerving george bush because if affects states -lrb- missouri and arizona -rrb- that he -lrb- bush -rrb- won only narrowly in 2000 . "
" a democratic people , who are in unanimous agreement that george w. bush must go , are pinning their hopes on john kerry and to a lesser extent on john edwards .
but is john kerry really the man to execute that goal ? " asked zürich-based swiss daily tages-anzeiger .
the paper pointed out that though kerry had acquired the reputation of a solid and sound politician during his long years in the washington senate , he was definitely not a visionary .
the senator may possess the necessary stature , but his readiness to take on political risks still needs to be proven , the daily stressed .
liberal austrian daily der standard opined that john kerry had hit the right note in his election campaign .
" kerry has – just like his rival john edwards – always struck a mildly populist tone in his campaign and portrayed bush , not without reason , as the president of ‘ corporate america ’ , of the rich and the powerful , " it wrote .
the daily added that as the husband of a rich heiress who owns a billion-dollar ketchup company , kerry wasn ’ t exactly in danger of ending up on the streets anytime soon .
" but he -lrb- kerry -rrb- has still understood the importance of profiling himself as the advocate of the lower and middle classes in the u.s. , who are reeling from the enron scandal and the latest tax cuts by the government and do n't have much to laugh about under bush . "
norway ’ s conservative aftenposten observed that john kerry seems to have the tail wind behind him , judging by his success so far in the primary elections .
" however , kerry must master a difficult balancing act with regard to wooing voters and keeping the ones who support him already , " the paper warned .
" the key is the level of criticism kerry may use against the other candidates , which if too personal and petty , could repel voters , " the daily wrote .
germany ’ s conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung admired the activist zeal the democrats have shown in recent months .
" they ’ re positively burning with the desire to get george bush out of the white house with a fury that is strategically focussed , " the paper wrote .
but it added , " the democrats are seeking the most electable candidate which will be quite a challenge in a country that is so deeply divided . "
italian daily la repubblica reflected that it ’ s still a long way off till the u.s. presidential election and the fortunes of the democrats could rise and fall by then .
" this long journey to the american presidential polls is marked by tides that rise and devour candidates and their hopes everyday .
today they appear to let bush sink and let his two opponents rise , the nth ‘ new kennedy ’ , senator john forbes kerry and right after him the ‘ new clinton ’ , southerner john edwards .
the winds of optimism are allowing the hopes of the democrats to take off right now . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback do you think kerry can beat bush ?

last year was an outstanding year for german cinema .
now , as the 54th international film festival berlin kicks off , it ’ s time for the stars of germany ’ s film industry to sit back and enjoy the attention . the berlinale gets underway on thursday with film fans flocking to the german capital to bask in the warm celebrity glow of the global stars and directors who will be arriving throughout the ten days of glamour and glitz .
but it will not only be the heat from the bright lights that will warm berliners attending the shows and events that make up the festival circus .
germans from all over the country can also revel in the feeling of pride that berlin ’ s film gala and the german movie industry as a whole is currently enjoying a surge in international profile , popularity and profit .
“ it 's been one of the best years ever for cinema in germany , ” said dieter kosslick , the festival ’ s director who has turned the berlinale into a showcase for german productions and has helped it secure its place behind cannes and alongside venice as one of europe 's three most important film festivals .
“ as long as i 'm the head of this festival , its backing for german films will remain high , ” kosslick said in an interview with reporters in the run-up to the festival ’ s opening .
“ i 've never had to push for german films because i 've always found them to be very good .
it was always other people who had problems with them . ”
from nowhere to a miracle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german director caroline link holds the oscar for " nowhere in africa . "
those problems have been fading ever since “ nowhere in africa , ” a film about the challenges facing a jewish family who flee to kenya after the nazis take power , won the academy award for best foreign language movie last march .
that oscar and a string of domestic box office hits have put germany ’ s film industry back into the international spotlight .
“ it 's obviously been a great year for german film , ” said rolf baehr , chairman of the german film board , in an interview with reuters .
“ german films are now reaching audiences with good stories . ”
“ film makers are concentrating on viewers more and not focused on their own self-realization .
the experience and training are also greatly improved .
it 's all coming together . ”
the successes of films such as “ good bye , lenin ” - the comedy about a son who conceals the fall of the berlin wall from his ailing mother , and the world war ii drama “ rosenstrasse " , has helped the domestic market share climb to about 15 percent in 2003 from around 11 percent the year before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good bye , lenin .
hello success .
“ good bye , lenin , ” which won six european film awards in december , topped germany 's box office last year with over 6.5 million people turning out to see the film , generating nearly € 31.9 million -lrb- $ 40 million -rrb- .
“ the miracle of bern ” , a film about west germany 's 1954 world cup winning soccer team , and the biopic “ luther ” also scored with audiences inside and outside germany , and film makers are hopeful the festival will herald another big year .
interest in german films rises “ thanks to caroline link 's oscar -lrb- for nowhere in africa -rrb- , there 's now a lot more interest in german films from abroad , " said romuald karmaker , a german director whose film “ nightsongs ” is one of 23 competing for the top golden bear awards .
the director told reporters : “ the entire atmosphere is completely different now , ” referring to the past when the berlinale featured very few german films in its program .
“ the attention we 're getting now is absolutely essential . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katja riemann holds the " coppa volpi " for best actress at the 60th venice film festival .
apart from director link ’ s oscar , germany ’ s profile has also been raised by performances - katja riemann -lrb- picture -rrb- won a best actress award at the venice film festival in september for her performance in as the aryan wife of a jew in nazi germany in “ rosenstrasse ” - and the use of german locations in major hollywood productions .
location of choice “ enemy at the gates , ” the star-studded depiction of the siege of stalingrad during world war ii , was filmed at the refurbished babelsberg studios south of berlin . hollywood star matt damon has rekindled his german links in the latest installment of his spy franchise by filming “ the bourne supremacy , ” the sequel to the franka potente co-starring original “ the bourne identity , ” in berlin .
oscar winner kevin spacey is also directing his film “ beyond the sea ” in the german capital .
berlin has been in direct competition with the three other major media metropolises in germany - hamburg , cologne and munich - for the favor of the film-makers .
and it seems that the capital is coming out on top in a competition where no one in germany is ultimately losing out .
according to the german institute of economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , more than 1,000 film and television enterprises are currently taking advantage of berlin ’ s allure . all in all , it adds up to a satisfying backdrop for the glamour that the german capital will be host to for the next ten days . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de column : cuddling at the berlinale berlin ’ s film festival is a glamorous affair , but not for this average movie-fan , who is having a tough time getting access .

british prime minister tony blair has said he might join an increasing number of eu countries that want to initially bar low-cost workers from new european union countries from working in the west . while the expansion of the eu by ten member states in may this year is seen by many as a historical milestone , it has also raised fears of mass migration of labor from the poorer , mostly ex-communist new members to the more affluent west .
eu skeptics say a large influx of low-wage workers would prove devastating to current members of the bloc , who are already facing stubbornly high unemployment rates .
prime minister tony blair told parliament on wednesday that he was re-evaluating his earlier stance on the issue , and might advocate imposing immigration controls and welfare benefit restrictions on immigrants from the 10 new countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair “ it is important that we recognize that there is a potential risk from these accession countries , ” blair -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliament .
“ we will take whatever measures are necessary to make sure that the ‘ pull factor ’ which might draw people here is closed off . ”
the draw , he said , could be britain ’ s welfare benefit system , and it would be re-examined to determined whether it was “ too generous . ”
change of heart britain ’ s new jumpiness about eastern migration comes in the wake of sweden ’ s decision last week to impose limits on workers from the new eu countries .
the netherlands also said recently it would impose a limit on the number of immigrant workers it would accept .
norway , though not an eu member but with close ties to the bloc , said on thursday it is also exploring possible restrictions , although it has previously stated its borders would be open to new eu citizens .
“ we now see that some of our neighboring countries , and now sweden , state that they will have some exceptions for some years , for an interim period , ” prime minister kjell magne bondevik told reporters on thursday after talks with european commission president romano prodi .
“ so we also now … intend to make a proposal for parliament about some possible exceptions for an interim period so we are more in line with our neighboring countries . ” for two years after enlargement , labor market access with depend on national policies , and not be dictated by brussels .
according to the european commission , only about half the 15 member states have told the eu about their plans .
austria , finland , belgium , france and denmark are planning limits , in some cases for up to seven years .
only ireland and spain have said they will keep their borders open .
germany , with its high unemployment and generous welfare system , insisted in 2002 during entry negotiations for the new candidate countries on a clause that would allow it to impose restrictions to its market for citizens from central and eastern europe until 2011 .
second-class citizens ?
malta , cyprus , estonia , latvia , lithuania , hungary , poland , slovakia , slovenia and the czech republic will become official members of the eu in may of this year . in the past months , tension between current and future members of the eu has increased on a number of issues .
the about-turns on work policy are likely to deepen the fear among many in the accession countries that they will be treated as second-class european citizens .
“ the thinking that we need long transition periods 14 years after the fall of the berlin wall shows a lack of solidarity , ” jan figiel , slovakia ’ s candidate for the european commission , told reuters .
the new members point to one of the fundaments of the eu project — free movement of persons including the right to live and work in another member state .
but as the eu prepares to take in 75 million new people , mostly from countries formerly part of the soviet bloc where wages were lower , fears have been growing of an influx of labor in search of a better standard of living .
the unease has been especially strong in germany , which , since 1990 , has attracted about 75 percent of the migrants to the eu from application countries .
unfounded fears experts , however , note that history teaches that such fears have generally been without foundation .
in previous eu enlargement periods , such as greece in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 , transitional measures such as labor restrictions were put into place , largely unnecessarily .
other alarms about east-west migration have proven false .
one example is a 1989 study by the u.n. high commission for refugees which estimated that 25 million people from the eastern europe would move to the west in the 1990s .

a few weeks before it was to hit the presses , a german publishing house pulled a book based on the secret porn industry of the third reich .
the reasons remain unclear . any book that attempts to shed light on the little-known nazi porn industry in the early 1940s is not likely to arrive in bookstores without a hitch .
but when the rowohlt publishing house completely cancelled its contract with author thor kunkel shortly before his new novel , " endstufe " -lrb- final step -rrb- , was to hit the presses , a slight sensation rippled through the industry .
little is being said by rowohlt and its head alexander fest about the reasons for the cancellation of the for-march planned release .
a statement by rowohlt mentioned something about not being able to bridge differences on questions on the " aesthetic and subject matter " in central parts of the book .
the manuscript , which landed in the hands of the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , was apparently not only filled with scenes of vivid sex and brutality , but made some questionable ties between the crimes of the allied army and those of the nazi regime .
kunkel is reportedly devastated by the cancellation of a book he spent three years researching and writing .
" i had the impression at a certain point that -lrb- the book -rrb- was being edited on ideological , not aesthetic levels , " he said in an interview with die welt newspaper .
" and i saw that as censorship .
i 'm 40 years old .
i know what i 'm writing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kunkel , thor : das schwarzlicht-terrarium .
the frankfurt-born kunkel is considered a rising talent in german literary circles following his prize-winning 2000 debut , " das schwarzlicht-terrarium " , about the frankfurt drug and disco scene in the late 1970s .
porn traded for raw materials he came upon the subject material for " endstufe " after watching a documentary in 1991 that looked into the little-known porn industry that apparently flourished during the third reich .
after asking around , he eventually got in contact with someone who had copies of the so-called sachsenwald films .
the films are reportedly filled with with scenes of sex , power relations and violence .
they were rumored to have been part of a flourishing raw materials trade .
kunkel , based in amsterdam , moved to berlin to research the book , drawing upon witness testimony at the time , including a former actress in one of the films .
he forms his novel around a group of nazi scientists who work at a secret service clinic and produce porn films on the side .
the films are soon a major success and part of a trade network that stretches throughout the wider war zone .
the author infuses the description of the group of scientists with an end of the world attitude .
the characters are apparently self-indulgent and blissfully ignorant of the horrors of the concentration camps or battlefield misery , both of which are dealt with only fleetingly , according to the frankfurter allgemeine .
nazi theme should n't be too hot for germany no one seems to know for sure what combination of themes scared the publisher off : whether it was because it was novel that belittled the horrors of the nazi period , or whether kunkel documented the scientific experimentation at the time with a bit too much fascination .
fest , who recently cancelled a book called " i too , had to kill " by an israeli secret service agent , in a letter referred to the fact that kunkel 's work and subject matter could reap a hefty amount of criticism .
but kunkel seems nonplussed by such arguments .
" germany is a very normal european country , " he said in the welt interview .
" i do n't think we should be raised as humiliated , mentally-disturbed garden gnomes .
endstufe is written in a very modern language .
it 's not a historical novel .
instead , you have the feeling that the third reich is just around the corner . " dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback do you think the publishing company was right in pulling the book ?

a few weeks before it was to hit the presses , a german publishing house pulled a book based on the secret porn industry of the third reich .
the reasons remain unclear . any book that attempts to shed light on the little-known nazi porn industry in the early 1940s is not likely to arrive in bookstores without a hitch .
but when the rowohlt publishing house completely cancelled its contract with author thor kunkel shortly before his new novel , " endstufe " -lrb- final step -rrb- , was to hit the presses , a slight sensation rippled through the industry .
little is being said by rowohlt and its head alexander fest about the reasons for the cancellation of the for-march planned release .
a statement by rowohlt mentioned something about not being able to bridge differences on questions on the " aesthetic and subject matter " in central parts of the book .
the manuscript , which landed in the hands of the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , was apparently not only filled with scenes of vivid sex and brutality , but made some questionable ties between the crimes of the allied army and those of the nazi regime .
kunkel is reportedly devastated by the cancellation of a book he spent three years researching and writing .
" i had the impression at a certain point that -lrb- the book -rrb- was being edited on ideological , not aesthetic levels , " he said in an interview with die welt newspaper .
" and i saw that as censorship .
i 'm 40 years old .
i know what i 'm writing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kunkel , thor : das schwarzlicht-terrarium .
the frankfurt-born kunkel is considered a rising talent in german literary circles following his prize-winning 2000 debut , " das schwarzlicht-terrarium " , about the frankfurt drug and disco scene in the late 1970s .
porn traded for raw materials he came upon the subject material for " endstufe " after watching a documentary in 1991 that looked into the little-known porn industry that apparently flourished during the third reich .
after asking around , he eventually got in contact with someone who had copies of the so-called sachsenwald films .
the films are reportedly filled with with scenes of sex , power relations and violence .
they were rumored to have been part of a flourishing raw materials trade .
kunkel , based in amsterdam , moved to berlin to research the book , drawing upon witness testimony at the time , including a former actress in one of the films .
he forms his novel around a group of nazi scientists who work at a secret service clinic and produce porn films on the side .
the films are soon a major success and part of a trade network that stretches throughout the wider war zone .
the author infuses the description of the group of scientists with an end of the world attitude .
the characters are apparently self-indulgent and blissfully ignorant of the horrors of the concentration camps or battlefield misery , both of which are dealt with only fleetingly , according to the frankfurter allgemeine .
nazi theme should n't be too hot for germany no one seems to know for sure what combination of themes scared the publisher off : whether it was because it was novel that belittled the horrors of the nazi period , or whether kunkel documented the scientific experimentation at the time with a bit too much fascination .
fest , who recently cancelled a book called " i too , had to kill " by an israeli secret service agent , in a letter referred to the fact that kunkel 's work and subject matter could reap a hefty amount of criticism .
but kunkel seems nonplussed by such arguments .
" germany is a very normal european country , " he said in the welt interview .
" i do n't think we should be raised as humiliated , mentally-disturbed garden gnomes .
endstufe is written in a very modern language .
it 's not a historical novel .
instead , you have the feeling that the third reich is just around the corner . " dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback do you think the publishing company was right in pulling the book ?

the french-german pharmaceutical company aventis announced growing profits for 2003 in an effort to ward off a hostile takeover bid from a smaller french drug firm . aventis reported that net profits for 2003 had increased by 17.5 percent to € 2.44 billion -lrb- $ 3.07 billion -rrb- .
earnings per share had also risen by 18.6 percent although a weakening dollar had led to a 4.5 percent drop in sales .
aventis chief executive igor landau presented the 2003 profits at a press conference in london to make the case that the company is strong enough to stand on its own and can reject a € 48 billion -lrb- $ 60.4 billion -rrb- hostile takeover bid from the french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthélabo .
" today 's announcement highlights how sanofi 's offer fundamentally undervalues aventis , " said landau .
" their hostile bid is a cheap attempt to transfer their risks to our shareholders , " he added .
landau had previously hinted that there were other drug firms that would make better partners for aventis , suggesting that sanofi was using the hostile bid to avoid becoming a target of a takeover itself – a fact not disputed by sanofi 's executive board .
" they need us , but we do n't need them , ” said landau last week .
merger to create european drug giant sanofi-synthélabo made the grab for aventis on monday offering five of its shares and € 69 for every six aventis shares .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquarters of french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo sa in paris .
dealers and analysts said the franco-german company 's concerted attempt to fend off sanofi 's bid would ultimately fail , but aventis would force its french rival to increase its offer by at least 15 percent .
sanofi is pushing for the creation of a new european drug giant which would have a stronger combined presence on the lucrative u.s. market .
aventis pointed out on thursday that it already has a strong presence there ; 38 percent of its core sales are made in the us .
a merger with sanofi would create the third largest pharmaceutical company in terms of global sales behind the u.s. giant pfizer inc. and the british firm glaxosmithkline plc .
with a combined net worth of € 16.6 billion , aventis currently ranks as the sixth largest pharmaceutical company in the world .
the other well known german chemical firm , bayer , comes in at place 18 with a combined net worth of € 4.3 billion .
france enthusiastic , germany worried about job losses the french government is said to be enthusiastic about the takeover bid which would create a pharmaceutical giant based in paris .
germany is less excited about the prospect .
federal economics minister wolfgang clement warned last week that a merger could result in job losses in germany if the company moves its focus to paris .
" the german government has a strong interest in strengthening aventis ' position in germany rather than weakening it , " he said .
a combination of sanofi 's 70,000 strong workforce with aventis ' 69,000 employees could result in as many as 10,000 job cuts in both germany and france .
trade unions have said the number of lost jobs could be closer to 25,000 .
aventis now employs some 9,000 german workers who loyally support their chief executive igor landau .
michael klippel the head of the works committee at aventis said , " we are confident because we believe he will fight .
he is not one of these managers who will sell out for a few marks . "
analysts say the takeover battle is extremely personal for the 59 year old igor landau .
he was instrumental in the merger of the french drug firm rhône-poulenc , where he had been an executive for many years , with one of germany 's largest pharmaceutical companies , hoechst .
the deal was the pinnacle of three decades of work and landau shed the firm 's chemical and agricultural operation to focus solely on drugs .
hostile takeovers rare in europe the battle being played out in london between aventis and sanofi is unusual for europe , where hostile takeover attempts are extremely rare .
while experts do n't expect there to be an increase in hostile bids , they do believe friendly mergers , like the one that created aventis , will continue .
according to some experts , smaller pharmaceuticals in europe soon wo n't be able to keep up with the giants .
professor klaus pohle sits on the board of directors of lion bioscience ag , a german software provider for drug companies .
he said german drug companies have lost their title as " chemists of the world " because of a research policy burdened with too much bureaucracy that serves to stifles innovation .
research and development vital to drug firms surviving the research , development and release of a new drug onto the market takes approximately 12 years .
then it takes another six to nine years before substantial profits are made .
pohle said the larger the pharmaceutical company , the more money and time it can invest in new projects and the less money is lost when a project fails .
experts say even if sanofi 's offer transforms itself into a friendly one , landau , like many chief executives whose company has been targeted by a hostile buyer , is unlikely to gain control of the new company .
if the sanofi bid fails , the smaller french firm is likely to be next in line for a hostile takeover bid .
aventis shares on thursday were up 0.7 percent after comfortably beating forecast profits , while suitor sanofi-synthélabo stayed at 2.8 percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis moves to prevent hostile takeover french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo wants to acquire the franco-german drug-maker aventis in a hostile takeover .

the french-german pharmaceutical company aventis announced growing profits for 2003 in an effort to ward off a hostile takeover bid from a smaller french drug firm . aventis reported that net profits for 2003 had increased by 17.5 percent to € 2.44 billion -lrb- $ 3.07 billion -rrb- .
earnings per share had also risen by 18.6 percent although a weakening dollar had led to a 4.5 percent drop in sales .
aventis chief executive igor landau presented the 2003 profits at a press conference in london to make the case that the company is strong enough to stand on its own and can reject a € 48 billion -lrb- $ 60.4 billion -rrb- hostile takeover bid from the french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthélabo .
" today 's announcement highlights how sanofi 's offer fundamentally undervalues aventis , " said landau .
" their hostile bid is a cheap attempt to transfer their risks to our shareholders , " he added .
landau had previously hinted that there were other drug firms that would make better partners for aventis , suggesting that sanofi was using the hostile bid to avoid becoming a target of a takeover itself – a fact not disputed by sanofi 's executive board .
" they need us , but we do n't need them , ” said landau last week .
merger to create european drug giant sanofi-synthélabo made the grab for aventis on monday offering five of its shares and € 69 for every six aventis shares .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquarters of french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo sa in paris .
dealers and analysts said the franco-german company 's concerted attempt to fend off sanofi 's bid would ultimately fail , but aventis would force its french rival to increase its offer by at least 15 percent .
sanofi is pushing for the creation of a new european drug giant which would have a stronger combined presence on the lucrative u.s. market .
aventis pointed out on thursday that it already has a strong presence there ; 38 percent of its core sales are made in the us .
a merger with sanofi would create the third largest pharmaceutical company in terms of global sales behind the u.s. giant pfizer inc. and the british firm glaxosmithkline plc .
with a combined net worth of € 16.6 billion , aventis currently ranks as the sixth largest pharmaceutical company in the world .
the other well known german chemical firm , bayer , comes in at place 18 with a combined net worth of € 4.3 billion .
france enthusiastic , germany worried about job losses the french government is said to be enthusiastic about the takeover bid which would create a pharmaceutical giant based in paris .
germany is less excited about the prospect .
federal economics minister wolfgang clement warned last week that a merger could result in job losses in germany if the company moves its focus to paris .
" the german government has a strong interest in strengthening aventis ' position in germany rather than weakening it , " he said .
a combination of sanofi 's 70,000 strong workforce with aventis ' 69,000 employees could result in as many as 10,000 job cuts in both germany and france .
trade unions have said the number of lost jobs could be closer to 25,000 .
aventis now employs some 9,000 german workers who loyally support their chief executive igor landau .
michael klippel the head of the works committee at aventis said , " we are confident because we believe he will fight .
he is not one of these managers who will sell out for a few marks . "
analysts say the takeover battle is extremely personal for the 59 year old igor landau .
he was instrumental in the merger of the french drug firm rhône-poulenc , where he had been an executive for many years , with one of germany 's largest pharmaceutical companies , hoechst .
the deal was the pinnacle of three decades of work and landau shed the firm 's chemical and agricultural operation to focus solely on drugs .
hostile takeovers rare in europe the battle being played out in london between aventis and sanofi is unusual for europe , where hostile takeover attempts are extremely rare .
while experts do n't expect there to be an increase in hostile bids , they do believe friendly mergers , like the one that created aventis , will continue .
according to some experts , smaller pharmaceuticals in europe soon wo n't be able to keep up with the giants .
professor klaus pohle sits on the board of directors of lion bioscience ag , a german software provider for drug companies .
he said german drug companies have lost their title as " chemists of the world " because of a research policy burdened with too much bureaucracy that serves to stifles innovation .

nato defense chiefs will meet in munich this weekend to discuss the alliance 's role in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere .
the hope is that the meeting will be more cordial than last year . nato defense and foreign ministers will gather in munich on friday to discuss the lingering fallout from the iraq war and the future direction of the alliance .
it will be the 40th annual meeting for the german security conference . the big names of the defense world , an estimated 250 officials including pentagon chief donald rumsfeld are due to attend , will use the informal get-together to address transatlantic relations , the future of nato , and current developments in the middle east . they will also likely to take the opportunity to discuss extending the alliance 's role in afghanistan while in the bavarian capital , according to diplomats in brussels . iraq situation will again dominate agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the main focus will undoubtedly be the situation in iraq , even more so now inquiries have been launched into intelligence failures in the united states and britain regarding the lack of evidence in the search for weapons of mass destruction a year after the war began . the u.s. delegation is also likely to continue with its pressure to get nato to play a role in iraq as part of washington ’ s current initiative to solicit wider contributions from its member states . last year 's munich conference was a highly tense affair with officials from washington , paris and berlin on edge as a un security council vote on a new iraq resolution loomed ominously near .
rumsfeld and german foreign minister joschka fischer famously clashed at the event and will meet again on friday with hopefully less static in the air between them . security conference host horst teltschik told reporters in munich that some reconciliation is likely .
" i get the impression that the americans want to give us a sign that they are prepared to talk so that both sides can get back to a ' normal ' relationship . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish soldiers in the ancient city of babylon , 80 kilometers south of baghdad , iraq .
new nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer said last week that the alliance , which is supporting the polish-led division in iraq , is ready and able to do the job .
" if the question comes , it goes without saying that i 'm very much in favour of a nato role , " he told journalists , before adding : " it 's too early to say exactly what that role will be . " despite making favourable noises in the direction of the united states in the form of low-key discussions , most nato officials remain resolute that no action will be taken before sovereignty is transferred from the u.s.-appointed interim leadership to the iraqis , a move that has been pencilled in for june . isaf 's afghan mission to be addressed the defense ministers will also consider the success of its continuing mission in afghanistan .
when the alliance took over command last august of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- it was nato 's first mission outside europe .
since then , the command of the mission , which has until now been centered on the capital kabul , has been rotated between member countries , with canada currently in control . nato wants to extend isaf 's operations beyond the capital kabul , notably using german troops , but it is having trouble with resources .
" i think that there is political will , but translating it into terms of concrete forces on the ground is more difficult and that is our challenge " said britain 's ambassador to nato peter ricketts in a press conference in brussels this week . eurocorps ready to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurocorps in mülheim , germany .
the landscape of nato ’ s role in afghanistan is likely to change further after officials announced on wednesday that the five-nation eurocorps army is ready to take the lead in the afghan peacekeeping mission later this year .
the eurocorps was recognized in 2002 as a nato high readiness force and has already carried out peacekeeping duties in kosovo and bosnia . with plans to be released and confirmed in the coming days , the 60,000-strong force - made up of troops from germany , france , spain , belgium and luxembourg - would more than likely be ready to assume control of the kabul-based mission by the summer .
it was not immediately clear how many of its soldiers would leave for afghanistan , as part of the 5,500-strong isaf . ministers from the five eurocorps nations are scheduled to meet on the margins of the munich meeting to discuss taking on the headquarters role . washington calls for nato engagement in mid-east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the middle east situation is also on the agenda .
elsewhere at the munich conference , officials will analyze the possibilities of nato involvement in the middle east - a topic that could both provide grounds for transatlantic consensus but may also be a source of further tensions . the united states is eager for nato to engage in the middle east to help build regional stability , and around six middle east and northern african nations , including israel and egypt , are being invited to the alliance summit in istanbul in june . observers expect lively discussion to be generated by the attendance of several middle east delegations in munich , discussions on developments in iran , israel 's " security fence " in and around the west bank and its decision to dismantle some jewish settlements . the fireworks may not be solely reserved for the conference either .
protests are expected and around 21 rallies have been planned before the meeting finishes on sunday with some 4,000 police being mobilized in munich .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.02.2004 european press review : can kerry beat bush ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. john kerry is on course in the race to find a democratic challenger to president bush .
european papers on thursday focused on u.s. democratic presidential front-runner john kerry ’ s success on the campaign trail .
most warned kerry had his work cut out if he was to dislodge bush from the white house . u.s. presidential candidate john kerry won five of seven democratic primaries on tuesday .
dutch left-leaning paper volkskrant wrote that kerry ’ s success was based on the fact that " he ’ s trusted and seen as capable of being elected by many " as well as on his prestige that he built up as a vietnam veteran and during his long stint in the u.s. senate .
" but so far his election campaign has seldom witnessed sweeping enthusiasm .
one is still waiting for a political message that can stir american voters to entrust the highest post in the country to an acting senator for the first time since the days of john f. kennedy , " the daily concluded .
" can john kerry chase george w. bush out of the white house ? "
french daily liberation asked and added that the question had taken on new urgency since kerry appeared to have good chances of being pitched as the democrats ’ presidential candidate .
the paper mused that if the voters had already made kerry a favorite or planned to do so , it was because they are convinced that he can be elected .
" in paris kerry has already been declared as the most likely democratic presidential hopeful , " it wrote .
" but to defeat an acting president , even a beleaguered one , the candidate must have outstanding qualities and the circumstances need to be exceptional , " the broadsheet cautioned .
the independent in london said if there is one lesson to be drawn from past american president campaigns , it is that favorites whether for nominations or for the white house become the target of brickbats as soon as they are identified .
the paper expected the other democrat hopefuls to turn their fire on the front-runner .
" kerry has proved his appeal to voters in the north , east , center and southwest of the country , he has attracted all classes , white americans and hispanics . "
but the daily warned , " kerry must prepare himself for whatever the other candidates may dig up to use against him and dampen his voter appeal . "
belgian daily le soir was optimistic that kerry ’ s surging popularity had the potential to unseat president bush .
" everywhere the voter turnout has broken records , a sign for the mobilization of democrat followers to remove the president from the white house , " the paper wrote .
" but more than the surveys that show that john kerry and john edwards will defeat him , it ’ s this resoluteness that must be unnerving george bush because if affects states -lrb- missouri and arizona -rrb- that he -lrb- bush -rrb- won only narrowly in 2000 . "
" a democratic people , who are in unanimous agreement that george w. bush must go , are pinning their hopes on john kerry and to a lesser extent on john edwards .
but is john kerry really the man to execute that goal ? " asked zürich-based swiss daily tages-anzeiger .
the paper pointed out that though kerry had acquired the reputation of a solid and sound politician during his long years in the washington senate , he was definitely not a visionary .
the senator may possess the necessary stature , but his readiness to take on political risks still needs to be proven , the daily stressed .
liberal austrian daily der standard opined that john kerry had hit the right note in his election campaign .
" kerry has – just like his rival john edwards – always struck a mildly populist tone in his campaign and portrayed bush , not without reason , as the president of ‘ corporate america ’ , of the rich and the powerful , " it wrote .
the daily added that as the husband of a rich heiress who owns a billion-dollar ketchup company , kerry wasn ’ t exactly in danger of ending up on the streets anytime soon .
" but he -lrb- kerry -rrb- has still understood the importance of profiling himself as the advocate of the lower and middle classes in the u.s. , who are reeling from the enron scandal and the latest tax cuts by the government and do n't have much to laugh about under bush . "
norway ’ s conservative aftenposten observed that john kerry seems to have the tail wind behind him , judging by his success so far in the primary elections .
" however , kerry must master a difficult balancing act with regard to wooing voters and keeping the ones who support him already , " the paper warned .
" the key is the level of criticism kerry may use against the other candidates , which if too personal and petty , could repel voters , " the daily wrote .
germany ’ s conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung admired the activist zeal the democrats have shown in recent months .
" they ’ re positively burning with the desire to get george bush out of the white house with a fury that is strategically focussed , " the paper wrote .
but it added , " the democrats are seeking the most electable candidate which will be quite a challenge in a country that is so deeply divided . "
italian daily la repubblica reflected that it ’ s still a long way off till the u.s. presidential election and the fortunes of the democrats could rise and fall by then .
" this long journey to the american presidential polls is marked by tides that rise and devour candidates and their hopes everyday .
today they appear to let bush sink and let his two opponents rise , the nth ‘ new kennedy ’ , senator john forbes kerry and right after him the ‘ new clinton ’ , southerner john edwards .
the winds of optimism are allowing the hopes of the democrats to take off right now . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback do you think kerry can beat bush ?

last year was an outstanding year for german cinema .
now , as the 54th international film festival berlin kicks off , it ’ s time for the stars of germany ’ s film industry to sit back and enjoy the attention . the berlinale gets underway on thursday with film fans flocking to the german capital to bask in the warm celebrity glow of the global stars and directors who will be arriving throughout the ten days of glamour and glitz .
but it will not only be the heat from the bright lights that will warm berliners attending the shows and events that make up the festival circus .
germans from all over the country can also revel in the feeling of pride that berlin ’ s film gala and the german movie industry as a whole is currently enjoying a surge in international profile , popularity and profit .
“ it 's been one of the best years ever for cinema in germany , ” said dieter kosslick , the festival ’ s director who has turned the berlinale into a showcase for german productions and has helped it secure its place behind cannes and alongside venice as one of europe 's three most important film festivals .
“ as long as i 'm the head of this festival , its backing for german films will remain high , ” kosslick said in an interview with reporters in the run-up to the festival ’ s opening .
“ i 've never had to push for german films because i 've always found them to be very good .
it was always other people who had problems with them . ”

european papers on thursday focused on u.s. democratic presidential front-runner john kerry ’ s success on the campaign trail .
most warned kerry had his work cut out if he was to dislodge bush from the white house . u.s. presidential candidate john kerry won five of seven democratic primaries on tuesday .
dutch left-leaning paper volkskrant wrote that kerry ’ s success was based on the fact that " he ’ s trusted and seen as capable of being elected by many " as well as on his prestige that he built up as a vietnam veteran and during his long stint in the u.s. senate .
" but so far his election campaign has seldom witnessed sweeping enthusiasm .
one is still waiting for a political message that can stir american voters to entrust the highest post in the country to an acting senator for the first time since the days of john f. kennedy , " the daily concluded .
" can john kerry chase george w. bush out of the white house ? "
french daily liberation asked and added that the question had taken on new urgency since kerry appeared to have good chances of being pitched as the democrats ’ presidential candidate .
the paper mused that if the voters had already made kerry a favorite or planned to do so , it was because they are convinced that he can be elected .
" in paris kerry has already been declared as the most likely democratic presidential hopeful , " it wrote .
" but to defeat an acting president , even a beleaguered one , the candidate must have outstanding qualities and the circumstances need to be exceptional , " the broadsheet cautioned .
the independent in london said if there is one lesson to be drawn from past american president campaigns , it is that favorites whether for nominations or for the white house become the target of brickbats as soon as they are identified .
the paper expected the other democrat hopefuls to turn their fire on the front-runner .
" kerry has proved his appeal to voters in the north , east , center and southwest of the country , he has attracted all classes , white americans and hispanics . "
but the daily warned , " kerry must prepare himself for whatever the other candidates may dig up to use against him and dampen his voter appeal . "
belgian daily le soir was optimistic that kerry ’ s surging popularity had the potential to unseat president bush .
" everywhere the voter turnout has broken records , a sign for the mobilization of democrat followers to remove the president from the white house , " the paper wrote .
" but more than the surveys that show that john kerry and john edwards will defeat him , it ’ s this resoluteness that must be unnerving george bush because if affects states -lrb- missouri and arizona -rrb- that he -lrb- bush -rrb- won only narrowly in 2000 . "
" a democratic people , who are in unanimous agreement that george w. bush must go , are pinning their hopes on john kerry and to a lesser extent on john edwards .
but is john kerry really the man to execute that goal ? " asked zürich-based swiss daily tages-anzeiger .
the paper pointed out that though kerry had acquired the reputation of a solid and sound politician during his long years in the washington senate , he was definitely not a visionary .
the senator may possess the necessary stature , but his readiness to take on political risks still needs to be proven , the daily stressed .
liberal austrian daily der standard opined that john kerry had hit the right note in his election campaign .
" kerry has – just like his rival john edwards – always struck a mildly populist tone in his campaign and portrayed bush , not without reason , as the president of ‘ corporate america ’ , of the rich and the powerful , " it wrote .
the daily added that as the husband of a rich heiress who owns a billion-dollar ketchup company , kerry wasn ’ t exactly in danger of ending up on the streets anytime soon .
" but he -lrb- kerry -rrb- has still understood the importance of profiling himself as the advocate of the lower and middle classes in the u.s. , who are reeling from the enron scandal and the latest tax cuts by the government and do n't have much to laugh about under bush . "
norway ’ s conservative aftenposten observed that john kerry seems to have the tail wind behind him , judging by his success so far in the primary elections .
" however , kerry must master a difficult balancing act with regard to wooing voters and keeping the ones who support him already , " the paper warned .
" the key is the level of criticism kerry may use against the other candidates , which if too personal and petty , could repel voters , " the daily wrote .
germany ’ s conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung admired the activist zeal the democrats have shown in recent months .
" they ’ re positively burning with the desire to get george bush out of the white house with a fury that is strategically focussed , " the paper wrote .
but it added , " the democrats are seeking the most electable candidate which will be quite a challenge in a country that is so deeply divided . "
italian daily la repubblica reflected that it ’ s still a long way off till the u.s. presidential election and the fortunes of the democrats could rise and fall by then .
" this long journey to the american presidential polls is marked by tides that rise and devour candidates and their hopes everyday .
today they appear to let bush sink and let his two opponents rise , the nth ‘ new kennedy ’ , senator john forbes kerry and right after him the ‘ new clinton ’ , southerner john edwards .
the winds of optimism are allowing the hopes of the democrats to take off right now . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback do you think kerry can beat bush ?

" but so far his election campaign has seldom witnessed sweeping enthusiasm .
one is still waiting for a political message that can stir american voters to entrust the highest post in the country to an acting senator for the first time since the days of john f. kennedy , " the daily concluded .
" can john kerry chase george w. bush out of the white house ? "
french daily liberation asked and added that the question had taken on new urgency since kerry appeared to have good chances of being pitched as the democrats ’ presidential candidate .
the paper mused that if the voters had already made kerry a favorite or planned to do so , it was because they are convinced that he can be elected .
" in paris kerry has already been declared as the most likely democratic presidential hopeful , " it wrote .
" but to defeat an acting president , even a beleaguered one , the candidate must have outstanding qualities and the circumstances need to be exceptional , " the broadsheet cautioned .
the independent in london said if there is one lesson to be drawn from past american president campaigns , it is that favorites whether for nominations or for the white house become the target of brickbats as soon as they are identified .
the paper expected the other democrat hopefuls to turn their fire on the front-runner .
" kerry has proved his appeal to voters in the north , east , center and southwest of the country , he has attracted all classes , white americans and hispanics . "
but the daily warned , " kerry must prepare himself for whatever the other candidates may dig up to use against him and dampen his voter appeal . "
belgian daily le soir was optimistic that kerry ’ s surging popularity had the potential to unseat president bush .
" everywhere the voter turnout has broken records , a sign for the mobilization of democrat followers to remove the president from the white house , " the paper wrote .
" but more than the surveys that show that john kerry and john edwards will defeat him , it ’ s this resoluteness that must be unnerving george bush because if affects states -lrb- missouri and arizona -rrb- that he -lrb- bush -rrb- won only narrowly in 2000 . "
" a democratic people , who are in unanimous agreement that george w. bush must go , are pinning their hopes on john kerry and to a lesser extent on john edwards .
but is john kerry really the man to execute that goal ? " asked zürich-based swiss daily tages-anzeiger .
the paper pointed out that though kerry had acquired the reputation of a solid and sound politician during his long years in the washington senate , he was definitely not a visionary .
the senator may possess the necessary stature , but his readiness to take on political risks still needs to be proven , the daily stressed .
liberal austrian daily der standard opined that john kerry had hit the right note in his election campaign .
" kerry has – just like his rival john edwards – always struck a mildly populist tone in his campaign and portrayed bush , not without reason , as the president of ‘ corporate america ’ , of the rich and the powerful , " it wrote .
the daily added that as the husband of a rich heiress who owns a billion-dollar ketchup company , kerry wasn ’ t exactly in danger of ending up on the streets anytime soon .
" but he -lrb- kerry -rrb- has still understood the importance of profiling himself as the advocate of the lower and middle classes in the u.s. , who are reeling from the enron scandal and the latest tax cuts by the government and do n't have much to laugh about under bush . "
norway ’ s conservative aftenposten observed that john kerry seems to have the tail wind behind him , judging by his success so far in the primary elections .
" however , kerry must master a difficult balancing act with regard to wooing voters and keeping the ones who support him already , " the paper warned .
" the key is the level of criticism kerry may use against the other candidates , which if too personal and petty , could repel voters , " the daily wrote .
germany ’ s conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung admired the activist zeal the democrats have shown in recent months .
" they ’ re positively burning with the desire to get george bush out of the white house with a fury that is strategically focussed , " the paper wrote .
but it added , " the democrats are seeking the most electable candidate which will be quite a challenge in a country that is so deeply divided . "
italian daily la repubblica reflected that it ’ s still a long way off till the u.s. presidential election and the fortunes of the democrats could rise and fall by then .
" this long journey to the american presidential polls is marked by tides that rise and devour candidates and their hopes everyday .
today they appear to let bush sink and let his two opponents rise , the nth ‘ new kennedy ’ , senator john forbes kerry and right after him the ‘ new clinton ’ , southerner john edwards .

the roller-coaster course of the five-month trial against abdelghani mzoudi left judges no choice but to acquit him , deutsche welle 's peter phillip writes in a commentary on thursday 's verdict . moroccan abdelghani mzoudi would have had to be extremely unlucky to be convicted of abetting the sept .
11 attacks in the united states .
germany ’ s federal prosecutors had charged him with exactly that and blamed the student for playing a role in the deaths of 3,066 people .
but the hamburg judges were n't convinced and they came back with the only verdict that seemed possible after the trial ’ s somewhat haphazard course : an acquittal . the trial became unfocused because politics and the legal system kept clashing .
supporting the fight against terrorism wholeheartedly is certainly backed by germans across the political spectrum , but this consensus starts crumbling as soon as this support requires blindly following the u.s. ’ s leadership .
especially if such allegiance requires throwing out the founding principles of the constitutional state . a hastened search for terrorists since the perpetrators of the sept .
11 attacks had stayed in germany as inconspicuous “ sleepers ” before the attacks , it was only natural that the german authorities would investigate their surroundings and search for accomplices to put them on trial .
one escaped – ramzi binalshibh – another , mounir al motassadeq , has been sentenced to 15 years in prison . whether this verdict will hold up is more than questionable after mzoudi ’ s acquittal .
real proof for motassadeq ’ s guilt does not exist .
what ’ s even more significant , much that normally would not have been accepted by a court seems to have been tolerated out of consideration for washington : the u.s. didn ’ t offer any legal assistance ; they didn ’ t allow interrogations of binalshibh or other incarcerated suspects and instead simply handed the german authorities quotes from their own interrogations , according to the sink-or-swim principle . prosecutors ridicule themselves the judge was already so annoyed by this in december that he released mzoudi from jail .
prosecutors didn ’ t like this at all and were led to ridicule themselves : one day before the verdict was supposed to be announced , they tried to turn the trial in a different direction by conjuring up an alleged witness .
the same happened again on thursday : hours before the verdict , supposedly new evidence was offered to the court . the judges stayed their course , as that ’ s no way to convict someone .
obviously this doesn ’ t say anything about mzoudi ’ s guilt or innocence , nor does it guarantee him a life in freedom .
he could be deported to his homeland , where he is likely to be arrested or even extradited to the united states . peter phillip send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .

the roller-coaster course of the five-month trial against abdelghani mzoudi left judges no choice but to acquit him , deutsche welle 's peter phillip writes in a commentary on thursday 's verdict . moroccan abdelghani mzoudi would have had to be extremely unlucky to be convicted of abetting the sept .
11 attacks in the united states .
germany ’ s federal prosecutors had charged him with exactly that and blamed the student for playing a role in the deaths of 3,066 people .
but the hamburg judges were n't convinced and they came back with the only verdict that seemed possible after the trial ’ s somewhat haphazard course : an acquittal . the trial became unfocused because politics and the legal system kept clashing .
supporting the fight against terrorism wholeheartedly is certainly backed by germans across the political spectrum , but this consensus starts crumbling as soon as this support requires blindly following the u.s. ’ s leadership .
especially if such allegiance requires throwing out the founding principles of the constitutional state . a hastened search for terrorists since the perpetrators of the sept .
11 attacks had stayed in germany as inconspicuous “ sleepers ” before the attacks , it was only natural that the german authorities would investigate their surroundings and search for accomplices to put them on trial .
one escaped – ramzi binalshibh – another , mounir al motassadeq , has been sentenced to 15 years in prison . whether this verdict will hold up is more than questionable after mzoudi ’ s acquittal .
real proof for motassadeq ’ s guilt does not exist .
what ’ s even more significant , much that normally would not have been accepted by a court seems to have been tolerated out of consideration for washington : the u.s. didn ’ t offer any legal assistance ; they didn ’ t allow interrogations of binalshibh or other incarcerated suspects and instead simply handed the german authorities quotes from their own interrogations , according to the sink-or-swim principle . prosecutors ridicule themselves the judge was already so annoyed by this in december that he released mzoudi from jail .
prosecutors didn ’ t like this at all and were led to ridicule themselves : one day before the verdict was supposed to be announced , they tried to turn the trial in a different direction by conjuring up an alleged witness .
the same happened again on thursday : hours before the verdict , supposedly new evidence was offered to the court . the judges stayed their course , as that ’ s no way to convict someone .
obviously this doesn ’ t say anything about mzoudi ’ s guilt or innocence , nor does it guarantee him a life in freedom .
he could be deported to his homeland , where he is likely to be arrested or even extradited to the united states . peter phillip send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .
11 terror suspect acquitted a hamburg court on thursday acquitted a moroccan charged with helping to prepare the sept .
11 attacks .
german officials have already said they plan to deport abdelghani mzoudi to his home country .

last year was an outstanding year for german cinema .
now , as the 54th international film festival berlin kicks off , it ’ s time for the stars of germany ’ s film industry to sit back and enjoy the attention . the berlinale gets underway on thursday with film fans flocking to the german capital to bask in the warm celebrity glow of the global stars and directors who will be arriving throughout the ten days of glamour and glitz .
but it will not only be the heat from the bright lights that will warm berliners attending the shows and events that make up the festival circus .
germans from all over the country can also revel in the feeling of pride that berlin ’ s film gala and the german movie industry as a whole is currently enjoying a surge in international profile , popularity and profit .
“ it 's been one of the best years ever for cinema in germany , ” said dieter kosslick , the festival ’ s director who has turned the berlinale into a showcase for german productions and has helped it secure its place behind cannes and alongside venice as one of europe 's three most important film festivals .
“ as long as i 'm the head of this festival , its backing for german films will remain high , ” kosslick said in an interview with reporters in the run-up to the festival ’ s opening .
“ i 've never had to push for german films because i 've always found them to be very good .
it was always other people who had problems with them . ”
from nowhere to a miracle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german director caroline link holds the oscar for " nowhere in africa . "
those problems have been fading ever since “ nowhere in africa , ” a film about the challenges facing a jewish family who flee to kenya after the nazis take power , won the academy award for best foreign language movie last march .
that oscar and a string of domestic box office hits have put germany ’ s film industry back into the international spotlight .
“ it 's obviously been a great year for german film , ” said rolf baehr , chairman of the german film board , in an interview with reuters .
“ german films are now reaching audiences with good stories . ”
“ film makers are concentrating on viewers more and not focused on their own self-realization .
the experience and training are also greatly improved .
it 's all coming together . ”
the successes of films such as “ good bye , lenin ” - the comedy about a son who conceals the fall of the berlin wall from his ailing mother , and the world war ii drama “ rosenstrasse " , has helped the domestic market share climb to about 15 percent in 2003 from around 11 percent the year before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good bye , lenin .
hello success .
“ good bye , lenin , ” which won six european film awards in december , topped germany 's box office last year with over 6.5 million people turning out to see the film , generating nearly € 31.9 million -lrb- $ 40 million -rrb- .
“ the miracle of bern ” , a film about west germany 's 1954 world cup winning soccer team , and the biopic “ luther ” also scored with audiences inside and outside germany , and film makers are hopeful the festival will herald another big year .
interest in german films rises “ thanks to caroline link 's oscar -lrb- for nowhere in africa -rrb- , there 's now a lot more interest in german films from abroad , " said romuald karmaker , a german director whose film “ nightsongs ” is one of 23 competing for the top golden bear awards .
the director told reporters : “ the entire atmosphere is completely different now , ” referring to the past when the berlinale featured very few german films in its program .
“ the attention we 're getting now is absolutely essential . ”

location of choice “ enemy at the gates , ” the star-studded depiction of the siege of stalingrad during world war ii , was filmed at the refurbished babelsberg studios south of berlin . hollywood star matt damon has rekindled his german links in the latest installment of his spy franchise by filming “ the bourne supremacy , ” the sequel to the franka potente co-starring original “ the bourne identity , ” in berlin .
oscar winner kevin spacey is also directing his film “ beyond the sea ” in the german capital .
berlin has been in direct competition with the three other major media metropolises in germany - hamburg , cologne and munich - for the favor of the film-makers .
and it seems that the capital is coming out on top in a competition where no one in germany is ultimately losing out .
according to the german institute of economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , more than 1,000 film and television enterprises are currently taking advantage of berlin ’ s allure . all in all , it adds up to a satisfying backdrop for the glamour that the german capital will be host to for the next ten days . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de column : cuddling at the berlinale berlin ’ s film festival is a glamorous affair , but not for this average movie-fan , who is having a tough time getting access .

the french-german pharmaceutical company aventis announced growing profits for 2003 in an effort to ward off a hostile takeover bid from a smaller french drug firm . aventis reported that net profits for 2003 had increased by 17.5 percent to € 2.44 billion -lrb- $ 3.07 billion -rrb- .
earnings per share had also risen by 18.6 percent although a weakening dollar had led to a 4.5 percent drop in sales .
aventis chief executive igor landau presented the 2003 profits at a press conference in london to make the case that the company is strong enough to stand on its own and can reject a € 48 billion -lrb- $ 60.4 billion -rrb- hostile takeover bid from the french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthélabo .
" today 's announcement highlights how sanofi 's offer fundamentally undervalues aventis , " said landau .
" their hostile bid is a cheap attempt to transfer their risks to our shareholders , " he added .
landau had previously hinted that there were other drug firms that would make better partners for aventis , suggesting that sanofi was using the hostile bid to avoid becoming a target of a takeover itself – a fact not disputed by sanofi 's executive board .
" they need us , but we do n't need them , ” said landau last week .
merger to create european drug giant sanofi-synthélabo made the grab for aventis on monday offering five of its shares and € 69 for every six aventis shares .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquarters of french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo sa in paris .
dealers and analysts said the franco-german company 's concerted attempt to fend off sanofi 's bid would ultimately fail , but aventis would force its french rival to increase its offer by at least 15 percent .
sanofi is pushing for the creation of a new european drug giant which would have a stronger combined presence on the lucrative u.s. market .
aventis pointed out on thursday that it already has a strong presence there ; 38 percent of its core sales are made in the us .
a merger with sanofi would create the third largest pharmaceutical company in terms of global sales behind the u.s. giant pfizer inc. and the british firm glaxosmithkline plc .
with a combined net worth of € 16.6 billion , aventis currently ranks as the sixth largest pharmaceutical company in the world .
the other well known german chemical firm , bayer , comes in at place 18 with a combined net worth of € 4.3 billion .
france enthusiastic , germany worried about job losses the french government is said to be enthusiastic about the takeover bid which would create a pharmaceutical giant based in paris .
germany is less excited about the prospect .
federal economics minister wolfgang clement warned last week that a merger could result in job losses in germany if the company moves its focus to paris .
" the german government has a strong interest in strengthening aventis ' position in germany rather than weakening it , " he said .
a combination of sanofi 's 70,000 strong workforce with aventis ' 69,000 employees could result in as many as 10,000 job cuts in both germany and france .
trade unions have said the number of lost jobs could be closer to 25,000 .
aventis now employs some 9,000 german workers who loyally support their chief executive igor landau .
michael klippel the head of the works committee at aventis said , " we are confident because we believe he will fight .
he is not one of these managers who will sell out for a few marks . "
analysts say the takeover battle is extremely personal for the 59 year old igor landau .
he was instrumental in the merger of the french drug firm rhône-poulenc , where he had been an executive for many years , with one of germany 's largest pharmaceutical companies , hoechst .
the deal was the pinnacle of three decades of work and landau shed the firm 's chemical and agricultural operation to focus solely on drugs .
hostile takeovers rare in europe the battle being played out in london between aventis and sanofi is unusual for europe , where hostile takeover attempts are extremely rare .
while experts do n't expect there to be an increase in hostile bids , they do believe friendly mergers , like the one that created aventis , will continue .
according to some experts , smaller pharmaceuticals in europe soon wo n't be able to keep up with the giants .

he said german drug companies have lost their title as " chemists of the world " because of a research policy burdened with too much bureaucracy that serves to stifles innovation .

then it takes another six to nine years before substantial profits are made .
pohle said the larger the pharmaceutical company , the more money and time it can invest in new projects and the less money is lost when a project fails .
experts say even if sanofi 's offer transforms itself into a friendly one , landau , like many chief executives whose company has been targeted by a hostile buyer , is unlikely to gain control of the new company .
if the sanofi bid fails , the smaller french firm is likely to be next in line for a hostile takeover bid .

those problems have been fading ever since “ nowhere in africa , ” a film about the challenges facing a jewish family who flee to kenya after the nazis take power , won the academy award for best foreign language movie last march .
that oscar and a string of domestic box office hits have put germany ’ s film industry back into the international spotlight .
“ it 's obviously been a great year for german film , ” said rolf baehr , chairman of the german film board , in an interview with reuters .
“ german films are now reaching audiences with good stories . ”
“ film makers are concentrating on viewers more and not focused on their own self-realization .
the experience and training are also greatly improved .
it 's all coming together . ”
the successes of films such as “ good bye , lenin ” - the comedy about a son who conceals the fall of the berlin wall from his ailing mother , and the world war ii drama “ rosenstrasse " , has helped the domestic market share climb to about 15 percent in 2003 from around 11 percent the year before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good bye , lenin .
hello success .
“ good bye , lenin , ” which won six european film awards in december , topped germany 's box office last year with over 6.5 million people turning out to see the film , generating nearly € 31.9 million -lrb- $ 40 million -rrb- .
“ the miracle of bern ” , a film about west germany 's 1954 world cup winning soccer team , and the biopic “ luther ” also scored with audiences inside and outside germany , and film makers are hopeful the festival will herald another big year .
interest in german films rises “ thanks to caroline link 's oscar -lrb- for nowhere in africa -rrb- , there 's now a lot more interest in german films from abroad , " said romuald karmaker , a german director whose film “ nightsongs ” is one of 23 competing for the top golden bear awards .
the director told reporters : “ the entire atmosphere is completely different now , ” referring to the past when the berlinale featured very few german films in its program .
“ the attention we 're getting now is absolutely essential . ”

last year was an outstanding year for german cinema .
now , as the 54th international film festival berlin kicks off , it ’ s time for the stars of germany ’ s film industry to sit back and enjoy the attention . the berlinale gets underway on thursday with film fans flocking to the german capital to bask in the warm celebrity glow of the global stars and directors who will be arriving throughout the ten days of glamour and glitz .
but it will not only be the heat from the bright lights that will warm berliners attending the shows and events that make up the festival circus .
germans from all over the country can also revel in the feeling of pride that berlin ’ s film gala and the german movie industry as a whole is currently enjoying a surge in international profile , popularity and profit .
“ it 's been one of the best years ever for cinema in germany , ” said dieter kosslick , the festival ’ s director who has turned the berlinale into a showcase for german productions and has helped it secure its place behind cannes and alongside venice as one of europe 's three most important film festivals .
“ as long as i 'm the head of this festival , its backing for german films will remain high , ” kosslick said in an interview with reporters in the run-up to the festival ’ s opening .
“ i 've never had to push for german films because i 've always found them to be very good .
it was always other people who had problems with them . ”

european papers on thursday focused on u.s. democratic presidential front-runner john kerry ’ s success on the campaign trail .
most warned kerry had his work cut out if he was to dislodge bush from the white house . u.s. presidential candidate john kerry won five of seven democratic primaries on tuesday .
dutch left-leaning paper volkskrant wrote that kerry ’ s success was based on the fact that " he ’ s trusted and seen as capable of being elected by many " as well as on his prestige that he built up as a vietnam veteran and during his long stint in the u.s. senate .
" but so far his election campaign has seldom witnessed sweeping enthusiasm .
one is still waiting for a political message that can stir american voters to entrust the highest post in the country to an acting senator for the first time since the days of john f. kennedy , " the daily concluded .
" can john kerry chase george w. bush out of the white house ? "
french daily liberation asked and added that the question had taken on new urgency since kerry appeared to have good chances of being pitched as the democrats ’ presidential candidate .
the paper mused that if the voters had already made kerry a favorite or planned to do so , it was because they are convinced that he can be elected .
" in paris kerry has already been declared as the most likely democratic presidential hopeful , " it wrote .
" but to defeat an acting president , even a beleaguered one , the candidate must have outstanding qualities and the circumstances need to be exceptional , " the broadsheet cautioned .
the independent in london said if there is one lesson to be drawn from past american president campaigns , it is that favorites whether for nominations or for the white house become the target of brickbats as soon as they are identified .
the paper expected the other democrat hopefuls to turn their fire on the front-runner .
" kerry has proved his appeal to voters in the north , east , center and southwest of the country , he has attracted all classes , white americans and hispanics . "
but the daily warned , " kerry must prepare himself for whatever the other candidates may dig up to use against him and dampen his voter appeal . "
belgian daily le soir was optimistic that kerry ’ s surging popularity had the potential to unseat president bush .
" everywhere the voter turnout has broken records , a sign for the mobilization of democrat followers to remove the president from the white house , " the paper wrote .
" but more than the surveys that show that john kerry and john edwards will defeat him , it ’ s this resoluteness that must be unnerving george bush because if affects states -lrb- missouri and arizona -rrb- that he -lrb- bush -rrb- won only narrowly in 2000 . "
" a democratic people , who are in unanimous agreement that george w. bush must go , are pinning their hopes on john kerry and to a lesser extent on john edwards .
but is john kerry really the man to execute that goal ? " asked zürich-based swiss daily tages-anzeiger .
the paper pointed out that though kerry had acquired the reputation of a solid and sound politician during his long years in the washington senate , he was definitely not a visionary .
the senator may possess the necessary stature , but his readiness to take on political risks still needs to be proven , the daily stressed .
liberal austrian daily der standard opined that john kerry had hit the right note in his election campaign .
" kerry has – just like his rival john edwards – always struck a mildly populist tone in his campaign and portrayed bush , not without reason , as the president of ‘ corporate america ’ , of the rich and the powerful , " it wrote .
the daily added that as the husband of a rich heiress who owns a billion-dollar ketchup company , kerry wasn ’ t exactly in danger of ending up on the streets anytime soon .
" but he -lrb- kerry -rrb- has still understood the importance of profiling himself as the advocate of the lower and middle classes in the u.s. , who are reeling from the enron scandal and the latest tax cuts by the government and do n't have much to laugh about under bush . "
norway ’ s conservative aftenposten observed that john kerry seems to have the tail wind behind him , judging by his success so far in the primary elections .
" however , kerry must master a difficult balancing act with regard to wooing voters and keeping the ones who support him already , " the paper warned .
" the key is the level of criticism kerry may use against the other candidates , which if too personal and petty , could repel voters , " the daily wrote .
germany ’ s conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung admired the activist zeal the democrats have shown in recent months .
" they ’ re positively burning with the desire to get george bush out of the white house with a fury that is strategically focussed , " the paper wrote .
but it added , " the democrats are seeking the most electable candidate which will be quite a challenge in a country that is so deeply divided . "
italian daily la repubblica reflected that it ’ s still a long way off till the u.s. presidential election and the fortunes of the democrats could rise and fall by then .
" this long journey to the american presidential polls is marked by tides that rise and devour candidates and their hopes everyday .
today they appear to let bush sink and let his two opponents rise , the nth ‘ new kennedy ’ , senator john forbes kerry and right after him the ‘ new clinton ’ , southerner john edwards .

" in paris kerry has already been declared as the most likely democratic presidential hopeful , " it wrote .
" but to defeat an acting president , even a beleaguered one , the candidate must have outstanding qualities and the circumstances need to be exceptional , " the broadsheet cautioned .
the independent in london said if there is one lesson to be drawn from past american president campaigns , it is that favorites whether for nominations or for the white house become the target of brickbats as soon as they are identified .
the paper expected the other democrat hopefuls to turn their fire on the front-runner .
" kerry has proved his appeal to voters in the north , east , center and southwest of the country , he has attracted all classes , white americans and hispanics . "
but the daily warned , " kerry must prepare himself for whatever the other candidates may dig up to use against him and dampen his voter appeal . "
belgian daily le soir was optimistic that kerry ’ s surging popularity had the potential to unseat president bush .
" everywhere the voter turnout has broken records , a sign for the mobilization of democrat followers to remove the president from the white house , " the paper wrote .

" a democratic people , who are in unanimous agreement that george w. bush must go , are pinning their hopes on john kerry and to a lesser extent on john edwards .
but is john kerry really the man to execute that goal ? " asked zürich-based swiss daily tages-anzeiger .
the paper pointed out that though kerry had acquired the reputation of a solid and sound politician during his long years in the washington senate , he was definitely not a visionary .
the senator may possess the necessary stature , but his readiness to take on political risks still needs to be proven , the daily stressed .
liberal austrian daily der standard opined that john kerry had hit the right note in his election campaign .
" kerry has – just like his rival john edwards – always struck a mildly populist tone in his campaign and portrayed bush , not without reason , as the president of ‘ corporate america ’ , of the rich and the powerful , " it wrote .
the daily added that as the husband of a rich heiress who owns a billion-dollar ketchup company , kerry wasn ’ t exactly in danger of ending up on the streets anytime soon .

norway ’ s conservative aftenposten observed that john kerry seems to have the tail wind behind him , judging by his success so far in the primary elections .
" however , kerry must master a difficult balancing act with regard to wooing voters and keeping the ones who support him already , " the paper warned .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.02.2004 opinion : the only verdict possible großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutors were unable to prove mzoudi 's guilt .
the roller-coaster course of the five-month trial against abdelghani mzoudi left judges no choice but to acquit him , deutsche welle 's peter phillip writes in a commentary on thursday 's verdict . moroccan abdelghani mzoudi would have had to be extremely unlucky to be convicted of abetting the sept .
11 attacks in the united states .
germany ’ s federal prosecutors had charged him with exactly that and blamed the student for playing a role in the deaths of 3,066 people .
but the hamburg judges were n't convinced and they came back with the only verdict that seemed possible after the trial ’ s somewhat haphazard course : an acquittal . the trial became unfocused because politics and the legal system kept clashing .
supporting the fight against terrorism wholeheartedly is certainly backed by germans across the political spectrum , but this consensus starts crumbling as soon as this support requires blindly following the u.s. ’ s leadership .
especially if such allegiance requires throwing out the founding principles of the constitutional state . a hastened search for terrorists since the perpetrators of the sept .
11 attacks had stayed in germany as inconspicuous “ sleepers ” before the attacks , it was only natural that the german authorities would investigate their surroundings and search for accomplices to put them on trial .
one escaped – ramzi binalshibh – another , mounir al motassadeq , has been sentenced to 15 years in prison . whether this verdict will hold up is more than questionable after mzoudi ’ s acquittal .
real proof for motassadeq ’ s guilt does not exist .
what ’ s even more significant , much that normally would not have been accepted by a court seems to have been tolerated out of consideration for washington : the u.s. didn ’ t offer any legal assistance ; they didn ’ t allow interrogations of binalshibh or other incarcerated suspects and instead simply handed the german authorities quotes from their own interrogations , according to the sink-or-swim principle . prosecutors ridicule themselves the judge was already so annoyed by this in december that he released mzoudi from jail .
prosecutors didn ’ t like this at all and were led to ridicule themselves : one day before the verdict was supposed to be announced , they tried to turn the trial in a different direction by conjuring up an alleged witness .
the same happened again on thursday : hours before the verdict , supposedly new evidence was offered to the court . the judges stayed their course , as that ’ s no way to convict someone .
obviously this doesn ’ t say anything about mzoudi ’ s guilt or innocence , nor does it guarantee him a life in freedom .
he could be deported to his homeland , where he is likely to be arrested or even extradited to the united states . peter phillip send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .
11 terror suspect acquitted a hamburg court on thursday acquitted a moroccan charged with helping to prepare the sept .
11 attacks .

the roller-coaster course of the five-month trial against abdelghani mzoudi left judges no choice but to acquit him , deutsche welle 's peter phillip writes in a commentary on thursday 's verdict . moroccan abdelghani mzoudi would have had to be extremely unlucky to be convicted of abetting the sept .
11 attacks in the united states .
germany ’ s federal prosecutors had charged him with exactly that and blamed the student for playing a role in the deaths of 3,066 people .
but the hamburg judges were n't convinced and they came back with the only verdict that seemed possible after the trial ’ s somewhat haphazard course : an acquittal . the trial became unfocused because politics and the legal system kept clashing .
supporting the fight against terrorism wholeheartedly is certainly backed by germans across the political spectrum , but this consensus starts crumbling as soon as this support requires blindly following the u.s. ’ s leadership .
especially if such allegiance requires throwing out the founding principles of the constitutional state . a hastened search for terrorists since the perpetrators of the sept .
11 attacks had stayed in germany as inconspicuous “ sleepers ” before the attacks , it was only natural that the german authorities would investigate their surroundings and search for accomplices to put them on trial .
one escaped – ramzi binalshibh – another , mounir al motassadeq , has been sentenced to 15 years in prison . whether this verdict will hold up is more than questionable after mzoudi ’ s acquittal .
real proof for motassadeq ’ s guilt does not exist .
what ’ s even more significant , much that normally would not have been accepted by a court seems to have been tolerated out of consideration for washington : the u.s. didn ’ t offer any legal assistance ; they didn ’ t allow interrogations of binalshibh or other incarcerated suspects and instead simply handed the german authorities quotes from their own interrogations , according to the sink-or-swim principle . prosecutors ridicule themselves the judge was already so annoyed by this in december that he released mzoudi from jail .

a group of police officers in the western german city is trying to reach out to local youth by staging their own hip hop concerts . they rap about love , life and hope .
they dance in unison across the stage and crowds of young people watch them , enraptured at the sight before them .
germany 's next chart topping boy band ?
hardly .
the four men are members of the cologne police force , and they are committed to encouraging moral courage in local youth .
along the way , they are changing the way young people think about the cops .
they call themselves p.i.4 — an abbreviation for police inspection four .
the 25- to 30-year-old policemen shake their hips and raise their arms in sync with the beat while dressed in their standard issue , green police uniforms .
from the microphone the lyrics blast : " some say , i know it already , policemen on stage and an mc on the microphone , and you wanna say something , come to us after the show , you can ask whatever you want ... " preventing youth violence through music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : p.i. 4 at one of their concerts .
it 's a creative way of dealing with youth violence that brings young people into contact with authority figures who they often look upon with distrust .
faced with rising crime and a lack of resources in the german metropolis , many cologne police officers have come to the conclusion that prevention is the best answer to youth violence . three years ago , four such policemen formed a band of their own , and set out to transmit a positive message that might help stop the violent brawls which have become a daily feature of the officers ' work . today their lyrics can be heard at live performances across the city — in youth homes , at football games , demonstrations and concerts : " is it really so bad , things on a new path , bringing people together who were n't together before / it 's not about this crew winning a battle or having their single on the number one charts ... " the young civil servants take their mission seriously , which is one reason why hip hopper mr. man q.x. , also known as philip schwieren lent the dancing police officers his voice .
with schwieren 's help , the band has gone from corny wannabees to respectable hip hoppers . according to schwieren , the opportunity to work closely with the police has changed his opinion about them : " before , you 'd see a police car and a police officer and first you 'd think skeptically , ' what do they want from me , did i do something ? '
since then , i 've realized that you can talk with them like normal people , you can talk about whatever and it does n't have to be so hostile or against each other , " said schwieren . building bridges and trust still , dancing policemen on stage is an unusual sight , and the police officers do n't always have it easy with critical spectators , who wonder what the police are doing acting like rap stars .
but the police officers turned rappers see it differently , as they express in their lyrics " i tell you , hip hop has a job , hip hop has a job , a job , what 's hip hop got , hip hop has a job . "
indeed , for the officers , hip hop 's task is building bridges and trust .
their motto is , " look , act , call for help " against violence . andrea löhr , band member and police officer says the group gives their free time and energy to practicing their act in hopes it will have some positive effect on the communities they serve .
it 's not a professional act , but they give it their best shot , says löhr . " there is a large conference room at the station where we meet .
there are speakers in the room and we put the music on and we try and see how we can do it .
we also had some professional help , a choreographer who helped us , and some things we have tried out ourselves . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking the part the choreography is n't perfect and the police are only able to practice outside of work hours .
and whether or not their message has helped prevent violence may be difficult to measure .
however , members of p.i.4 say what matters is coming into contact with young people and encouraging positive attitudes about life such as in one of their four original songs : " i love life , i want to give it away and protect it , i have so much hope , maybe somebody could use some . " going beyond hip hop at a recent p.i.4 performance , there were mixed reviews for the police officers , but most young people seemed to appreciate the officers ' attempt at developing a relationship with young people on young people 's turf .
those skeptics who turn up for the concerts often come away surprised .
" i personally do n't find it so bad , i liked the lyrics and that they 're performing here , i think it 's actually a nice idea , " said one spectator .
and another young listener agreed , " i think you have to find a way to get closer to the public and i do n't have a problem with it at all . " still , some say hip hop just is n't the place for a policeman — particularly because of the often negative associations found in hip hop music when it comes to the police authorities .
one concert go-er commented that " hip hop is n't the right choice of music for them , because they are n't going to find a lot of sympathizers among hip-hoppers , i just ca n't imagine that . " but band leader michael mannheim says hip hop is just the beginning .
" we are n't fixed to hip-hop , " he said . " we worked well with our rapper and if tomorrow i find another singer with current music — be it rock , pop or soul , then we 'll do that too .
the only requirements are that it 's german music and that it has the right message . " although some critics suggest that it is n't the role of upstanding police officers to get up on stage and perform hip hop tunes , the foursome insists their message is worth it : " i wish you a voice , when you 're lying on the ground , when you are afraid and you ca n't get anymore air , yeah , yeah ... " the cologne chief of police and the state 's interior minister agree the creative approach is a worthwhile one and have since shown their support for the brave band of hip coppers . herbert ostwald -lrb- der -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

hardly .
the four men are members of the cologne police force , and they are committed to encouraging moral courage in local youth .
along the way , they are changing the way young people think about the cops .
they call themselves p.i.4 — an abbreviation for police inspection four .
the 25- to 30-year-old policemen shake their hips and raise their arms in sync with the beat while dressed in their standard issue , green police uniforms .

it 's a creative way of dealing with youth violence that brings young people into contact with authority figures who they often look upon with distrust .
faced with rising crime and a lack of resources in the german metropolis , many cologne police officers have come to the conclusion that prevention is the best answer to youth violence . three years ago , four such policemen formed a band of their own , and set out to transmit a positive message that might help stop the violent brawls which have become a daily feature of the officers ' work . today their lyrics can be heard at live performances across the city — in youth homes , at football games , demonstrations and concerts : " is it really so bad , things on a new path , bringing people together who were n't together before / it 's not about this crew winning a battle or having their single on the number one charts ... " the young civil servants take their mission seriously , which is one reason why hip hopper mr. man q.x. , also known as philip schwieren lent the dancing police officers his voice .
with schwieren 's help , the band has gone from corny wannabees to respectable hip hoppers . according to schwieren , the opportunity to work closely with the police has changed his opinion about them : " before , you 'd see a police car and a police officer and first you 'd think skeptically , ' what do they want from me , did i do something ?

since then , i 've realized that you can talk with them like normal people , you can talk about whatever and it does n't have to be so hostile or against each other , " said schwieren . building bridges and trust still , dancing policemen on stage is an unusual sight , and the police officers do n't always have it easy with critical spectators , who wonder what the police are doing acting like rap stars .
but the police officers turned rappers see it differently , as they express in their lyrics " i tell you , hip hop has a job , hip hop has a job , a job , what 's hip hop got , hip hop has a job . "
indeed , for the officers , hip hop 's task is building bridges and trust .
their motto is , " look , act , call for help " against violence . andrea löhr , band member and police officer says the group gives their free time and energy to practicing their act in hopes it will have some positive effect on the communities they serve .
it 's not a professional act , but they give it their best shot , says löhr . " there is a large conference room at the station where we meet .
there are speakers in the room and we put the music on and we try and see how we can do it .
we also had some professional help , a choreographer who helped us , and some things we have tried out ourselves . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking the part the choreography is n't perfect and the police are only able to practice outside of work hours .
and whether or not their message has helped prevent violence may be difficult to measure .
however , members of p.i.4 say what matters is coming into contact with young people and encouraging positive attitudes about life such as in one of their four original songs : " i love life , i want to give it away and protect it , i have so much hope , maybe somebody could use some . " going beyond hip hop at a recent p.i.4 performance , there were mixed reviews for the police officers , but most young people seemed to appreciate the officers ' attempt at developing a relationship with young people on young people 's turf .
those skeptics who turn up for the concerts often come away surprised .

and another young listener agreed , " i think you have to find a way to get closer to the public and i do n't have a problem with it at all . " still , some say hip hop just is n't the place for a policeman — particularly because of the often negative associations found in hip hop music when it comes to the police authorities .
one concert go-er commented that " hip hop is n't the right choice of music for them , because they are n't going to find a lot of sympathizers among hip-hoppers , i just ca n't imagine that . " but band leader michael mannheim says hip hop is just the beginning .
" we are n't fixed to hip-hop , " he said . " we worked well with our rapper and if tomorrow i find another singer with current music — be it rock , pop or soul , then we 'll do that too .

a few weeks before it was to hit the presses , a german publishing house pulled a book based on the secret porn industry of the third reich .
the reasons remain unclear . any book that attempts to shed light on the little-known nazi porn industry in the early 1940s is not likely to arrive in bookstores without a hitch .
but when the rowohlt publishing house completely cancelled its contract with author thor kunkel shortly before his new novel , " endstufe " -lrb- final step -rrb- , was to hit the presses , a slight sensation rippled through the industry .
little is being said by rowohlt and its head alexander fest about the reasons for the cancellation of the for-march planned release .
a statement by rowohlt mentioned something about not being able to bridge differences on questions on the " aesthetic and subject matter " in central parts of the book .
the manuscript , which landed in the hands of the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , was apparently not only filled with scenes of vivid sex and brutality , but made some questionable ties between the crimes of the allied army and those of the nazi regime .
kunkel is reportedly devastated by the cancellation of a book he spent three years researching and writing .
" i had the impression at a certain point that -lrb- the book -rrb- was being edited on ideological , not aesthetic levels , " he said in an interview with die welt newspaper .
" and i saw that as censorship .
i 'm 40 years old .
i know what i 'm writing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kunkel , thor : das schwarzlicht-terrarium .
the frankfurt-born kunkel is considered a rising talent in german literary circles following his prize-winning 2000 debut , " das schwarzlicht-terrarium " , about the frankfurt drug and disco scene in the late 1970s .
porn traded for raw materials he came upon the subject material for " endstufe " after watching a documentary in 1991 that looked into the little-known porn industry that apparently flourished during the third reich .
after asking around , he eventually got in contact with someone who had copies of the so-called sachsenwald films .
the films are reportedly filled with with scenes of sex , power relations and violence .
they were rumored to have been part of a flourishing raw materials trade .
kunkel , based in amsterdam , moved to berlin to research the book , drawing upon witness testimony at the time , including a former actress in one of the films .
he forms his novel around a group of nazi scientists who work at a secret service clinic and produce porn films on the side .
the films are soon a major success and part of a trade network that stretches throughout the wider war zone .
the author infuses the description of the group of scientists with an end of the world attitude .
the characters are apparently self-indulgent and blissfully ignorant of the horrors of the concentration camps or battlefield misery , both of which are dealt with only fleetingly , according to the frankfurter allgemeine .
nazi theme should n't be too hot for germany no one seems to know for sure what combination of themes scared the publisher off : whether it was because it was novel that belittled the horrors of the nazi period , or whether kunkel documented the scientific experimentation at the time with a bit too much fascination .
fest , who recently cancelled a book called " i too , had to kill " by an israeli secret service agent , in a letter referred to the fact that kunkel 's work and subject matter could reap a hefty amount of criticism .
but kunkel seems nonplussed by such arguments .
" germany is a very normal european country , " he said in the welt interview .
" i do n't think we should be raised as humiliated , mentally-disturbed garden gnomes .
endstufe is written in a very modern language .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.02.2004 publisher drops book on nazi porno großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi porn videos enjoyed a healthy trade in the early 1940s across front lines .
a few weeks before it was to hit the presses , a german publishing house pulled a book based on the secret porn industry of the third reich .
the reasons remain unclear . any book that attempts to shed light on the little-known nazi porn industry in the early 1940s is not likely to arrive in bookstores without a hitch .
but when the rowohlt publishing house completely cancelled its contract with author thor kunkel shortly before his new novel , " endstufe " -lrb- final step -rrb- , was to hit the presses , a slight sensation rippled through the industry .
little is being said by rowohlt and its head alexander fest about the reasons for the cancellation of the for-march planned release .
a statement by rowohlt mentioned something about not being able to bridge differences on questions on the " aesthetic and subject matter " in central parts of the book .
the manuscript , which landed in the hands of the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , was apparently not only filled with scenes of vivid sex and brutality , but made some questionable ties between the crimes of the allied army and those of the nazi regime .
kunkel is reportedly devastated by the cancellation of a book he spent three years researching and writing .
" i had the impression at a certain point that -lrb- the book -rrb- was being edited on ideological , not aesthetic levels , " he said in an interview with die welt newspaper .
" and i saw that as censorship .
i 'm 40 years old .
i know what i 'm writing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kunkel , thor : das schwarzlicht-terrarium .
the frankfurt-born kunkel is considered a rising talent in german literary circles following his prize-winning 2000 debut , " das schwarzlicht-terrarium " , about the frankfurt drug and disco scene in the late 1970s .
porn traded for raw materials he came upon the subject material for " endstufe " after watching a documentary in 1991 that looked into the little-known porn industry that apparently flourished during the third reich .
after asking around , he eventually got in contact with someone who had copies of the so-called sachsenwald films .
the films are reportedly filled with with scenes of sex , power relations and violence .
they were rumored to have been part of a flourishing raw materials trade .
kunkel , based in amsterdam , moved to berlin to research the book , drawing upon witness testimony at the time , including a former actress in one of the films .
he forms his novel around a group of nazi scientists who work at a secret service clinic and produce porn films on the side .
the films are soon a major success and part of a trade network that stretches throughout the wider war zone .
the author infuses the description of the group of scientists with an end of the world attitude .
the characters are apparently self-indulgent and blissfully ignorant of the horrors of the concentration camps or battlefield misery , both of which are dealt with only fleetingly , according to the frankfurter allgemeine .
nazi theme should n't be too hot for germany no one seems to know for sure what combination of themes scared the publisher off : whether it was because it was novel that belittled the horrors of the nazi period , or whether kunkel documented the scientific experimentation at the time with a bit too much fascination .
fest , who recently cancelled a book called " i too , had to kill " by an israeli secret service agent , in a letter referred to the fact that kunkel 's work and subject matter could reap a hefty amount of criticism .
but kunkel seems nonplussed by such arguments .
" germany is a very normal european country , " he said in the welt interview .
" i do n't think we should be raised as humiliated , mentally-disturbed garden gnomes .
endstufe is written in a very modern language .
it 's not a historical novel .

british prime minister tony blair has said he might join an increasing number of eu countries that want to initially bar low-cost workers from new european union countries from working in the west . while the expansion of the eu by ten member states in may this year is seen by many as a historical milestone , it has also raised fears of mass migration of labor from the poorer , mostly ex-communist new members to the more affluent west .
eu skeptics say a large influx of low-wage workers would prove devastating to current members of the bloc , who are already facing stubbornly high unemployment rates .
prime minister tony blair told parliament on wednesday that he was re-evaluating his earlier stance on the issue , and might advocate imposing immigration controls and welfare benefit restrictions on immigrants from the 10 new countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair “ it is important that we recognize that there is a potential risk from these accession countries , ” blair -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliament .
“ we will take whatever measures are necessary to make sure that the ‘ pull factor ’ which might draw people here is closed off . ”
the draw , he said , could be britain ’ s welfare benefit system , and it would be re-examined to determined whether it was “ too generous . ”
change of heart britain ’ s new jumpiness about eastern migration comes in the wake of sweden ’ s decision last week to impose limits on workers from the new eu countries .
the netherlands also said recently it would impose a limit on the number of immigrant workers it would accept .
norway , though not an eu member but with close ties to the bloc , said on thursday it is also exploring possible restrictions , although it has previously stated its borders would be open to new eu citizens .
“ we now see that some of our neighboring countries , and now sweden , state that they will have some exceptions for some years , for an interim period , ” prime minister kjell magne bondevik told reporters on thursday after talks with european commission president romano prodi .
“ so we also now … intend to make a proposal for parliament about some possible exceptions for an interim period so we are more in line with our neighboring countries . ” for two years after enlargement , labor market access with depend on national policies , and not be dictated by brussels .
according to the european commission , only about half the 15 member states have told the eu about their plans .
austria , finland , belgium , france and denmark are planning limits , in some cases for up to seven years .
only ireland and spain have said they will keep their borders open .
germany , with its high unemployment and generous welfare system , insisted in 2002 during entry negotiations for the new candidate countries on a clause that would allow it to impose restrictions to its market for citizens from central and eastern europe until 2011 .
second-class citizens ?
malta , cyprus , estonia , latvia , lithuania , hungary , poland , slovakia , slovenia and the czech republic will become official members of the eu in may of this year . in the past months , tension between current and future members of the eu has increased on a number of issues .
the about-turns on work policy are likely to deepen the fear among many in the accession countries that they will be treated as second-class european citizens .
“ the thinking that we need long transition periods 14 years after the fall of the berlin wall shows a lack of solidarity , ” jan figiel , slovakia ’ s candidate for the european commission , told reuters .
the new members point to one of the fundaments of the eu project — free movement of persons including the right to live and work in another member state .
but as the eu prepares to take in 75 million new people , mostly from countries formerly part of the soviet bloc where wages were lower , fears have been growing of an influx of labor in search of a better standard of living .
the unease has been especially strong in germany , which , since 1990 , has attracted about 75 percent of the migrants to the eu from application countries .
unfounded fears experts , however , note that history teaches that such fears have generally been without foundation .
in previous eu enlargement periods , such as greece in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 , transitional measures such as labor restrictions were put into place , largely unnecessarily .
other alarms about east-west migration have proven false .
one example is a 1989 study by the u.n. high commission for refugees which estimated that 25 million people from the eastern europe would move to the west in the 1990s .

british prime minister tony blair has said he might join an increasing number of eu countries that want to initially bar low-cost workers from new european union countries from working in the west . while the expansion of the eu by ten member states in may this year is seen by many as a historical milestone , it has also raised fears of mass migration of labor from the poorer , mostly ex-communist new members to the more affluent west .
eu skeptics say a large influx of low-wage workers would prove devastating to current members of the bloc , who are already facing stubbornly high unemployment rates .
prime minister tony blair told parliament on wednesday that he was re-evaluating his earlier stance on the issue , and might advocate imposing immigration controls and welfare benefit restrictions on immigrants from the 10 new countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair “ it is important that we recognize that there is a potential risk from these accession countries , ” blair -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliament .
“ we will take whatever measures are necessary to make sure that the ‘ pull factor ’ which might draw people here is closed off . ”
the draw , he said , could be britain ’ s welfare benefit system , and it would be re-examined to determined whether it was “ too generous . ”
change of heart britain ’ s new jumpiness about eastern migration comes in the wake of sweden ’ s decision last week to impose limits on workers from the new eu countries .
the netherlands also said recently it would impose a limit on the number of immigrant workers it would accept .
norway , though not an eu member but with close ties to the bloc , said on thursday it is also exploring possible restrictions , although it has previously stated its borders would be open to new eu citizens .
“ we now see that some of our neighboring countries , and now sweden , state that they will have some exceptions for some years , for an interim period , ” prime minister kjell magne bondevik told reporters on thursday after talks with european commission president romano prodi .
“ so we also now … intend to make a proposal for parliament about some possible exceptions for an interim period so we are more in line with our neighboring countries . ” for two years after enlargement , labor market access with depend on national policies , and not be dictated by brussels .
according to the european commission , only about half the 15 member states have told the eu about their plans .
austria , finland , belgium , france and denmark are planning limits , in some cases for up to seven years .
only ireland and spain have said they will keep their borders open .
germany , with its high unemployment and generous welfare system , insisted in 2002 during entry negotiations for the new candidate countries on a clause that would allow it to impose restrictions to its market for citizens from central and eastern europe until 2011 .
second-class citizens ?
malta , cyprus , estonia , latvia , lithuania , hungary , poland , slovakia , slovenia and the czech republic will become official members of the eu in may of this year . in the past months , tension between current and future members of the eu has increased on a number of issues .
the about-turns on work policy are likely to deepen the fear among many in the accession countries that they will be treated as second-class european citizens .
“ the thinking that we need long transition periods 14 years after the fall of the berlin wall shows a lack of solidarity , ” jan figiel , slovakia ’ s candidate for the european commission , told reuters .
the new members point to one of the fundaments of the eu project — free movement of persons including the right to live and work in another member state .

the french-german pharmaceutical company aventis announced growing profits for 2003 in an effort to ward off a hostile takeover bid from a smaller french drug firm . aventis reported that net profits for 2003 had increased by 17.5 percent to € 2.44 billion -lrb- $ 3.07 billion -rrb- .
earnings per share had also risen by 18.6 percent although a weakening dollar had led to a 4.5 percent drop in sales .
aventis chief executive igor landau presented the 2003 profits at a press conference in london to make the case that the company is strong enough to stand on its own and can reject a € 48 billion -lrb- $ 60.4 billion -rrb- hostile takeover bid from the french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthélabo .
" today 's announcement highlights how sanofi 's offer fundamentally undervalues aventis , " said landau .
" their hostile bid is a cheap attempt to transfer their risks to our shareholders , " he added .
landau had previously hinted that there were other drug firms that would make better partners for aventis , suggesting that sanofi was using the hostile bid to avoid becoming a target of a takeover itself – a fact not disputed by sanofi 's executive board .
" they need us , but we do n't need them , ” said landau last week .
merger to create european drug giant sanofi-synthélabo made the grab for aventis on monday offering five of its shares and € 69 for every six aventis shares .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquarters of french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo sa in paris .
dealers and analysts said the franco-german company 's concerted attempt to fend off sanofi 's bid would ultimately fail , but aventis would force its french rival to increase its offer by at least 15 percent .
sanofi is pushing for the creation of a new european drug giant which would have a stronger combined presence on the lucrative u.s. market .
aventis pointed out on thursday that it already has a strong presence there ; 38 percent of its core sales are made in the us .
a merger with sanofi would create the third largest pharmaceutical company in terms of global sales behind the u.s. giant pfizer inc. and the british firm glaxosmithkline plc .
with a combined net worth of € 16.6 billion , aventis currently ranks as the sixth largest pharmaceutical company in the world .
the other well known german chemical firm , bayer , comes in at place 18 with a combined net worth of € 4.3 billion .
france enthusiastic , germany worried about job losses the french government is said to be enthusiastic about the takeover bid which would create a pharmaceutical giant based in paris .
germany is less excited about the prospect .
federal economics minister wolfgang clement warned last week that a merger could result in job losses in germany if the company moves its focus to paris .
" the german government has a strong interest in strengthening aventis ' position in germany rather than weakening it , " he said .
a combination of sanofi 's 70,000 strong workforce with aventis ' 69,000 employees could result in as many as 10,000 job cuts in both germany and france .
trade unions have said the number of lost jobs could be closer to 25,000 .
aventis now employs some 9,000 german workers who loyally support their chief executive igor landau .
michael klippel the head of the works committee at aventis said , " we are confident because we believe he will fight .
he is not one of these managers who will sell out for a few marks . "
analysts say the takeover battle is extremely personal for the 59 year old igor landau .
he was instrumental in the merger of the french drug firm rhône-poulenc , where he had been an executive for many years , with one of germany 's largest pharmaceutical companies , hoechst .
the deal was the pinnacle of three decades of work and landau shed the firm 's chemical and agricultural operation to focus solely on drugs .
hostile takeovers rare in europe the battle being played out in london between aventis and sanofi is unusual for europe , where hostile takeover attempts are extremely rare .
while experts do n't expect there to be an increase in hostile bids , they do believe friendly mergers , like the one that created aventis , will continue .
according to some experts , smaller pharmaceuticals in europe soon wo n't be able to keep up with the giants .
professor klaus pohle sits on the board of directors of lion bioscience ag , a german software provider for drug companies .
he said german drug companies have lost their title as " chemists of the world " because of a research policy burdened with too much bureaucracy that serves to stifles innovation .
research and development vital to drug firms surviving the research , development and release of a new drug onto the market takes approximately 12 years .
then it takes another six to nine years before substantial profits are made .
pohle said the larger the pharmaceutical company , the more money and time it can invest in new projects and the less money is lost when a project fails .
experts say even if sanofi 's offer transforms itself into a friendly one , landau , like many chief executives whose company has been targeted by a hostile buyer , is unlikely to gain control of the new company .
if the sanofi bid fails , the smaller french firm is likely to be next in line for a hostile takeover bid .

the french-german pharmaceutical company aventis announced growing profits for 2003 in an effort to ward off a hostile takeover bid from a smaller french drug firm . aventis reported that net profits for 2003 had increased by 17.5 percent to € 2.44 billion -lrb- $ 3.07 billion -rrb- .
earnings per share had also risen by 18.6 percent although a weakening dollar had led to a 4.5 percent drop in sales .
aventis chief executive igor landau presented the 2003 profits at a press conference in london to make the case that the company is strong enough to stand on its own and can reject a € 48 billion -lrb- $ 60.4 billion -rrb- hostile takeover bid from the french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthélabo .
" today 's announcement highlights how sanofi 's offer fundamentally undervalues aventis , " said landau .
" their hostile bid is a cheap attempt to transfer their risks to our shareholders , " he added .
landau had previously hinted that there were other drug firms that would make better partners for aventis , suggesting that sanofi was using the hostile bid to avoid becoming a target of a takeover itself – a fact not disputed by sanofi 's executive board .
" they need us , but we do n't need them , ” said landau last week .
merger to create european drug giant sanofi-synthélabo made the grab for aventis on monday offering five of its shares and € 69 for every six aventis shares .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquarters of french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo sa in paris .
dealers and analysts said the franco-german company 's concerted attempt to fend off sanofi 's bid would ultimately fail , but aventis would force its french rival to increase its offer by at least 15 percent .
sanofi is pushing for the creation of a new european drug giant which would have a stronger combined presence on the lucrative u.s. market .
aventis pointed out on thursday that it already has a strong presence there ; 38 percent of its core sales are made in the us .
a merger with sanofi would create the third largest pharmaceutical company in terms of global sales behind the u.s. giant pfizer inc. and the british firm glaxosmithkline plc .
with a combined net worth of € 16.6 billion , aventis currently ranks as the sixth largest pharmaceutical company in the world .
the other well known german chemical firm , bayer , comes in at place 18 with a combined net worth of € 4.3 billion .
france enthusiastic , germany worried about job losses the french government is said to be enthusiastic about the takeover bid which would create a pharmaceutical giant based in paris .
germany is less excited about the prospect .
federal economics minister wolfgang clement warned last week that a merger could result in job losses in germany if the company moves its focus to paris .
" the german government has a strong interest in strengthening aventis ' position in germany rather than weakening it , " he said .
a combination of sanofi 's 70,000 strong workforce with aventis ' 69,000 employees could result in as many as 10,000 job cuts in both germany and france .
trade unions have said the number of lost jobs could be closer to 25,000 .
aventis now employs some 9,000 german workers who loyally support their chief executive igor landau .
michael klippel the head of the works committee at aventis said , " we are confident because we believe he will fight .
he is not one of these managers who will sell out for a few marks . "
analysts say the takeover battle is extremely personal for the 59 year old igor landau .
he was instrumental in the merger of the french drug firm rhône-poulenc , where he had been an executive for many years , with one of germany 's largest pharmaceutical companies , hoechst .
the deal was the pinnacle of three decades of work and landau shed the firm 's chemical and agricultural operation to focus solely on drugs .
hostile takeovers rare in europe the battle being played out in london between aventis and sanofi is unusual for europe , where hostile takeover attempts are extremely rare .
while experts do n't expect there to be an increase in hostile bids , they do believe friendly mergers , like the one that created aventis , will continue .
according to some experts , smaller pharmaceuticals in europe soon wo n't be able to keep up with the giants .
professor klaus pohle sits on the board of directors of lion bioscience ag , a german software provider for drug companies .
he said german drug companies have lost their title as " chemists of the world " because of a research policy burdened with too much bureaucracy that serves to stifles innovation .
research and development vital to drug firms surviving the research , development and release of a new drug onto the market takes approximately 12 years .
then it takes another six to nine years before substantial profits are made .
pohle said the larger the pharmaceutical company , the more money and time it can invest in new projects and the less money is lost when a project fails .
experts say even if sanofi 's offer transforms itself into a friendly one , landau , like many chief executives whose company has been targeted by a hostile buyer , is unlikely to gain control of the new company .
if the sanofi bid fails , the smaller french firm is likely to be next in line for a hostile takeover bid .

nato defense chiefs will meet in munich this weekend to discuss the alliance 's role in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere .
the hope is that the meeting will be more cordial than last year . nato defense and foreign ministers will gather in munich on friday to discuss the lingering fallout from the iraq war and the future direction of the alliance .
it will be the 40th annual meeting for the german security conference . the big names of the defense world , an estimated 250 officials including pentagon chief donald rumsfeld are due to attend , will use the informal get-together to address transatlantic relations , the future of nato , and current developments in the middle east . they will also likely to take the opportunity to discuss extending the alliance 's role in afghanistan while in the bavarian capital , according to diplomats in brussels . iraq situation will again dominate agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the main focus will undoubtedly be the situation in iraq , even more so now inquiries have been launched into intelligence failures in the united states and britain regarding the lack of evidence in the search for weapons of mass destruction a year after the war began . the u.s. delegation is also likely to continue with its pressure to get nato to play a role in iraq as part of washington ’ s current initiative to solicit wider contributions from its member states . last year 's munich conference was a highly tense affair with officials from washington , paris and berlin on edge as a un security council vote on a new iraq resolution loomed ominously near .
rumsfeld and german foreign minister joschka fischer famously clashed at the event and will meet again on friday with hopefully less static in the air between them . security conference host horst teltschik told reporters in munich that some reconciliation is likely .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish soldiers in the ancient city of babylon , 80 kilometers south of baghdad , iraq .
new nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer said last week that the alliance , which is supporting the polish-led division in iraq , is ready and able to do the job .
" if the question comes , it goes without saying that i 'm very much in favour of a nato role , " he told journalists , before adding : " it 's too early to say exactly what that role will be . " despite making favourable noises in the direction of the united states in the form of low-key discussions , most nato officials remain resolute that no action will be taken before sovereignty is transferred from the u.s.-appointed interim leadership to the iraqis , a move that has been pencilled in for june . isaf 's afghan mission to be addressed the defense ministers will also consider the success of its continuing mission in afghanistan .
when the alliance took over command last august of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- it was nato 's first mission outside europe .
since then , the command of the mission , which has until now been centered on the capital kabul , has been rotated between member countries , with canada currently in control . nato wants to extend isaf 's operations beyond the capital kabul , notably using german troops , but it is having trouble with resources .
" i think that there is political will , but translating it into terms of concrete forces on the ground is more difficult and that is our challenge " said britain 's ambassador to nato peter ricketts in a press conference in brussels this week . eurocorps ready to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurocorps in mülheim , germany .
the landscape of nato ’ s role in afghanistan is likely to change further after officials announced on wednesday that the five-nation eurocorps army is ready to take the lead in the afghan peacekeeping mission later this year .
the eurocorps was recognized in 2002 as a nato high readiness force and has already carried out peacekeeping duties in kosovo and bosnia . with plans to be released and confirmed in the coming days , the 60,000-strong force - made up of troops from germany , france , spain , belgium and luxembourg - would more than likely be ready to assume control of the kabul-based mission by the summer .
it was not immediately clear how many of its soldiers would leave for afghanistan , as part of the 5,500-strong isaf . ministers from the five eurocorps nations are scheduled to meet on the margins of the munich meeting to discuss taking on the headquarters role . washington calls for nato engagement in mid-east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the middle east situation is also on the agenda .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.02.2004 cologne 's cop rappers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 've got the moves to go with the rapping .
a group of police officers in the western german city is trying to reach out to local youth by staging their own hip hop concerts . they rap about love , life and hope .
they dance in unison across the stage and crowds of young people watch them , enraptured at the sight before them .
germany 's next chart topping boy band ?
hardly .
the four men are members of the cologne police force , and they are committed to encouraging moral courage in local youth .
along the way , they are changing the way young people think about the cops .
they call themselves p.i.4 — an abbreviation for police inspection four .
the 25- to 30-year-old policemen shake their hips and raise their arms in sync with the beat while dressed in their standard issue , green police uniforms .
from the microphone the lyrics blast : " some say , i know it already , policemen on stage and an mc on the microphone , and you wanna say something , come to us after the show , you can ask whatever you want ... " preventing youth violence through music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : p.i. 4 at one of their concerts .
it 's a creative way of dealing with youth violence that brings young people into contact with authority figures who they often look upon with distrust .
faced with rising crime and a lack of resources in the german metropolis , many cologne police officers have come to the conclusion that prevention is the best answer to youth violence . three years ago , four such policemen formed a band of their own , and set out to transmit a positive message that might help stop the violent brawls which have become a daily feature of the officers ' work . today their lyrics can be heard at live performances across the city — in youth homes , at football games , demonstrations and concerts : " is it really so bad , things on a new path , bringing people together who were n't together before / it 's not about this crew winning a battle or having their single on the number one charts ... " the young civil servants take their mission seriously , which is one reason why hip hopper mr. man q.x. , also known as philip schwieren lent the dancing police officers his voice .
with schwieren 's help , the band has gone from corny wannabees to respectable hip hoppers . according to schwieren , the opportunity to work closely with the police has changed his opinion about them : " before , you 'd see a police car and a police officer and first you 'd think skeptically , ' what do they want from me , did i do something ? '
since then , i 've realized that you can talk with them like normal people , you can talk about whatever and it does n't have to be so hostile or against each other , " said schwieren . building bridges and trust still , dancing policemen on stage is an unusual sight , and the police officers do n't always have it easy with critical spectators , who wonder what the police are doing acting like rap stars .
but the police officers turned rappers see it differently , as they express in their lyrics " i tell you , hip hop has a job , hip hop has a job , a job , what 's hip hop got , hip hop has a job . "
indeed , for the officers , hip hop 's task is building bridges and trust .
their motto is , " look , act , call for help " against violence . andrea löhr , band member and police officer says the group gives their free time and energy to practicing their act in hopes it will have some positive effect on the communities they serve .
it 's not a professional act , but they give it their best shot , says löhr . " there is a large conference room at the station where we meet .
there are speakers in the room and we put the music on and we try and see how we can do it .
we also had some professional help , a choreographer who helped us , and some things we have tried out ourselves . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking the part the choreography is n't perfect and the police are only able to practice outside of work hours .
and whether or not their message has helped prevent violence may be difficult to measure .
however , members of p.i.4 say what matters is coming into contact with young people and encouraging positive attitudes about life such as in one of their four original songs : " i love life , i want to give it away and protect it , i have so much hope , maybe somebody could use some . " going beyond hip hop at a recent p.i.4 performance , there were mixed reviews for the police officers , but most young people seemed to appreciate the officers ' attempt at developing a relationship with young people on young people 's turf .
those skeptics who turn up for the concerts often come away surprised .
" i personally do n't find it so bad , i liked the lyrics and that they 're performing here , i think it 's actually a nice idea , " said one spectator .
and another young listener agreed , " i think you have to find a way to get closer to the public and i do n't have a problem with it at all . " still , some say hip hop just is n't the place for a policeman — particularly because of the often negative associations found in hip hop music when it comes to the police authorities .

a group of police officers in the western german city is trying to reach out to local youth by staging their own hip hop concerts . they rap about love , life and hope .
they dance in unison across the stage and crowds of young people watch them , enraptured at the sight before them .
germany 's next chart topping boy band ?
hardly .
the four men are members of the cologne police force , and they are committed to encouraging moral courage in local youth .
along the way , they are changing the way young people think about the cops .
they call themselves p.i.4 — an abbreviation for police inspection four .
the 25- to 30-year-old policemen shake their hips and raise their arms in sync with the beat while dressed in their standard issue , green police uniforms .
from the microphone the lyrics blast : " some say , i know it already , policemen on stage and an mc on the microphone , and you wanna say something , come to us after the show , you can ask whatever you want ... " preventing youth violence through music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : p.i. 4 at one of their concerts .
it 's a creative way of dealing with youth violence that brings young people into contact with authority figures who they often look upon with distrust .
faced with rising crime and a lack of resources in the german metropolis , many cologne police officers have come to the conclusion that prevention is the best answer to youth violence . three years ago , four such policemen formed a band of their own , and set out to transmit a positive message that might help stop the violent brawls which have become a daily feature of the officers ' work . today their lyrics can be heard at live performances across the city — in youth homes , at football games , demonstrations and concerts : " is it really so bad , things on a new path , bringing people together who were n't together before / it 's not about this crew winning a battle or having their single on the number one charts ... " the young civil servants take their mission seriously , which is one reason why hip hopper mr. man q.x. , also known as philip schwieren lent the dancing police officers his voice .
with schwieren 's help , the band has gone from corny wannabees to respectable hip hoppers . according to schwieren , the opportunity to work closely with the police has changed his opinion about them : " before , you 'd see a police car and a police officer and first you 'd think skeptically , ' what do they want from me , did i do something ? '
since then , i 've realized that you can talk with them like normal people , you can talk about whatever and it does n't have to be so hostile or against each other , " said schwieren . building bridges and trust still , dancing policemen on stage is an unusual sight , and the police officers do n't always have it easy with critical spectators , who wonder what the police are doing acting like rap stars .
but the police officers turned rappers see it differently , as they express in their lyrics " i tell you , hip hop has a job , hip hop has a job , a job , what 's hip hop got , hip hop has a job . "
indeed , for the officers , hip hop 's task is building bridges and trust .
their motto is , " look , act , call for help " against violence . andrea löhr , band member and police officer says the group gives their free time and energy to practicing their act in hopes it will have some positive effect on the communities they serve .
it 's not a professional act , but they give it their best shot , says löhr . " there is a large conference room at the station where we meet .
there are speakers in the room and we put the music on and we try and see how we can do it .
we also had some professional help , a choreographer who helped us , and some things we have tried out ourselves . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking the part the choreography is n't perfect and the police are only able to practice outside of work hours .
and whether or not their message has helped prevent violence may be difficult to measure .
however , members of p.i.4 say what matters is coming into contact with young people and encouraging positive attitudes about life such as in one of their four original songs : " i love life , i want to give it away and protect it , i have so much hope , maybe somebody could use some . " going beyond hip hop at a recent p.i.4 performance , there were mixed reviews for the police officers , but most young people seemed to appreciate the officers ' attempt at developing a relationship with young people on young people 's turf .
those skeptics who turn up for the concerts often come away surprised .
" i personally do n't find it so bad , i liked the lyrics and that they 're performing here , i think it 's actually a nice idea , " said one spectator .
and another young listener agreed , " i think you have to find a way to get closer to the public and i do n't have a problem with it at all . " still , some say hip hop just is n't the place for a policeman — particularly because of the often negative associations found in hip hop music when it comes to the police authorities .

they dance in unison across the stage and crowds of young people watch them , enraptured at the sight before them .
germany 's next chart topping boy band ?
hardly .
the four men are members of the cologne police force , and they are committed to encouraging moral courage in local youth .
along the way , they are changing the way young people think about the cops .
they call themselves p.i.4 — an abbreviation for police inspection four .
the 25- to 30-year-old policemen shake their hips and raise their arms in sync with the beat while dressed in their standard issue , green police uniforms .

it 's a creative way of dealing with youth violence that brings young people into contact with authority figures who they often look upon with distrust .
faced with rising crime and a lack of resources in the german metropolis , many cologne police officers have come to the conclusion that prevention is the best answer to youth violence . three years ago , four such policemen formed a band of their own , and set out to transmit a positive message that might help stop the violent brawls which have become a daily feature of the officers ' work . today their lyrics can be heard at live performances across the city — in youth homes , at football games , demonstrations and concerts : " is it really so bad , things on a new path , bringing people together who were n't together before / it 's not about this crew winning a battle or having their single on the number one charts ... " the young civil servants take their mission seriously , which is one reason why hip hopper mr. man q.x. , also known as philip schwieren lent the dancing police officers his voice .
with schwieren 's help , the band has gone from corny wannabees to respectable hip hoppers . according to schwieren , the opportunity to work closely with the police has changed his opinion about them : " before , you 'd see a police car and a police officer and first you 'd think skeptically , ' what do they want from me , did i do something ?

faced with rising crime and a lack of resources in the german metropolis , many cologne police officers have come to the conclusion that prevention is the best answer to youth violence . three years ago , four such policemen formed a band of their own , and set out to transmit a positive message that might help stop the violent brawls which have become a daily feature of the officers ' work . today their lyrics can be heard at live performances across the city — in youth homes , at football games , demonstrations and concerts : " is it really so bad , things on a new path , bringing people together who were n't together before / it 's not about this crew winning a battle or having their single on the number one charts ... " the young civil servants take their mission seriously , which is one reason why hip hopper mr. man q.x. , also known as philip schwieren lent the dancing police officers his voice .
with schwieren 's help , the band has gone from corny wannabees to respectable hip hoppers . according to schwieren , the opportunity to work closely with the police has changed his opinion about them : " before , you 'd see a police car and a police officer and first you 'd think skeptically , ' what do they want from me , did i do something ? '
since then , i 've realized that you can talk with them like normal people , you can talk about whatever and it does n't have to be so hostile or against each other , " said schwieren . building bridges and trust still , dancing policemen on stage is an unusual sight , and the police officers do n't always have it easy with critical spectators , who wonder what the police are doing acting like rap stars .
but the police officers turned rappers see it differently , as they express in their lyrics " i tell you , hip hop has a job , hip hop has a job , a job , what 's hip hop got , hip hop has a job . "
indeed , for the officers , hip hop 's task is building bridges and trust .
their motto is , " look , act , call for help " against violence . andrea löhr , band member and police officer says the group gives their free time and energy to practicing their act in hopes it will have some positive effect on the communities they serve .
it 's not a professional act , but they give it their best shot , says löhr . " there is a large conference room at the station where we meet .
there are speakers in the room and we put the music on and we try and see how we can do it .
we also had some professional help , a choreographer who helped us , and some things we have tried out ourselves . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking the part the choreography is n't perfect and the police are only able to practice outside of work hours .
and whether or not their message has helped prevent violence may be difficult to measure .
however , members of p.i.4 say what matters is coming into contact with young people and encouraging positive attitudes about life such as in one of their four original songs : " i love life , i want to give it away and protect it , i have so much hope , maybe somebody could use some . " going beyond hip hop at a recent p.i.4 performance , there were mixed reviews for the police officers , but most young people seemed to appreciate the officers ' attempt at developing a relationship with young people on young people 's turf .
those skeptics who turn up for the concerts often come away surprised .
" i personally do n't find it so bad , i liked the lyrics and that they 're performing here , i think it 's actually a nice idea , " said one spectator .
and another young listener agreed , " i think you have to find a way to get closer to the public and i do n't have a problem with it at all . " still , some say hip hop just is n't the place for a policeman — particularly because of the often negative associations found in hip hop music when it comes to the police authorities .
one concert go-er commented that " hip hop is n't the right choice of music for them , because they are n't going to find a lot of sympathizers among hip-hoppers , i just ca n't imagine that . " but band leader michael mannheim says hip hop is just the beginning .
" we are n't fixed to hip-hop , " he said . " we worked well with our rapper and if tomorrow i find another singer with current music — be it rock , pop or soul , then we 'll do that too .
the only requirements are that it 's german music and that it has the right message . " although some critics suggest that it is n't the role of upstanding police officers to get up on stage and perform hip hop tunes , the foursome insists their message is worth it : " i wish you a voice , when you 're lying on the ground , when you are afraid and you ca n't get anymore air , yeah , yeah ...

a group of police officers in the western german city is trying to reach out to local youth by staging their own hip hop concerts . they rap about love , life and hope .
they dance in unison across the stage and crowds of young people watch them , enraptured at the sight before them .
germany 's next chart topping boy band ?
hardly .
the four men are members of the cologne police force , and they are committed to encouraging moral courage in local youth .
along the way , they are changing the way young people think about the cops .
they call themselves p.i.4 — an abbreviation for police inspection four .
the 25- to 30-year-old policemen shake their hips and raise their arms in sync with the beat while dressed in their standard issue , green police uniforms .
from the microphone the lyrics blast : " some say , i know it already , policemen on stage and an mc on the microphone , and you wanna say something , come to us after the show , you can ask whatever you want ...

a few weeks before it was to hit the presses , a german publishing house pulled a book based on the secret porn industry of the third reich .
the reasons remain unclear . any book that attempts to shed light on the little-known nazi porn industry in the early 1940s is not likely to arrive in bookstores without a hitch .
but when the rowohlt publishing house completely cancelled its contract with author thor kunkel shortly before his new novel , " endstufe " -lrb- final step -rrb- , was to hit the presses , a slight sensation rippled through the industry .
little is being said by rowohlt and its head alexander fest about the reasons for the cancellation of the for-march planned release .
a statement by rowohlt mentioned something about not being able to bridge differences on questions on the " aesthetic and subject matter " in central parts of the book .
the manuscript , which landed in the hands of the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , was apparently not only filled with scenes of vivid sex and brutality , but made some questionable ties between the crimes of the allied army and those of the nazi regime .
kunkel is reportedly devastated by the cancellation of a book he spent three years researching and writing .
" i had the impression at a certain point that -lrb- the book -rrb- was being edited on ideological , not aesthetic levels , " he said in an interview with die welt newspaper .
" and i saw that as censorship .
i 'm 40 years old .
i know what i 'm writing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kunkel , thor : das schwarzlicht-terrarium .
the frankfurt-born kunkel is considered a rising talent in german literary circles following his prize-winning 2000 debut , " das schwarzlicht-terrarium " , about the frankfurt drug and disco scene in the late 1970s .
porn traded for raw materials he came upon the subject material for " endstufe " after watching a documentary in 1991 that looked into the little-known porn industry that apparently flourished during the third reich .
after asking around , he eventually got in contact with someone who had copies of the so-called sachsenwald films .
the films are reportedly filled with with scenes of sex , power relations and violence .
they were rumored to have been part of a flourishing raw materials trade .
kunkel , based in amsterdam , moved to berlin to research the book , drawing upon witness testimony at the time , including a former actress in one of the films .
he forms his novel around a group of nazi scientists who work at a secret service clinic and produce porn films on the side .
the films are soon a major success and part of a trade network that stretches throughout the wider war zone .
the author infuses the description of the group of scientists with an end of the world attitude .
the characters are apparently self-indulgent and blissfully ignorant of the horrors of the concentration camps or battlefield misery , both of which are dealt with only fleetingly , according to the frankfurter allgemeine .
nazi theme should n't be too hot for germany no one seems to know for sure what combination of themes scared the publisher off : whether it was because it was novel that belittled the horrors of the nazi period , or whether kunkel documented the scientific experimentation at the time with a bit too much fascination .
fest , who recently cancelled a book called " i too , had to kill " by an israeli secret service agent , in a letter referred to the fact that kunkel 's work and subject matter could reap a hefty amount of criticism .
but kunkel seems nonplussed by such arguments .
" germany is a very normal european country , " he said in the welt interview .
" i do n't think we should be raised as humiliated , mentally-disturbed garden gnomes .

a few weeks before it was to hit the presses , a german publishing house pulled a book based on the secret porn industry of the third reich .
the reasons remain unclear . any book that attempts to shed light on the little-known nazi porn industry in the early 1940s is not likely to arrive in bookstores without a hitch .
but when the rowohlt publishing house completely cancelled its contract with author thor kunkel shortly before his new novel , " endstufe " -lrb- final step -rrb- , was to hit the presses , a slight sensation rippled through the industry .
little is being said by rowohlt and its head alexander fest about the reasons for the cancellation of the for-march planned release .
a statement by rowohlt mentioned something about not being able to bridge differences on questions on the " aesthetic and subject matter " in central parts of the book .
the manuscript , which landed in the hands of the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , was apparently not only filled with scenes of vivid sex and brutality , but made some questionable ties between the crimes of the allied army and those of the nazi regime .
kunkel is reportedly devastated by the cancellation of a book he spent three years researching and writing .
" i had the impression at a certain point that -lrb- the book -rrb- was being edited on ideological , not aesthetic levels , " he said in an interview with die welt newspaper .
" and i saw that as censorship .
i 'm 40 years old .
i know what i 'm writing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kunkel , thor : das schwarzlicht-terrarium .
the frankfurt-born kunkel is considered a rising talent in german literary circles following his prize-winning 2000 debut , " das schwarzlicht-terrarium " , about the frankfurt drug and disco scene in the late 1970s .
porn traded for raw materials he came upon the subject material for " endstufe " after watching a documentary in 1991 that looked into the little-known porn industry that apparently flourished during the third reich .
after asking around , he eventually got in contact with someone who had copies of the so-called sachsenwald films .
the films are reportedly filled with with scenes of sex , power relations and violence .
they were rumored to have been part of a flourishing raw materials trade .
kunkel , based in amsterdam , moved to berlin to research the book , drawing upon witness testimony at the time , including a former actress in one of the films .
he forms his novel around a group of nazi scientists who work at a secret service clinic and produce porn films on the side .
the films are soon a major success and part of a trade network that stretches throughout the wider war zone .
the author infuses the description of the group of scientists with an end of the world attitude .
the characters are apparently self-indulgent and blissfully ignorant of the horrors of the concentration camps or battlefield misery , both of which are dealt with only fleetingly , according to the frankfurter allgemeine .
nazi theme should n't be too hot for germany no one seems to know for sure what combination of themes scared the publisher off : whether it was because it was novel that belittled the horrors of the nazi period , or whether kunkel documented the scientific experimentation at the time with a bit too much fascination .
fest , who recently cancelled a book called " i too , had to kill " by an israeli secret service agent , in a letter referred to the fact that kunkel 's work and subject matter could reap a hefty amount of criticism .
but kunkel seems nonplussed by such arguments .
" germany is a very normal european country , " he said in the welt interview .
" i do n't think we should be raised as humiliated , mentally-disturbed garden gnomes .
endstufe is written in a very modern language .
it 's not a historical novel .

a few weeks before it was to hit the presses , a german publishing house pulled a book based on the secret porn industry of the third reich .
the reasons remain unclear . any book that attempts to shed light on the little-known nazi porn industry in the early 1940s is not likely to arrive in bookstores without a hitch .
but when the rowohlt publishing house completely cancelled its contract with author thor kunkel shortly before his new novel , " endstufe " -lrb- final step -rrb- , was to hit the presses , a slight sensation rippled through the industry .
little is being said by rowohlt and its head alexander fest about the reasons for the cancellation of the for-march planned release .
a statement by rowohlt mentioned something about not being able to bridge differences on questions on the " aesthetic and subject matter " in central parts of the book .
the manuscript , which landed in the hands of the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , was apparently not only filled with scenes of vivid sex and brutality , but made some questionable ties between the crimes of the allied army and those of the nazi regime .
kunkel is reportedly devastated by the cancellation of a book he spent three years researching and writing .
" i had the impression at a certain point that -lrb- the book -rrb- was being edited on ideological , not aesthetic levels , " he said in an interview with die welt newspaper .
" and i saw that as censorship .
i 'm 40 years old .
i know what i 'm writing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kunkel , thor : das schwarzlicht-terrarium .
the frankfurt-born kunkel is considered a rising talent in german literary circles following his prize-winning 2000 debut , " das schwarzlicht-terrarium " , about the frankfurt drug and disco scene in the late 1970s .
porn traded for raw materials he came upon the subject material for " endstufe " after watching a documentary in 1991 that looked into the little-known porn industry that apparently flourished during the third reich .
after asking around , he eventually got in contact with someone who had copies of the so-called sachsenwald films .
the films are reportedly filled with with scenes of sex , power relations and violence .
they were rumored to have been part of a flourishing raw materials trade .
kunkel , based in amsterdam , moved to berlin to research the book , drawing upon witness testimony at the time , including a former actress in one of the films .
he forms his novel around a group of nazi scientists who work at a secret service clinic and produce porn films on the side .
the films are soon a major success and part of a trade network that stretches throughout the wider war zone .
the author infuses the description of the group of scientists with an end of the world attitude .
the characters are apparently self-indulgent and blissfully ignorant of the horrors of the concentration camps or battlefield misery , both of which are dealt with only fleetingly , according to the frankfurter allgemeine .
nazi theme should n't be too hot for germany no one seems to know for sure what combination of themes scared the publisher off : whether it was because it was novel that belittled the horrors of the nazi period , or whether kunkel documented the scientific experimentation at the time with a bit too much fascination .
fest , who recently cancelled a book called " i too , had to kill " by an israeli secret service agent , in a letter referred to the fact that kunkel 's work and subject matter could reap a hefty amount of criticism .
but kunkel seems nonplussed by such arguments .
" germany is a very normal european country , " he said in the welt interview .
" i do n't think we should be raised as humiliated , mentally-disturbed garden gnomes .
endstufe is written in a very modern language .
it 's not a historical novel .

germany 's next chart topping boy band ?
hardly .
the four men are members of the cologne police force , and they are committed to encouraging moral courage in local youth .
along the way , they are changing the way young people think about the cops .
they call themselves p.i.4 — an abbreviation for police inspection four .
the 25- to 30-year-old policemen shake their hips and raise their arms in sync with the beat while dressed in their standard issue , green police uniforms .
from the microphone the lyrics blast : " some say , i know it already , policemen on stage and an mc on the microphone , and you wanna say something , come to us after the show , you can ask whatever you want ... " preventing youth violence through music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : p.i. 4 at one of their concerts .
it 's a creative way of dealing with youth violence that brings young people into contact with authority figures who they often look upon with distrust .
faced with rising crime and a lack of resources in the german metropolis , many cologne police officers have come to the conclusion that prevention is the best answer to youth violence . three years ago , four such policemen formed a band of their own , and set out to transmit a positive message that might help stop the violent brawls which have become a daily feature of the officers ' work . today their lyrics can be heard at live performances across the city — in youth homes , at football games , demonstrations and concerts : " is it really so bad , things on a new path , bringing people together who were n't together before / it 's not about this crew winning a battle or having their single on the number one charts ... " the young civil servants take their mission seriously , which is one reason why hip hopper mr. man q.x. , also known as philip schwieren lent the dancing police officers his voice .
with schwieren 's help , the band has gone from corny wannabees to respectable hip hoppers . according to schwieren , the opportunity to work closely with the police has changed his opinion about them : " before , you 'd see a police car and a police officer and first you 'd think skeptically , ' what do they want from me , did i do something ? '
since then , i 've realized that you can talk with them like normal people , you can talk about whatever and it does n't have to be so hostile or against each other , " said schwieren . building bridges and trust still , dancing policemen on stage is an unusual sight , and the police officers do n't always have it easy with critical spectators , who wonder what the police are doing acting like rap stars .
but the police officers turned rappers see it differently , as they express in their lyrics " i tell you , hip hop has a job , hip hop has a job , a job , what 's hip hop got , hip hop has a job . "
indeed , for the officers , hip hop 's task is building bridges and trust .
their motto is , " look , act , call for help " against violence . andrea löhr , band member and police officer says the group gives their free time and energy to practicing their act in hopes it will have some positive effect on the communities they serve .
it 's not a professional act , but they give it their best shot , says löhr . " there is a large conference room at the station where we meet .
there are speakers in the room and we put the music on and we try and see how we can do it .
we also had some professional help , a choreographer who helped us , and some things we have tried out ourselves . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking the part the choreography is n't perfect and the police are only able to practice outside of work hours .
and whether or not their message has helped prevent violence may be difficult to measure .
however , members of p.i.4 say what matters is coming into contact with young people and encouraging positive attitudes about life such as in one of their four original songs : " i love life , i want to give it away and protect it , i have so much hope , maybe somebody could use some . " going beyond hip hop at a recent p.i.4 performance , there were mixed reviews for the police officers , but most young people seemed to appreciate the officers ' attempt at developing a relationship with young people on young people 's turf .
those skeptics who turn up for the concerts often come away surprised .
" i personally do n't find it so bad , i liked the lyrics and that they 're performing here , i think it 's actually a nice idea , " said one spectator .
and another young listener agreed , " i think you have to find a way to get closer to the public and i do n't have a problem with it at all . " still , some say hip hop just is n't the place for a policeman — particularly because of the often negative associations found in hip hop music when it comes to the police authorities .
one concert go-er commented that " hip hop is n't the right choice of music for them , because they are n't going to find a lot of sympathizers among hip-hoppers , i just ca n't imagine that . " but band leader michael mannheim says hip hop is just the beginning .
" we are n't fixed to hip-hop , " he said . " we worked well with our rapper and if tomorrow i find another singer with current music — be it rock , pop or soul , then we 'll do that too .
the only requirements are that it 's german music and that it has the right message . " although some critics suggest that it is n't the role of upstanding police officers to get up on stage and perform hip hop tunes , the foursome insists their message is worth it : " i wish you a voice , when you 're lying on the ground , when you are afraid and you ca n't get anymore air , yeah , yeah ...

a group of police officers in the western german city is trying to reach out to local youth by staging their own hip hop concerts . they rap about love , life and hope .
they dance in unison across the stage and crowds of young people watch them , enraptured at the sight before them .
germany 's next chart topping boy band ?
hardly .
the four men are members of the cologne police force , and they are committed to encouraging moral courage in local youth .
along the way , they are changing the way young people think about the cops .
they call themselves p.i.4 — an abbreviation for police inspection four .
the 25- to 30-year-old policemen shake their hips and raise their arms in sync with the beat while dressed in their standard issue , green police uniforms .
from the microphone the lyrics blast : " some say , i know it already , policemen on stage and an mc on the microphone , and you wanna say something , come to us after the show , you can ask whatever you want ... " preventing youth violence through music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : p.i. 4 at one of their concerts .
it 's a creative way of dealing with youth violence that brings young people into contact with authority figures who they often look upon with distrust .
faced with rising crime and a lack of resources in the german metropolis , many cologne police officers have come to the conclusion that prevention is the best answer to youth violence . three years ago , four such policemen formed a band of their own , and set out to transmit a positive message that might help stop the violent brawls which have become a daily feature of the officers ' work . today their lyrics can be heard at live performances across the city — in youth homes , at football games , demonstrations and concerts : " is it really so bad , things on a new path , bringing people together who were n't together before / it 's not about this crew winning a battle or having their single on the number one charts ... " the young civil servants take their mission seriously , which is one reason why hip hopper mr. man q.x. , also known as philip schwieren lent the dancing police officers his voice .
with schwieren 's help , the band has gone from corny wannabees to respectable hip hoppers . according to schwieren , the opportunity to work closely with the police has changed his opinion about them : " before , you 'd see a police car and a police officer and first you 'd think skeptically , ' what do they want from me , did i do something ? '
since then , i 've realized that you can talk with them like normal people , you can talk about whatever and it does n't have to be so hostile or against each other , " said schwieren . building bridges and trust still , dancing policemen on stage is an unusual sight , and the police officers do n't always have it easy with critical spectators , who wonder what the police are doing acting like rap stars .
but the police officers turned rappers see it differently , as they express in their lyrics " i tell you , hip hop has a job , hip hop has a job , a job , what 's hip hop got , hip hop has a job . "
indeed , for the officers , hip hop 's task is building bridges and trust .
their motto is , " look , act , call for help " against violence . andrea löhr , band member and police officer says the group gives their free time and energy to practicing their act in hopes it will have some positive effect on the communities they serve .
it 's not a professional act , but they give it their best shot , says löhr . " there is a large conference room at the station where we meet .
there are speakers in the room and we put the music on and we try and see how we can do it .
we also had some professional help , a choreographer who helped us , and some things we have tried out ourselves . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking the part the choreography is n't perfect and the police are only able to practice outside of work hours .
and whether or not their message has helped prevent violence may be difficult to measure .
however , members of p.i.4 say what matters is coming into contact with young people and encouraging positive attitudes about life such as in one of their four original songs : " i love life , i want to give it away and protect it , i have so much hope , maybe somebody could use some . " going beyond hip hop at a recent p.i.4 performance , there were mixed reviews for the police officers , but most young people seemed to appreciate the officers ' attempt at developing a relationship with young people on young people 's turf .
those skeptics who turn up for the concerts often come away surprised .
" i personally do n't find it so bad , i liked the lyrics and that they 're performing here , i think it 's actually a nice idea , " said one spectator .
and another young listener agreed , " i think you have to find a way to get closer to the public and i do n't have a problem with it at all . " still , some say hip hop just is n't the place for a policeman — particularly because of the often negative associations found in hip hop music when it comes to the police authorities .
one concert go-er commented that " hip hop is n't the right choice of music for them , because they are n't going to find a lot of sympathizers among hip-hoppers , i just ca n't imagine that . " but band leader michael mannheim says hip hop is just the beginning .
" we are n't fixed to hip-hop , " he said . " we worked well with our rapper and if tomorrow i find another singer with current music — be it rock , pop or soul , then we 'll do that too .
the only requirements are that it 's german music and that it has the right message . " although some critics suggest that it is n't the role of upstanding police officers to get up on stage and perform hip hop tunes , the foursome insists their message is worth it : " i wish you a voice , when you 're lying on the ground , when you are afraid and you ca n't get anymore air , yeah , yeah ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.02.2004 publisher drops book on nazi porno großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi porn videos enjoyed a healthy trade in the early 1940s across front lines .
a few weeks before it was to hit the presses , a german publishing house pulled a book based on the secret porn industry of the third reich .
the reasons remain unclear . any book that attempts to shed light on the little-known nazi porn industry in the early 1940s is not likely to arrive in bookstores without a hitch .
but when the rowohlt publishing house completely cancelled its contract with author thor kunkel shortly before his new novel , " endstufe " -lrb- final step -rrb- , was to hit the presses , a slight sensation rippled through the industry .
little is being said by rowohlt and its head alexander fest about the reasons for the cancellation of the for-march planned release .
a statement by rowohlt mentioned something about not being able to bridge differences on questions on the " aesthetic and subject matter " in central parts of the book .
the manuscript , which landed in the hands of the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , was apparently not only filled with scenes of vivid sex and brutality , but made some questionable ties between the crimes of the allied army and those of the nazi regime .
kunkel is reportedly devastated by the cancellation of a book he spent three years researching and writing .
" i had the impression at a certain point that -lrb- the book -rrb- was being edited on ideological , not aesthetic levels , " he said in an interview with die welt newspaper .
" and i saw that as censorship .
i 'm 40 years old .
i know what i 'm writing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kunkel , thor : das schwarzlicht-terrarium .
the frankfurt-born kunkel is considered a rising talent in german literary circles following his prize-winning 2000 debut , " das schwarzlicht-terrarium " , about the frankfurt drug and disco scene in the late 1970s .
porn traded for raw materials he came upon the subject material for " endstufe " after watching a documentary in 1991 that looked into the little-known porn industry that apparently flourished during the third reich .
after asking around , he eventually got in contact with someone who had copies of the so-called sachsenwald films .
the films are reportedly filled with with scenes of sex , power relations and violence .
they were rumored to have been part of a flourishing raw materials trade .
kunkel , based in amsterdam , moved to berlin to research the book , drawing upon witness testimony at the time , including a former actress in one of the films .
he forms his novel around a group of nazi scientists who work at a secret service clinic and produce porn films on the side .
the films are soon a major success and part of a trade network that stretches throughout the wider war zone .
the author infuses the description of the group of scientists with an end of the world attitude .
the characters are apparently self-indulgent and blissfully ignorant of the horrors of the concentration camps or battlefield misery , both of which are dealt with only fleetingly , according to the frankfurter allgemeine .
nazi theme should n't be too hot for germany no one seems to know for sure what combination of themes scared the publisher off : whether it was because it was novel that belittled the horrors of the nazi period , or whether kunkel documented the scientific experimentation at the time with a bit too much fascination .
fest , who recently cancelled a book called " i too , had to kill " by an israeli secret service agent , in a letter referred to the fact that kunkel 's work and subject matter could reap a hefty amount of criticism .
but kunkel seems nonplussed by such arguments .
" germany is a very normal european country , " he said in the welt interview .
" i do n't think we should be raised as humiliated , mentally-disturbed garden gnomes .
endstufe is written in a very modern language .
it 's not a historical novel .
instead , you have the feeling that the third reich is just around the corner . " dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback do you think the publishing company was right in pulling the book ?

a few weeks before it was to hit the presses , a german publishing house pulled a book based on the secret porn industry of the third reich .
the reasons remain unclear . any book that attempts to shed light on the little-known nazi porn industry in the early 1940s is not likely to arrive in bookstores without a hitch .
but when the rowohlt publishing house completely cancelled its contract with author thor kunkel shortly before his new novel , " endstufe " -lrb- final step -rrb- , was to hit the presses , a slight sensation rippled through the industry .
little is being said by rowohlt and its head alexander fest about the reasons for the cancellation of the for-march planned release .
a statement by rowohlt mentioned something about not being able to bridge differences on questions on the " aesthetic and subject matter " in central parts of the book .
the manuscript , which landed in the hands of the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , was apparently not only filled with scenes of vivid sex and brutality , but made some questionable ties between the crimes of the allied army and those of the nazi regime .
kunkel is reportedly devastated by the cancellation of a book he spent three years researching and writing .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kunkel , thor : das schwarzlicht-terrarium .
the frankfurt-born kunkel is considered a rising talent in german literary circles following his prize-winning 2000 debut , " das schwarzlicht-terrarium " , about the frankfurt drug and disco scene in the late 1970s .
porn traded for raw materials he came upon the subject material for " endstufe " after watching a documentary in 1991 that looked into the little-known porn industry that apparently flourished during the third reich .
after asking around , he eventually got in contact with someone who had copies of the so-called sachsenwald films .
the films are reportedly filled with with scenes of sex , power relations and violence .
they were rumored to have been part of a flourishing raw materials trade .
kunkel , based in amsterdam , moved to berlin to research the book , drawing upon witness testimony at the time , including a former actress in one of the films .
he forms his novel around a group of nazi scientists who work at a secret service clinic and produce porn films on the side .
the films are soon a major success and part of a trade network that stretches throughout the wider war zone .
the author infuses the description of the group of scientists with an end of the world attitude .
the characters are apparently self-indulgent and blissfully ignorant of the horrors of the concentration camps or battlefield misery , both of which are dealt with only fleetingly , according to the frankfurter allgemeine .
nazi theme should n't be too hot for germany no one seems to know for sure what combination of themes scared the publisher off : whether it was because it was novel that belittled the horrors of the nazi period , or whether kunkel documented the scientific experimentation at the time with a bit too much fascination .
fest , who recently cancelled a book called " i too , had to kill " by an israeli secret service agent , in a letter referred to the fact that kunkel 's work and subject matter could reap a hefty amount of criticism .
but kunkel seems nonplussed by such arguments .
" germany is a very normal european country , " he said in the welt interview .
" i do n't think we should be raised as humiliated , mentally-disturbed garden gnomes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.02.2004 aventis posts profits to ward off hostile takeover bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aventis says it can stand on its own .
the french-german pharmaceutical company aventis announced growing profits for 2003 in an effort to ward off a hostile takeover bid from a smaller french drug firm . aventis reported that net profits for 2003 had increased by 17.5 percent to € 2.44 billion -lrb- $ 3.07 billion -rrb- .
earnings per share had also risen by 18.6 percent although a weakening dollar had led to a 4.5 percent drop in sales .
aventis chief executive igor landau presented the 2003 profits at a press conference in london to make the case that the company is strong enough to stand on its own and can reject a € 48 billion -lrb- $ 60.4 billion -rrb- hostile takeover bid from the french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthélabo .
" today 's announcement highlights how sanofi 's offer fundamentally undervalues aventis , " said landau .
" their hostile bid is a cheap attempt to transfer their risks to our shareholders , " he added .
landau had previously hinted that there were other drug firms that would make better partners for aventis , suggesting that sanofi was using the hostile bid to avoid becoming a target of a takeover itself – a fact not disputed by sanofi 's executive board .
" they need us , but we do n't need them , ” said landau last week .
merger to create european drug giant sanofi-synthélabo made the grab for aventis on monday offering five of its shares and € 69 for every six aventis shares .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquarters of french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo sa in paris .
dealers and analysts said the franco-german company 's concerted attempt to fend off sanofi 's bid would ultimately fail , but aventis would force its french rival to increase its offer by at least 15 percent .
sanofi is pushing for the creation of a new european drug giant which would have a stronger combined presence on the lucrative u.s. market .
aventis pointed out on thursday that it already has a strong presence there ; 38 percent of its core sales are made in the us .
a merger with sanofi would create the third largest pharmaceutical company in terms of global sales behind the u.s. giant pfizer inc. and the british firm glaxosmithkline plc .
with a combined net worth of € 16.6 billion , aventis currently ranks as the sixth largest pharmaceutical company in the world .
the other well known german chemical firm , bayer , comes in at place 18 with a combined net worth of € 4.3 billion .
france enthusiastic , germany worried about job losses the french government is said to be enthusiastic about the takeover bid which would create a pharmaceutical giant based in paris .
germany is less excited about the prospect .
federal economics minister wolfgang clement warned last week that a merger could result in job losses in germany if the company moves its focus to paris .
" the german government has a strong interest in strengthening aventis ' position in germany rather than weakening it , " he said .
a combination of sanofi 's 70,000 strong workforce with aventis ' 69,000 employees could result in as many as 10,000 job cuts in both germany and france .
trade unions have said the number of lost jobs could be closer to 25,000 .
aventis now employs some 9,000 german workers who loyally support their chief executive igor landau .
michael klippel the head of the works committee at aventis said , " we are confident because we believe he will fight .
he is not one of these managers who will sell out for a few marks . "
analysts say the takeover battle is extremely personal for the 59 year old igor landau .
he was instrumental in the merger of the french drug firm rhône-poulenc , where he had been an executive for many years , with one of germany 's largest pharmaceutical companies , hoechst .
the deal was the pinnacle of three decades of work and landau shed the firm 's chemical and agricultural operation to focus solely on drugs .
hostile takeovers rare in europe the battle being played out in london between aventis and sanofi is unusual for europe , where hostile takeover attempts are extremely rare .
while experts do n't expect there to be an increase in hostile bids , they do believe friendly mergers , like the one that created aventis , will continue .
according to some experts , smaller pharmaceuticals in europe soon wo n't be able to keep up with the giants .
professor klaus pohle sits on the board of directors of lion bioscience ag , a german software provider for drug companies .
he said german drug companies have lost their title as " chemists of the world " because of a research policy burdened with too much bureaucracy that serves to stifles innovation .
research and development vital to drug firms surviving the research , development and release of a new drug onto the market takes approximately 12 years .
then it takes another six to nine years before substantial profits are made .
pohle said the larger the pharmaceutical company , the more money and time it can invest in new projects and the less money is lost when a project fails .
experts say even if sanofi 's offer transforms itself into a friendly one , landau , like many chief executives whose company has been targeted by a hostile buyer , is unlikely to gain control of the new company .
if the sanofi bid fails , the smaller french firm is likely to be next in line for a hostile takeover bid .
aventis shares on thursday were up 0.7 percent after comfortably beating forecast profits , while suitor sanofi-synthélabo stayed at 2.8 percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis moves to prevent hostile takeover french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo wants to acquire the franco-german drug-maker aventis in a hostile takeover .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.02.2004 nato defense chiefs return to munich großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld and joschka fischer got hot under the collar last year in munich .
nato defense chiefs will meet in munich this weekend to discuss the alliance 's role in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere .
the hope is that the meeting will be more cordial than last year . nato defense and foreign ministers will gather in munich on friday to discuss the lingering fallout from the iraq war and the future direction of the alliance .
it will be the 40th annual meeting for the german security conference . the big names of the defense world , an estimated 250 officials including pentagon chief donald rumsfeld are due to attend , will use the informal get-together to address transatlantic relations , the future of nato , and current developments in the middle east . they will also likely to take the opportunity to discuss extending the alliance 's role in afghanistan while in the bavarian capital , according to diplomats in brussels . iraq situation will again dominate agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the main focus will undoubtedly be the situation in iraq , even more so now inquiries have been launched into intelligence failures in the united states and britain regarding the lack of evidence in the search for weapons of mass destruction a year after the war began . the u.s. delegation is also likely to continue with its pressure to get nato to play a role in iraq as part of washington ’ s current initiative to solicit wider contributions from its member states . last year 's munich conference was a highly tense affair with officials from washington , paris and berlin on edge as a un security council vote on a new iraq resolution loomed ominously near .
rumsfeld and german foreign minister joschka fischer famously clashed at the event and will meet again on friday with hopefully less static in the air between them . security conference host horst teltschik told reporters in munich that some reconciliation is likely .
" i get the impression that the americans want to give us a sign that they are prepared to talk so that both sides can get back to a ' normal ' relationship . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish soldiers in the ancient city of babylon , 80 kilometers south of baghdad , iraq .
new nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer said last week that the alliance , which is supporting the polish-led division in iraq , is ready and able to do the job .
" if the question comes , it goes without saying that i 'm very much in favour of a nato role , " he told journalists , before adding : " it 's too early to say exactly what that role will be . " despite making favourable noises in the direction of the united states in the form of low-key discussions , most nato officials remain resolute that no action will be taken before sovereignty is transferred from the u.s.-appointed interim leadership to the iraqis , a move that has been pencilled in for june . isaf 's afghan mission to be addressed the defense ministers will also consider the success of its continuing mission in afghanistan .
when the alliance took over command last august of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- it was nato 's first mission outside europe .
since then , the command of the mission , which has until now been centered on the capital kabul , has been rotated between member countries , with canada currently in control . nato wants to extend isaf 's operations beyond the capital kabul , notably using german troops , but it is having trouble with resources .
" i think that there is political will , but translating it into terms of concrete forces on the ground is more difficult and that is our challenge " said britain 's ambassador to nato peter ricketts in a press conference in brussels this week . eurocorps ready to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurocorps in mülheim , germany .
the landscape of nato ’ s role in afghanistan is likely to change further after officials announced on wednesday that the five-nation eurocorps army is ready to take the lead in the afghan peacekeeping mission later this year .
the eurocorps was recognized in 2002 as a nato high readiness force and has already carried out peacekeeping duties in kosovo and bosnia . with plans to be released and confirmed in the coming days , the 60,000-strong force - made up of troops from germany , france , spain , belgium and luxembourg - would more than likely be ready to assume control of the kabul-based mission by the summer .
it was not immediately clear how many of its soldiers would leave for afghanistan , as part of the 5,500-strong isaf . ministers from the five eurocorps nations are scheduled to meet on the margins of the munich meeting to discuss taking on the headquarters role . washington calls for nato engagement in mid-east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the middle east situation is also on the agenda .

last year was an outstanding year for german cinema .
now , as the 54th international film festival berlin kicks off , it ’ s time for the stars of germany ’ s film industry to sit back and enjoy the attention . the berlinale gets underway on thursday with film fans flocking to the german capital to bask in the warm celebrity glow of the global stars and directors who will be arriving throughout the ten days of glamour and glitz .
but it will not only be the heat from the bright lights that will warm berliners attending the shows and events that make up the festival circus .
germans from all over the country can also revel in the feeling of pride that berlin ’ s film gala and the german movie industry as a whole is currently enjoying a surge in international profile , popularity and profit .
“ it 's been one of the best years ever for cinema in germany , ” said dieter kosslick , the festival ’ s director who has turned the berlinale into a showcase for german productions and has helped it secure its place behind cannes and alongside venice as one of europe 's three most important film festivals .
“ as long as i 'm the head of this festival , its backing for german films will remain high , ” kosslick said in an interview with reporters in the run-up to the festival ’ s opening .
“ i 've never had to push for german films because i 've always found them to be very good .
it was always other people who had problems with them . ”
from nowhere to a miracle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german director caroline link holds the oscar for " nowhere in africa . "
those problems have been fading ever since “ nowhere in africa , ” a film about the challenges facing a jewish family who flee to kenya after the nazis take power , won the academy award for best foreign language movie last march .
that oscar and a string of domestic box office hits have put germany ’ s film industry back into the international spotlight .
“ it 's obviously been a great year for german film , ” said rolf baehr , chairman of the german film board , in an interview with reuters .
“ german films are now reaching audiences with good stories . ”
“ film makers are concentrating on viewers more and not focused on their own self-realization .
the experience and training are also greatly improved .
it 's all coming together . ”
the successes of films such as “ good bye , lenin ” - the comedy about a son who conceals the fall of the berlin wall from his ailing mother , and the world war ii drama “ rosenstrasse " , has helped the domestic market share climb to about 15 percent in 2003 from around 11 percent the year before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good bye , lenin .
hello success .
“ good bye , lenin , ” which won six european film awards in december , topped germany 's box office last year with over 6.5 million people turning out to see the film , generating nearly € 31.9 million -lrb- $ 40 million -rrb- .
“ the miracle of bern ” , a film about west germany 's 1954 world cup winning soccer team , and the biopic “ luther ” also scored with audiences inside and outside germany , and film makers are hopeful the festival will herald another big year .
interest in german films rises “ thanks to caroline link 's oscar -lrb- for nowhere in africa -rrb- , there 's now a lot more interest in german films from abroad , " said romuald karmaker , a german director whose film “ nightsongs ” is one of 23 competing for the top golden bear awards .
the director told reporters : “ the entire atmosphere is completely different now , ” referring to the past when the berlinale featured very few german films in its program .
“ the attention we 're getting now is absolutely essential . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katja riemann holds the " coppa volpi " for best actress at the 60th venice film festival .
apart from director link ’ s oscar , germany ’ s profile has also been raised by performances - katja riemann -lrb- picture -rrb- won a best actress award at the venice film festival in september for her performance in as the aryan wife of a jew in nazi germany in “ rosenstrasse ” - and the use of german locations in major hollywood productions .
location of choice “ enemy at the gates , ” the star-studded depiction of the siege of stalingrad during world war ii , was filmed at the refurbished babelsberg studios south of berlin . hollywood star matt damon has rekindled his german links in the latest installment of his spy franchise by filming “ the bourne supremacy , ” the sequel to the franka potente co-starring original “ the bourne identity , ” in berlin .
oscar winner kevin spacey is also directing his film “ beyond the sea ” in the german capital .
berlin has been in direct competition with the three other major media metropolises in germany - hamburg , cologne and munich - for the favor of the film-makers .
and it seems that the capital is coming out on top in a competition where no one in germany is ultimately losing out .
according to the german institute of economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , more than 1,000 film and television enterprises are currently taking advantage of berlin ’ s allure . all in all , it adds up to a satisfying backdrop for the glamour that the german capital will be host to for the next ten days . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de column : cuddling at the berlinale berlin ’ s film festival is a glamorous affair , but not for this average movie-fan , who is having a tough time getting access .

last year was an outstanding year for german cinema .
now , as the 54th international film festival berlin kicks off , it ’ s time for the stars of germany ’ s film industry to sit back and enjoy the attention . the berlinale gets underway on thursday with film fans flocking to the german capital to bask in the warm celebrity glow of the global stars and directors who will be arriving throughout the ten days of glamour and glitz .
but it will not only be the heat from the bright lights that will warm berliners attending the shows and events that make up the festival circus .
germans from all over the country can also revel in the feeling of pride that berlin ’ s film gala and the german movie industry as a whole is currently enjoying a surge in international profile , popularity and profit .
“ it 's been one of the best years ever for cinema in germany , ” said dieter kosslick , the festival ’ s director who has turned the berlinale into a showcase for german productions and has helped it secure its place behind cannes and alongside venice as one of europe 's three most important film festivals .
“ as long as i 'm the head of this festival , its backing for german films will remain high , ” kosslick said in an interview with reporters in the run-up to the festival ’ s opening .
“ i 've never had to push for german films because i 've always found them to be very good .
it was always other people who had problems with them . ”
from nowhere to a miracle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german director caroline link holds the oscar for " nowhere in africa . "
those problems have been fading ever since “ nowhere in africa , ” a film about the challenges facing a jewish family who flee to kenya after the nazis take power , won the academy award for best foreign language movie last march .
that oscar and a string of domestic box office hits have put germany ’ s film industry back into the international spotlight .
“ it 's obviously been a great year for german film , ” said rolf baehr , chairman of the german film board , in an interview with reuters .
“ german films are now reaching audiences with good stories . ”
“ film makers are concentrating on viewers more and not focused on their own self-realization .
the experience and training are also greatly improved .
it 's all coming together . ”
the successes of films such as “ good bye , lenin ” - the comedy about a son who conceals the fall of the berlin wall from his ailing mother , and the world war ii drama “ rosenstrasse " , has helped the domestic market share climb to about 15 percent in 2003 from around 11 percent the year before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good bye , lenin .
hello success .
“ good bye , lenin , ” which won six european film awards in december , topped germany 's box office last year with over 6.5 million people turning out to see the film , generating nearly € 31.9 million -lrb- $ 40 million -rrb- .
“ the miracle of bern ” , a film about west germany 's 1954 world cup winning soccer team , and the biopic “ luther ” also scored with audiences inside and outside germany , and film makers are hopeful the festival will herald another big year .
interest in german films rises “ thanks to caroline link 's oscar -lrb- for nowhere in africa -rrb- , there 's now a lot more interest in german films from abroad , " said romuald karmaker , a german director whose film “ nightsongs ” is one of 23 competing for the top golden bear awards .
the director told reporters : “ the entire atmosphere is completely different now , ” referring to the past when the berlinale featured very few german films in its program .
“ the attention we 're getting now is absolutely essential . ”

berlin has been in direct competition with the three other major media metropolises in germany - hamburg , cologne and munich - for the favor of the film-makers .

british prime minister tony blair has said he might join an increasing number of eu countries that want to initially bar low-cost workers from new european union countries from working in the west . while the expansion of the eu by ten member states in may this year is seen by many as a historical milestone , it has also raised fears of mass migration of labor from the poorer , mostly ex-communist new members to the more affluent west .
eu skeptics say a large influx of low-wage workers would prove devastating to current members of the bloc , who are already facing stubbornly high unemployment rates .
prime minister tony blair told parliament on wednesday that he was re-evaluating his earlier stance on the issue , and might advocate imposing immigration controls and welfare benefit restrictions on immigrants from the 10 new countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair “ it is important that we recognize that there is a potential risk from these accession countries , ” blair -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliament .
“ we will take whatever measures are necessary to make sure that the ‘ pull factor ’ which might draw people here is closed off . ”
the draw , he said , could be britain ’ s welfare benefit system , and it would be re-examined to determined whether it was “ too generous . ”
change of heart britain ’ s new jumpiness about eastern migration comes in the wake of sweden ’ s decision last week to impose limits on workers from the new eu countries .
the netherlands also said recently it would impose a limit on the number of immigrant workers it would accept .
norway , though not an eu member but with close ties to the bloc , said on thursday it is also exploring possible restrictions , although it has previously stated its borders would be open to new eu citizens .
“ we now see that some of our neighboring countries , and now sweden , state that they will have some exceptions for some years , for an interim period , ” prime minister kjell magne bondevik told reporters on thursday after talks with european commission president romano prodi .
“ so we also now … intend to make a proposal for parliament about some possible exceptions for an interim period so we are more in line with our neighboring countries . ” for two years after enlargement , labor market access with depend on national policies , and not be dictated by brussels .
according to the european commission , only about half the 15 member states have told the eu about their plans .
austria , finland , belgium , france and denmark are planning limits , in some cases for up to seven years .
only ireland and spain have said they will keep their borders open .
germany , with its high unemployment and generous welfare system , insisted in 2002 during entry negotiations for the new candidate countries on a clause that would allow it to impose restrictions to its market for citizens from central and eastern europe until 2011 .
second-class citizens ?
malta , cyprus , estonia , latvia , lithuania , hungary , poland , slovakia , slovenia and the czech republic will become official members of the eu in may of this year . in the past months , tension between current and future members of the eu has increased on a number of issues .
the about-turns on work policy are likely to deepen the fear among many in the accession countries that they will be treated as second-class european citizens .
“ the thinking that we need long transition periods 14 years after the fall of the berlin wall shows a lack of solidarity , ” jan figiel , slovakia ’ s candidate for the european commission , told reuters .
the new members point to one of the fundaments of the eu project — free movement of persons including the right to live and work in another member state .
but as the eu prepares to take in 75 million new people , mostly from countries formerly part of the soviet bloc where wages were lower , fears have been growing of an influx of labor in search of a better standard of living .
the unease has been especially strong in germany , which , since 1990 , has attracted about 75 percent of the migrants to the eu from application countries .
unfounded fears experts , however , note that history teaches that such fears have generally been without foundation .
in previous eu enlargement periods , such as greece in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 , transitional measures such as labor restrictions were put into place , largely unnecessarily .
other alarms about east-west migration have proven false .
one example is a 1989 study by the u.n. high commission for refugees which estimated that 25 million people from the eastern europe would move to the west in the 1990s .

prime minister tony blair told parliament on wednesday that he was re-evaluating his earlier stance on the issue , and might advocate imposing immigration controls and welfare benefit restrictions on immigrants from the 10 new countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair “ it is important that we recognize that there is a potential risk from these accession countries , ” blair -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliament .
“ we will take whatever measures are necessary to make sure that the ‘ pull factor ’ which might draw people here is closed off . ”
the draw , he said , could be britain ’ s welfare benefit system , and it would be re-examined to determined whether it was “ too generous . ”
change of heart britain ’ s new jumpiness about eastern migration comes in the wake of sweden ’ s decision last week to impose limits on workers from the new eu countries .
the netherlands also said recently it would impose a limit on the number of immigrant workers it would accept .
norway , though not an eu member but with close ties to the bloc , said on thursday it is also exploring possible restrictions , although it has previously stated its borders would be open to new eu citizens .
“ we now see that some of our neighboring countries , and now sweden , state that they will have some exceptions for some years , for an interim period , ” prime minister kjell magne bondevik told reporters on thursday after talks with european commission president romano prodi .
“ so we also now … intend to make a proposal for parliament about some possible exceptions for an interim period so we are more in line with our neighboring countries . ” for two years after enlargement , labor market access with depend on national policies , and not be dictated by brussels .
according to the european commission , only about half the 15 member states have told the eu about their plans .
austria , finland , belgium , france and denmark are planning limits , in some cases for up to seven years .
only ireland and spain have said they will keep their borders open .
germany , with its high unemployment and generous welfare system , insisted in 2002 during entry negotiations for the new candidate countries on a clause that would allow it to impose restrictions to its market for citizens from central and eastern europe until 2011 .
second-class citizens ?
malta , cyprus , estonia , latvia , lithuania , hungary , poland , slovakia , slovenia and the czech republic will become official members of the eu in may of this year . in the past months , tension between current and future members of the eu has increased on a number of issues .
the about-turns on work policy are likely to deepen the fear among many in the accession countries that they will be treated as second-class european citizens .
“ the thinking that we need long transition periods 14 years after the fall of the berlin wall shows a lack of solidarity , ” jan figiel , slovakia ’ s candidate for the european commission , told reuters .
the new members point to one of the fundaments of the eu project — free movement of persons including the right to live and work in another member state .
but as the eu prepares to take in 75 million new people , mostly from countries formerly part of the soviet bloc where wages were lower , fears have been growing of an influx of labor in search of a better standard of living .
the unease has been especially strong in germany , which , since 1990 , has attracted about 75 percent of the migrants to the eu from application countries .
unfounded fears experts , however , note that history teaches that such fears have generally been without foundation .
in previous eu enlargement periods , such as greece in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 , transitional measures such as labor restrictions were put into place , largely unnecessarily .
other alarms about east-west migration have proven false .
one example is a 1989 study by the u.n. high commission for refugees which estimated that 25 million people from the eastern europe would move to the west in the 1990s .

last year was an outstanding year for german cinema .
now , as the 54th international film festival berlin kicks off , it ’ s time for the stars of germany ’ s film industry to sit back and enjoy the attention . the berlinale gets underway on thursday with film fans flocking to the german capital to bask in the warm celebrity glow of the global stars and directors who will be arriving throughout the ten days of glamour and glitz .
but it will not only be the heat from the bright lights that will warm berliners attending the shows and events that make up the festival circus .
germans from all over the country can also revel in the feeling of pride that berlin ’ s film gala and the german movie industry as a whole is currently enjoying a surge in international profile , popularity and profit .
“ it 's been one of the best years ever for cinema in germany , ” said dieter kosslick , the festival ’ s director who has turned the berlinale into a showcase for german productions and has helped it secure its place behind cannes and alongside venice as one of europe 's three most important film festivals .
“ as long as i 'm the head of this festival , its backing for german films will remain high , ” kosslick said in an interview with reporters in the run-up to the festival ’ s opening .
“ i 've never had to push for german films because i 've always found them to be very good .
it was always other people who had problems with them . ”
from nowhere to a miracle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german director caroline link holds the oscar for " nowhere in africa . "
those problems have been fading ever since “ nowhere in africa , ” a film about the challenges facing a jewish family who flee to kenya after the nazis take power , won the academy award for best foreign language movie last march .
that oscar and a string of domestic box office hits have put germany ’ s film industry back into the international spotlight .
“ it 's obviously been a great year for german film , ” said rolf baehr , chairman of the german film board , in an interview with reuters .
“ german films are now reaching audiences with good stories . ”
“ film makers are concentrating on viewers more and not focused on their own self-realization .
the experience and training are also greatly improved .
it 's all coming together . ”
the successes of films such as “ good bye , lenin ” - the comedy about a son who conceals the fall of the berlin wall from his ailing mother , and the world war ii drama “ rosenstrasse " , has helped the domestic market share climb to about 15 percent in 2003 from around 11 percent the year before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good bye , lenin .
hello success .
“ good bye , lenin , ” which won six european film awards in december , topped germany 's box office last year with over 6.5 million people turning out to see the film , generating nearly € 31.9 million -lrb- $ 40 million -rrb- .
“ the miracle of bern ” , a film about west germany 's 1954 world cup winning soccer team , and the biopic “ luther ” also scored with audiences inside and outside germany , and film makers are hopeful the festival will herald another big year .
interest in german films rises “ thanks to caroline link 's oscar -lrb- for nowhere in africa -rrb- , there 's now a lot more interest in german films from abroad , " said romuald karmaker , a german director whose film “ nightsongs ” is one of 23 competing for the top golden bear awards .
the director told reporters : “ the entire atmosphere is completely different now , ” referring to the past when the berlinale featured very few german films in its program .
“ the attention we 're getting now is absolutely essential . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katja riemann holds the " coppa volpi " for best actress at the 60th venice film festival .
apart from director link ’ s oscar , germany ’ s profile has also been raised by performances - katja riemann -lrb- picture -rrb- won a best actress award at the venice film festival in september for her performance in as the aryan wife of a jew in nazi germany in “ rosenstrasse ” - and the use of german locations in major hollywood productions .
location of choice “ enemy at the gates , ” the star-studded depiction of the siege of stalingrad during world war ii , was filmed at the refurbished babelsberg studios south of berlin . hollywood star matt damon has rekindled his german links in the latest installment of his spy franchise by filming “ the bourne supremacy , ” the sequel to the franka potente co-starring original “ the bourne identity , ” in berlin .
oscar winner kevin spacey is also directing his film “ beyond the sea ” in the german capital .
berlin has been in direct competition with the three other major media metropolises in germany - hamburg , cologne and munich - for the favor of the film-makers .
and it seems that the capital is coming out on top in a competition where no one in germany is ultimately losing out .
according to the german institute of economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , more than 1,000 film and television enterprises are currently taking advantage of berlin ’ s allure . all in all , it adds up to a satisfying backdrop for the glamour that the german capital will be host to for the next ten days . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de column : cuddling at the berlinale berlin ’ s film festival is a glamorous affair , but not for this average movie-fan , who is having a tough time getting access .

that oscar and a string of domestic box office hits have put germany ’ s film industry back into the international spotlight .
“ it 's obviously been a great year for german film , ” said rolf baehr , chairman of the german film board , in an interview with reuters .
“ german films are now reaching audiences with good stories . ”
“ film makers are concentrating on viewers more and not focused on their own self-realization .

the successes of films such as “ good bye , lenin ” - the comedy about a son who conceals the fall of the berlin wall from his ailing mother , and the world war ii drama “ rosenstrasse " , has helped the domestic market share climb to about 15 percent in 2003 from around 11 percent the year before .

“ good bye , lenin , ” which won six european film awards in december , topped germany 's box office last year with over 6.5 million people turning out to see the film , generating nearly € 31.9 million -lrb- $ 40 million -rrb- .
“ the miracle of bern ” , a film about west germany 's 1954 world cup winning soccer team , and the biopic “ luther ” also scored with audiences inside and outside germany , and film makers are hopeful the festival will herald another big year .
interest in german films rises “ thanks to caroline link 's oscar -lrb- for nowhere in africa -rrb- , there 's now a lot more interest in german films from abroad , " said romuald karmaker , a german director whose film “ nightsongs ” is one of 23 competing for the top golden bear awards .
the director told reporters : “ the entire atmosphere is completely different now , ” referring to the past when the berlinale featured very few german films in its program .

last year was an outstanding year for german cinema .
now , as the 54th international film festival berlin kicks off , it ’ s time for the stars of germany ’ s film industry to sit back and enjoy the attention . the berlinale gets underway on thursday with film fans flocking to the german capital to bask in the warm celebrity glow of the global stars and directors who will be arriving throughout the ten days of glamour and glitz .
but it will not only be the heat from the bright lights that will warm berliners attending the shows and events that make up the festival circus .
germans from all over the country can also revel in the feeling of pride that berlin ’ s film gala and the german movie industry as a whole is currently enjoying a surge in international profile , popularity and profit .
“ it 's been one of the best years ever for cinema in germany , ” said dieter kosslick , the festival ’ s director who has turned the berlinale into a showcase for german productions and has helped it secure its place behind cannes and alongside venice as one of europe 's three most important film festivals .
“ as long as i 'm the head of this festival , its backing for german films will remain high , ” kosslick said in an interview with reporters in the run-up to the festival ’ s opening .
“ i 've never had to push for german films because i 've always found them to be very good .
it was always other people who had problems with them . ”

european papers on thursday focused on u.s. democratic presidential front-runner john kerry ’ s success on the campaign trail .
most warned kerry had his work cut out if he was to dislodge bush from the white house . u.s. presidential candidate john kerry won five of seven democratic primaries on tuesday .
dutch left-leaning paper volkskrant wrote that kerry ’ s success was based on the fact that " he ’ s trusted and seen as capable of being elected by many " as well as on his prestige that he built up as a vietnam veteran and during his long stint in the u.s. senate .
" but so far his election campaign has seldom witnessed sweeping enthusiasm .
one is still waiting for a political message that can stir american voters to entrust the highest post in the country to an acting senator for the first time since the days of john f. kennedy , " the daily concluded .
" can john kerry chase george w. bush out of the white house ? "
french daily liberation asked and added that the question had taken on new urgency since kerry appeared to have good chances of being pitched as the democrats ’ presidential candidate .
the paper mused that if the voters had already made kerry a favorite or planned to do so , it was because they are convinced that he can be elected .
" in paris kerry has already been declared as the most likely democratic presidential hopeful , " it wrote .
" but to defeat an acting president , even a beleaguered one , the candidate must have outstanding qualities and the circumstances need to be exceptional , " the broadsheet cautioned .
the independent in london said if there is one lesson to be drawn from past american president campaigns , it is that favorites whether for nominations or for the white house become the target of brickbats as soon as they are identified .
the paper expected the other democrat hopefuls to turn their fire on the front-runner .
" kerry has proved his appeal to voters in the north , east , center and southwest of the country , he has attracted all classes , white americans and hispanics . "
but the daily warned , " kerry must prepare himself for whatever the other candidates may dig up to use against him and dampen his voter appeal . "
belgian daily le soir was optimistic that kerry ’ s surging popularity had the potential to unseat president bush .
" everywhere the voter turnout has broken records , a sign for the mobilization of democrat followers to remove the president from the white house , " the paper wrote .
" but more than the surveys that show that john kerry and john edwards will defeat him , it ’ s this resoluteness that must be unnerving george bush because if affects states -lrb- missouri and arizona -rrb- that he -lrb- bush -rrb- won only narrowly in 2000 . "
" a democratic people , who are in unanimous agreement that george w. bush must go , are pinning their hopes on john kerry and to a lesser extent on john edwards .
but is john kerry really the man to execute that goal ? " asked zürich-based swiss daily tages-anzeiger .
the paper pointed out that though kerry had acquired the reputation of a solid and sound politician during his long years in the washington senate , he was definitely not a visionary .
the senator may possess the necessary stature , but his readiness to take on political risks still needs to be proven , the daily stressed .
liberal austrian daily der standard opined that john kerry had hit the right note in his election campaign .
" kerry has – just like his rival john edwards – always struck a mildly populist tone in his campaign and portrayed bush , not without reason , as the president of ‘ corporate america ’ , of the rich and the powerful , " it wrote .
the daily added that as the husband of a rich heiress who owns a billion-dollar ketchup company , kerry wasn ’ t exactly in danger of ending up on the streets anytime soon .
" but he -lrb- kerry -rrb- has still understood the importance of profiling himself as the advocate of the lower and middle classes in the u.s. , who are reeling from the enron scandal and the latest tax cuts by the government and do n't have much to laugh about under bush . "
norway ’ s conservative aftenposten observed that john kerry seems to have the tail wind behind him , judging by his success so far in the primary elections .
" however , kerry must master a difficult balancing act with regard to wooing voters and keeping the ones who support him already , " the paper warned .
" the key is the level of criticism kerry may use against the other candidates , which if too personal and petty , could repel voters , " the daily wrote .
germany ’ s conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung admired the activist zeal the democrats have shown in recent months .
" they ’ re positively burning with the desire to get george bush out of the white house with a fury that is strategically focussed , " the paper wrote .
but it added , " the democrats are seeking the most electable candidate which will be quite a challenge in a country that is so deeply divided . "
italian daily la repubblica reflected that it ’ s still a long way off till the u.s. presidential election and the fortunes of the democrats could rise and fall by then .
" this long journey to the american presidential polls is marked by tides that rise and devour candidates and their hopes everyday .
today they appear to let bush sink and let his two opponents rise , the nth ‘ new kennedy ’ , senator john forbes kerry and right after him the ‘ new clinton ’ , southerner john edwards .

european papers on thursday focused on u.s. democratic presidential front-runner john kerry ’ s success on the campaign trail .
most warned kerry had his work cut out if he was to dislodge bush from the white house . u.s. presidential candidate john kerry won five of seven democratic primaries on tuesday .
dutch left-leaning paper volkskrant wrote that kerry ’ s success was based on the fact that " he ’ s trusted and seen as capable of being elected by many " as well as on his prestige that he built up as a vietnam veteran and during his long stint in the u.s. senate .
" but so far his election campaign has seldom witnessed sweeping enthusiasm .
one is still waiting for a political message that can stir american voters to entrust the highest post in the country to an acting senator for the first time since the days of john f. kennedy , " the daily concluded .
" can john kerry chase george w. bush out of the white house ? "
french daily liberation asked and added that the question had taken on new urgency since kerry appeared to have good chances of being pitched as the democrats ’ presidential candidate .
the paper mused that if the voters had already made kerry a favorite or planned to do so , it was because they are convinced that he can be elected .
" in paris kerry has already been declared as the most likely democratic presidential hopeful , " it wrote .
" but to defeat an acting president , even a beleaguered one , the candidate must have outstanding qualities and the circumstances need to be exceptional , " the broadsheet cautioned .
the independent in london said if there is one lesson to be drawn from past american president campaigns , it is that favorites whether for nominations or for the white house become the target of brickbats as soon as they are identified .
the paper expected the other democrat hopefuls to turn their fire on the front-runner .
" kerry has proved his appeal to voters in the north , east , center and southwest of the country , he has attracted all classes , white americans and hispanics . "
but the daily warned , " kerry must prepare himself for whatever the other candidates may dig up to use against him and dampen his voter appeal . "
belgian daily le soir was optimistic that kerry ’ s surging popularity had the potential to unseat president bush .

the roller-coaster course of the five-month trial against abdelghani mzoudi left judges no choice but to acquit him , deutsche welle 's peter phillip writes in a commentary on thursday 's verdict . moroccan abdelghani mzoudi would have had to be extremely unlucky to be convicted of abetting the sept .

germany ’ s federal prosecutors had charged him with exactly that and blamed the student for playing a role in the deaths of 3,066 people .

11 attacks had stayed in germany as inconspicuous “ sleepers ” before the attacks , it was only natural that the german authorities would investigate their surroundings and search for accomplices to put them on trial .
one escaped – ramzi binalshibh – another , mounir al motassadeq , has been sentenced to 15 years in prison . whether this verdict will hold up is more than questionable after mzoudi ’ s acquittal .

what ’ s even more significant , much that normally would not have been accepted by a court seems to have been tolerated out of consideration for washington : the u.s. didn ’ t offer any legal assistance ; they didn ’ t allow interrogations of binalshibh or other incarcerated suspects and instead simply handed the german authorities quotes from their own interrogations , according to the sink-or-swim principle . prosecutors ridicule themselves the judge was already so annoyed by this in december that he released mzoudi from jail .
prosecutors didn ’ t like this at all and were led to ridicule themselves : one day before the verdict was supposed to be announced , they tried to turn the trial in a different direction by conjuring up an alleged witness .
the same happened again on thursday : hours before the verdict , supposedly new evidence was offered to the court . the judges stayed their course , as that ’ s no way to convict someone .

the roller-coaster course of the five-month trial against abdelghani mzoudi left judges no choice but to acquit him , deutsche welle 's peter phillip writes in a commentary on thursday 's verdict . moroccan abdelghani mzoudi would have had to be extremely unlucky to be convicted of abetting the sept .
11 attacks in the united states .
germany ’ s federal prosecutors had charged him with exactly that and blamed the student for playing a role in the deaths of 3,066 people .
but the hamburg judges were n't convinced and they came back with the only verdict that seemed possible after the trial ’ s somewhat haphazard course : an acquittal . the trial became unfocused because politics and the legal system kept clashing .
supporting the fight against terrorism wholeheartedly is certainly backed by germans across the political spectrum , but this consensus starts crumbling as soon as this support requires blindly following the u.s. ’ s leadership .

one escaped – ramzi binalshibh – another , mounir al motassadeq , has been sentenced to 15 years in prison . whether this verdict will hold up is more than questionable after mzoudi ’ s acquittal .
real proof for motassadeq ’ s guilt does not exist .
what ’ s even more significant , much that normally would not have been accepted by a court seems to have been tolerated out of consideration for washington : the u.s. didn ’ t offer any legal assistance ; they didn ’ t allow interrogations of binalshibh or other incarcerated suspects and instead simply handed the german authorities quotes from their own interrogations , according to the sink-or-swim principle . prosecutors ridicule themselves the judge was already so annoyed by this in december that he released mzoudi from jail .

british prime minister tony blair has said he might join an increasing number of eu countries that want to initially bar low-cost workers from new european union countries from working in the west . while the expansion of the eu by ten member states in may this year is seen by many as a historical milestone , it has also raised fears of mass migration of labor from the poorer , mostly ex-communist new members to the more affluent west .
eu skeptics say a large influx of low-wage workers would prove devastating to current members of the bloc , who are already facing stubbornly high unemployment rates .
prime minister tony blair told parliament on wednesday that he was re-evaluating his earlier stance on the issue , and might advocate imposing immigration controls and welfare benefit restrictions on immigrants from the 10 new countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair “ it is important that we recognize that there is a potential risk from these accession countries , ” blair -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliament .
“ we will take whatever measures are necessary to make sure that the ‘ pull factor ’ which might draw people here is closed off . ”
the draw , he said , could be britain ’ s welfare benefit system , and it would be re-examined to determined whether it was “ too generous . ”
change of heart britain ’ s new jumpiness about eastern migration comes in the wake of sweden ’ s decision last week to impose limits on workers from the new eu countries .
the netherlands also said recently it would impose a limit on the number of immigrant workers it would accept .
norway , though not an eu member but with close ties to the bloc , said on thursday it is also exploring possible restrictions , although it has previously stated its borders would be open to new eu citizens .
“ we now see that some of our neighboring countries , and now sweden , state that they will have some exceptions for some years , for an interim period , ” prime minister kjell magne bondevik told reporters on thursday after talks with european commission president romano prodi .
“ so we also now … intend to make a proposal for parliament about some possible exceptions for an interim period so we are more in line with our neighboring countries . ” for two years after enlargement , labor market access with depend on national policies , and not be dictated by brussels .
according to the european commission , only about half the 15 member states have told the eu about their plans .
austria , finland , belgium , france and denmark are planning limits , in some cases for up to seven years .
only ireland and spain have said they will keep their borders open .
germany , with its high unemployment and generous welfare system , insisted in 2002 during entry negotiations for the new candidate countries on a clause that would allow it to impose restrictions to its market for citizens from central and eastern europe until 2011 .
second-class citizens ?
malta , cyprus , estonia , latvia , lithuania , hungary , poland , slovakia , slovenia and the czech republic will become official members of the eu in may of this year . in the past months , tension between current and future members of the eu has increased on a number of issues .
the about-turns on work policy are likely to deepen the fear among many in the accession countries that they will be treated as second-class european citizens .
“ the thinking that we need long transition periods 14 years after the fall of the berlin wall shows a lack of solidarity , ” jan figiel , slovakia ’ s candidate for the european commission , told reuters .
the new members point to one of the fundaments of the eu project — free movement of persons including the right to live and work in another member state .
but as the eu prepares to take in 75 million new people , mostly from countries formerly part of the soviet bloc where wages were lower , fears have been growing of an influx of labor in search of a better standard of living .
the unease has been especially strong in germany , which , since 1990 , has attracted about 75 percent of the migrants to the eu from application countries .
unfounded fears experts , however , note that history teaches that such fears have generally been without foundation .
in previous eu enlargement periods , such as greece in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 , transitional measures such as labor restrictions were put into place , largely unnecessarily .
other alarms about east-west migration have proven false .

germany , with its high unemployment and generous welfare system , insisted in 2002 during entry negotiations for the new candidate countries on a clause that would allow it to impose restrictions to its market for citizens from central and eastern europe until 2011 .
second-class citizens ?
malta , cyprus , estonia , latvia , lithuania , hungary , poland , slovakia , slovenia and the czech republic will become official members of the eu in may of this year . in the past months , tension between current and future members of the eu has increased on a number of issues .
the about-turns on work policy are likely to deepen the fear among many in the accession countries that they will be treated as second-class european citizens .
“ the thinking that we need long transition periods 14 years after the fall of the berlin wall shows a lack of solidarity , ” jan figiel , slovakia ’ s candidate for the european commission , told reuters .
the new members point to one of the fundaments of the eu project — free movement of persons including the right to live and work in another member state .
but as the eu prepares to take in 75 million new people , mostly from countries formerly part of the soviet bloc where wages were lower , fears have been growing of an influx of labor in search of a better standard of living .
the unease has been especially strong in germany , which , since 1990 , has attracted about 75 percent of the migrants to the eu from application countries .
unfounded fears experts , however , note that history teaches that such fears have generally been without foundation .
in previous eu enlargement periods , such as greece in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 , transitional measures such as labor restrictions were put into place , largely unnecessarily .
other alarms about east-west migration have proven false .
one example is a 1989 study by the u.n. high commission for refugees which estimated that 25 million people from the eastern europe would move to the west in the 1990s .
in the end , fewer than one-tenth that number did so . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 2004 expected to be a tough year for eu as the eu expands from 15 to 25 members in may , unity will become more difficult .
already there is substantial dissent from the founding members of the bloc .

30 , 2003 -rrb- eu enlargement : what comes next ?
the yes vote in latvia marks the beginning of the next phase of eu enlargement , culminating in the official entry of 10 new members in may 2004 .
but before that can happen , there are still a few loose ends to tie up .

a few weeks before it was to hit the presses , a german publishing house pulled a book based on the secret porn industry of the third reich .
the reasons remain unclear . any book that attempts to shed light on the little-known nazi porn industry in the early 1940s is not likely to arrive in bookstores without a hitch .
but when the rowohlt publishing house completely cancelled its contract with author thor kunkel shortly before his new novel , " endstufe " -lrb- final step -rrb- , was to hit the presses , a slight sensation rippled through the industry .
little is being said by rowohlt and its head alexander fest about the reasons for the cancellation of the for-march planned release .
a statement by rowohlt mentioned something about not being able to bridge differences on questions on the " aesthetic and subject matter " in central parts of the book .
the manuscript , which landed in the hands of the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , was apparently not only filled with scenes of vivid sex and brutality , but made some questionable ties between the crimes of the allied army and those of the nazi regime .
kunkel is reportedly devastated by the cancellation of a book he spent three years researching and writing .
" i had the impression at a certain point that -lrb- the book -rrb- was being edited on ideological , not aesthetic levels , " he said in an interview with die welt newspaper .
" and i saw that as censorship .
i 'm 40 years old .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kunkel , thor : das schwarzlicht-terrarium .
the frankfurt-born kunkel is considered a rising talent in german literary circles following his prize-winning 2000 debut , " das schwarzlicht-terrarium " , about the frankfurt drug and disco scene in the late 1970s .
porn traded for raw materials he came upon the subject material for " endstufe " after watching a documentary in 1991 that looked into the little-known porn industry that apparently flourished during the third reich .
after asking around , he eventually got in contact with someone who had copies of the so-called sachsenwald films .
the films are reportedly filled with with scenes of sex , power relations and violence .
they were rumored to have been part of a flourishing raw materials trade .
kunkel , based in amsterdam , moved to berlin to research the book , drawing upon witness testimony at the time , including a former actress in one of the films .
he forms his novel around a group of nazi scientists who work at a secret service clinic and produce porn films on the side .
the films are soon a major success and part of a trade network that stretches throughout the wider war zone .
the author infuses the description of the group of scientists with an end of the world attitude .
the characters are apparently self-indulgent and blissfully ignorant of the horrors of the concentration camps or battlefield misery , both of which are dealt with only fleetingly , according to the frankfurter allgemeine .
nazi theme should n't be too hot for germany no one seems to know for sure what combination of themes scared the publisher off : whether it was because it was novel that belittled the horrors of the nazi period , or whether kunkel documented the scientific experimentation at the time with a bit too much fascination .
fest , who recently cancelled a book called " i too , had to kill " by an israeli secret service agent , in a letter referred to the fact that kunkel 's work and subject matter could reap a hefty amount of criticism .
but kunkel seems nonplussed by such arguments .
" germany is a very normal european country , " he said in the welt interview .
" i do n't think we should be raised as humiliated , mentally-disturbed garden gnomes .
endstufe is written in a very modern language .
it 's not a historical novel .

a few weeks before it was to hit the presses , a german publishing house pulled a book based on the secret porn industry of the third reich .
the reasons remain unclear . any book that attempts to shed light on the little-known nazi porn industry in the early 1940s is not likely to arrive in bookstores without a hitch .
but when the rowohlt publishing house completely cancelled its contract with author thor kunkel shortly before his new novel , " endstufe " -lrb- final step -rrb- , was to hit the presses , a slight sensation rippled through the industry .
little is being said by rowohlt and its head alexander fest about the reasons for the cancellation of the for-march planned release .
a statement by rowohlt mentioned something about not being able to bridge differences on questions on the " aesthetic and subject matter " in central parts of the book .
the manuscript , which landed in the hands of the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , was apparently not only filled with scenes of vivid sex and brutality , but made some questionable ties between the crimes of the allied army and those of the nazi regime .
kunkel is reportedly devastated by the cancellation of a book he spent three years researching and writing .
" i had the impression at a certain point that -lrb- the book -rrb- was being edited on ideological , not aesthetic levels , " he said in an interview with die welt newspaper .
" and i saw that as censorship .

nato defense chiefs will meet in munich this weekend to discuss the alliance 's role in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere .
the hope is that the meeting will be more cordial than last year . nato defense and foreign ministers will gather in munich on friday to discuss the lingering fallout from the iraq war and the future direction of the alliance .
it will be the 40th annual meeting for the german security conference . the big names of the defense world , an estimated 250 officials including pentagon chief donald rumsfeld are due to attend , will use the informal get-together to address transatlantic relations , the future of nato , and current developments in the middle east . they will also likely to take the opportunity to discuss extending the alliance 's role in afghanistan while in the bavarian capital , according to diplomats in brussels . iraq situation will again dominate agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the main focus will undoubtedly be the situation in iraq , even more so now inquiries have been launched into intelligence failures in the united states and britain regarding the lack of evidence in the search for weapons of mass destruction a year after the war began . the u.s. delegation is also likely to continue with its pressure to get nato to play a role in iraq as part of washington ’ s current initiative to solicit wider contributions from its member states . last year 's munich conference was a highly tense affair with officials from washington , paris and berlin on edge as a un security council vote on a new iraq resolution loomed ominously near .
rumsfeld and german foreign minister joschka fischer famously clashed at the event and will meet again on friday with hopefully less static in the air between them . security conference host horst teltschik told reporters in munich that some reconciliation is likely .

new nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer said last week that the alliance , which is supporting the polish-led division in iraq , is ready and able to do the job .
" if the question comes , it goes without saying that i 'm very much in favour of a nato role , " he told journalists , before adding : " it 's too early to say exactly what that role will be . " despite making favourable noises in the direction of the united states in the form of low-key discussions , most nato officials remain resolute that no action will be taken before sovereignty is transferred from the u.s.-appointed interim leadership to the iraqis , a move that has been pencilled in for june . isaf 's afghan mission to be addressed the defense ministers will also consider the success of its continuing mission in afghanistan .
when the alliance took over command last august of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- it was nato 's first mission outside europe .
since then , the command of the mission , which has until now been centered on the capital kabul , has been rotated between member countries , with canada currently in control . nato wants to extend isaf 's operations beyond the capital kabul , notably using german troops , but it is having trouble with resources .

the landscape of nato ’ s role in afghanistan is likely to change further after officials announced on wednesday that the five-nation eurocorps army is ready to take the lead in the afghan peacekeeping mission later this year .
the eurocorps was recognized in 2002 as a nato high readiness force and has already carried out peacekeeping duties in kosovo and bosnia . with plans to be released and confirmed in the coming days , the 60,000-strong force - made up of troops from germany , france , spain , belgium and luxembourg - would more than likely be ready to assume control of the kabul-based mission by the summer .

the french-german pharmaceutical company aventis announced growing profits for 2003 in an effort to ward off a hostile takeover bid from a smaller french drug firm . aventis reported that net profits for 2003 had increased by 17.5 percent to € 2.44 billion -lrb- $ 3.07 billion -rrb- .
earnings per share had also risen by 18.6 percent although a weakening dollar had led to a 4.5 percent drop in sales .
aventis chief executive igor landau presented the 2003 profits at a press conference in london to make the case that the company is strong enough to stand on its own and can reject a € 48 billion -lrb- $ 60.4 billion -rrb- hostile takeover bid from the french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthélabo .
" today 's announcement highlights how sanofi 's offer fundamentally undervalues aventis , " said landau .
" their hostile bid is a cheap attempt to transfer their risks to our shareholders , " he added .
landau had previously hinted that there were other drug firms that would make better partners for aventis , suggesting that sanofi was using the hostile bid to avoid becoming a target of a takeover itself – a fact not disputed by sanofi 's executive board .

sanofi is pushing for the creation of a new european drug giant which would have a stronger combined presence on the lucrative u.s. market .
aventis pointed out on thursday that it already has a strong presence there ; 38 percent of its core sales are made in the us .
a merger with sanofi would create the third largest pharmaceutical company in terms of global sales behind the u.s. giant pfizer inc. and the british firm glaxosmithkline plc .

federal economics minister wolfgang clement warned last week that a merger could result in job losses in germany if the company moves its focus to paris .
" the german government has a strong interest in strengthening aventis ' position in germany rather than weakening it , " he said .
a combination of sanofi 's 70,000 strong workforce with aventis ' 69,000 employees could result in as many as 10,000 job cuts in both germany and france .
trade unions have said the number of lost jobs could be closer to 25,000 .

the deal was the pinnacle of three decades of work and landau shed the firm 's chemical and agricultural operation to focus solely on drugs .
hostile takeovers rare in europe the battle being played out in london between aventis and sanofi is unusual for europe , where hostile takeover attempts are extremely rare .

the french-german pharmaceutical company aventis announced growing profits for 2003 in an effort to ward off a hostile takeover bid from a smaller french drug firm . aventis reported that net profits for 2003 had increased by 17.5 percent to € 2.44 billion -lrb- $ 3.07 billion -rrb- .
earnings per share had also risen by 18.6 percent although a weakening dollar had led to a 4.5 percent drop in sales .
aventis chief executive igor landau presented the 2003 profits at a press conference in london to make the case that the company is strong enough to stand on its own and can reject a € 48 billion -lrb- $ 60.4 billion -rrb- hostile takeover bid from the french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthélabo .
" today 's announcement highlights how sanofi 's offer fundamentally undervalues aventis , " said landau .
" their hostile bid is a cheap attempt to transfer their risks to our shareholders , " he added .
landau had previously hinted that there were other drug firms that would make better partners for aventis , suggesting that sanofi was using the hostile bid to avoid becoming a target of a takeover itself – a fact not disputed by sanofi 's executive board .
" they need us , but we do n't need them , ” said landau last week .

while experts do n't expect there to be an increase in hostile bids , they do believe friendly mergers , like the one that created aventis , will continue .
according to some experts , smaller pharmaceuticals in europe soon wo n't be able to keep up with the giants .
professor klaus pohle sits on the board of directors of lion bioscience ag , a german software provider for drug companies .
he said german drug companies have lost their title as " chemists of the world " because of a research policy burdened with too much bureaucracy that serves to stifles innovation .
research and development vital to drug firms surviving the research , development and release of a new drug onto the market takes approximately 12 years .
then it takes another six to nine years before substantial profits are made .
pohle said the larger the pharmaceutical company , the more money and time it can invest in new projects and the less money is lost when a project fails .
experts say even if sanofi 's offer transforms itself into a friendly one , landau , like many chief executives whose company has been targeted by a hostile buyer , is unlikely to gain control of the new company .
if the sanofi bid fails , the smaller french firm is likely to be next in line for a hostile takeover bid .

in its latest report , the public spending watchdog concludes that the progress made is " disappointing " .
its report shows that councils did not reduce the amount of waste they sent to landfill sites last year .
the scottish executive welcomed the " progress " made but opposition parties called on ministers to intervene .
in 2002/03 councils sent 2.8m tonnes of waste to landfill - the same amount as in the previous year .
the proportion of waste recycled or composted by councils was 9.6 % - 2 % more than the previous year .
improvements needed the report reveals wide variations across councils in the amount of waste recycled - from 24.3 % in angus to just 3.5 % in highland .
these statistics , said the commission , are problematic given that councils are expected to reduce the amount going to landfill by 300,000 tonnes over the next two years .
but the convention of scottish local authorities -lrb- cosla -rrb- said its members were working on longer term targets .
accounts commission chairman , alastair macnish , said : " the latest figures are disappointing .
unless councils do more to make recycling easy and convenient they will not reach the target of 25 % of waste being recycled by 2006 . "
the scottish executive must step in now to ensure the targets that they set for local councils are met by the agreed time " roseanna cunningham , snp " we need to see marked improvements in waste recycling and composting levels in the next few years . "
deputy environment minister allan wilson conceded that " landfill figures are too high and recycling too low " .
" that is why we announced a major investment of over £ 230m to tackle this .
" the audit scotland figures predate this major investment which has already begun to make a major impact in local areas . "
mr wilson cited progress in north ayrshire where the recycling and composting rate increased from 5.8 % in 2001/02 to 12.3 % in 2002/03 .
he also mentioned similar levels of success in south ayrshire and north lanarkshire .
but the scottish national party -lrb- snp -rrb- said the accounts commission figures showed clearly that councils needed help .
the party 's environment spokesperson , roseanna cunningham , said : " while it is clear that local councils are making some attempt to increase the amount of waste that is recycled each year , the fear is that they will not meet the set target by the 2006 deadline .
" the scottish executive must step in now to ensure the targets that they set for local councils are met by the agreed time because if they do n't , people may start to question the minister 's ability to improve the environment in scotland . "
cosla 's waste spokesman russell imrie said : " it is unfortunate that the finger is pointed solely at councils who have no statutory duty with respect to recycling .
' no quick fix ' " councils are only part of a larger picture and have traditional expertise , mainly in waste collection systems .
" there is no quick fix .
councils are thinking long term and have ambitious plans for well beyond 2006 , which rely on accessing funding from the scottish executive 's strategic waste fund . "
the scottish greens lodged a motion in the scottish parliament deploring the disappointing figures and calling on the executive to adopt " zero waste " as policy .
shiona baird msp said : " i am appalled that none of the targets set by the executive are being met .
" valuable resources in scotland are being wasted .
the executive should move immediately to adopt a policy of zero waste with timetables , in order to stem the flow of waste being produced .
" zero waste would boost scotland 's self sufficiency , economic security and deliver more green jobs . "

the party 's environment spokesperson , roseanna cunningham , said : " while it is clear that local councils are making some attempt to increase the amount of waste that is recycled each year , the fear is that they will not meet the set target by the 2006 deadline .

councils are thinking long term and have ambitious plans for well beyond 2006 , which rely on accessing funding from the scottish executive 's strategic waste fund . "
the scottish greens lodged a motion in the scottish parliament deploring the disappointing figures and calling on the executive to adopt " zero waste " as policy .

councils are thinking long term and have ambitious plans for well beyond 2006 , which rely on accessing funding from the scottish executive 's strategic waste fund . "

in its latest report , the public spending watchdog concludes that the progress made is " disappointing " .
its report shows that councils did not reduce the amount of waste they sent to landfill sites last year .
the scottish executive welcomed the " progress " made but opposition parties called on ministers to intervene .
in 2002/03 councils sent 2.8m tonnes of waste to landfill - the same amount as in the previous year .
the proportion of waste recycled or composted by councils was 9.6 % - 2 % more than the previous year .
improvements needed the report reveals wide variations across councils in the amount of waste recycled - from 24.3 % in angus to just 3.5 % in highland .
these statistics , said the commission , are problematic given that councils are expected to reduce the amount going to landfill by 300,000 tonnes over the next two years .
but the convention of scottish local authorities -lrb- cosla -rrb- said its members were working on longer term targets .
accounts commission chairman , alastair macnish , said : " the latest figures are disappointing .
unless councils do more to make recycling easy and convenient they will not reach the target of 25 % of waste being recycled by 2006 .
the scottish executive must step in now to ensure the targets that they set for local councils are met by the agreed time roseanna cunningham , snp " we need to see marked improvements in waste recycling and composting levels in the next few years . "
deputy environment minister allan wilson conceded that " landfill figures are too high and recycling too low " .
" that is why we announced a major investment of over £ 230m to tackle this .
" the audit scotland figures predate this major investment which has already begun to make a major impact in local areas . "
mr wilson cited progress in north ayrshire where the recycling and composting rate increased from 5.8 % in 2001/02 to 12.3 % in 2002/03 .

they include advice about security and housekeeping and tips about how to secure church property at night .
' growing problem ' other arson attacks that have taken place within the diocese - which covers staffordshire , north shropshire and parts of the black country - include one that destroyed part of the holy trinity church in dawley , telford , in october .
the church is still being repaired and its congregation has been forced to worship at a local school .
the archdeacon of shropshire , the venerable john hall , said : " i do n't think churches are being specifically targeted ... but the number of attacks is on the increase and that 's what this guidance aims to help prevent . "
martin timmis from shropshire fire and rescue service said : " arson is a growing problem and attacks on churches are now becoming a more frequent event .

he said he took full responsibility for proliferating nuclear weapons to iran , libya and north korea .
the nuclear national command authority , made up of the country 's top military and civilian leaders , met after his confession and requested a pardon for mr khan from the cabinet .
his admission of guilt and plea for mercy is an attempt by the army to put the biggest global scandal on nuclear weapons proliferation behind them as swiftly as possible .
mr khan 's case raises questions about the pakistani military a trial , even held in camera , may implicate political and military leaders , which may destabilise president pervez musharraf 's government .
opposition parties have threatened to mount street protests if mr khan goes on trial .
islamic fundamentalist and secular parties denounced general musharraf for trying to make him a scapegoat whilst absolving the army of any responsibility .
however , qazi hussain ahmed , leader of the islamic fundamentalist jamaat-e-islami , again insisted that mr khan had told him he had never signed a confession during their meeting on tuesday .
" i do n't think people like khan should be tried .
he is a national hero .
he has developed the nuclear programme , " mr ahmed said .
choreography ?
the meeting between general musharraf and mr khan - and the scientist 's appearance on television - appeared to be carefully choreographed by the government .
mr musharraf , dressed in his camouflage military uniform , looked grim throughout the meeting and spoke through pursed lips .
mr khan , dressed in a tan kashmir wool jacket , appeared to be bending towards him in supplication .
pakistani nuclear experts said that in exchange for not embarrassing mr musharraf , the us is now likely to insist that pakistan allow some degree of international safeguards on its nuclear programme wednesday 's events also seem to have been closely co-ordinated with washington , which is deeply anxious not to destabilise mr musharraf , who has sided with the us in the war against terrorism .
" president musharraf has assured us that pakistan was not involved in any kind of proliferation and i am talking about the government of pakistan , " said white house spokesman scott mcclellan .
the international community still needs pakistan 's close co-operation in curbing the resurgent taleban in afghanistan and catching osama bin laden and the remnants of al-qaeda who are hiding out in the pakistan-afghanistan border region .
kashmir pressure the us and britain have also expended much diplomatic capital in persuading india and pakistan to begin peace talks on kashmir .
the first formal meeting between the two countries is due to start on 16 february .
undue international pressure on mr musharraf or domestic agitation could jeopardise that meeting .
khan is credited with giving pakistan a nuclear deterrent however pakistani nuclear experts said that in exchange for not embarrassing mr musharraf , the us is now likely to insist that pakistan allow some degree of international safeguards on its nuclear programme .
the us is also likely to ask for greater controls on pakistan 's stockpile of nuclear weapons and vetting of the 6,000 scientists who work for the nuclear programme .
many of pakistan 's nuclear scientists are committed islamic fundamentalists .
such negotiations are likely to be carried in secret .
however , the fall-out of pakistan 's proliferation is likely to continue , with even greater international scrutiny on the nuclear programmes of north korea and iran , and the arrest of those middlemen in europe , africa and dubai whom khan has named .
they allegedly helped him ship nuclear technology to these countries .

he said he took full responsibility for proliferating nuclear weapons to iran , libya and north korea .
the nuclear national command authority , made up of the country 's top military and civilian leaders , met after his confession and requested a pardon for mr khan from the cabinet .
his admission of guilt and plea for mercy is an attempt by the army to put the biggest global scandal on nuclear weapons proliferation behind them as swiftly as possible .
mr khan 's case raises questions about the pakistani military a trial , even held in camera , may implicate political and military leaders , which may destabilise president pervez musharraf 's government .
opposition parties have threatened to mount street protests if mr khan goes on trial .
islamic fundamentalist and secular parties denounced general musharraf for trying to make him a scapegoat whilst absolving the army of any responsibility .
however , qazi hussain ahmed , leader of the islamic fundamentalist jamaat-e-islami , again insisted that mr khan had told him he had never signed a confession during their meeting on tuesday .
" i do n't think people like khan should be tried .
he is a national hero .
he has developed the nuclear programme , " mr ahmed said .
choreography ?
the meeting between general musharraf and mr khan - and the scientist 's appearance on television - appeared to be carefully choreographed by the government .
mr musharraf , dressed in his camouflage military uniform , looked grim throughout the meeting and spoke through pursed lips .
mr khan , dressed in a tan kashmir wool jacket , appeared to be bending towards him in supplication .
pakistani nuclear experts said that in exchange for not embarrassing mr musharraf , the us is now likely to insist that pakistan allow some degree of international safeguards on its nuclear programme wednesday 's events also seem to have been closely co-ordinated with washington , which is deeply anxious not to destabilise mr musharraf , who has sided with the us in the war against terrorism .
" president musharraf has assured us that pakistan was not involved in any kind of proliferation and i am talking about the government of pakistan , " said white house spokesman scott mcclellan .
the international community still needs pakistan 's close co-operation in curbing the resurgent taleban in afghanistan and catching osama bin laden and the remnants of al-qaeda who are hiding out in the pakistan-afghanistan border region .
kashmir pressure the us and britain have also expended much diplomatic capital in persuading india and pakistan to begin peace talks on kashmir .
the first formal meeting between the two countries is due to start on 16 february .
undue international pressure on mr musharraf or domestic agitation could jeopardise that meeting .
khan is credited with giving pakistan a nuclear deterrent however pakistani nuclear experts said that in exchange for not embarrassing mr musharraf , the us is now likely to insist that pakistan allow some degree of international safeguards on its nuclear programme .
the us is also likely to ask for greater controls on pakistan 's stockpile of nuclear weapons and vetting of the 6,000 scientists who work for the nuclear programme .
many of pakistan 's nuclear scientists are committed islamic fundamentalists .
such negotiations are likely to be carried in secret .
however , the fall-out of pakistan 's proliferation is likely to continue , with even greater international scrutiny on the nuclear programmes of north korea and iran , and the arrest of those middlemen in europe , africa and dubai whom khan has named .
they allegedly helped him ship nuclear technology to these countries .
