germans are often seen as hard-working , efficient people .
but are they happy at work ?
not according to an international study by the gallup organization , which says most germans feel disengaged from their jobs . those wondering why the german economy is in the doldrums could find part of the reason in the results of the gallup study . the american-based organization said this week that only 12 percent of germans have a strong emotional attachment to their jobs and their workplace ; 70 percent say they 're just going through the motions , and 18 percent have , psychologically at least , already quit . the results are part of a 30-year international study on emotional attachment to work as a measure of job satisfaction and productivity . the german branch of the gallup market research and consulting group interviewed around 2,000 working germans in the summer of last year .
the organization also carried out studies worldwide . americans lead the way in job satisfaction , with 30 percent of u.s. respondents saying they feel a strong attachment to their jobs . other leading nations were canada -lrb- 24 percent -rrb- , israel -lrb- 20 -rrb- , australia -lrb- 18 -rrb- , and great britain -lrb- 17 -rrb- . nations with fewer people expressing job satisfaction than germany include japan , where only 9 percent said they liked their job , france -lrb- 6 -rrb- and singapore -lrb- 4 -rrb- . the majority of people who are unhappy in their jobs do n't do anything to change their situation . according to gerald wood , executive director of gallup germany , most stay with their companies - something that has detrimental consequences for their employers . “ the level of emotional attachment to the jobs has a direct correlation to productivity , customer satisfaction , lost workdays , lower turnover - key economic factors directly linked to the state of mind , " he told deutsche welle .
" so basically by having a workforce that is less productive , you end up with lesser profitability . ” personal relationships matter wood estimates the value of lost productivity caused by job dissatisfaction in germany at around € 240 billion per year .
it 's often not the actual work that puts employees off , rather the personal interaction with their colleagues , and especially , their supervisors . “ what we have found is that the relationship with the direct managers is very important , " wood said .
" that is where emotional attachment either happens or doesn ’ t happen .
so you could be very happy to work for bmw for example as a company , but if you are very unsatisfied with your direct workplace then you are more likely to quit that job . ” so what , if anything , can german companies do to make their workforce happier ? while it 's difficult to change the chemistry between staff members , wood encourages german managers to become more liberal with praise for their staff , and start listening more to employees ' opinions - things that have little to do with how well colleagues like each other , but which can greatly improve the office atmosphere . less hierarchy additionally , german companies can take a cue from countries with higher percentages of satisfied workers , and do away with unnecessary corporate hierarchy . “ if you look at countries where hierarchies play a large role , for example in germany , france , singapore and japan , you see engagement dropping .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.01.2004 german press review : big business in the dock german newspapers wednesday commented on the mannesmann court case and the future of florian gerster , the head of the country ’ s federal labor office , who has lately come under fire for costly pr and consulting contracts . the beginning of a court case against six german managers over their role in the takeover of mannesmann by the telecommunications giant vodafone has lead many german editorialists to reflect on the relationship between business ethics versus business law . impertinent !
that ’ s the only thing that can be said about the greediness of the mannesmann clique , wrote the berliner kurier .
they have earned it , argue the ‘ experts ’ from the upper floors .
after all , the shareholders have gained mightily from the takeover .
but the process which is now under way , said the paper , underscores the fact that german share law is one thing – and ethics and propriety is something very different . the court won ’ t be able answer the most important question , argued der tagesspiegel .
and this question is how to lead a good enterprise .
neither will the court be able to define the thin line between a healthy bonus for good managers and pure greed , nor the line between moral behavior and irresponsible action . extreme cases in recent years have shown that economic power needs to be checked , wrote the nürnberger nachrichten .
but the paper thinks that courts are the wrong institutions for this .
judges only take criminal liability into account , not ethical points of view .
but the court case can do one thing , argued the paper : to stir up a debate as to what kind of rules german society wants to put in place on the economy and where the borders should run with regard to entrepreneurial liberty . other german dailies have taken a closer look at the political future of florian gerster , head of the germany ’ s federal labor office . as interested as some political circles might be in showing him up in order to denounce his reform ideas , florian gerster ’ s worst enemy , is gerster himself , wrote the frankfurter rundschau .
if it turns out to be true what has been filtering out of nuremberg in the past few days , gerster might become a real risk for the reform of his institution , predicted the paper .
one might overlook one wrong decision when it comes to placing orders to pr or consultant firms .
but three , four or even more cases – that will cost more in terms of reputation than a dozen pr campaigns could have built up . the süddeutsche zeitung observed that bit by bit , the german government is withdrawing support for gerster .
the individual cases might not be all that grave .
but all of them taken together , argued the munich-based daily , make it difficult to keep him . what was wanted was a messiah for germany ’ s social system , wrote the conservative paper die welt .
but so much is clear : gerster is neither a saint nor a super-human being .
now , there ’ s a somewhat burnt smell emanating from gerster ’ s files , and the first clouds of smoke have reached his boss , german economy minister wolfgang clement .
before his ministry is goes up in flames , predicted the paper , gerster has to take his leave .
until then , however , he has continue to pretend that he has super-human powers after all . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory bremen leads bundesliga at winter break culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.01.2004 bundesliga hopes to be big in japan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn prepares to catch a hopeful shot on goal as two young japanese fans look on .
germany ’ s top soccer league , the bundesliga , is looking to attract fans and revenue from the lucrative far east market .
league chiefs have dispatched bayern munich goalkeeper oliver kahn to japan to lay the groundwork . in a business where the go-getters are constantly looking to expand their reach and raise their profile , the bundesliga has apparently been caught sleeping on the job . the german soccer league , for so long resigned to its role as the less fashionable cousin to other leagues on its own continent , has been shaken from its slumber by bad dreams of dwindling funds and recurring nightmares of shrinking television revenue . now it seems that the german league has woken up to the fact that the giants of spanish , italian and english soccer have a head start when it comes to making extra cash and promoting themselves as a brand in the rapidly-growing soccer markets in asia . while clubs such as manchester united and real madrid already have their own branded stores in major asian cities , selling their replica kits all over the continent - united alone sells its nike shirts in over 58 asian countries - even bundesliga giants bayern munich have failed to capture the imagination . ambassador of the bundesliga in an attempt to make up lost ground , tie up some lucrative deals and open avenues to possible cash flow opportunities in these burgeoning fanatical soccer markets , the bundesliga has dispatched bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn to japan to promote the league and german football . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beaten finalist but winner of japanese respect .
the german national captain is by far the most popular of his compatriots in soccer-hungry japan after his outstanding performances there during the world cup in 2002 .
while his thunder was stolen in the end by star striker ronaldo , who plies his trade in spain , kahn ’ s display ’ s as the ultimate line of defense for the runner-up german national team endeared him to the japanese . close relations of the past the association between the two countries on a soccer level is a close one which goes back many years .
german coaches and players have long been recognized as the teachers of the modern game in japan , while many japanese players past and present have honed their skills in the bundesliga .
but these days , while respect endures , the influx of german names to japan has dried up and most japanese fans do not rate modern german football as much of a spectator sport . yuichi akatsu , soccer expert for state broadcaster nhk admits that many see german football as monotonous , dull and " without special character which inspires the audience , " according to comments he made in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on wednesday . german soccer lacks the spark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his comments were supported in the same article by those of nobuyuki hirano , soccer marketing expert at dentsu , japan ’ s biggest japanese advertising agency .
" the image of german football is strong and stable , but definitely not thrilling .
compared to italian and spanish football , the german football is not attractive , although technically it is very good . " in a bid to convince the skeptical japanese and the rest of their far east target group , bundesliga chiefs are considering shifting scheduled weekend games from their traditional late and mid-afternoon kick off times to 12 noon to allow viewers in asia to watch live matches .
the hope is that demand will supplement funds back in germany while the future of homegrown television revenue remains up in the air . to whet the appetite : enter " ollie " .
while it is recognized that a change of match scheduling in favor of peak asian viewing times will not make german soccer popular overnight , the bundesliga chiefs feel that it is time that germany ’ s stars start to make their presence felt , hence the national goalkeeper ’ s brief tour of exhibition displays . a pretender to the throne of king david bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham enjoys adoration across the far east .
however , kahn is no david beckham by any stretch of the imagination .
the englishman ’ s one-man summer tour of the far east preceded his transfer to real madrid and helped launch the spanish club ’ s assault on the asian market place .
when he returned with his new team mates for their own pre-season sojourn , real racked up around € 17.4 million -lrb- $ 22 million -rrb- on their travels , including shirt and merchandising sales inspired by the england captain . and therein lies a potential problem for the bundesliga ’ s plans at getting a slice of the far east market and popularizing german soccer .
the european clubs and leagues that have made an impact in the region have done so through the marketable quality of the few big-name stars which just happen to play for some of the most fashionable teams in the world , in some of the most exciting leagues on the planet . the trend seems to show that the clubs and competitions that are doing well in the asian sector are doing so because of the popularity of individuals associated with them .
the far east fans seem to adore the celebrity soccer stars .
unfortunately , right now , the bundesliga is devoid of such globally recognizable players and lacks the pulling power to attract them . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dortmund may need to sell star players are the vultures already circling troubled german soccer club borussia dortmund ?

all eyes are focused on deutsche bank ceo , josef ackermann .
deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann faces " breach of trust " charges in a düsseldorf court .
he and five others are accused of authorizing unwarranted payments when mobile phone company mannesmann was bought out by vodafone . it 's likely to rank as one of the most closely-watched trials in german corporate history .
starting wednesday , the head of deutsche bank , the former head of germany 's biggest trade union , and the former supervisory board of mobile phone company mannesmann will be spending two days a week in a düsseldorf court facing charges they unlawfully approved payments to top company executives . the six men have been accused of violating shareholders trust .
prosecutors say they took advantage of british telecommunications company vodafone 's takeover of its german rival mannesmann in 2000 to approve around € 57 million -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to the german firm 's managers . making waves compared to the united states , where such payments are commonplace , the mannesmann case has made waves in germany , where pay differerentials between board members and average employees remain comparatively low .
it 's also the first time german business leaders have faced prosecution for supervisory board activities . " this is the only country where people who are creating value go to court for doing so , " ackermann told reporters on wednesday , according to the reuters news agency . as the head of deutsche bank , swiss-born josef ackermann is arguably germany 's most powerful banker , and he 's still on the job , despite the charges against him .
deutsche bank has stood behind ackermann throughout the saga .
if convicted , it 's unlikely that he or his co-defendants would serve jail time .
but a guilty verdict would probably cost ackermann his job .
indecently high ?
klaus esser , mannesmann 's former chief executive and the main beneficiary of the bonuses , has repeatedly stressed that there was nothing indecent about the nearly € 30 million in bonuses and severance pay he received .
" i believe that the level of the payments should be gauged according to the manager 's success , " he has said and points to the fact that during his time as ceo mannesmann shares more than doubled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zwickel , former head of ig metall trade union but klaus zwickel , former head of ig metall , germany 's most powerful labor union -lrb- as with all large corporations , unions represent the workers ' interests on the supervisory board -rrb- , has subsequently berated himself publicly , saying he should have voted against the payments that were " indecently high and incomprehensible for any worker . " at the time , though , he effectively authorized the payments by abstaining from voting . prosecutors spent three years investigating the case and filed breach of trust charges against ackermann , zwickel , former supervisory board chairman joachim funk and worker 's council representative jürgen ladberg .
esser and personnel director dieter droste are accused of aiding and abetting the four members of the supervisory board . initially , prosecutors in düsseldorf considered charging the co-defendants with paying bribes to the managers to encourage them to drop objections to the € 190 billion vodafone takeover but decided on the " breach of trust " accusations instead .

deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann faces " breach of trust " charges in a düsseldorf court .
he and five others are accused of authorizing unwarranted payments when mobile phone company mannesmann was bought out by vodafone . it 's likely to rank as one of the most closely-watched trials in german corporate history .
starting wednesday , the head of deutsche bank , the former head of germany 's biggest trade union , and the former supervisory board of mobile phone company mannesmann will be spending two days a week in a düsseldorf court facing charges they unlawfully approved payments to top company executives . the six men have been accused of violating shareholders trust .
prosecutors say they took advantage of british telecommunications company vodafone 's takeover of its german rival mannesmann in 2000 to approve around € 57 million -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to the german firm 's managers . making waves compared to the united states , where such payments are commonplace , the mannesmann case has made waves in germany , where pay differerentials between board members and average employees remain comparatively low .
it 's also the first time german business leaders have faced prosecution for supervisory board activities . " this is the only country where people who are creating value go to court for doing so , " ackermann told reporters on wednesday , according to the reuters news agency . as the head of deutsche bank , swiss-born josef ackermann is arguably germany 's most powerful banker , and he 's still on the job , despite the charges against him .
deutsche bank has stood behind ackermann throughout the saga .
if convicted , it 's unlikely that he or his co-defendants would serve jail time .
but a guilty verdict would probably cost ackermann his job .
indecently high ?
klaus esser , mannesmann 's former chief executive and the main beneficiary of the bonuses , has repeatedly stressed that there was nothing indecent about the nearly € 30 million in bonuses and severance pay he received .
" i believe that the level of the payments should be gauged according to the manager 's success , " he has said and points to the fact that during his time as ceo mannesmann shares more than doubled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zwickel , former head of ig metall trade union but klaus zwickel , former head of ig metall , germany 's most powerful labor union -lrb- as with all large corporations , unions represent the workers ' interests on the supervisory board -rrb- , has subsequently berated himself publicly , saying he should have voted against the payments that were " indecently high and incomprehensible for any worker . " at the time , though , he effectively authorized the payments by abstaining from voting . prosecutors spent three years investigating the case and filed breach of trust charges against ackermann , zwickel , former supervisory board chairman joachim funk and worker 's council representative jürgen ladberg .
esser and personnel director dieter droste are accused of aiding and abetting the four members of the supervisory board . initially , prosecutors in düsseldorf considered charging the co-defendants with paying bribes to the managers to encourage them to drop objections to the € 190 billion vodafone takeover but decided on the " breach of trust " accusations instead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.01.2004 german press review : big business in the dock german newspapers wednesday commented on the mannesmann court case and the future of florian gerster , the head of the country ’ s federal labor office , who has lately come under fire for costly pr and consulting contracts . the beginning of a court case against six german managers over their role in the takeover of mannesmann by the telecommunications giant vodafone has lead many german editorialists to reflect on the relationship between business ethics versus business law . impertinent !
that ’ s the only thing that can be said about the greediness of the mannesmann clique , wrote the berliner kurier .
they have earned it , argue the ‘ experts ’ from the upper floors .
after all , the shareholders have gained mightily from the takeover .
but the process which is now under way , said the paper , underscores the fact that german share law is one thing – and ethics and propriety is something very different . the court won ’ t be able answer the most important question , argued der tagesspiegel .
and this question is how to lead a good enterprise .
neither will the court be able to define the thin line between a healthy bonus for good managers and pure greed , nor the line between moral behavior and irresponsible action . extreme cases in recent years have shown that economic power needs to be checked , wrote the nürnberger nachrichten .
but the paper thinks that courts are the wrong institutions for this .
judges only take criminal liability into account , not ethical points of view .
but the court case can do one thing , argued the paper : to stir up a debate as to what kind of rules german society wants to put in place on the economy and where the borders should run with regard to entrepreneurial liberty . other german dailies have taken a closer look at the political future of florian gerster , head of the germany ’ s federal labor office . as interested as some political circles might be in showing him up in order to denounce his reform ideas , florian gerster ’ s worst enemy , is gerster himself , wrote the frankfurter rundschau .
if it turns out to be true what has been filtering out of nuremberg in the past few days , gerster might become a real risk for the reform of his institution , predicted the paper .
one might overlook one wrong decision when it comes to placing orders to pr or consultant firms .
but three , four or even more cases – that will cost more in terms of reputation than a dozen pr campaigns could have built up . the süddeutsche zeitung observed that bit by bit , the german government is withdrawing support for gerster .
the individual cases might not be all that grave .
but all of them taken together , argued the munich-based daily , make it difficult to keep him . what was wanted was a messiah for germany ’ s social system , wrote the conservative paper die welt .
but so much is clear : gerster is neither a saint nor a super-human being .
now , there ’ s a somewhat burnt smell emanating from gerster ’ s files , and the first clouds of smoke have reached his boss , german economy minister wolfgang clement .
before his ministry is goes up in flames , predicted the paper , gerster has to take his leave .

all eyes are focused on deutsche bank ceo , josef ackermann .
deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann faces " breach of trust " charges in a düsseldorf court .
he and five others are accused of authorizing unwarranted payments when mobile phone company mannesmann was bought out by vodafone . it 's likely to rank as one of the most closely-watched trials in german corporate history .
starting wednesday , the head of deutsche bank , the former head of germany 's biggest trade union , and the former supervisory board of mobile phone company mannesmann will be spending two days a week in a düsseldorf court facing charges they unlawfully approved payments to top company executives . the six men have been accused of violating shareholders trust .
prosecutors say they took advantage of british telecommunications company vodafone 's takeover of its german rival mannesmann in 2000 to approve around € 57 million -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to the german firm 's managers . making waves compared to the united states , where such payments are commonplace , the mannesmann case has made waves in germany , where pay differerentials between board members and average employees remain comparatively low .
it 's also the first time german business leaders have faced prosecution for supervisory board activities . " this is the only country where people who are creating value go to court for doing so , " ackermann told reporters on wednesday , according to the reuters news agency . as the head of deutsche bank , swiss-born josef ackermann is arguably germany 's most powerful banker , and he 's still on the job , despite the charges against him .
deutsche bank has stood behind ackermann throughout the saga .
if convicted , it 's unlikely that he or his co-defendants would serve jail time .
but a guilty verdict would probably cost ackermann his job .
indecently high ?
klaus esser , mannesmann 's former chief executive and the main beneficiary of the bonuses , has repeatedly stressed that there was nothing indecent about the nearly € 30 million in bonuses and severance pay he received .
" i believe that the level of the payments should be gauged according to the manager 's success , " he has said and points to the fact that during his time as ceo mannesmann shares more than doubled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zwickel , former head of ig metall trade union but klaus zwickel , former head of ig metall , germany 's most powerful labor union -lrb- as with all large corporations , unions represent the workers ' interests on the supervisory board -rrb- , has subsequently berated himself publicly , saying he should have voted against the payments that were " indecently high and incomprehensible for any worker . " at the time , though , he effectively authorized the payments by abstaining from voting . prosecutors spent three years investigating the case and filed breach of trust charges against ackermann , zwickel , former supervisory board chairman joachim funk and worker 's council representative jürgen ladberg .
esser and personnel director dieter droste are accused of aiding and abetting the four members of the supervisory board . initially , prosecutors in düsseldorf considered charging the co-defendants with paying bribes to the managers to encourage them to drop objections to the € 190 billion vodafone takeover but decided on the " breach of trust " accusations instead .

but three , four or even more cases – that will cost more in terms of reputation than a dozen pr campaigns could have built up . the süddeutsche zeitung observed that bit by bit , the german government is withdrawing support for gerster .
the individual cases might not be all that grave .
but all of them taken together , argued the munich-based daily , make it difficult to keep him . what was wanted was a messiah for germany ’ s social system , wrote the conservative paper die welt .
but so much is clear : gerster is neither a saint nor a super-human being .
now , there ’ s a somewhat burnt smell emanating from gerster ’ s files , and the first clouds of smoke have reached his boss , german economy minister wolfgang clement .
before his ministry is goes up in flames , predicted the paper , gerster has to take his leave .
until then , however , he has continue to pretend that he has super-human powers after all . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germans are often seen as hard-working , efficient people .
but are they happy at work ?
not according to an international study by the gallup organization , which says most germans feel disengaged from their jobs . those wondering why the german economy is in the doldrums could find part of the reason in the results of the gallup study . the american-based organization said this week that only 12 percent of germans have a strong emotional attachment to their jobs and their workplace ; 70 percent say they 're just going through the motions , and 18 percent have , psychologically at least , already quit . the results are part of a 30-year international study on emotional attachment to work as a measure of job satisfaction and productivity . the german branch of the gallup market research and consulting group interviewed around 2,000 working germans in the summer of last year .
the organization also carried out studies worldwide . americans lead the way in job satisfaction , with 30 percent of u.s. respondents saying they feel a strong attachment to their jobs . other leading nations were canada -lrb- 24 percent -rrb- , israel -lrb- 20 -rrb- , australia -lrb- 18 -rrb- , and great britain -lrb- 17 -rrb- . nations with fewer people expressing job satisfaction than germany include japan , where only 9 percent said they liked their job , france -lrb- 6 -rrb- and singapore -lrb- 4 -rrb- . the majority of people who are unhappy in their jobs do n't do anything to change their situation . according to gerald wood , executive director of gallup germany , most stay with their companies - something that has detrimental consequences for their employers . “ the level of emotional attachment to the jobs has a direct correlation to productivity , customer satisfaction , lost workdays , lower turnover - key economic factors directly linked to the state of mind , " he told deutsche welle .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory bremen leads bundesliga at winter break culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.01.2004 bundesliga hopes to be big in japan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn prepares to catch a hopeful shot on goal as two young japanese fans look on .
germany ’ s top soccer league , the bundesliga , is looking to attract fans and revenue from the lucrative far east market .
league chiefs have dispatched bayern munich goalkeeper oliver kahn to japan to lay the groundwork . in a business where the go-getters are constantly looking to expand their reach and raise their profile , the bundesliga has apparently been caught sleeping on the job . the german soccer league , for so long resigned to its role as the less fashionable cousin to other leagues on its own continent , has been shaken from its slumber by bad dreams of dwindling funds and recurring nightmares of shrinking television revenue . now it seems that the german league has woken up to the fact that the giants of spanish , italian and english soccer have a head start when it comes to making extra cash and promoting themselves as a brand in the rapidly-growing soccer markets in asia . while clubs such as manchester united and real madrid already have their own branded stores in major asian cities , selling their replica kits all over the continent - united alone sells its nike shirts in over 58 asian countries - even bundesliga giants bayern munich have failed to capture the imagination . ambassador of the bundesliga in an attempt to make up lost ground , tie up some lucrative deals and open avenues to possible cash flow opportunities in these burgeoning fanatical soccer markets , the bundesliga has dispatched bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn to japan to promote the league and german football . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beaten finalist but winner of japanese respect .
the german national captain is by far the most popular of his compatriots in soccer-hungry japan after his outstanding performances there during the world cup in 2002 .
while his thunder was stolen in the end by star striker ronaldo , who plies his trade in spain , kahn ’ s display ’ s as the ultimate line of defense for the runner-up german national team endeared him to the japanese . close relations of the past the association between the two countries on a soccer level is a close one which goes back many years .
german coaches and players have long been recognized as the teachers of the modern game in japan , while many japanese players past and present have honed their skills in the bundesliga .
but these days , while respect endures , the influx of german names to japan has dried up and most japanese fans do not rate modern german football as much of a spectator sport . yuichi akatsu , soccer expert for state broadcaster nhk admits that many see german football as monotonous , dull and " without special character which inspires the audience , " according to comments he made in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on wednesday . german soccer lacks the spark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his comments were supported in the same article by those of nobuyuki hirano , soccer marketing expert at dentsu , japan ’ s biggest japanese advertising agency .
" the image of german football is strong and stable , but definitely not thrilling .
compared to italian and spanish football , the german football is not attractive , although technically it is very good . " in a bid to convince the skeptical japanese and the rest of their far east target group , bundesliga chiefs are considering shifting scheduled weekend games from their traditional late and mid-afternoon kick off times to 12 noon to allow viewers in asia to watch live matches .
the hope is that demand will supplement funds back in germany while the future of homegrown television revenue remains up in the air . to whet the appetite : enter " ollie " .

league chiefs have dispatched bayern munich goalkeeper oliver kahn to japan to lay the groundwork . in a business where the go-getters are constantly looking to expand their reach and raise their profile , the bundesliga has apparently been caught sleeping on the job . the german soccer league , for so long resigned to its role as the less fashionable cousin to other leagues on its own continent , has been shaken from its slumber by bad dreams of dwindling funds and recurring nightmares of shrinking television revenue . now it seems that the german league has woken up to the fact that the giants of spanish , italian and english soccer have a head start when it comes to making extra cash and promoting themselves as a brand in the rapidly-growing soccer markets in asia . while clubs such as manchester united and real madrid already have their own branded stores in major asian cities , selling their replica kits all over the continent - united alone sells its nike shirts in over 58 asian countries - even bundesliga giants bayern munich have failed to capture the imagination . ambassador of the bundesliga in an attempt to make up lost ground , tie up some lucrative deals and open avenues to possible cash flow opportunities in these burgeoning fanatical soccer markets , the bundesliga has dispatched bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn to japan to promote the league and german football . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beaten finalist but winner of japanese respect .
the german national captain is by far the most popular of his compatriots in soccer-hungry japan after his outstanding performances there during the world cup in 2002 .
while his thunder was stolen in the end by star striker ronaldo , who plies his trade in spain , kahn ’ s display ’ s as the ultimate line of defense for the runner-up german national team endeared him to the japanese . close relations of the past the association between the two countries on a soccer level is a close one which goes back many years .
german coaches and players have long been recognized as the teachers of the modern game in japan , while many japanese players past and present have honed their skills in the bundesliga .
but these days , while respect endures , the influx of german names to japan has dried up and most japanese fans do not rate modern german football as much of a spectator sport . yuichi akatsu , soccer expert for state broadcaster nhk admits that many see german football as monotonous , dull and " without special character which inspires the audience , " according to comments he made in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on wednesday . german soccer lacks the spark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his comments were supported in the same article by those of nobuyuki hirano , soccer marketing expert at dentsu , japan ’ s biggest japanese advertising agency .
" the image of german football is strong and stable , but definitely not thrilling .
compared to italian and spanish football , the german football is not attractive , although technically it is very good . " in a bid to convince the skeptical japanese and the rest of their far east target group , bundesliga chiefs are considering shifting scheduled weekend games from their traditional late and mid-afternoon kick off times to 12 noon to allow viewers in asia to watch live matches .
the hope is that demand will supplement funds back in germany while the future of homegrown television revenue remains up in the air . to whet the appetite : enter " ollie " .
while it is recognized that a change of match scheduling in favor of peak asian viewing times will not make german soccer popular overnight , the bundesliga chiefs feel that it is time that germany ’ s stars start to make their presence felt , hence the national goalkeeper ’ s brief tour of exhibition displays . a pretender to the throne of king david bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham enjoys adoration across the far east .
however , kahn is no david beckham by any stretch of the imagination .
the englishman ’ s one-man summer tour of the far east preceded his transfer to real madrid and helped launch the spanish club ’ s assault on the asian market place .
when he returned with his new team mates for their own pre-season sojourn , real racked up around € 17.4 million -lrb- $ 22 million -rrb- on their travels , including shirt and merchandising sales inspired by the england captain . and therein lies a potential problem for the bundesliga ’ s plans at getting a slice of the far east market and popularizing german soccer .
the european clubs and leagues that have made an impact in the region have done so through the marketable quality of the few big-name stars which just happen to play for some of the most fashionable teams in the world , in some of the most exciting leagues on the planet . the trend seems to show that the clubs and competitions that are doing well in the asian sector are doing so because of the popularity of individuals associated with them .
the far east fans seem to adore the celebrity soccer stars .
unfortunately , right now , the bundesliga is devoid of such globally recognizable players and lacks the pulling power to attract them . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dortmund may need to sell star players are the vultures already circling troubled german soccer club borussia dortmund ?

after all , the shareholders have gained mightily from the takeover .
but the process which is now under way , said the paper , underscores the fact that german share law is one thing – and ethics and propriety is something very different . the court won ’ t be able answer the most important question , argued der tagesspiegel .

the organization also carried out studies worldwide . americans lead the way in job satisfaction , with 30 percent of u.s. respondents saying they feel a strong attachment to their jobs . other leading nations were canada -lrb- 24 percent -rrb- , israel -lrb- 20 -rrb- , australia -lrb- 18 -rrb- , and great britain -lrb- 17 -rrb- . nations with fewer people expressing job satisfaction than germany include japan , where only 9 percent said they liked their job , france -lrb- 6 -rrb- and singapore -lrb- 4 -rrb- . the majority of people who are unhappy in their jobs do n't do anything to change their situation . according to gerald wood , executive director of gallup germany , most stay with their companies - something that has detrimental consequences for their employers . “ the level of emotional attachment to the jobs has a direct correlation to productivity , customer satisfaction , lost workdays , lower turnover - key economic factors directly linked to the state of mind , " he told deutsche welle .
" so basically by having a workforce that is less productive , you end up with lesser profitability . ” personal relationships matter wood estimates the value of lost productivity caused by job dissatisfaction in germany at around € 240 billion per year .
it 's often not the actual work that puts employees off , rather the personal interaction with their colleagues , and especially , their supervisors . “ what we have found is that the relationship with the direct managers is very important , " wood said .
" that is where emotional attachment either happens or doesn ’ t happen .
so you could be very happy to work for bmw for example as a company , but if you are very unsatisfied with your direct workplace then you are more likely to quit that job . ” so what , if anything , can german companies do to make their workforce happier ? while it 's difficult to change the chemistry between staff members , wood encourages german managers to become more liberal with praise for their staff , and start listening more to employees ' opinions - things that have little to do with how well colleagues like each other , but which can greatly improve the office atmosphere . less hierarchy additionally , german companies can take a cue from countries with higher percentages of satisfied workers , and do away with unnecessary corporate hierarchy . “ if you look at countries where hierarchies play a large role , for example in germany , france , singapore and japan , you see engagement dropping .

that ’ s the only thing that can be said about the greediness of the mannesmann clique , wrote the berliner kurier .
they have earned it , argue the ‘ experts ’ from the upper floors .
after all , the shareholders have gained mightily from the takeover .
but the process which is now under way , said the paper , underscores the fact that german share law is one thing – and ethics and propriety is something very different . the court won ’ t be able answer the most important question , argued der tagesspiegel .
and this question is how to lead a good enterprise .
neither will the court be able to define the thin line between a healthy bonus for good managers and pure greed , nor the line between moral behavior and irresponsible action . extreme cases in recent years have shown that economic power needs to be checked , wrote the nürnberger nachrichten .
but the paper thinks that courts are the wrong institutions for this .
judges only take criminal liability into account , not ethical points of view .
but the court case can do one thing , argued the paper : to stir up a debate as to what kind of rules german society wants to put in place on the economy and where the borders should run with regard to entrepreneurial liberty . other german dailies have taken a closer look at the political future of florian gerster , head of the germany ’ s federal labor office . as interested as some political circles might be in showing him up in order to denounce his reform ideas , florian gerster ’ s worst enemy , is gerster himself , wrote the frankfurter rundschau .
if it turns out to be true what has been filtering out of nuremberg in the past few days , gerster might become a real risk for the reform of his institution , predicted the paper .
one might overlook one wrong decision when it comes to placing orders to pr or consultant firms .
but three , four or even more cases – that will cost more in terms of reputation than a dozen pr campaigns could have built up . the süddeutsche zeitung observed that bit by bit , the german government is withdrawing support for gerster .
the individual cases might not be all that grave .
but all of them taken together , argued the munich-based daily , make it difficult to keep him . what was wanted was a messiah for germany ’ s social system , wrote the conservative paper die welt .
but so much is clear : gerster is neither a saint nor a super-human being .
now , there ’ s a somewhat burnt smell emanating from gerster ’ s files , and the first clouds of smoke have reached his boss , german economy minister wolfgang clement .
before his ministry is goes up in flames , predicted the paper , gerster has to take his leave .

that ’ s the only thing that can be said about the greediness of the mannesmann clique , wrote the berliner kurier .
they have earned it , argue the ‘ experts ’ from the upper floors .
after all , the shareholders have gained mightily from the takeover .
but the process which is now under way , said the paper , underscores the fact that german share law is one thing – and ethics and propriety is something very different . the court won ’ t be able answer the most important question , argued der tagesspiegel .
and this question is how to lead a good enterprise .
neither will the court be able to define the thin line between a healthy bonus for good managers and pure greed , nor the line between moral behavior and irresponsible action . extreme cases in recent years have shown that economic power needs to be checked , wrote the nürnberger nachrichten .
but the paper thinks that courts are the wrong institutions for this .
judges only take criminal liability into account , not ethical points of view .
but the court case can do one thing , argued the paper : to stir up a debate as to what kind of rules german society wants to put in place on the economy and where the borders should run with regard to entrepreneurial liberty . other german dailies have taken a closer look at the political future of florian gerster , head of the germany ’ s federal labor office . as interested as some political circles might be in showing him up in order to denounce his reform ideas , florian gerster ’ s worst enemy , is gerster himself , wrote the frankfurter rundschau .
if it turns out to be true what has been filtering out of nuremberg in the past few days , gerster might become a real risk for the reform of his institution , predicted the paper .
one might overlook one wrong decision when it comes to placing orders to pr or consultant firms .
but three , four or even more cases – that will cost more in terms of reputation than a dozen pr campaigns could have built up . the süddeutsche zeitung observed that bit by bit , the german government is withdrawing support for gerster .
the individual cases might not be all that grave .
but all of them taken together , argued the munich-based daily , make it difficult to keep him . what was wanted was a messiah for germany ’ s social system , wrote the conservative paper die welt .
but so much is clear : gerster is neither a saint nor a super-human being .
now , there ’ s a somewhat burnt smell emanating from gerster ’ s files , and the first clouds of smoke have reached his boss , german economy minister wolfgang clement .
before his ministry is goes up in flames , predicted the paper , gerster has to take his leave .

all eyes are focused on deutsche bank ceo , josef ackermann .
deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann faces " breach of trust " charges in a düsseldorf court .
he and five others are accused of authorizing unwarranted payments when mobile phone company mannesmann was bought out by vodafone . it 's likely to rank as one of the most closely-watched trials in german corporate history .
starting wednesday , the head of deutsche bank , the former head of germany 's biggest trade union , and the former supervisory board of mobile phone company mannesmann will be spending two days a week in a düsseldorf court facing charges they unlawfully approved payments to top company executives . the six men have been accused of violating shareholders trust .
prosecutors say they took advantage of british telecommunications company vodafone 's takeover of its german rival mannesmann in 2000 to approve around € 57 million -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to the german firm 's managers . making waves compared to the united states , where such payments are commonplace , the mannesmann case has made waves in germany , where pay differerentials between board members and average employees remain comparatively low .
it 's also the first time german business leaders have faced prosecution for supervisory board activities . " this is the only country where people who are creating value go to court for doing so , " ackermann told reporters on wednesday , according to the reuters news agency . as the head of deutsche bank , swiss-born josef ackermann is arguably germany 's most powerful banker , and he 's still on the job , despite the charges against him .
deutsche bank has stood behind ackermann throughout the saga .
if convicted , it 's unlikely that he or his co-defendants would serve jail time .
but a guilty verdict would probably cost ackermann his job .
indecently high ?
klaus esser , mannesmann 's former chief executive and the main beneficiary of the bonuses , has repeatedly stressed that there was nothing indecent about the nearly € 30 million in bonuses and severance pay he received .
" i believe that the level of the payments should be gauged according to the manager 's success , " he has said and points to the fact that during his time as ceo mannesmann shares more than doubled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zwickel , former head of ig metall trade union but klaus zwickel , former head of ig metall , germany 's most powerful labor union -lrb- as with all large corporations , unions represent the workers ' interests on the supervisory board -rrb- , has subsequently berated himself publicly , saying he should have voted against the payments that were " indecently high and incomprehensible for any worker . " at the time , though , he effectively authorized the payments by abstaining from voting . prosecutors spent three years investigating the case and filed breach of trust charges against ackermann , zwickel , former supervisory board chairman joachim funk and worker 's council representative jürgen ladberg .
esser and personnel director dieter droste are accused of aiding and abetting the four members of the supervisory board . initially , prosecutors in düsseldorf considered charging the co-defendants with paying bribes to the managers to encourage them to drop objections to the € 190 billion vodafone takeover but decided on the " breach of trust " accusations instead .

deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann faces " breach of trust " charges in a düsseldorf court .
he and five others are accused of authorizing unwarranted payments when mobile phone company mannesmann was bought out by vodafone . it 's likely to rank as one of the most closely-watched trials in german corporate history .
starting wednesday , the head of deutsche bank , the former head of germany 's biggest trade union , and the former supervisory board of mobile phone company mannesmann will be spending two days a week in a düsseldorf court facing charges they unlawfully approved payments to top company executives . the six men have been accused of violating shareholders trust .
prosecutors say they took advantage of british telecommunications company vodafone 's takeover of its german rival mannesmann in 2000 to approve around € 57 million -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to the german firm 's managers . making waves compared to the united states , where such payments are commonplace , the mannesmann case has made waves in germany , where pay differerentials between board members and average employees remain comparatively low .
it 's also the first time german business leaders have faced prosecution for supervisory board activities . " this is the only country where people who are creating value go to court for doing so , " ackermann told reporters on wednesday , according to the reuters news agency . as the head of deutsche bank , swiss-born josef ackermann is arguably germany 's most powerful banker , and he 's still on the job , despite the charges against him .
deutsche bank has stood behind ackermann throughout the saga .
if convicted , it 's unlikely that he or his co-defendants would serve jail time .
but a guilty verdict would probably cost ackermann his job .
indecently high ?
klaus esser , mannesmann 's former chief executive and the main beneficiary of the bonuses , has repeatedly stressed that there was nothing indecent about the nearly € 30 million in bonuses and severance pay he received .
" i believe that the level of the payments should be gauged according to the manager 's success , " he has said and points to the fact that during his time as ceo mannesmann shares more than doubled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zwickel , former head of ig metall trade union but klaus zwickel , former head of ig metall , germany 's most powerful labor union -lrb- as with all large corporations , unions represent the workers ' interests on the supervisory board -rrb- , has subsequently berated himself publicly , saying he should have voted against the payments that were " indecently high and incomprehensible for any worker . " at the time , though , he effectively authorized the payments by abstaining from voting . prosecutors spent three years investigating the case and filed breach of trust charges against ackermann , zwickel , former supervisory board chairman joachim funk and worker 's council representative jürgen ladberg .
esser and personnel director dieter droste are accused of aiding and abetting the four members of the supervisory board . initially , prosecutors in düsseldorf considered charging the co-defendants with paying bribes to the managers to encourage them to drop objections to the € 190 billion vodafone takeover but decided on the " breach of trust " accusations instead .

all eyes are focused on deutsche bank ceo , josef ackermann .
deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann faces " breach of trust " charges in a düsseldorf court .
he and five others are accused of authorizing unwarranted payments when mobile phone company mannesmann was bought out by vodafone . it 's likely to rank as one of the most closely-watched trials in german corporate history .
starting wednesday , the head of deutsche bank , the former head of germany 's biggest trade union , and the former supervisory board of mobile phone company mannesmann will be spending two days a week in a düsseldorf court facing charges they unlawfully approved payments to top company executives . the six men have been accused of violating shareholders trust .
prosecutors say they took advantage of british telecommunications company vodafone 's takeover of its german rival mannesmann in 2000 to approve around € 57 million -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to the german firm 's managers . making waves compared to the united states , where such payments are commonplace , the mannesmann case has made waves in germany , where pay differerentials between board members and average employees remain comparatively low .
it 's also the first time german business leaders have faced prosecution for supervisory board activities . " this is the only country where people who are creating value go to court for doing so , " ackermann told reporters on wednesday , according to the reuters news agency . as the head of deutsche bank , swiss-born josef ackermann is arguably germany 's most powerful banker , and he 's still on the job , despite the charges against him .
deutsche bank has stood behind ackermann throughout the saga .
if convicted , it 's unlikely that he or his co-defendants would serve jail time .
but a guilty verdict would probably cost ackermann his job .
indecently high ?
klaus esser , mannesmann 's former chief executive and the main beneficiary of the bonuses , has repeatedly stressed that there was nothing indecent about the nearly € 30 million in bonuses and severance pay he received .

brussels has long maintained that the law violates eu merger rules .
a spokesperson for the commission said the body ran out of time to discuss the issue as expected on wednesday and that it will be taken up instead next week .
european internal markets commissioner frits bolkestein has said the limitation of voting rights for volkswagen shareholders gives lower saxony , which holds an 18.5 percent share in the company , significant control of the company and an unfair advantage that limits the freedom of capital flow within the eu . more briefs 20.01.2004 -pipe- zapf dolls gather dust in the u.s. 20.01.2004 -pipe- workplace theft on the rise 20.01.2004 -pipe- carlsberg takes over german rival holsten 19.01.2004 -pipe- german , french businesses hold economic summit in paris 19.01.2004 -pipe- infineon reports profits , improved conditions 19.01.2004 -pipe- volkswagen considering increased u.s. production 19.01.2004 -pipe- used cars get more expensive in germany 19.01.2004 -pipe- business groups expect better 2004 growth radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

though parents have a right to raise their children the way they see fit , the hamburg school system also has a right to teaching students " personal responsibility , " according to the judges .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory bremen leads bundesliga at winter break culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.01.2004 bundesliga hopes to be big in japan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn prepares to catch a hopeful shot on goal as two young japanese fans look on .
germany ’ s top soccer league , the bundesliga , is looking to attract fans and revenue from the lucrative far east market .
league chiefs have dispatched bayern munich goalkeeper oliver kahn to japan to lay the groundwork . in a business where the go-getters are constantly looking to expand their reach and raise their profile , the bundesliga has apparently been caught sleeping on the job . the german soccer league , for so long resigned to its role as the less fashionable cousin to other leagues on its own continent , has been shaken from its slumber by bad dreams of dwindling funds and recurring nightmares of shrinking television revenue . now it seems that the german league has woken up to the fact that the giants of spanish , italian and english soccer have a head start when it comes to making extra cash and promoting themselves as a brand in the rapidly-growing soccer markets in asia . while clubs such as manchester united and real madrid already have their own branded stores in major asian cities , selling their replica kits all over the continent - united alone sells its nike shirts in over 58 asian countries - even bundesliga giants bayern munich have failed to capture the imagination . ambassador of the bundesliga in an attempt to make up lost ground , tie up some lucrative deals and open avenues to possible cash flow opportunities in these burgeoning fanatical soccer markets , the bundesliga has dispatched bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn to japan to promote the league and german football . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beaten finalist but winner of japanese respect .
the german national captain is by far the most popular of his compatriots in soccer-hungry japan after his outstanding performances there during the world cup in 2002 .
while his thunder was stolen in the end by star striker ronaldo , who plies his trade in spain , kahn ’ s display ’ s as the ultimate line of defense for the runner-up german national team endeared him to the japanese . close relations of the past the association between the two countries on a soccer level is a close one which goes back many years .
german coaches and players have long been recognized as the teachers of the modern game in japan , while many japanese players past and present have honed their skills in the bundesliga .
but these days , while respect endures , the influx of german names to japan has dried up and most japanese fans do not rate modern german football as much of a spectator sport . yuichi akatsu , soccer expert for state broadcaster nhk admits that many see german football as monotonous , dull and " without special character which inspires the audience , " according to comments he made in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on wednesday . german soccer lacks the spark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his comments were supported in the same article by those of nobuyuki hirano , soccer marketing expert at dentsu , japan ’ s biggest japanese advertising agency .
" the image of german football is strong and stable , but definitely not thrilling .
compared to italian and spanish football , the german football is not attractive , although technically it is very good . " in a bid to convince the skeptical japanese and the rest of their far east target group , bundesliga chiefs are considering shifting scheduled weekend games from their traditional late and mid-afternoon kick off times to 12 noon to allow viewers in asia to watch live matches .
the hope is that demand will supplement funds back in germany while the future of homegrown television revenue remains up in the air . to whet the appetite : enter " ollie " .
while it is recognized that a change of match scheduling in favor of peak asian viewing times will not make german soccer popular overnight , the bundesliga chiefs feel that it is time that germany ’ s stars start to make their presence felt , hence the national goalkeeper ’ s brief tour of exhibition displays . a pretender to the throne of king david bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham enjoys adoration across the far east .
however , kahn is no david beckham by any stretch of the imagination .
the englishman ’ s one-man summer tour of the far east preceded his transfer to real madrid and helped launch the spanish club ’ s assault on the asian market place .
when he returned with his new team mates for their own pre-season sojourn , real racked up around € 17.4 million -lrb- $ 22 million -rrb- on their travels , including shirt and merchandising sales inspired by the england captain . and therein lies a potential problem for the bundesliga ’ s plans at getting a slice of the far east market and popularizing german soccer .
the european clubs and leagues that have made an impact in the region have done so through the marketable quality of the few big-name stars which just happen to play for some of the most fashionable teams in the world , in some of the most exciting leagues on the planet . the trend seems to show that the clubs and competitions that are doing well in the asian sector are doing so because of the popularity of individuals associated with them .
the far east fans seem to adore the celebrity soccer stars .
unfortunately , right now , the bundesliga is devoid of such globally recognizable players and lacks the pulling power to attract them . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dortmund may need to sell star players are the vultures already circling troubled german soccer club borussia dortmund ?

germans are often seen as hard-working , efficient people .
but are they happy at work ?
not according to an international study by the gallup organization , which says most germans feel disengaged from their jobs . those wondering why the german economy is in the doldrums could find part of the reason in the results of the gallup study . the american-based organization said this week that only 12 percent of germans have a strong emotional attachment to their jobs and their workplace ; 70 percent say they 're just going through the motions , and 18 percent have , psychologically at least , already quit . the results are part of a 30-year international study on emotional attachment to work as a measure of job satisfaction and productivity . the german branch of the gallup market research and consulting group interviewed around 2,000 working germans in the summer of last year .
the organization also carried out studies worldwide . americans lead the way in job satisfaction , with 30 percent of u.s. respondents saying they feel a strong attachment to their jobs . other leading nations were canada -lrb- 24 percent -rrb- , israel -lrb- 20 -rrb- , australia -lrb- 18 -rrb- , and great britain -lrb- 17 -rrb- . nations with fewer people expressing job satisfaction than germany include japan , where only 9 percent said they liked their job , france -lrb- 6 -rrb- and singapore -lrb- 4 -rrb- . the majority of people who are unhappy in their jobs do n't do anything to change their situation . according to gerald wood , executive director of gallup germany , most stay with their companies - something that has detrimental consequences for their employers . “ the level of emotional attachment to the jobs has a direct correlation to productivity , customer satisfaction , lost workdays , lower turnover - key economic factors directly linked to the state of mind , " he told deutsche welle .
" so basically by having a workforce that is less productive , you end up with lesser profitability . ” personal relationships matter wood estimates the value of lost productivity caused by job dissatisfaction in germany at around € 240 billion per year .
it 's often not the actual work that puts employees off , rather the personal interaction with their colleagues , and especially , their supervisors . “ what we have found is that the relationship with the direct managers is very important , " wood said .
" that is where emotional attachment either happens or doesn ’ t happen .
so you could be very happy to work for bmw for example as a company , but if you are very unsatisfied with your direct workplace then you are more likely to quit that job . ” so what , if anything , can german companies do to make their workforce happier ? while it 's difficult to change the chemistry between staff members , wood encourages german managers to become more liberal with praise for their staff , and start listening more to employees ' opinions - things that have little to do with how well colleagues like each other , but which can greatly improve the office atmosphere . less hierarchy additionally , german companies can take a cue from countries with higher percentages of satisfied workers , and do away with unnecessary corporate hierarchy . “ if you look at countries where hierarchies play a large role , for example in germany , france , singapore and japan , you see engagement dropping .

germans are often seen as hard-working , efficient people .
but are they happy at work ?
not according to an international study by the gallup organization , which says most germans feel disengaged from their jobs . those wondering why the german economy is in the doldrums could find part of the reason in the results of the gallup study . the american-based organization said this week that only 12 percent of germans have a strong emotional attachment to their jobs and their workplace ; 70 percent say they 're just going through the motions , and 18 percent have , psychologically at least , already quit . the results are part of a 30-year international study on emotional attachment to work as a measure of job satisfaction and productivity . the german branch of the gallup market research and consulting group interviewed around 2,000 working germans in the summer of last year .
the organization also carried out studies worldwide . americans lead the way in job satisfaction , with 30 percent of u.s. respondents saying they feel a strong attachment to their jobs . other leading nations were canada -lrb- 24 percent -rrb- , israel -lrb- 20 -rrb- , australia -lrb- 18 -rrb- , and great britain -lrb- 17 -rrb- . nations with fewer people expressing job satisfaction than germany include japan , where only 9 percent said they liked their job , france -lrb- 6 -rrb- and singapore -lrb- 4 -rrb- . the majority of people who are unhappy in their jobs do n't do anything to change their situation . according to gerald wood , executive director of gallup germany , most stay with their companies - something that has detrimental consequences for their employers . “ the level of emotional attachment to the jobs has a direct correlation to productivity , customer satisfaction , lost workdays , lower turnover - key economic factors directly linked to the state of mind , " he told deutsche welle .
" so basically by having a workforce that is less productive , you end up with lesser profitability . ” personal relationships matter wood estimates the value of lost productivity caused by job dissatisfaction in germany at around € 240 billion per year .
it 's often not the actual work that puts employees off , rather the personal interaction with their colleagues , and especially , their supervisors . “ what we have found is that the relationship with the direct managers is very important , " wood said .
" that is where emotional attachment either happens or doesn ’ t happen .
so you could be very happy to work for bmw for example as a company , but if you are very unsatisfied with your direct workplace then you are more likely to quit that job . ” so what , if anything , can german companies do to make their workforce happier ? while it 's difficult to change the chemistry between staff members , wood encourages german managers to become more liberal with praise for their staff , and start listening more to employees ' opinions - things that have little to do with how well colleagues like each other , but which can greatly improve the office atmosphere . less hierarchy additionally , german companies can take a cue from countries with higher percentages of satisfied workers , and do away with unnecessary corporate hierarchy . “ if you look at countries where hierarchies play a large role , for example in germany , france , singapore and japan , you see engagement dropping .

germany ’ s top soccer league , the bundesliga , is looking to attract fans and revenue from the lucrative far east market .
league chiefs have dispatched bayern munich goalkeeper oliver kahn to japan to lay the groundwork . in a business where the go-getters are constantly looking to expand their reach and raise their profile , the bundesliga has apparently been caught sleeping on the job . the german soccer league , for so long resigned to its role as the less fashionable cousin to other leagues on its own continent , has been shaken from its slumber by bad dreams of dwindling funds and recurring nightmares of shrinking television revenue . now it seems that the german league has woken up to the fact that the giants of spanish , italian and english soccer have a head start when it comes to making extra cash and promoting themselves as a brand in the rapidly-growing soccer markets in asia . while clubs such as manchester united and real madrid already have their own branded stores in major asian cities , selling their replica kits all over the continent - united alone sells its nike shirts in over 58 asian countries - even bundesliga giants bayern munich have failed to capture the imagination . ambassador of the bundesliga in an attempt to make up lost ground , tie up some lucrative deals and open avenues to possible cash flow opportunities in these burgeoning fanatical soccer markets , the bundesliga has dispatched bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn to japan to promote the league and german football . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beaten finalist but winner of japanese respect .
the german national captain is by far the most popular of his compatriots in soccer-hungry japan after his outstanding performances there during the world cup in 2002 .

german coaches and players have long been recognized as the teachers of the modern game in japan , while many japanese players past and present have honed their skills in the bundesliga .

" in a bid to convince the skeptical japanese and the rest of their far east target group , bundesliga chiefs are considering shifting scheduled weekend games from their traditional late and mid-afternoon kick off times to 12 noon to allow viewers in asia to watch live matches .
the hope is that demand will supplement funds back in germany while the future of homegrown television revenue remains up in the air . to whet the appetite : enter " ollie " .
while it is recognized that a change of match scheduling in favor of peak asian viewing times will not make german soccer popular overnight , the bundesliga chiefs feel that it is time that germany ’ s stars start to make their presence felt , hence the national goalkeeper ’ s brief tour of exhibition displays . a pretender to the throne of king david bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham enjoys adoration across the far east .

germans are often seen as hard-working , efficient people .
but are they happy at work ?
not according to an international study by the gallup organization , which says most germans feel disengaged from their jobs . those wondering why the german economy is in the doldrums could find part of the reason in the results of the gallup study . the american-based organization said this week that only 12 percent of germans have a strong emotional attachment to their jobs and their workplace ; 70 percent say they 're just going through the motions , and 18 percent have , psychologically at least , already quit . the results are part of a 30-year international study on emotional attachment to work as a measure of job satisfaction and productivity . the german branch of the gallup market research and consulting group interviewed around 2,000 working germans in the summer of last year .
the organization also carried out studies worldwide . americans lead the way in job satisfaction , with 30 percent of u.s. respondents saying they feel a strong attachment to their jobs . other leading nations were canada -lrb- 24 percent -rrb- , israel -lrb- 20 -rrb- , australia -lrb- 18 -rrb- , and great britain -lrb- 17 -rrb- . nations with fewer people expressing job satisfaction than germany include japan , where only 9 percent said they liked their job , france -lrb- 6 -rrb- and singapore -lrb- 4 -rrb- . the majority of people who are unhappy in their jobs do n't do anything to change their situation . according to gerald wood , executive director of gallup germany , most stay with their companies - something that has detrimental consequences for their employers . “ the level of emotional attachment to the jobs has a direct correlation to productivity , customer satisfaction , lost workdays , lower turnover - key economic factors directly linked to the state of mind , " he told deutsche welle .
" so basically by having a workforce that is less productive , you end up with lesser profitability . ” personal relationships matter wood estimates the value of lost productivity caused by job dissatisfaction in germany at around € 240 billion per year .
it 's often not the actual work that puts employees off , rather the personal interaction with their colleagues , and especially , their supervisors . “ what we have found is that the relationship with the direct managers is very important , " wood said .
" that is where emotional attachment either happens or doesn ’ t happen .
so you could be very happy to work for bmw for example as a company , but if you are very unsatisfied with your direct workplace then you are more likely to quit that job . ” so what , if anything , can german companies do to make their workforce happier ? while it 's difficult to change the chemistry between staff members , wood encourages german managers to become more liberal with praise for their staff , and start listening more to employees ' opinions - things that have little to do with how well colleagues like each other , but which can greatly improve the office atmosphere . less hierarchy additionally , german companies can take a cue from countries with higher percentages of satisfied workers , and do away with unnecessary corporate hierarchy . “ if you look at countries where hierarchies play a large role , for example in germany , france , singapore and japan , you see engagement dropping .
so what the us has done is to flatten hierarchies and also the whole communications culture within corporations - the structures in the us are much different than what we find here in germany , ” wood said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder encourages personal responsibility german chancellor gerhard schröder in his annual new year ’ s speech called on germans to do their part in bringing the country ’ s ailing economy back on track .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory bremen leads bundesliga at winter break culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.01.2004 bundesliga hopes to be big in japan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn prepares to catch a hopeful shot on goal as two young japanese fans look on .
germany ’ s top soccer league , the bundesliga , is looking to attract fans and revenue from the lucrative far east market .
league chiefs have dispatched bayern munich goalkeeper oliver kahn to japan to lay the groundwork . in a business where the go-getters are constantly looking to expand their reach and raise their profile , the bundesliga has apparently been caught sleeping on the job . the german soccer league , for so long resigned to its role as the less fashionable cousin to other leagues on its own continent , has been shaken from its slumber by bad dreams of dwindling funds and recurring nightmares of shrinking television revenue . now it seems that the german league has woken up to the fact that the giants of spanish , italian and english soccer have a head start when it comes to making extra cash and promoting themselves as a brand in the rapidly-growing soccer markets in asia . while clubs such as manchester united and real madrid already have their own branded stores in major asian cities , selling their replica kits all over the continent - united alone sells its nike shirts in over 58 asian countries - even bundesliga giants bayern munich have failed to capture the imagination . ambassador of the bundesliga in an attempt to make up lost ground , tie up some lucrative deals and open avenues to possible cash flow opportunities in these burgeoning fanatical soccer markets , the bundesliga has dispatched bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn to japan to promote the league and german football . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beaten finalist but winner of japanese respect .
the german national captain is by far the most popular of his compatriots in soccer-hungry japan after his outstanding performances there during the world cup in 2002 .
while his thunder was stolen in the end by star striker ronaldo , who plies his trade in spain , kahn ’ s display ’ s as the ultimate line of defense for the runner-up german national team endeared him to the japanese . close relations of the past the association between the two countries on a soccer level is a close one which goes back many years .
german coaches and players have long been recognized as the teachers of the modern game in japan , while many japanese players past and present have honed their skills in the bundesliga .
but these days , while respect endures , the influx of german names to japan has dried up and most japanese fans do not rate modern german football as much of a spectator sport . yuichi akatsu , soccer expert for state broadcaster nhk admits that many see german football as monotonous , dull and " without special character which inspires the audience , " according to comments he made in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on wednesday . german soccer lacks the spark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his comments were supported in the same article by those of nobuyuki hirano , soccer marketing expert at dentsu , japan ’ s biggest japanese advertising agency .
" the image of german football is strong and stable , but definitely not thrilling .
compared to italian and spanish football , the german football is not attractive , although technically it is very good . " in a bid to convince the skeptical japanese and the rest of their far east target group , bundesliga chiefs are considering shifting scheduled weekend games from their traditional late and mid-afternoon kick off times to 12 noon to allow viewers in asia to watch live matches .
the hope is that demand will supplement funds back in germany while the future of homegrown television revenue remains up in the air . to whet the appetite : enter " ollie " .
while it is recognized that a change of match scheduling in favor of peak asian viewing times will not make german soccer popular overnight , the bundesliga chiefs feel that it is time that germany ’ s stars start to make their presence felt , hence the national goalkeeper ’ s brief tour of exhibition displays . a pretender to the throne of king david bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham enjoys adoration across the far east .
however , kahn is no david beckham by any stretch of the imagination .
the englishman ’ s one-man summer tour of the far east preceded his transfer to real madrid and helped launch the spanish club ’ s assault on the asian market place .
when he returned with his new team mates for their own pre-season sojourn , real racked up around € 17.4 million -lrb- $ 22 million -rrb- on their travels , including shirt and merchandising sales inspired by the england captain . and therein lies a potential problem for the bundesliga ’ s plans at getting a slice of the far east market and popularizing german soccer .
the european clubs and leagues that have made an impact in the region have done so through the marketable quality of the few big-name stars which just happen to play for some of the most fashionable teams in the world , in some of the most exciting leagues on the planet . the trend seems to show that the clubs and competitions that are doing well in the asian sector are doing so because of the popularity of individuals associated with them .
the far east fans seem to adore the celebrity soccer stars .
unfortunately , right now , the bundesliga is devoid of such globally recognizable players and lacks the pulling power to attract them . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dortmund may need to sell star players are the vultures already circling troubled german soccer club borussia dortmund ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.01.2004 german press review : big business in the dock german newspapers wednesday commented on the mannesmann court case and the future of florian gerster , the head of the country ’ s federal labor office , who has lately come under fire for costly pr and consulting contracts . the beginning of a court case against six german managers over their role in the takeover of mannesmann by the telecommunications giant vodafone has lead many german editorialists to reflect on the relationship between business ethics versus business law . impertinent !
that ’ s the only thing that can be said about the greediness of the mannesmann clique , wrote the berliner kurier .
they have earned it , argue the ‘ experts ’ from the upper floors .
after all , the shareholders have gained mightily from the takeover .
but the process which is now under way , said the paper , underscores the fact that german share law is one thing – and ethics and propriety is something very different . the court won ’ t be able answer the most important question , argued der tagesspiegel .
and this question is how to lead a good enterprise .
neither will the court be able to define the thin line between a healthy bonus for good managers and pure greed , nor the line between moral behavior and irresponsible action . extreme cases in recent years have shown that economic power needs to be checked , wrote the nürnberger nachrichten .
but the paper thinks that courts are the wrong institutions for this .
judges only take criminal liability into account , not ethical points of view .
but the court case can do one thing , argued the paper : to stir up a debate as to what kind of rules german society wants to put in place on the economy and where the borders should run with regard to entrepreneurial liberty . other german dailies have taken a closer look at the political future of florian gerster , head of the germany ’ s federal labor office . as interested as some political circles might be in showing him up in order to denounce his reform ideas , florian gerster ’ s worst enemy , is gerster himself , wrote the frankfurter rundschau .
if it turns out to be true what has been filtering out of nuremberg in the past few days , gerster might become a real risk for the reform of his institution , predicted the paper .
one might overlook one wrong decision when it comes to placing orders to pr or consultant firms .
but three , four or even more cases – that will cost more in terms of reputation than a dozen pr campaigns could have built up . the süddeutsche zeitung observed that bit by bit , the german government is withdrawing support for gerster .
the individual cases might not be all that grave .
but all of them taken together , argued the munich-based daily , make it difficult to keep him . what was wanted was a messiah for germany ’ s social system , wrote the conservative paper die welt .
but so much is clear : gerster is neither a saint nor a super-human being .
now , there ’ s a somewhat burnt smell emanating from gerster ’ s files , and the first clouds of smoke have reached his boss , german economy minister wolfgang clement .
before his ministry is goes up in flames , predicted the paper , gerster has to take his leave .
until then , however , he has continue to pretend that he has super-human powers after all . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

all eyes are focused on deutsche bank ceo , josef ackermann .
deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann faces " breach of trust " charges in a düsseldorf court .
he and five others are accused of authorizing unwarranted payments when mobile phone company mannesmann was bought out by vodafone . it 's likely to rank as one of the most closely-watched trials in german corporate history .
starting wednesday , the head of deutsche bank , the former head of germany 's biggest trade union , and the former supervisory board of mobile phone company mannesmann will be spending two days a week in a düsseldorf court facing charges they unlawfully approved payments to top company executives . the six men have been accused of violating shareholders trust .
prosecutors say they took advantage of british telecommunications company vodafone 's takeover of its german rival mannesmann in 2000 to approve around € 57 million -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to the german firm 's managers . making waves compared to the united states , where such payments are commonplace , the mannesmann case has made waves in germany , where pay differerentials between board members and average employees remain comparatively low .
it 's also the first time german business leaders have faced prosecution for supervisory board activities . " this is the only country where people who are creating value go to court for doing so , " ackermann told reporters on wednesday , according to the reuters news agency . as the head of deutsche bank , swiss-born josef ackermann is arguably germany 's most powerful banker , and he 's still on the job , despite the charges against him .
deutsche bank has stood behind ackermann throughout the saga .
if convicted , it 's unlikely that he or his co-defendants would serve jail time .
but a guilty verdict would probably cost ackermann his job .
indecently high ?
klaus esser , mannesmann 's former chief executive and the main beneficiary of the bonuses , has repeatedly stressed that there was nothing indecent about the nearly € 30 million in bonuses and severance pay he received .
" i believe that the level of the payments should be gauged according to the manager 's success , " he has said and points to the fact that during his time as ceo mannesmann shares more than doubled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zwickel , former head of ig metall trade union but klaus zwickel , former head of ig metall , germany 's most powerful labor union -lrb- as with all large corporations , unions represent the workers ' interests on the supervisory board -rrb- , has subsequently berated himself publicly , saying he should have voted against the payments that were " indecently high and incomprehensible for any worker . " at the time , though , he effectively authorized the payments by abstaining from voting . prosecutors spent three years investigating the case and filed breach of trust charges against ackermann , zwickel , former supervisory board chairman joachim funk and worker 's council representative jürgen ladberg .
esser and personnel director dieter droste are accused of aiding and abetting the four members of the supervisory board . initially , prosecutors in düsseldorf considered charging the co-defendants with paying bribes to the managers to encourage them to drop objections to the € 190 billion vodafone takeover but decided on the " breach of trust " accusations instead .

deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann faces " breach of trust " charges in a düsseldorf court .
he and five others are accused of authorizing unwarranted payments when mobile phone company mannesmann was bought out by vodafone . it 's likely to rank as one of the most closely-watched trials in german corporate history .
starting wednesday , the head of deutsche bank , the former head of germany 's biggest trade union , and the former supervisory board of mobile phone company mannesmann will be spending two days a week in a düsseldorf court facing charges they unlawfully approved payments to top company executives . the six men have been accused of violating shareholders trust .
prosecutors say they took advantage of british telecommunications company vodafone 's takeover of its german rival mannesmann in 2000 to approve around € 57 million -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to the german firm 's managers . making waves compared to the united states , where such payments are commonplace , the mannesmann case has made waves in germany , where pay differerentials between board members and average employees remain comparatively low .
it 's also the first time german business leaders have faced prosecution for supervisory board activities . " this is the only country where people who are creating value go to court for doing so , " ackermann told reporters on wednesday , according to the reuters news agency . as the head of deutsche bank , swiss-born josef ackermann is arguably germany 's most powerful banker , and he 's still on the job , despite the charges against him .
deutsche bank has stood behind ackermann throughout the saga .
if convicted , it 's unlikely that he or his co-defendants would serve jail time .
but a guilty verdict would probably cost ackermann his job .

klaus esser , mannesmann 's former chief executive and the main beneficiary of the bonuses , has repeatedly stressed that there was nothing indecent about the nearly € 30 million in bonuses and severance pay he received .

" at the time , though , he effectively authorized the payments by abstaining from voting . prosecutors spent three years investigating the case and filed breach of trust charges against ackermann , zwickel , former supervisory board chairman joachim funk and worker 's council representative jürgen ladberg .
esser and personnel director dieter droste are accused of aiding and abetting the four members of the supervisory board . initially , prosecutors in düsseldorf considered charging the co-defendants with paying bribes to the managers to encourage them to drop objections to the € 190 billion vodafone takeover but decided on the " breach of trust " accusations instead .

prosecutors say they took advantage of british telecommunications company vodafone 's takeover of its german rival mannesmann in 2000 to approve around € 57 million -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to the german firm 's managers . making waves compared to the united states , where such payments are commonplace , the mannesmann case has made waves in germany , where pay differerentials between board members and average employees remain comparatively low .
it 's also the first time german business leaders have faced prosecution for supervisory board activities . " this is the only country where people who are creating value go to court for doing so , " ackermann told reporters on wednesday , according to the reuters news agency . as the head of deutsche bank , swiss-born josef ackermann is arguably germany 's most powerful banker , and he 's still on the job , despite the charges against him .
deutsche bank has stood behind ackermann throughout the saga .
if convicted , it 's unlikely that he or his co-defendants would serve jail time .
but a guilty verdict would probably cost ackermann his job .
indecently high ?
klaus esser , mannesmann 's former chief executive and the main beneficiary of the bonuses , has repeatedly stressed that there was nothing indecent about the nearly € 30 million in bonuses and severance pay he received .
" i believe that the level of the payments should be gauged according to the manager 's success , " he has said and points to the fact that during his time as ceo mannesmann shares more than doubled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zwickel , former head of ig metall trade union but klaus zwickel , former head of ig metall , germany 's most powerful labor union -lrb- as with all large corporations , unions represent the workers ' interests on the supervisory board -rrb- , has subsequently berated himself publicly , saying he should have voted against the payments that were " indecently high and incomprehensible for any worker . " at the time , though , he effectively authorized the payments by abstaining from voting . prosecutors spent three years investigating the case and filed breach of trust charges against ackermann , zwickel , former supervisory board chairman joachim funk and worker 's council representative jürgen ladberg .
esser and personnel director dieter droste are accused of aiding and abetting the four members of the supervisory board . initially , prosecutors in düsseldorf considered charging the co-defendants with paying bribes to the managers to encourage them to drop objections to the € 190 billion vodafone takeover but decided on the " breach of trust " accusations instead .

prosecutors say they took advantage of british telecommunications company vodafone 's takeover of its german rival mannesmann in 2000 to approve around € 57 million -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to the german firm 's managers . making waves compared to the united states , where such payments are commonplace , the mannesmann case has made waves in germany , where pay differerentials between board members and average employees remain comparatively low .
it 's also the first time german business leaders have faced prosecution for supervisory board activities . " this is the only country where people who are creating value go to court for doing so , " ackermann told reporters on wednesday , according to the reuters news agency . as the head of deutsche bank , swiss-born josef ackermann is arguably germany 's most powerful banker , and he 's still on the job , despite the charges against him .
deutsche bank has stood behind ackermann throughout the saga .
if convicted , it 's unlikely that he or his co-defendants would serve jail time .
but a guilty verdict would probably cost ackermann his job .
indecently high ?
klaus esser , mannesmann 's former chief executive and the main beneficiary of the bonuses , has repeatedly stressed that there was nothing indecent about the nearly € 30 million in bonuses and severance pay he received .
" i believe that the level of the payments should be gauged according to the manager 's success , " he has said and points to the fact that during his time as ceo mannesmann shares more than doubled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zwickel , former head of ig metall trade union but klaus zwickel , former head of ig metall , germany 's most powerful labor union -lrb- as with all large corporations , unions represent the workers ' interests on the supervisory board -rrb- , has subsequently berated himself publicly , saying he should have voted against the payments that were " indecently high and incomprehensible for any worker .

germans are often seen as hard-working , efficient people .
but are they happy at work ?
not according to an international study by the gallup organization , which says most germans feel disengaged from their jobs . those wondering why the german economy is in the doldrums could find part of the reason in the results of the gallup study . the american-based organization said this week that only 12 percent of germans have a strong emotional attachment to their jobs and their workplace ; 70 percent say they 're just going through the motions , and 18 percent have , psychologically at least , already quit . the results are part of a 30-year international study on emotional attachment to work as a measure of job satisfaction and productivity . the german branch of the gallup market research and consulting group interviewed around 2,000 working germans in the summer of last year .
the organization also carried out studies worldwide . americans lead the way in job satisfaction , with 30 percent of u.s. respondents saying they feel a strong attachment to their jobs . other leading nations were canada -lrb- 24 percent -rrb- , israel -lrb- 20 -rrb- , australia -lrb- 18 -rrb- , and great britain -lrb- 17 -rrb- . nations with fewer people expressing job satisfaction than germany include japan , where only 9 percent said they liked their job , france -lrb- 6 -rrb- and singapore -lrb- 4 -rrb- . the majority of people who are unhappy in their jobs do n't do anything to change their situation . according to gerald wood , executive director of gallup germany , most stay with their companies - something that has detrimental consequences for their employers . “ the level of emotional attachment to the jobs has a direct correlation to productivity , customer satisfaction , lost workdays , lower turnover - key economic factors directly linked to the state of mind , " he told deutsche welle .
" so basically by having a workforce that is less productive , you end up with lesser profitability . ” personal relationships matter wood estimates the value of lost productivity caused by job dissatisfaction in germany at around € 240 billion per year .
it 's often not the actual work that puts employees off , rather the personal interaction with their colleagues , and especially , their supervisors . “ what we have found is that the relationship with the direct managers is very important , " wood said .
" that is where emotional attachment either happens or doesn ’ t happen .
so you could be very happy to work for bmw for example as a company , but if you are very unsatisfied with your direct workplace then you are more likely to quit that job . ” so what , if anything , can german companies do to make their workforce happier ? while it 's difficult to change the chemistry between staff members , wood encourages german managers to become more liberal with praise for their staff , and start listening more to employees ' opinions - things that have little to do with how well colleagues like each other , but which can greatly improve the office atmosphere . less hierarchy additionally , german companies can take a cue from countries with higher percentages of satisfied workers , and do away with unnecessary corporate hierarchy . “ if you look at countries where hierarchies play a large role , for example in germany , france , singapore and japan , you see engagement dropping .
so what the us has done is to flatten hierarchies and also the whole communications culture within corporations - the structures in the us are much different than what we find here in germany , ” wood said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder encourages personal responsibility german chancellor gerhard schröder in his annual new year ’ s speech called on germans to do their part in bringing the country ’ s ailing economy back on track .

all eyes are focused on deutsche bank ceo , josef ackermann .
deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann faces " breach of trust " charges in a düsseldorf court .
he and five others are accused of authorizing unwarranted payments when mobile phone company mannesmann was bought out by vodafone . it 's likely to rank as one of the most closely-watched trials in german corporate history .
starting wednesday , the head of deutsche bank , the former head of germany 's biggest trade union , and the former supervisory board of mobile phone company mannesmann will be spending two days a week in a düsseldorf court facing charges they unlawfully approved payments to top company executives . the six men have been accused of violating shareholders trust .
prosecutors say they took advantage of british telecommunications company vodafone 's takeover of its german rival mannesmann in 2000 to approve around € 57 million -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to the german firm 's managers . making waves compared to the united states , where such payments are commonplace , the mannesmann case has made waves in germany , where pay differerentials between board members and average employees remain comparatively low .
it 's also the first time german business leaders have faced prosecution for supervisory board activities . " this is the only country where people who are creating value go to court for doing so , " ackermann told reporters on wednesday , according to the reuters news agency . as the head of deutsche bank , swiss-born josef ackermann is arguably germany 's most powerful banker , and he 's still on the job , despite the charges against him .
deutsche bank has stood behind ackermann throughout the saga .
if convicted , it 's unlikely that he or his co-defendants would serve jail time .
but a guilty verdict would probably cost ackermann his job .
indecently high ?
klaus esser , mannesmann 's former chief executive and the main beneficiary of the bonuses , has repeatedly stressed that there was nothing indecent about the nearly € 30 million in bonuses and severance pay he received .
" i believe that the level of the payments should be gauged according to the manager 's success , " he has said and points to the fact that during his time as ceo mannesmann shares more than doubled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zwickel , former head of ig metall trade union but klaus zwickel , former head of ig metall , germany 's most powerful labor union -lrb- as with all large corporations , unions represent the workers ' interests on the supervisory board -rrb- , has subsequently berated himself publicly , saying he should have voted against the payments that were " indecently high and incomprehensible for any worker . " at the time , though , he effectively authorized the payments by abstaining from voting . prosecutors spent three years investigating the case and filed breach of trust charges against ackermann , zwickel , former supervisory board chairman joachim funk and worker 's council representative jürgen ladberg .
esser and personnel director dieter droste are accused of aiding and abetting the four members of the supervisory board . initially , prosecutors in düsseldorf considered charging the co-defendants with paying bribes to the managers to encourage them to drop objections to the € 190 billion vodafone takeover but decided on the " breach of trust " accusations instead .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory bremen leads bundesliga at winter break culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.01.2004 bundesliga hopes to be big in japan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn prepares to catch a hopeful shot on goal as two young japanese fans look on .
germany ’ s top soccer league , the bundesliga , is looking to attract fans and revenue from the lucrative far east market .
league chiefs have dispatched bayern munich goalkeeper oliver kahn to japan to lay the groundwork . in a business where the go-getters are constantly looking to expand their reach and raise their profile , the bundesliga has apparently been caught sleeping on the job . the german soccer league , for so long resigned to its role as the less fashionable cousin to other leagues on its own continent , has been shaken from its slumber by bad dreams of dwindling funds and recurring nightmares of shrinking television revenue . now it seems that the german league has woken up to the fact that the giants of spanish , italian and english soccer have a head start when it comes to making extra cash and promoting themselves as a brand in the rapidly-growing soccer markets in asia . while clubs such as manchester united and real madrid already have their own branded stores in major asian cities , selling their replica kits all over the continent - united alone sells its nike shirts in over 58 asian countries - even bundesliga giants bayern munich have failed to capture the imagination . ambassador of the bundesliga in an attempt to make up lost ground , tie up some lucrative deals and open avenues to possible cash flow opportunities in these burgeoning fanatical soccer markets , the bundesliga has dispatched bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn to japan to promote the league and german football . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beaten finalist but winner of japanese respect .
the german national captain is by far the most popular of his compatriots in soccer-hungry japan after his outstanding performances there during the world cup in 2002 .
while his thunder was stolen in the end by star striker ronaldo , who plies his trade in spain , kahn ’ s display ’ s as the ultimate line of defense for the runner-up german national team endeared him to the japanese . close relations of the past the association between the two countries on a soccer level is a close one which goes back many years .
german coaches and players have long been recognized as the teachers of the modern game in japan , while many japanese players past and present have honed their skills in the bundesliga .
but these days , while respect endures , the influx of german names to japan has dried up and most japanese fans do not rate modern german football as much of a spectator sport . yuichi akatsu , soccer expert for state broadcaster nhk admits that many see german football as monotonous , dull and " without special character which inspires the audience , " according to comments he made in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on wednesday . german soccer lacks the spark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his comments were supported in the same article by those of nobuyuki hirano , soccer marketing expert at dentsu , japan ’ s biggest japanese advertising agency .
" the image of german football is strong and stable , but definitely not thrilling .
compared to italian and spanish football , the german football is not attractive , although technically it is very good . " in a bid to convince the skeptical japanese and the rest of their far east target group , bundesliga chiefs are considering shifting scheduled weekend games from their traditional late and mid-afternoon kick off times to 12 noon to allow viewers in asia to watch live matches .
the hope is that demand will supplement funds back in germany while the future of homegrown television revenue remains up in the air . to whet the appetite : enter " ollie " .
while it is recognized that a change of match scheduling in favor of peak asian viewing times will not make german soccer popular overnight , the bundesliga chiefs feel that it is time that germany ’ s stars start to make their presence felt , hence the national goalkeeper ’ s brief tour of exhibition displays . a pretender to the throne of king david bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham enjoys adoration across the far east .
however , kahn is no david beckham by any stretch of the imagination .
the englishman ’ s one-man summer tour of the far east preceded his transfer to real madrid and helped launch the spanish club ’ s assault on the asian market place .
when he returned with his new team mates for their own pre-season sojourn , real racked up around € 17.4 million -lrb- $ 22 million -rrb- on their travels , including shirt and merchandising sales inspired by the england captain . and therein lies a potential problem for the bundesliga ’ s plans at getting a slice of the far east market and popularizing german soccer .
the european clubs and leagues that have made an impact in the region have done so through the marketable quality of the few big-name stars which just happen to play for some of the most fashionable teams in the world , in some of the most exciting leagues on the planet . the trend seems to show that the clubs and competitions that are doing well in the asian sector are doing so because of the popularity of individuals associated with them .
the far east fans seem to adore the celebrity soccer stars .
unfortunately , right now , the bundesliga is devoid of such globally recognizable players and lacks the pulling power to attract them . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dortmund may need to sell star players are the vultures already circling troubled german soccer club borussia dortmund ?

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory bremen leads bundesliga at winter break culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.01.2004 bundesliga hopes to be big in japan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn prepares to catch a hopeful shot on goal as two young japanese fans look on .
germany ’ s top soccer league , the bundesliga , is looking to attract fans and revenue from the lucrative far east market .
league chiefs have dispatched bayern munich goalkeeper oliver kahn to japan to lay the groundwork . in a business where the go-getters are constantly looking to expand their reach and raise their profile , the bundesliga has apparently been caught sleeping on the job . the german soccer league , for so long resigned to its role as the less fashionable cousin to other leagues on its own continent , has been shaken from its slumber by bad dreams of dwindling funds and recurring nightmares of shrinking television revenue . now it seems that the german league has woken up to the fact that the giants of spanish , italian and english soccer have a head start when it comes to making extra cash and promoting themselves as a brand in the rapidly-growing soccer markets in asia . while clubs such as manchester united and real madrid already have their own branded stores in major asian cities , selling their replica kits all over the continent - united alone sells its nike shirts in over 58 asian countries - even bundesliga giants bayern munich have failed to capture the imagination . ambassador of the bundesliga in an attempt to make up lost ground , tie up some lucrative deals and open avenues to possible cash flow opportunities in these burgeoning fanatical soccer markets , the bundesliga has dispatched bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn to japan to promote the league and german football . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beaten finalist but winner of japanese respect .
the german national captain is by far the most popular of his compatriots in soccer-hungry japan after his outstanding performances there during the world cup in 2002 .
while his thunder was stolen in the end by star striker ronaldo , who plies his trade in spain , kahn ’ s display ’ s as the ultimate line of defense for the runner-up german national team endeared him to the japanese . close relations of the past the association between the two countries on a soccer level is a close one which goes back many years .
german coaches and players have long been recognized as the teachers of the modern game in japan , while many japanese players past and present have honed their skills in the bundesliga .
but these days , while respect endures , the influx of german names to japan has dried up and most japanese fans do not rate modern german football as much of a spectator sport . yuichi akatsu , soccer expert for state broadcaster nhk admits that many see german football as monotonous , dull and " without special character which inspires the audience , " according to comments he made in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on wednesday . german soccer lacks the spark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his comments were supported in the same article by those of nobuyuki hirano , soccer marketing expert at dentsu , japan ’ s biggest japanese advertising agency .
" the image of german football is strong and stable , but definitely not thrilling .
compared to italian and spanish football , the german football is not attractive , although technically it is very good . " in a bid to convince the skeptical japanese and the rest of their far east target group , bundesliga chiefs are considering shifting scheduled weekend games from their traditional late and mid-afternoon kick off times to 12 noon to allow viewers in asia to watch live matches .
the hope is that demand will supplement funds back in germany while the future of homegrown television revenue remains up in the air . to whet the appetite : enter " ollie " .
while it is recognized that a change of match scheduling in favor of peak asian viewing times will not make german soccer popular overnight , the bundesliga chiefs feel that it is time that germany ’ s stars start to make their presence felt , hence the national goalkeeper ’ s brief tour of exhibition displays . a pretender to the throne of king david bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham enjoys adoration across the far east .
however , kahn is no david beckham by any stretch of the imagination .
the englishman ’ s one-man summer tour of the far east preceded his transfer to real madrid and helped launch the spanish club ’ s assault on the asian market place .
when he returned with his new team mates for their own pre-season sojourn , real racked up around € 17.4 million -lrb- $ 22 million -rrb- on their travels , including shirt and merchandising sales inspired by the england captain . and therein lies a potential problem for the bundesliga ’ s plans at getting a slice of the far east market and popularizing german soccer .
the european clubs and leagues that have made an impact in the region have done so through the marketable quality of the few big-name stars which just happen to play for some of the most fashionable teams in the world , in some of the most exciting leagues on the planet . the trend seems to show that the clubs and competitions that are doing well in the asian sector are doing so because of the popularity of individuals associated with them .
the far east fans seem to adore the celebrity soccer stars .
unfortunately , right now , the bundesliga is devoid of such globally recognizable players and lacks the pulling power to attract them . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dortmund may need to sell star players are the vultures already circling troubled german soccer club borussia dortmund ?

that ’ s the only thing that can be said about the greediness of the mannesmann clique , wrote the berliner kurier .
they have earned it , argue the ‘ experts ’ from the upper floors .
after all , the shareholders have gained mightily from the takeover .
but the process which is now under way , said the paper , underscores the fact that german share law is one thing – and ethics and propriety is something very different . the court won ’ t be able answer the most important question , argued der tagesspiegel .
and this question is how to lead a good enterprise .
neither will the court be able to define the thin line between a healthy bonus for good managers and pure greed , nor the line between moral behavior and irresponsible action . extreme cases in recent years have shown that economic power needs to be checked , wrote the nürnberger nachrichten .

but the court case can do one thing , argued the paper : to stir up a debate as to what kind of rules german society wants to put in place on the economy and where the borders should run with regard to entrepreneurial liberty . other german dailies have taken a closer look at the political future of florian gerster , head of the germany ’ s federal labor office . as interested as some political circles might be in showing him up in order to denounce his reform ideas , florian gerster ’ s worst enemy , is gerster himself , wrote the frankfurter rundschau .
if it turns out to be true what has been filtering out of nuremberg in the past few days , gerster might become a real risk for the reform of his institution , predicted the paper .
one might overlook one wrong decision when it comes to placing orders to pr or consultant firms .
but three , four or even more cases – that will cost more in terms of reputation than a dozen pr campaigns could have built up . the süddeutsche zeitung observed that bit by bit , the german government is withdrawing support for gerster .
the individual cases might not be all that grave .
but all of them taken together , argued the munich-based daily , make it difficult to keep him . what was wanted was a messiah for germany ’ s social system , wrote the conservative paper die welt .
but so much is clear : gerster is neither a saint nor a super-human being .
now , there ’ s a somewhat burnt smell emanating from gerster ’ s files , and the first clouds of smoke have reached his boss , german economy minister wolfgang clement .

all eyes are focused on deutsche bank ceo , josef ackermann .
deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann faces " breach of trust " charges in a düsseldorf court .
he and five others are accused of authorizing unwarranted payments when mobile phone company mannesmann was bought out by vodafone . it 's likely to rank as one of the most closely-watched trials in german corporate history .
starting wednesday , the head of deutsche bank , the former head of germany 's biggest trade union , and the former supervisory board of mobile phone company mannesmann will be spending two days a week in a düsseldorf court facing charges they unlawfully approved payments to top company executives . the six men have been accused of violating shareholders trust .
prosecutors say they took advantage of british telecommunications company vodafone 's takeover of its german rival mannesmann in 2000 to approve around € 57 million -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to the german firm 's managers . making waves compared to the united states , where such payments are commonplace , the mannesmann case has made waves in germany , where pay differerentials between board members and average employees remain comparatively low .
it 's also the first time german business leaders have faced prosecution for supervisory board activities . " this is the only country where people who are creating value go to court for doing so , " ackermann told reporters on wednesday , according to the reuters news agency . as the head of deutsche bank , swiss-born josef ackermann is arguably germany 's most powerful banker , and he 's still on the job , despite the charges against him .
deutsche bank has stood behind ackermann throughout the saga .
if convicted , it 's unlikely that he or his co-defendants would serve jail time .
but a guilty verdict would probably cost ackermann his job .
indecently high ?
klaus esser , mannesmann 's former chief executive and the main beneficiary of the bonuses , has repeatedly stressed that there was nothing indecent about the nearly € 30 million in bonuses and severance pay he received .
" i believe that the level of the payments should be gauged according to the manager 's success , " he has said and points to the fact that during his time as ceo mannesmann shares more than doubled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zwickel , former head of ig metall trade union but klaus zwickel , former head of ig metall , germany 's most powerful labor union -lrb- as with all large corporations , unions represent the workers ' interests on the supervisory board -rrb- , has subsequently berated himself publicly , saying he should have voted against the payments that were " indecently high and incomprehensible for any worker . " at the time , though , he effectively authorized the payments by abstaining from voting . prosecutors spent three years investigating the case and filed breach of trust charges against ackermann , zwickel , former supervisory board chairman joachim funk and worker 's council representative jürgen ladberg .
esser and personnel director dieter droste are accused of aiding and abetting the four members of the supervisory board . initially , prosecutors in düsseldorf considered charging the co-defendants with paying bribes to the managers to encourage them to drop objections to the € 190 billion vodafone takeover but decided on the " breach of trust " accusations instead .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory bremen leads bundesliga at winter break culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.01.2004 bundesliga hopes to be big in japan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn prepares to catch a hopeful shot on goal as two young japanese fans look on .
germany ’ s top soccer league , the bundesliga , is looking to attract fans and revenue from the lucrative far east market .
league chiefs have dispatched bayern munich goalkeeper oliver kahn to japan to lay the groundwork . in a business where the go-getters are constantly looking to expand their reach and raise their profile , the bundesliga has apparently been caught sleeping on the job . the german soccer league , for so long resigned to its role as the less fashionable cousin to other leagues on its own continent , has been shaken from its slumber by bad dreams of dwindling funds and recurring nightmares of shrinking television revenue . now it seems that the german league has woken up to the fact that the giants of spanish , italian and english soccer have a head start when it comes to making extra cash and promoting themselves as a brand in the rapidly-growing soccer markets in asia . while clubs such as manchester united and real madrid already have their own branded stores in major asian cities , selling their replica kits all over the continent - united alone sells its nike shirts in over 58 asian countries - even bundesliga giants bayern munich have failed to capture the imagination . ambassador of the bundesliga in an attempt to make up lost ground , tie up some lucrative deals and open avenues to possible cash flow opportunities in these burgeoning fanatical soccer markets , the bundesliga has dispatched bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn to japan to promote the league and german football . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beaten finalist but winner of japanese respect .
the german national captain is by far the most popular of his compatriots in soccer-hungry japan after his outstanding performances there during the world cup in 2002 .
while his thunder was stolen in the end by star striker ronaldo , who plies his trade in spain , kahn ’ s display ’ s as the ultimate line of defense for the runner-up german national team endeared him to the japanese . close relations of the past the association between the two countries on a soccer level is a close one which goes back many years .
german coaches and players have long been recognized as the teachers of the modern game in japan , while many japanese players past and present have honed their skills in the bundesliga .
but these days , while respect endures , the influx of german names to japan has dried up and most japanese fans do not rate modern german football as much of a spectator sport . yuichi akatsu , soccer expert for state broadcaster nhk admits that many see german football as monotonous , dull and " without special character which inspires the audience , " according to comments he made in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on wednesday . german soccer lacks the spark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his comments were supported in the same article by those of nobuyuki hirano , soccer marketing expert at dentsu , japan ’ s biggest japanese advertising agency .
" the image of german football is strong and stable , but definitely not thrilling .
compared to italian and spanish football , the german football is not attractive , although technically it is very good . " in a bid to convince the skeptical japanese and the rest of their far east target group , bundesliga chiefs are considering shifting scheduled weekend games from their traditional late and mid-afternoon kick off times to 12 noon to allow viewers in asia to watch live matches .
the hope is that demand will supplement funds back in germany while the future of homegrown television revenue remains up in the air . to whet the appetite : enter " ollie " .
while it is recognized that a change of match scheduling in favor of peak asian viewing times will not make german soccer popular overnight , the bundesliga chiefs feel that it is time that germany ’ s stars start to make their presence felt , hence the national goalkeeper ’ s brief tour of exhibition displays . a pretender to the throne of king david bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham enjoys adoration across the far east .

germans are often seen as hard-working , efficient people .
but are they happy at work ?
not according to an international study by the gallup organization , which says most germans feel disengaged from their jobs . those wondering why the german economy is in the doldrums could find part of the reason in the results of the gallup study . the american-based organization said this week that only 12 percent of germans have a strong emotional attachment to their jobs and their workplace ; 70 percent say they 're just going through the motions , and 18 percent have , psychologically at least , already quit . the results are part of a 30-year international study on emotional attachment to work as a measure of job satisfaction and productivity . the german branch of the gallup market research and consulting group interviewed around 2,000 working germans in the summer of last year .
the organization also carried out studies worldwide . americans lead the way in job satisfaction , with 30 percent of u.s. respondents saying they feel a strong attachment to their jobs . other leading nations were canada -lrb- 24 percent -rrb- , israel -lrb- 20 -rrb- , australia -lrb- 18 -rrb- , and great britain -lrb- 17 -rrb- . nations with fewer people expressing job satisfaction than germany include japan , where only 9 percent said they liked their job , france -lrb- 6 -rrb- and singapore -lrb- 4 -rrb- . the majority of people who are unhappy in their jobs do n't do anything to change their situation . according to gerald wood , executive director of gallup germany , most stay with their companies - something that has detrimental consequences for their employers . “ the level of emotional attachment to the jobs has a direct correlation to productivity , customer satisfaction , lost workdays , lower turnover - key economic factors directly linked to the state of mind , " he told deutsche welle .
" so basically by having a workforce that is less productive , you end up with lesser profitability . ” personal relationships matter wood estimates the value of lost productivity caused by job dissatisfaction in germany at around € 240 billion per year .
it 's often not the actual work that puts employees off , rather the personal interaction with their colleagues , and especially , their supervisors . “ what we have found is that the relationship with the direct managers is very important , " wood said .
" that is where emotional attachment either happens or doesn ’ t happen .
so you could be very happy to work for bmw for example as a company , but if you are very unsatisfied with your direct workplace then you are more likely to quit that job . ” so what , if anything , can german companies do to make their workforce happier ? while it 's difficult to change the chemistry between staff members , wood encourages german managers to become more liberal with praise for their staff , and start listening more to employees ' opinions - things that have little to do with how well colleagues like each other , but which can greatly improve the office atmosphere . less hierarchy additionally , german companies can take a cue from countries with higher percentages of satisfied workers , and do away with unnecessary corporate hierarchy . “ if you look at countries where hierarchies play a large role , for example in germany , france , singapore and japan , you see engagement dropping .

germans are often seen as hard-working , efficient people .
but are they happy at work ?
not according to an international study by the gallup organization , which says most germans feel disengaged from their jobs . those wondering why the german economy is in the doldrums could find part of the reason in the results of the gallup study . the american-based organization said this week that only 12 percent of germans have a strong emotional attachment to their jobs and their workplace ; 70 percent say they 're just going through the motions , and 18 percent have , psychologically at least , already quit . the results are part of a 30-year international study on emotional attachment to work as a measure of job satisfaction and productivity . the german branch of the gallup market research and consulting group interviewed around 2,000 working germans in the summer of last year .
the organization also carried out studies worldwide . americans lead the way in job satisfaction , with 30 percent of u.s. respondents saying they feel a strong attachment to their jobs . other leading nations were canada -lrb- 24 percent -rrb- , israel -lrb- 20 -rrb- , australia -lrb- 18 -rrb- , and great britain -lrb- 17 -rrb- . nations with fewer people expressing job satisfaction than germany include japan , where only 9 percent said they liked their job , france -lrb- 6 -rrb- and singapore -lrb- 4 -rrb- . the majority of people who are unhappy in their jobs do n't do anything to change their situation . according to gerald wood , executive director of gallup germany , most stay with their companies - something that has detrimental consequences for their employers . “ the level of emotional attachment to the jobs has a direct correlation to productivity , customer satisfaction , lost workdays , lower turnover - key economic factors directly linked to the state of mind , " he told deutsche welle .
" so basically by having a workforce that is less productive , you end up with lesser profitability . ” personal relationships matter wood estimates the value of lost productivity caused by job dissatisfaction in germany at around € 240 billion per year .
it 's often not the actual work that puts employees off , rather the personal interaction with their colleagues , and especially , their supervisors . “ what we have found is that the relationship with the direct managers is very important , " wood said .
" that is where emotional attachment either happens or doesn ’ t happen .
so you could be very happy to work for bmw for example as a company , but if you are very unsatisfied with your direct workplace then you are more likely to quit that job . ” so what , if anything , can german companies do to make their workforce happier ? while it 's difficult to change the chemistry between staff members , wood encourages german managers to become more liberal with praise for their staff , and start listening more to employees ' opinions - things that have little to do with how well colleagues like each other , but which can greatly improve the office atmosphere . less hierarchy additionally , german companies can take a cue from countries with higher percentages of satisfied workers , and do away with unnecessary corporate hierarchy . “ if you look at countries where hierarchies play a large role , for example in germany , france , singapore and japan , you see engagement dropping .

all eyes are focused on deutsche bank ceo , josef ackermann .
deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann faces " breach of trust " charges in a düsseldorf court .
he and five others are accused of authorizing unwarranted payments when mobile phone company mannesmann was bought out by vodafone . it 's likely to rank as one of the most closely-watched trials in german corporate history .
starting wednesday , the head of deutsche bank , the former head of germany 's biggest trade union , and the former supervisory board of mobile phone company mannesmann will be spending two days a week in a düsseldorf court facing charges they unlawfully approved payments to top company executives . the six men have been accused of violating shareholders trust .
prosecutors say they took advantage of british telecommunications company vodafone 's takeover of its german rival mannesmann in 2000 to approve around € 57 million -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to the german firm 's managers . making waves compared to the united states , where such payments are commonplace , the mannesmann case has made waves in germany , where pay differerentials between board members and average employees remain comparatively low .
it 's also the first time german business leaders have faced prosecution for supervisory board activities . " this is the only country where people who are creating value go to court for doing so , " ackermann told reporters on wednesday , according to the reuters news agency . as the head of deutsche bank , swiss-born josef ackermann is arguably germany 's most powerful banker , and he 's still on the job , despite the charges against him .
deutsche bank has stood behind ackermann throughout the saga .
if convicted , it 's unlikely that he or his co-defendants would serve jail time .
but a guilty verdict would probably cost ackermann his job .
indecently high ?
klaus esser , mannesmann 's former chief executive and the main beneficiary of the bonuses , has repeatedly stressed that there was nothing indecent about the nearly € 30 million in bonuses and severance pay he received .
" i believe that the level of the payments should be gauged according to the manager 's success , " he has said and points to the fact that during his time as ceo mannesmann shares more than doubled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zwickel , former head of ig metall trade union but klaus zwickel , former head of ig metall , germany 's most powerful labor union -lrb- as with all large corporations , unions represent the workers ' interests on the supervisory board -rrb- , has subsequently berated himself publicly , saying he should have voted against the payments that were " indecently high and incomprehensible for any worker . " at the time , though , he effectively authorized the payments by abstaining from voting . prosecutors spent three years investigating the case and filed breach of trust charges against ackermann , zwickel , former supervisory board chairman joachim funk and worker 's council representative jürgen ladberg .
esser and personnel director dieter droste are accused of aiding and abetting the four members of the supervisory board . initially , prosecutors in düsseldorf considered charging the co-defendants with paying bribes to the managers to encourage them to drop objections to the € 190 billion vodafone takeover but decided on the " breach of trust " accusations instead .

deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann faces " breach of trust " charges in a düsseldorf court .
he and five others are accused of authorizing unwarranted payments when mobile phone company mannesmann was bought out by vodafone . it 's likely to rank as one of the most closely-watched trials in german corporate history .
starting wednesday , the head of deutsche bank , the former head of germany 's biggest trade union , and the former supervisory board of mobile phone company mannesmann will be spending two days a week in a düsseldorf court facing charges they unlawfully approved payments to top company executives . the six men have been accused of violating shareholders trust .
prosecutors say they took advantage of british telecommunications company vodafone 's takeover of its german rival mannesmann in 2000 to approve around € 57 million -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to the german firm 's managers . making waves compared to the united states , where such payments are commonplace , the mannesmann case has made waves in germany , where pay differerentials between board members and average employees remain comparatively low .
it 's also the first time german business leaders have faced prosecution for supervisory board activities . " this is the only country where people who are creating value go to court for doing so , " ackermann told reporters on wednesday , according to the reuters news agency . as the head of deutsche bank , swiss-born josef ackermann is arguably germany 's most powerful banker , and he 's still on the job , despite the charges against him .
deutsche bank has stood behind ackermann throughout the saga .
if convicted , it 's unlikely that he or his co-defendants would serve jail time .
but a guilty verdict would probably cost ackermann his job .
indecently high ?
klaus esser , mannesmann 's former chief executive and the main beneficiary of the bonuses , has repeatedly stressed that there was nothing indecent about the nearly € 30 million in bonuses and severance pay he received .
" i believe that the level of the payments should be gauged according to the manager 's success , " he has said and points to the fact that during his time as ceo mannesmann shares more than doubled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zwickel , former head of ig metall trade union but klaus zwickel , former head of ig metall , germany 's most powerful labor union -lrb- as with all large corporations , unions represent the workers ' interests on the supervisory board -rrb- , has subsequently berated himself publicly , saying he should have voted against the payments that were " indecently high and incomprehensible for any worker . " at the time , though , he effectively authorized the payments by abstaining from voting . prosecutors spent three years investigating the case and filed breach of trust charges against ackermann , zwickel , former supervisory board chairman joachim funk and worker 's council representative jürgen ladberg .
esser and personnel director dieter droste are accused of aiding and abetting the four members of the supervisory board . initially , prosecutors in düsseldorf considered charging the co-defendants with paying bribes to the managers to encourage them to drop objections to the € 190 billion vodafone takeover but decided on the " breach of trust " accusations instead .

that ’ s the only thing that can be said about the greediness of the mannesmann clique , wrote the berliner kurier .
they have earned it , argue the ‘ experts ’ from the upper floors .
after all , the shareholders have gained mightily from the takeover .
but the process which is now under way , said the paper , underscores the fact that german share law is one thing – and ethics and propriety is something very different . the court won ’ t be able answer the most important question , argued der tagesspiegel .
and this question is how to lead a good enterprise .
neither will the court be able to define the thin line between a healthy bonus for good managers and pure greed , nor the line between moral behavior and irresponsible action . extreme cases in recent years have shown that economic power needs to be checked , wrote the nürnberger nachrichten .
but the paper thinks that courts are the wrong institutions for this .
judges only take criminal liability into account , not ethical points of view .
but the court case can do one thing , argued the paper : to stir up a debate as to what kind of rules german society wants to put in place on the economy and where the borders should run with regard to entrepreneurial liberty . other german dailies have taken a closer look at the political future of florian gerster , head of the germany ’ s federal labor office . as interested as some political circles might be in showing him up in order to denounce his reform ideas , florian gerster ’ s worst enemy , is gerster himself , wrote the frankfurter rundschau .
if it turns out to be true what has been filtering out of nuremberg in the past few days , gerster might become a real risk for the reform of his institution , predicted the paper .
one might overlook one wrong decision when it comes to placing orders to pr or consultant firms .
but three , four or even more cases – that will cost more in terms of reputation than a dozen pr campaigns could have built up . the süddeutsche zeitung observed that bit by bit , the german government is withdrawing support for gerster .
the individual cases might not be all that grave .
but all of them taken together , argued the munich-based daily , make it difficult to keep him . what was wanted was a messiah for germany ’ s social system , wrote the conservative paper die welt .
but so much is clear : gerster is neither a saint nor a super-human being .
now , there ’ s a somewhat burnt smell emanating from gerster ’ s files , and the first clouds of smoke have reached his boss , german economy minister wolfgang clement .
before his ministry is goes up in flames , predicted the paper , gerster has to take his leave .
until then , however , he has continue to pretend that he has super-human powers after all . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany ’ s top soccer league , the bundesliga , is looking to attract fans and revenue from the lucrative far east market .
league chiefs have dispatched bayern munich goalkeeper oliver kahn to japan to lay the groundwork . in a business where the go-getters are constantly looking to expand their reach and raise their profile , the bundesliga has apparently been caught sleeping on the job . the german soccer league , for so long resigned to its role as the less fashionable cousin to other leagues on its own continent , has been shaken from its slumber by bad dreams of dwindling funds and recurring nightmares of shrinking television revenue . now it seems that the german league has woken up to the fact that the giants of spanish , italian and english soccer have a head start when it comes to making extra cash and promoting themselves as a brand in the rapidly-growing soccer markets in asia . while clubs such as manchester united and real madrid already have their own branded stores in major asian cities , selling their replica kits all over the continent - united alone sells its nike shirts in over 58 asian countries - even bundesliga giants bayern munich have failed to capture the imagination . ambassador of the bundesliga in an attempt to make up lost ground , tie up some lucrative deals and open avenues to possible cash flow opportunities in these burgeoning fanatical soccer markets , the bundesliga has dispatched bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn to japan to promote the league and german football . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beaten finalist but winner of japanese respect .
the german national captain is by far the most popular of his compatriots in soccer-hungry japan after his outstanding performances there during the world cup in 2002 .
while his thunder was stolen in the end by star striker ronaldo , who plies his trade in spain , kahn ’ s display ’ s as the ultimate line of defense for the runner-up german national team endeared him to the japanese . close relations of the past the association between the two countries on a soccer level is a close one which goes back many years .
german coaches and players have long been recognized as the teachers of the modern game in japan , while many japanese players past and present have honed their skills in the bundesliga .
but these days , while respect endures , the influx of german names to japan has dried up and most japanese fans do not rate modern german football as much of a spectator sport . yuichi akatsu , soccer expert for state broadcaster nhk admits that many see german football as monotonous , dull and " without special character which inspires the audience , " according to comments he made in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on wednesday . german soccer lacks the spark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his comments were supported in the same article by those of nobuyuki hirano , soccer marketing expert at dentsu , japan ’ s biggest japanese advertising agency .
" the image of german football is strong and stable , but definitely not thrilling .
compared to italian and spanish football , the german football is not attractive , although technically it is very good . " in a bid to convince the skeptical japanese and the rest of their far east target group , bundesliga chiefs are considering shifting scheduled weekend games from their traditional late and mid-afternoon kick off times to 12 noon to allow viewers in asia to watch live matches .
the hope is that demand will supplement funds back in germany while the future of homegrown television revenue remains up in the air . to whet the appetite : enter " ollie " .
while it is recognized that a change of match scheduling in favor of peak asian viewing times will not make german soccer popular overnight , the bundesliga chiefs feel that it is time that germany ’ s stars start to make their presence felt , hence the national goalkeeper ’ s brief tour of exhibition displays . a pretender to the throne of king david bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham enjoys adoration across the far east .
however , kahn is no david beckham by any stretch of the imagination .
the englishman ’ s one-man summer tour of the far east preceded his transfer to real madrid and helped launch the spanish club ’ s assault on the asian market place .
when he returned with his new team mates for their own pre-season sojourn , real racked up around € 17.4 million -lrb- $ 22 million -rrb- on their travels , including shirt and merchandising sales inspired by the england captain . and therein lies a potential problem for the bundesliga ’ s plans at getting a slice of the far east market and popularizing german soccer .
the european clubs and leagues that have made an impact in the region have done so through the marketable quality of the few big-name stars which just happen to play for some of the most fashionable teams in the world , in some of the most exciting leagues on the planet . the trend seems to show that the clubs and competitions that are doing well in the asian sector are doing so because of the popularity of individuals associated with them .
the far east fans seem to adore the celebrity soccer stars .

all eyes are focused on deutsche bank ceo , josef ackermann .
deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann faces " breach of trust " charges in a düsseldorf court .
he and five others are accused of authorizing unwarranted payments when mobile phone company mannesmann was bought out by vodafone . it 's likely to rank as one of the most closely-watched trials in german corporate history .
starting wednesday , the head of deutsche bank , the former head of germany 's biggest trade union , and the former supervisory board of mobile phone company mannesmann will be spending two days a week in a düsseldorf court facing charges they unlawfully approved payments to top company executives . the six men have been accused of violating shareholders trust .
prosecutors say they took advantage of british telecommunications company vodafone 's takeover of its german rival mannesmann in 2000 to approve around € 57 million -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to the german firm 's managers . making waves compared to the united states , where such payments are commonplace , the mannesmann case has made waves in germany , where pay differerentials between board members and average employees remain comparatively low .
it 's also the first time german business leaders have faced prosecution for supervisory board activities . " this is the only country where people who are creating value go to court for doing so , " ackermann told reporters on wednesday , according to the reuters news agency . as the head of deutsche bank , swiss-born josef ackermann is arguably germany 's most powerful banker , and he 's still on the job , despite the charges against him .
deutsche bank has stood behind ackermann throughout the saga .
if convicted , it 's unlikely that he or his co-defendants would serve jail time .
but a guilty verdict would probably cost ackermann his job .
indecently high ?
klaus esser , mannesmann 's former chief executive and the main beneficiary of the bonuses , has repeatedly stressed that there was nothing indecent about the nearly € 30 million in bonuses and severance pay he received .
" i believe that the level of the payments should be gauged according to the manager 's success , " he has said and points to the fact that during his time as ceo mannesmann shares more than doubled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zwickel , former head of ig metall trade union but klaus zwickel , former head of ig metall , germany 's most powerful labor union -lrb- as with all large corporations , unions represent the workers ' interests on the supervisory board -rrb- , has subsequently berated himself publicly , saying he should have voted against the payments that were " indecently high and incomprehensible for any worker . " at the time , though , he effectively authorized the payments by abstaining from voting . prosecutors spent three years investigating the case and filed breach of trust charges against ackermann , zwickel , former supervisory board chairman joachim funk and worker 's council representative jürgen ladberg .
esser and personnel director dieter droste are accused of aiding and abetting the four members of the supervisory board . initially , prosecutors in düsseldorf considered charging the co-defendants with paying bribes to the managers to encourage them to drop objections to the € 190 billion vodafone takeover but decided on the " breach of trust " accusations instead .

all eyes are focused on deutsche bank ceo , josef ackermann .
deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann faces " breach of trust " charges in a düsseldorf court .
he and five others are accused of authorizing unwarranted payments when mobile phone company mannesmann was bought out by vodafone . it 's likely to rank as one of the most closely-watched trials in german corporate history .
starting wednesday , the head of deutsche bank , the former head of germany 's biggest trade union , and the former supervisory board of mobile phone company mannesmann will be spending two days a week in a düsseldorf court facing charges they unlawfully approved payments to top company executives . the six men have been accused of violating shareholders trust .
prosecutors say they took advantage of british telecommunications company vodafone 's takeover of its german rival mannesmann in 2000 to approve around € 57 million -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to the german firm 's managers . making waves compared to the united states , where such payments are commonplace , the mannesmann case has made waves in germany , where pay differerentials between board members and average employees remain comparatively low .
it 's also the first time german business leaders have faced prosecution for supervisory board activities . " this is the only country where people who are creating value go to court for doing so , " ackermann told reporters on wednesday , according to the reuters news agency . as the head of deutsche bank , swiss-born josef ackermann is arguably germany 's most powerful banker , and he 's still on the job , despite the charges against him .
deutsche bank has stood behind ackermann throughout the saga .
if convicted , it 's unlikely that he or his co-defendants would serve jail time .
but a guilty verdict would probably cost ackermann his job .
indecently high ?
klaus esser , mannesmann 's former chief executive and the main beneficiary of the bonuses , has repeatedly stressed that there was nothing indecent about the nearly € 30 million in bonuses and severance pay he received .
" i believe that the level of the payments should be gauged according to the manager 's success , " he has said and points to the fact that during his time as ceo mannesmann shares more than doubled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zwickel , former head of ig metall trade union but klaus zwickel , former head of ig metall , germany 's most powerful labor union -lrb- as with all large corporations , unions represent the workers ' interests on the supervisory board -rrb- , has subsequently berated himself publicly , saying he should have voted against the payments that were " indecently high and incomprehensible for any worker . " at the time , though , he effectively authorized the payments by abstaining from voting . prosecutors spent three years investigating the case and filed breach of trust charges against ackermann , zwickel , former supervisory board chairman joachim funk and worker 's council representative jürgen ladberg .
esser and personnel director dieter droste are accused of aiding and abetting the four members of the supervisory board . initially , prosecutors in düsseldorf considered charging the co-defendants with paying bribes to the managers to encourage them to drop objections to the € 190 billion vodafone takeover but decided on the " breach of trust " accusations instead .

starting wednesday , the head of deutsche bank , the former head of germany 's biggest trade union , and the former supervisory board of mobile phone company mannesmann will be spending two days a week in a düsseldorf court facing charges they unlawfully approved payments to top company executives . the six men have been accused of violating shareholders trust .
prosecutors say they took advantage of british telecommunications company vodafone 's takeover of its german rival mannesmann in 2000 to approve around € 57 million -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to the german firm 's managers . making waves compared to the united states , where such payments are commonplace , the mannesmann case has made waves in germany , where pay differerentials between board members and average employees remain comparatively low .
it 's also the first time german business leaders have faced prosecution for supervisory board activities . " this is the only country where people who are creating value go to court for doing so , " ackermann told reporters on wednesday , according to the reuters news agency . as the head of deutsche bank , swiss-born josef ackermann is arguably germany 's most powerful banker , and he 's still on the job , despite the charges against him .
deutsche bank has stood behind ackermann throughout the saga .
if convicted , it 's unlikely that he or his co-defendants would serve jail time .
but a guilty verdict would probably cost ackermann his job .
indecently high ?
klaus esser , mannesmann 's former chief executive and the main beneficiary of the bonuses , has repeatedly stressed that there was nothing indecent about the nearly € 30 million in bonuses and severance pay he received .
" i believe that the level of the payments should be gauged according to the manager 's success , " he has said and points to the fact that during his time as ceo mannesmann shares more than doubled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zwickel , former head of ig metall trade union but klaus zwickel , former head of ig metall , germany 's most powerful labor union -lrb- as with all large corporations , unions represent the workers ' interests on the supervisory board -rrb- , has subsequently berated himself publicly , saying he should have voted against the payments that were " indecently high and incomprehensible for any worker . " at the time , though , he effectively authorized the payments by abstaining from voting . prosecutors spent three years investigating the case and filed breach of trust charges against ackermann , zwickel , former supervisory board chairman joachim funk and worker 's council representative jürgen ladberg .
esser and personnel director dieter droste are accused of aiding and abetting the four members of the supervisory board . initially , prosecutors in düsseldorf considered charging the co-defendants with paying bribes to the managers to encourage them to drop objections to the € 190 billion vodafone takeover but decided on the " breach of trust " accusations instead .

not according to an international study by the gallup organization , which says most germans feel disengaged from their jobs . those wondering why the german economy is in the doldrums could find part of the reason in the results of the gallup study . the american-based organization said this week that only 12 percent of germans have a strong emotional attachment to their jobs and their workplace ; 70 percent say they 're just going through the motions , and 18 percent have , psychologically at least , already quit . the results are part of a 30-year international study on emotional attachment to work as a measure of job satisfaction and productivity . the german branch of the gallup market research and consulting group interviewed around 2,000 working germans in the summer of last year .

" so basically by having a workforce that is less productive , you end up with lesser profitability . ” personal relationships matter wood estimates the value of lost productivity caused by job dissatisfaction in germany at around € 240 billion per year .
it 's often not the actual work that puts employees off , rather the personal interaction with their colleagues , and especially , their supervisors . “ what we have found is that the relationship with the direct managers is very important , " wood said .

" so basically by having a workforce that is less productive , you end up with lesser profitability . ” personal relationships matter wood estimates the value of lost productivity caused by job dissatisfaction in germany at around € 240 billion per year .
it 's often not the actual work that puts employees off , rather the personal interaction with their colleagues , and especially , their supervisors . “ what we have found is that the relationship with the direct managers is very important , " wood said .
" that is where emotional attachment either happens or doesn ’ t happen .
so you could be very happy to work for bmw for example as a company , but if you are very unsatisfied with your direct workplace then you are more likely to quit that job . ” so what , if anything , can german companies do to make their workforce happier ? while it 's difficult to change the chemistry between staff members , wood encourages german managers to become more liberal with praise for their staff , and start listening more to employees ' opinions - things that have little to do with how well colleagues like each other , but which can greatly improve the office atmosphere . less hierarchy additionally , german companies can take a cue from countries with higher percentages of satisfied workers , and do away with unnecessary corporate hierarchy . “ if you look at countries where hierarchies play a large role , for example in germany , france , singapore and japan , you see engagement dropping .

that ’ s the only thing that can be said about the greediness of the mannesmann clique , wrote the berliner kurier .

after all , the shareholders have gained mightily from the takeover .
but the process which is now under way , said the paper , underscores the fact that german share law is one thing – and ethics and propriety is something very different . the court won ’ t be able answer the most important question , argued der tagesspiegel .
and this question is how to lead a good enterprise .

one might overlook one wrong decision when it comes to placing orders to pr or consultant firms .

here is a full transcript of his speech : mr speaker , vice president cheney , members of congress , distinguished guests , and fellow citizens : america this evening is a nation called to great responsibilities .
and we are rising to meet them .
as we gather tonight , hundreds of thousands of american servicemen and women are deployed across the world in the war on terror .
by bringing hope to the oppressed , and delivering justice to the violent , they are making america more secure .
each day , law enforcement personnel and intelligence officers are tracking terrorist threats ; analysts are examining airline passenger lists ; the men and women of our new homeland security department are patrolling our coasts and borders .
and their vigilance is protecting america .
americans are proving once again to be the hardest working people in the world .
the american economy is growing stronger .
the tax relief you passed is working .
tonight , members of congress can take pride in great works of compassion and reform that sceptics had thought impossible .
you are raising the standards of our public schools ; and you are giving our senior citizens prescription drug coverage under medicare .
we have faced serious challenges together and now we face a choice .
we can go forward with confidence and resolve - or we can turn back to the dangerous illusion that terrorists are not plotting and outlaw regimes are no threat to us .
we can press on with economic growth , and reforms in education and medicare - or we can turn back to the old policies and old divisions .
we have not come all this way - through tragedy , and trial , and war - only to falter and leave our work unfinished .
americans are rising to the tasks of history , and they expect the same of us .
in their efforts , their enterprise , and their character , the american people are showing that the state of our union is confident and strong .
defending america our greatest responsibility is the active defence of the american people .
twenty-eight months have passed since september 11 , 2001 - over two years without an attack on american soil - and it is tempting to believe that the danger is behind us .
that hope is understandable , comforting - and false .
the killing has continued in bali , jakarta , casablanca , riyadh , mombasa , jerusalem , istanbul , and baghdad .
the terrorists continue to plot against america and the civilised world .
and by our will and courage , this danger will be defeated .
inside the united states , where the war began , we must continue to give homeland security and law enforcement personnel every tool they need to defend us .
and one of those essential tools is the patriot act , which allows federal law enforcement to better share information , to track terrorists , to disrupt their cells , and to seize their assets .
for years , we have used similar provisions to catch embezzlers and drug traffickers .
if these methods are good for hunting criminals , they are even more important for hunting terrorists .
key provisions of the patriot act are set to expire next year .
the terrorist threat will not expire on that schedule .
our law enforcement needs this vital legislation to protect our citizens - you need to renew the patriot act .
america is on the offensive against the terrorists who started this war .
last march , khalid sheikh mohammed , a mastermind of september 11th , awoke to find himself in the custody of us and pakistani authorities .
last august 11th brought the capture of the terrorist hambali , who was a key player in the attack in indonesia that killed over 200 people .
we are tracking al-qaeda around the world , and nearly two-thirds of their known leaders have now been captured or killed .
thousands of very skilled and determined military personnel are on a manhunt , going after the remaining killers who hide in cities and caves and , one by one , we will bring the terrorists to justice .
regime change as part of the offensive against terror , we are also confronting the regimes that harbour and support terrorists , and could supply them with nuclear , chemical , or biological weapons .
the united states and our allies are determined : we refuse to live in the shadow of this ultimate danger .
the first to see our determination were the taleban , who made afghanistan the primary training base of al-qaeda killers .
as of this month , that country has a new constitution , guaranteeing free elections and full participation by women .
businesses are opening , health care centres are being established , and the boys and girls of afghanistan are back in school .
with help from the new afghan army , our coalition is leading aggressive raids against surviving members of the taleban and al-qaeda .
the men and women of afghanistan are building a nation that is free , and proud , and fighting terror , and america is honoured to be their friend .
since we last met in this chamber , combat forces of the united states , great britain , australia , poland , and other countries enforced the demands of the united nations , ended the rule of saddam hussein , and the people of iraq are free .
having broken the baathist regime , we face a remnant of violent saddam supporters .
men who ran away from our troops in battle are now dispersed and attack from the shadows .
these killers , joined by foreign terrorists , are a serious , continuing danger .
yet we are making progress against them .
the once all-powerful ruler of iraq was found in a hole , and now sits in a prison cell .
of the top 55 officials of the former regime , we have captured or killed 45 .
our forces are on the offensive , leading over 1,600 patrols a day , and conducting an average of 180 raids every week .
we are dealing with these thugs in iraq , just as surely as we dealt with saddam hussein 's evil regime .
the work of building a new iraq is hard , and it is right .
and america has always been willing to do what it takes for what is right .
last january , iraq 's only law was the whim of one brutal man .
today our coalition is working with the iraqi governing council to draft a basic law , with a bill of rights .
we are working with iraqis and the united nations to prepare for a transition to full iraqi sovereignty by the end of june .
as democracy takes hold in iraq , the enemies of freedom will do all in their power to spread violence and fear .
they are trying to shake the will of our country and our friends , but the united states of america will never be intimidated by thugs and assassins .
the killers will fail , and the iraqi people will live in freedom .
month by month , iraqis are assuming more responsibility for their own security and their own future .
and tonight we are honored to welcome one of iraq 's most respected leaders : the current president of the iraqi governing council , adnan pachachi .
sir , america stands with you and the iraqi people as you build a free and peaceful nation .
because of american leadership and resolve , the world is changing for the better .
last month , the leader of libya voluntarily pledged to disclose and dismantle all of his regime 's weapons of mass destruction programmes , including a uranium enrichment project for nuclear weapons .
colonel gaddaffi correctly judged that his country would be better off , and far more secure , without weapons of mass murder .
nine months of intense negotiations involving the united states and great britain succeeded with libya , while 12 years of diplomacy with iraq did not .
and one reason is clear : for diplomacy to be effective , words must be credible , and no one can now doubt the word of america .
different threats require different strategies .
along with nations in the region , we are insisting that north korea eliminate its nuclear programme .
america and the international community are demanding that iran meet its commitments and not develop nuclear weapons .
america is committed to keeping the world 's most dangerous weapons out of the hands of the world 's most dangerous regimes .
' coalition of nations ' when i came to this rostrum on september 20th , 2001 , i brought the police shield of a fallen officer , my reminder of lives that ended , and a task that does not end .
i gave to you and to all americans my complete commitment to securing our country and defeating our enemies .
and this pledge , given by one , has been kept by many .
you in the congress have provided the resources for our defence , and cast the difficult votes of war and peace .
our closest allies have been unwavering .
america 's intelligence personnel and diplomats have been skilled and tireless .
and the men and women of the american military , they have taken the hardest duty .
we have seen their skill and courage in armoured charges and midnight raids and lonely hours on faithful watch .
we have seen the joy when they return , and felt the sorrow when one is lost .
i have had the honour of meeting our servicemen and women at many posts , from the deck of a carrier in the pacific , to a mess hall in baghdad .
many of our troops are listening tonight .
and i want you and your families to know : america is proud of you .
and my administration , and this congress , will give you the resources you need to fight and win the war on terror .
i know that some people question if america is really in a war at all .
they view terrorism more as a crime , a problem to be solved mainly with law enforcement and indictments .
after the world trade center was first attacked in 1993 , some of the guilty were indicted , tried , convicted , and sent to prison .
but the matter was not settled .
the terrorists were still training and plotting in other nations , and drawing up more ambitious plans .
after the chaos and carnage of september 11th , it is not enough to serve our enemies with legal papers .
the terrorists and their supporters declared war on the united states , and war is what they got .
some in this chamber , and in our country , did not support the liberation of iraq .
objections to war often come from principled motives .
but let us be candid about the consequences of leaving saddam hussein in power .
we are seeking all the facts - already the kay report identified dozens of weapons of mass destruction-related programme activities and significant amounts of equipment that iraq concealed from the united nations .
had we failed to act , the dictator 's weapons of mass destruction programmes would continue to this day .
had we failed to act , security council resolutions on iraq would have been revealed as empty threats , weakening the united nations and encouraging defiance by dictators around the world .
iraq 's torture chambers would still be filled with victims , terrified and innocent .
the killing fields of iraq , where hundreds of thousands of men , women , and children vanished into the sands , would still be known only to the killers .
for all who love freedom and peace , the world without saddam hussein 's regime is a better and safer place .
some critics have said our duties in iraq must be internationalised .
this particular criticism is hard to explain to our partners in britain , australia , japan , south korea , the philippines , thailand , italy , spain , poland , denmark , hungary , bulgaria , ukraine , romania , the netherlands , norway , el salvador , and the 17 other countries that have committed troops to iraq .
as we debate at home , we must never ignore the vital contributions of our international partners , or dismiss their sacrifices .
from the beginning , america has sought international support for operations in afghanistan and iraq , and we have gained much support .
there is a difference , however , between leading a coalition of many nations , and submitting to the objections of a few .
america will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our country .
middle east democracy we also hear doubts that democracy is a realistic goal for the greater middle east , where freedom is rare .
yet it is mistaken , and condescending , to assume that whole cultures and great religions are incompatible with liberty and self-government .
i believe that god has planted in every human heart the desire to live in freedom .
and even when that desire is crushed by tyranny for decades , it will rise again .
as long as the middle east remains a place of tyranny , despair , and anger , it will continue to produce men and movements that threaten the safety of america and our friends .
so america is pursuing a forward strategy of freedom in the greater middle east .
we will challenge the enemies of reform , confront the allies of terror , and expect a higher standard from our friends .
to cut through the barriers of hateful propaganda , the voice of america and other broadcast services are expanding their programming in arabic and persian and soon , a new television service will begin providing reliable news and information across the region .
i will send you a proposal to double the budget of the national endowment for democracy , and to focus its new work on the development of free elections , free markets , free press , and free labour unions in the middle east .
and above all , we will finish the historic work of democracy in afghanistan and iraq , so those nations can light the way for others , and help transform a troubled part of the world .
america is a nation with a mission , and that mission comes from our most basic beliefs .
we have no desire to dominate , no ambitions of empire .
our aim is a democratic peace , a peace founded upon the dignity and rights of every man and woman .
america acts in this cause with friends and allies at our side , yet we understand our special calling : this great republic will lead the cause of freedom .
economy in these last three years , adversity has also revealed the fundamental strengths of the american economy .
we have come through recession and terrorist attack and corporate scandals , and the uncertainties of war .
and because you acted to stimulate our economy with tax relief , this economy is strong , and growing stronger .
you have doubled the child tax credit from $ 500 to $ 1,000 , reduced the marriage penalty , begun to phase out the death tax , reduced taxes on capital gains and stock dividends , cut taxes on small businesses , and you have lowered taxes for every american who pays income taxes .
americans took those dollars and put them to work , driving this economy forward .
the pace of economic growth in the third quarter of 2003 was the fastest in nearly 20 years .
new home construction , the highest in almost 20 years .
home ownership rates the highest ever .
manufacturing activity is increasing .
inflation is low .
interest rates are low .
exports are growing .
productivity is high .
and jobs are on the rise .
these numbers confirm that the american people are using their money far better than government would have , and you were right to return it .
america 's growing economy is also a changing economy .
as technology transforms the way almost every job is done , america becomes more productive , and workers need new skills .
much of our job growth will be found in high-skilled fields like health care and biotechnology .
so we must respond by helping more americans gain the skills to find good jobs in our new economy .
education all skills begin with the basics of reading and math , which are supposed to be learned in the early grades of our schools .
yet for too long , for too many children , those skills were never mastered .
by passing the no child left behind act , you have made the expectation of literacy the law of our country .
we are providing more funding for our schools , a 36 % increase since 2001 .
we are requiring higher standards .
we are regularly testing every child on the fundamentals .
we are reporting results to parents , and making sure they have better options when schools are not performing .
we are making progress toward excellence for every child .
but the status quo always has defenders .
some want to undermine the no child left behind act by weakening standards and accountability .
yet the results we require are really a matter of common sense : we expect third graders to read and do math at third grade level , and that is not asking too much .
testing is the only way to identify and help students who are falling behind .
this nation will not go back to the days of simply shuffling children along from grade to grade without them learning the basics .
i refuse to give up on any child , and the no child left behind act is opening the door of opportunity to all of america 's children .
at the same time , we must ensure that older students and adults can gain the skills they need to find work now .
many of the fastest-growing occupations require strong math and science preparation , and training beyond the high school level .
so tonight i propose a series of measures called jobs for the 21st century .
this programme will provide extra help to middle- and high school students who fall behind in reading and math , expand advanced placement programmes in low-income schools , and invite math and science professionals from the private sector to teach part-time in our high schools .
i propose larger pell grants for students who prepare for college with demanding courses in high school .
i propose increasing our support for america 's fine community colleges , so they can train workers for the industries that are creating the most new jobs .
by all these actions , we will help more and more americans to join in the growing prosperity of our country .
job training is important , and so is job creation .
we must continue to pursue an aggressive , pro-growth economic agenda .
tax cuts congress has some unfinished business on the issue of taxes .
the tax reductions you passed are set to expire .
unless you act , the unfair tax on marriage will go back up .
unless you act , millions of families will be charged $ 300 more in federal taxes for every child .
unless you act , small businesses will pay higher taxes .
unless you act , the death tax will eventually come back to life .
unless you act , americans face a tax increase .
what the congress has given , the congress should not take away : for the sake of job growth , the tax cuts you passed should be permanent .
our agenda for jobs and growth must help small business owners and employees with relief from needless federal regulation , and protect them from junk and frivolous lawsuits .
consumers and businesses need reliable supplies of energy to make our economy run , so i urge you to pass legislation to modernise our electricity system , promote conservation , and make america less dependent on foreign sources of energy .
my administration is promoting free and fair trade , to open up new markets for america 's entrepreneurs , and manufacturers , and farmers , and to create jobs for america 's workers .
younger workers should have the opportunity to build a nest egg by saving part of their social security taxes in a personal retirement account .
we should make the social security system a source of ownership for the american people .
and we should limit the burden of government on this economy by acting as good stewards of taxpayer dollars .
in two weeks , i will send you a budget that funds the war , protects the homeland , and meets important domestic needs , while limiting the growth in discretionary spending to less than 4 % .
this will require that congress focus on priorities , cut wasteful spending , and be wise with the people 's money .
by doing so , we can cut the deficit in half over the next five years .
tonight i also ask you to reform our immigration laws , so they reflect our values and benefit our economy .
i propose a new temporary worker programme to match willing foreign workers with willing employers , when no americans can be found to fill the job .
this reform will be good for our economy , because employers will find needed workers in an honest and orderly system .
a temporary worker programme will help protect our homeland , allowing border patrol and law enforcement to focus on true threats to our national security .
i oppose amnesty , because it would encourage further illegal immigration , and unfairly reward those who break our laws .
my temporary worker programe will preserve the citizenship path for those who respect the law , while bringing millions of hardworking men and women out from the shadows of american life .
health our nation 's health care system , like our economy , is also in a time of change .
amazing medical technologies are improving and saving lives .
this dramatic progress has brought its own challenge , in the rising costs of medical care and health insurance .
members of congress , we must work together to help control those costs and extend the benefits of modern medicine throughout our country .
meeting these goals requires bipartisan effort and two months ago , you showed the way .
by strengthening medicare and adding a prescription drug benefit , you kept a basic commitment to our seniors : you are giving them the modern medicine they deserve .
starting this year , under the law you passed , seniors can choose to receive a drug discount card , saving them 10 to 25 % off the retail price of most prescription drugs , and millions of low-income seniors can get an additional $ 600 to buy medicine .
beginning next year , seniors will have new coverage for preventive screenings against diabetes and heart disease , and seniors just entering medicare can receive wellness exams .
in january of 2006 , seniors can get prescription drug coverage under medicare .
for a monthly premium of about $ 35 , most seniors who do not have that coverage today can expect to see their drug bills cut roughly in half .
under this reform , senior citizens will be able to keep their medicare just as it is , or they can choose a medicare plan that fits them best , just as you , as members of congress , can choose an insurance plan that meets your needs .
and starting this year , millions of americans will be able to save money tax-free for their medical expenses , in a health savings account .
i signed this measure proudly , and any attempt to limit the choices of our seniors , or to take away their prescription drug coverage under medicare , will meet my veto .
on the critical issue of health care , our goal is to ensure that americans can choose and afford private health care coverage that best fits their individual needs .
to make insurance more affordable , congress must act to address rapidly rising health care costs .
small businesses should be able to band together and negotiate for lower insurance rates , so they can cover more workers with health insurance .
i urge you to pass association health plans .
i ask you to give lower-income americans a refundable tax credit that would allow millions to buy their own basic health insurance .
by computerising health records , we can avoid dangerous medical mistakes , reduce costs , and improve care .
to protect the doctor-patient relationship , and keep good doctors doing good work , we must eliminate wasteful and frivolous medical lawsuits .
and tonight i propose that individuals who buy catastrophic health care coverage , as part of our new health savings accounts , be allowed to deduct 100 % of the premiums from their taxes .
a government-run health care system is the wrong prescription .
by keeping costs under control , expanding access , and helping more americans afford coverage , we will preserve the system of private medicine that makes america 's health care the best in the world .
drugs and abstinence we are living in a time of great change in our world , in our economy , and in science and medicine .
yet some things endure - courage and compassion , reverence and integrity , respect for differences of faith and race .
the values we try to live by never change .
and they are instilled in us by fundamental institutions , such as families , and schools , and religious congregations .
these institutions , the unseen pillars of civilisation , must remain strong in america , and we will defend them .
we must stand with our families to help them raise healthy , responsible children .
and when it comes to helping children make right choices , there is work for all of us to do .
one of the worst decisions our children can make is to gamble their lives and futures on drugs .
our government is helping parents confront this problem , with aggressive education , treatment , and law enforcement .
drug use in high school has declined by 11 % over the past two years .
four hundred thousand fewer young people are using illegal drugs than in the year 2001 .
in my budget , i have proposed new funding to continue our aggressive , community-based strategy to reduce demand for illegal drugs .
drug testing in our schools has proven to be an effective part of this effort .
so tonight i propose an additional $ 23m dollars for schools that want to use drug testing as a tool to save children 's lives .
the aim here is not to punish children , but to send them this message : we love you , and we do n't want to lose you .
to help children make right choices , they need good examples .
athletics play such an important role in our society , but , unfortunately , some in professional sports are not setting much of an example .
the use of performance-enhancing drugs like steroids in baseball , football , and other sports is dangerous , and it sends the wrong message - that there are shortcuts to accomplishment , and that performance is more important than character .
so tonight i call on team owners , union representatives , coaches , and players to take the lead , to send the right signal , to get tough , and to get rid of steroids now .
to encourage right choices , we must be willing to confront the dangers young people face , even when they are difficult to talk about .
each year , about three million teenagers contract sexually transmitted diseases that can harm them , or kill them , or prevent them from ever becoming parents .
in my budget , i propose a grassroots campaign to help inform families about these medical risks .
we will double federal funding for abstinence programs , so schools can teach this fact of life : abstinence for young people is the only certain way to avoid sexually transmitted diseases .
decisions children make now can affect their health and character for the rest of their lives .
all of us - parents , schools , government - must work together to counter the negative influence of the culture , and to send the right messages to our children .
marriage a strong america must also value the institution of marriage .
i believe we should respect individuals as we take a principled stand for one of the most fundamental , enduring institutions of our civilisation .
congress has already taken a stand on this issue by passing the defense of marriage act , signed in 1996 by president clinton .
that statute protects marriage under federal law as the union of a man and a woman , and declares that one state may not redefine marriage for other states .
activist judges , however , have begun redefining marriage by court order , without regard for the will of the people and their elected representatives .
on an issue of such great consequence , the people 's voice must be heard .
if judges insist on forcing their arbitrary will upon the people , the only alternative left to the people would be the constitutional process .
our nation must defend the sanctity of marriage .
the outcome of this debate is important , and so is the way we conduct it .
the same moral tradition that defines marriage also teaches that each individual has dignity and value in god 's sight .
it is also important to strengthen our communities by unleashing the compassion of america 's religious institutions .
religious charities of every creed are doing some of the most vital work in our country - mentoring children , feeding the hungry , taking the hand of the lonely .
yet government has often denied social service grants and contracts to these groups , just because they have a cross or star of david or crescent on the wall .
by executive order , i have opened billions of dollars in grant money to competition that includes faith-based charities .
tonight i ask you to codify this into law , so people of faith can know that the law will never discriminate against them again .
in the past , we have worked together to bring mentors to the children of prisoners , and provide treatment for the addicted , and help for the homeless .
tonight i ask you to consider another group of americans in need of help .
this year , some 600,000 inmates will be released from prison back into society .
we know from long experience that if they ca n't find work , or a home , or help , they are much more likely to commit more crimes and return to prison .
so tonight , i propose a four-year , $ 300m prisoner re-entry initiative to expand job training and placement services , to provide transitional housing , and to help newly released prisoners get mentoring , including from faith-based groups .
america is the land of the second chance , and when the gates of the prison open , the path ahead should lead to a better life .
' greater power ' for all americans , the last three years have brought tests we did not ask for , and achievements shared by all .
by our actions , we have shown what kind of nation we are .
in grief , we found the grace to go on .
in challenge , we rediscovered the courage and daring of a free people .
in victory , we have shown the noble aims and good heart of america .
and having come this far , we sense that we live in a time set apart .
i have been a witness to the character of the american people , who have shown calm in times of danger , compassion for one another , and toughness for the long haul .
all of us have been partners in a great enterprise .
and even some of the youngest understand that we are living in historic times .
last month a girl in lincoln , rhode island , sent me a letter .
it began : " dear george w bush .
if there is anything you know i , ashley pearson age 10 , can do to help anyone , please send me a letter and tell me what i can do to save our country . "
she added this ps : " if you can send a letter to the troops , please put ' ashley pearson believes in you . '
" tonight , ashley , your message to our troops has just been conveyed .
and yes , you have some duties yourself .
study hard in school , listen to your mom or dad , help someone in need , and when you and your friends see a man or woman in uniform , say : " thank you . "
and while you do your part , all of us here in this great chamber will do our best to keep you and the rest of america safe and free .
my fellow citizens , we now move forward , with confidence and faith .
our nation is strong and steadfast .
the cause we serve is right , because it is the cause of all mankind .
the momentum of freedom in our world is unmistakable and it is not carried forward by our power alone .
we can trust in that greater power who guides the unfolding of the years .
and in all that is to come , we can know that his purposes are just and true .
may god bless the united states of america .
thank you .

here is a full transcript of his speech : mr speaker , vice president cheney , members of congress , distinguished guests , and fellow citizens : america this evening is a nation called to great responsibilities .
and we are rising to meet them .
as we gather tonight , hundreds of thousands of american servicemen and women are deployed across the world in the war on terror .
by bringing hope to the oppressed , and delivering justice to the violent , they are making america more secure .
each day , law enforcement personnel and intelligence officers are tracking terrorist threats ; analysts are examining airline passenger lists ; the men and women of our new homeland security department are patrolling our coasts and borders .
and their vigilance is protecting america .
americans are proving once again to be the hardest working people in the world .
the american economy is growing stronger .
the tax relief you passed is working .
tonight , members of congress can take pride in great works of compassion and reform that sceptics had thought impossible .
you are raising the standards of our public schools ; and you are giving our senior citizens prescription drug coverage under medicare .
we have faced serious challenges together and now we face a choice .
we can go forward with confidence and resolve - or we can turn back to the dangerous illusion that terrorists are not plotting and outlaw regimes are no threat to us .
we can press on with economic growth , and reforms in education and medicare - or we can turn back to the old policies and old divisions .
we have not come all this way - through tragedy , and trial , and war - only to falter and leave our work unfinished .
americans are rising to the tasks of history , and they expect the same of us .
in their efforts , their enterprise , and their character , the american people are showing that the state of our union is confident and strong .
defending america our greatest responsibility is the active defence of the american people .
twenty-eight months have passed since september 11 , 2001 - over two years without an attack on american soil - and it is tempting to believe that the danger is behind us .
that hope is understandable , comforting - and false .
the killing has continued in bali , jakarta , casablanca , riyadh , mombasa , jerusalem , istanbul , and baghdad .
the terrorists continue to plot against america and the civilised world .
and by our will and courage , this danger will be defeated .
inside the united states , where the war began , we must continue to give homeland security and law enforcement personnel every tool they need to defend us .
and one of those essential tools is the patriot act , which allows federal law enforcement to better share information , to track terrorists , to disrupt their cells , and to seize their assets .
for years , we have used similar provisions to catch embezzlers and drug traffickers .
if these methods are good for hunting criminals , they are even more important for hunting terrorists .
key provisions of the patriot act are set to expire next year .
the terrorist threat will not expire on that schedule .
our law enforcement needs this vital legislation to protect our citizens - you need to renew the patriot act .
america is on the offensive against the terrorists who started this war .
last march , khalid sheikh mohammed , a mastermind of september 11th , awoke to find himself in the custody of us and pakistani authorities .
last august 11th brought the capture of the terrorist hambali , who was a key player in the attack in indonesia that killed over 200 people .
we are tracking al-qaeda around the world , and nearly two-thirds of their known leaders have now been captured or killed .
thousands of very skilled and determined military personnel are on a manhunt , going after the remaining killers who hide in cities and caves and , one by one , we will bring the terrorists to justice .
regime change as part of the offensive against terror , we are also confronting the regimes that harbour and support terrorists , and could supply them with nuclear , chemical , or biological weapons .
the united states and our allies are determined : we refuse to live in the shadow of this ultimate danger .
the first to see our determination were the taleban , who made afghanistan the primary training base of al-qaeda killers .
as of this month , that country has a new constitution , guaranteeing free elections and full participation by women .
businesses are opening , health care centres are being established , and the boys and girls of afghanistan are back in school .
with help from the new afghan army , our coalition is leading aggressive raids against surviving members of the taleban and al-qaeda .
the men and women of afghanistan are building a nation that is free , and proud , and fighting terror , and america is honoured to be their friend .
since we last met in this chamber , combat forces of the united states , great britain , australia , poland , and other countries enforced the demands of the united nations , ended the rule of saddam hussein , and the people of iraq are free .
having broken the baathist regime , we face a remnant of violent saddam supporters .
men who ran away from our troops in battle are now dispersed and attack from the shadows .
these killers , joined by foreign terrorists , are a serious , continuing danger .
yet we are making progress against them .
the once all-powerful ruler of iraq was found in a hole , and now sits in a prison cell .
of the top 55 officials of the former regime , we have captured or killed 45 .
our forces are on the offensive , leading over 1,600 patrols a day , and conducting an average of 180 raids every week .
we are dealing with these thugs in iraq , just as surely as we dealt with saddam hussein 's evil regime .
the work of building a new iraq is hard , and it is right .
and america has always been willing to do what it takes for what is right .
last january , iraq 's only law was the whim of one brutal man .
today our coalition is working with the iraqi governing council to draft a basic law , with a bill of rights .
we are working with iraqis and the united nations to prepare for a transition to full iraqi sovereignty by the end of june .
as democracy takes hold in iraq , the enemies of freedom will do all in their power to spread violence and fear .
they are trying to shake the will of our country and our friends , but the united states of america will never be intimidated by thugs and assassins .
the killers will fail , and the iraqi people will live in freedom .
month by month , iraqis are assuming more responsibility for their own security and their own future .
and tonight we are honored to welcome one of iraq 's most respected leaders : the current president of the iraqi governing council , adnan pachachi .
sir , america stands with you and the iraqi people as you build a free and peaceful nation .
because of american leadership and resolve , the world is changing for the better .
last month , the leader of libya voluntarily pledged to disclose and dismantle all of his regime 's weapons of mass destruction programmes , including a uranium enrichment project for nuclear weapons .
colonel gaddaffi correctly judged that his country would be better off , and far more secure , without weapons of mass murder .
nine months of intense negotiations involving the united states and great britain succeeded with libya , while 12 years of diplomacy with iraq did not .
and one reason is clear : for diplomacy to be effective , words must be credible , and no one can now doubt the word of america .
different threats require different strategies .
along with nations in the region , we are insisting that north korea eliminate its nuclear programme .
america and the international community are demanding that iran meet its commitments and not develop nuclear weapons .
america is committed to keeping the world 's most dangerous weapons out of the hands of the world 's most dangerous regimes .
' coalition of nations ' when i came to this rostrum on september 20th , 2001 , i brought the police shield of a fallen officer , my reminder of lives that ended , and a task that does not end .
i gave to you and to all americans my complete commitment to securing our country and defeating our enemies .
and this pledge , given by one , has been kept by many .
you in the congress have provided the resources for our defence , and cast the difficult votes of war and peace .
our closest allies have been unwavering .
america 's intelligence personnel and diplomats have been skilled and tireless .
and the men and women of the american military , they have taken the hardest duty .
we have seen their skill and courage in armoured charges and midnight raids and lonely hours on faithful watch .
we have seen the joy when they return , and felt the sorrow when one is lost .
i have had the honour of meeting our servicemen and women at many posts , from the deck of a carrier in the pacific , to a mess hall in baghdad .
many of our troops are listening tonight .
and i want you and your families to know : america is proud of you .
and my administration , and this congress , will give you the resources you need to fight and win the war on terror .
i know that some people question if america is really in a war at all .
they view terrorism more as a crime , a problem to be solved mainly with law enforcement and indictments .
after the world trade center was first attacked in 1993 , some of the guilty were indicted , tried , convicted , and sent to prison .
but the matter was not settled .
the terrorists were still training and plotting in other nations , and drawing up more ambitious plans .
after the chaos and carnage of september 11th , it is not enough to serve our enemies with legal papers .
the terrorists and their supporters declared war on the united states , and war is what they got .
some in this chamber , and in our country , did not support the liberation of iraq .
objections to war often come from principled motives .
but let us be candid about the consequences of leaving saddam hussein in power .
we are seeking all the facts - already the kay report identified dozens of weapons of mass destruction-related programme activities and significant amounts of equipment that iraq concealed from the united nations .
had we failed to act , the dictator 's weapons of mass destruction programmes would continue to this day .
had we failed to act , security council resolutions on iraq would have been revealed as empty threats , weakening the united nations and encouraging defiance by dictators around the world .
iraq 's torture chambers would still be filled with victims , terrified and innocent .
the killing fields of iraq , where hundreds of thousands of men , women , and children vanished into the sands , would still be known only to the killers .
for all who love freedom and peace , the world without saddam hussein 's regime is a better and safer place .
some critics have said our duties in iraq must be internationalised .
this particular criticism is hard to explain to our partners in britain , australia , japan , south korea , the philippines , thailand , italy , spain , poland , denmark , hungary , bulgaria , ukraine , romania , the netherlands , norway , el salvador , and the 17 other countries that have committed troops to iraq .
as we debate at home , we must never ignore the vital contributions of our international partners , or dismiss their sacrifices .
from the beginning , america has sought international support for operations in afghanistan and iraq , and we have gained much support .
there is a difference , however , between leading a coalition of many nations , and submitting to the objections of a few .
america will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our country .
middle east democracy we also hear doubts that democracy is a realistic goal for the greater middle east , where freedom is rare .
yet it is mistaken , and condescending , to assume that whole cultures and great religions are incompatible with liberty and self-government .
i believe that god has planted in every human heart the desire to live in freedom .
and even when that desire is crushed by tyranny for decades , it will rise again .
as long as the middle east remains a place of tyranny , despair , and anger , it will continue to produce men and movements that threaten the safety of america and our friends .
so america is pursuing a forward strategy of freedom in the greater middle east .
we will challenge the enemies of reform , confront the allies of terror , and expect a higher standard from our friends .
to cut through the barriers of hateful propaganda , the voice of america and other broadcast services are expanding their programming in arabic and persian and soon , a new television service will begin providing reliable news and information across the region .
i will send you a proposal to double the budget of the national endowment for democracy , and to focus its new work on the development of free elections , free markets , free press , and free labour unions in the middle east .
and above all , we will finish the historic work of democracy in afghanistan and iraq , so those nations can light the way for others , and help transform a troubled part of the world .
america is a nation with a mission , and that mission comes from our most basic beliefs .
we have no desire to dominate , no ambitions of empire .
our aim is a democratic peace , a peace founded upon the dignity and rights of every man and woman .
america acts in this cause with friends and allies at our side , yet we understand our special calling : this great republic will lead the cause of freedom .
economy in these last three years , adversity has also revealed the fundamental strengths of the american economy .
we have come through recession and terrorist attack and corporate scandals , and the uncertainties of war .
and because you acted to stimulate our economy with tax relief , this economy is strong , and growing stronger .
you have doubled the child tax credit from $ 500 to $ 1,000 , reduced the marriage penalty , begun to phase out the death tax , reduced taxes on capital gains and stock dividends , cut taxes on small businesses , and you have lowered taxes for every american who pays income taxes .
americans took those dollars and put them to work , driving this economy forward .
the pace of economic growth in the third quarter of 2003 was the fastest in nearly 20 years .
new home construction , the highest in almost 20 years .
home ownership rates the highest ever .
manufacturing activity is increasing .
inflation is low .
interest rates are low .
exports are growing .
productivity is high .
and jobs are on the rise .
these numbers confirm that the american people are using their money far better than government would have , and you were right to return it .
america 's growing economy is also a changing economy .
as technology transforms the way almost every job is done , america becomes more productive , and workers need new skills .
much of our job growth will be found in high-skilled fields like health care and biotechnology .
so we must respond by helping more americans gain the skills to find good jobs in our new economy .
education all skills begin with the basics of reading and math , which are supposed to be learned in the early grades of our schools .
yet for too long , for too many children , those skills were never mastered .
by passing the no child left behind act , you have made the expectation of literacy the law of our country .
we are providing more funding for our schools , a 36 % increase since 2001 .
we are requiring higher standards .
we are regularly testing every child on the fundamentals .
we are reporting results to parents , and making sure they have better options when schools are not performing .
we are making progress toward excellence for every child .
but the status quo always has defenders .
some want to undermine the no child left behind act by weakening standards and accountability .
yet the results we require are really a matter of common sense : we expect third graders to read and do math at third grade level , and that is not asking too much .
testing is the only way to identify and help students who are falling behind .
this nation will not go back to the days of simply shuffling children along from grade to grade without them learning the basics .
i refuse to give up on any child , and the no child left behind act is opening the door of opportunity to all of america 's children .
at the same time , we must ensure that older students and adults can gain the skills they need to find work now .
many of the fastest-growing occupations require strong math and science preparation , and training beyond the high school level .
so tonight i propose a series of measures called jobs for the 21st century .
this programme will provide extra help to middle- and high school students who fall behind in reading and math , expand advanced placement programmes in low-income schools , and invite math and science professionals from the private sector to teach part-time in our high schools .
i propose larger pell grants for students who prepare for college with demanding courses in high school .
i propose increasing our support for america 's fine community colleges , so they can train workers for the industries that are creating the most new jobs .
by all these actions , we will help more and more americans to join in the growing prosperity of our country .
job training is important , and so is job creation .
we must continue to pursue an aggressive , pro-growth economic agenda .
tax cuts congress has some unfinished business on the issue of taxes .
the tax reductions you passed are set to expire .
unless you act , the unfair tax on marriage will go back up .
unless you act , millions of families will be charged $ 300 more in federal taxes for every child .
unless you act , small businesses will pay higher taxes .
unless you act , the death tax will eventually come back to life .
unless you act , americans face a tax increase .
what the congress has given , the congress should not take away : for the sake of job growth , the tax cuts you passed should be permanent .
our agenda for jobs and growth must help small business owners and employees with relief from needless federal regulation , and protect them from junk and frivolous lawsuits .
consumers and businesses need reliable supplies of energy to make our economy run , so i urge you to pass legislation to modernise our electricity system , promote conservation , and make america less dependent on foreign sources of energy .
my administration is promoting free and fair trade , to open up new markets for america 's entrepreneurs , and manufacturers , and farmers , and to create jobs for america 's workers .
younger workers should have the opportunity to build a nest egg by saving part of their social security taxes in a personal retirement account .
we should make the social security system a source of ownership for the american people .
and we should limit the burden of government on this economy by acting as good stewards of taxpayer dollars .
in two weeks , i will send you a budget that funds the war , protects the homeland , and meets important domestic needs , while limiting the growth in discretionary spending to less than 4 % .
this will require that congress focus on priorities , cut wasteful spending , and be wise with the people 's money .
by doing so , we can cut the deficit in half over the next five years .
tonight i also ask you to reform our immigration laws , so they reflect our values and benefit our economy .
i propose a new temporary worker programme to match willing foreign workers with willing employers , when no americans can be found to fill the job .
this reform will be good for our economy , because employers will find needed workers in an honest and orderly system .
a temporary worker programme will help protect our homeland , allowing border patrol and law enforcement to focus on true threats to our national security .
i oppose amnesty , because it would encourage further illegal immigration , and unfairly reward those who break our laws .
my temporary worker programe will preserve the citizenship path for those who respect the law , while bringing millions of hardworking men and women out from the shadows of american life .
health our nation 's health care system , like our economy , is also in a time of change .
amazing medical technologies are improving and saving lives .
this dramatic progress has brought its own challenge , in the rising costs of medical care and health insurance .
members of congress , we must work together to help control those costs and extend the benefits of modern medicine throughout our country .
meeting these goals requires bipartisan effort and two months ago , you showed the way .
by strengthening medicare and adding a prescription drug benefit , you kept a basic commitment to our seniors : you are giving them the modern medicine they deserve .
starting this year , under the law you passed , seniors can choose to receive a drug discount card , saving them 10 to 25 % off the retail price of most prescription drugs , and millions of low-income seniors can get an additional $ 600 to buy medicine .
beginning next year , seniors will have new coverage for preventive screenings against diabetes and heart disease , and seniors just entering medicare can receive wellness exams .
in january of 2006 , seniors can get prescription drug coverage under medicare .
for a monthly premium of about $ 35 , most seniors who do not have that coverage today can expect to see their drug bills cut roughly in half .
under this reform , senior citizens will be able to keep their medicare just as it is , or they can choose a medicare plan that fits them best , just as you , as members of congress , can choose an insurance plan that meets your needs .
and starting this year , millions of americans will be able to save money tax-free for their medical expenses , in a health savings account .
i signed this measure proudly , and any attempt to limit the choices of our seniors , or to take away their prescription drug coverage under medicare , will meet my veto .
on the critical issue of health care , our goal is to ensure that americans can choose and afford private health care coverage that best fits their individual needs .
to make insurance more affordable , congress must act to address rapidly rising health care costs .
small businesses should be able to band together and negotiate for lower insurance rates , so they can cover more workers with health insurance .
i urge you to pass association health plans .
i ask you to give lower-income americans a refundable tax credit that would allow millions to buy their own basic health insurance .
by computerising health records , we can avoid dangerous medical mistakes , reduce costs , and improve care .
to protect the doctor-patient relationship , and keep good doctors doing good work , we must eliminate wasteful and frivolous medical lawsuits .
and tonight i propose that individuals who buy catastrophic health care coverage , as part of our new health savings accounts , be allowed to deduct 100 % of the premiums from their taxes .
a government-run health care system is the wrong prescription .
by keeping costs under control , expanding access , and helping more americans afford coverage , we will preserve the system of private medicine that makes america 's health care the best in the world .
drugs and abstinence we are living in a time of great change in our world , in our economy , and in science and medicine .
yet some things endure - courage and compassion , reverence and integrity , respect for differences of faith and race .
the values we try to live by never change .
and they are instilled in us by fundamental institutions , such as families , and schools , and religious congregations .
these institutions , the unseen pillars of civilisation , must remain strong in america , and we will defend them .
we must stand with our families to help them raise healthy , responsible children .
and when it comes to helping children make right choices , there is work for all of us to do .
one of the worst decisions our children can make is to gamble their lives and futures on drugs .
our government is helping parents confront this problem , with aggressive education , treatment , and law enforcement .
drug use in high school has declined by 11 % over the past two years .
four hundred thousand fewer young people are using illegal drugs than in the year 2001 .
in my budget , i have proposed new funding to continue our aggressive , community-based strategy to reduce demand for illegal drugs .
drug testing in our schools has proven to be an effective part of this effort .
so tonight i propose an additional $ 23m dollars for schools that want to use drug testing as a tool to save children 's lives .
the aim here is not to punish children , but to send them this message : we love you , and we do n't want to lose you .
to help children make right choices , they need good examples .
athletics play such an important role in our society , but , unfortunately , some in professional sports are not setting much of an example .
the use of performance-enhancing drugs like steroids in baseball , football , and other sports is dangerous , and it sends the wrong message - that there are shortcuts to accomplishment , and that performance is more important than character .
so tonight i call on team owners , union representatives , coaches , and players to take the lead , to send the right signal , to get tough , and to get rid of steroids now .
to encourage right choices , we must be willing to confront the dangers young people face , even when they are difficult to talk about .
each year , about three million teenagers contract sexually transmitted diseases that can harm them , or kill them , or prevent them from ever becoming parents .
in my budget , i propose a grassroots campaign to help inform families about these medical risks .
we will double federal funding for abstinence programs , so schools can teach this fact of life : abstinence for young people is the only certain way to avoid sexually transmitted diseases .
decisions children make now can affect their health and character for the rest of their lives .
all of us - parents , schools , government - must work together to counter the negative influence of the culture , and to send the right messages to our children .
marriage a strong america must also value the institution of marriage .
i believe we should respect individuals as we take a principled stand for one of the most fundamental , enduring institutions of our civilisation .
congress has already taken a stand on this issue by passing the defense of marriage act , signed in 1996 by president clinton .
that statute protects marriage under federal law as the union of a man and a woman , and declares that one state may not redefine marriage for other states .
activist judges , however , have begun redefining marriage by court order , without regard for the will of the people and their elected representatives .
on an issue of such great consequence , the people 's voice must be heard .
if judges insist on forcing their arbitrary will upon the people , the only alternative left to the people would be the constitutional process .
our nation must defend the sanctity of marriage .
the outcome of this debate is important , and so is the way we conduct it .
the same moral tradition that defines marriage also teaches that each individual has dignity and value in god 's sight .
it is also important to strengthen our communities by unleashing the compassion of america 's religious institutions .
religious charities of every creed are doing some of the most vital work in our country - mentoring children , feeding the hungry , taking the hand of the lonely .
yet government has often denied social service grants and contracts to these groups , just because they have a cross or star of david or crescent on the wall .
by executive order , i have opened billions of dollars in grant money to competition that includes faith-based charities .
tonight i ask you to codify this into law , so people of faith can know that the law will never discriminate against them again .
in the past , we have worked together to bring mentors to the children of prisoners , and provide treatment for the addicted , and help for the homeless .
tonight i ask you to consider another group of americans in need of help .
this year , some 600,000 inmates will be released from prison back into society .
we know from long experience that if they ca n't find work , or a home , or help , they are much more likely to commit more crimes and return to prison .
so tonight , i propose a four-year , $ 300m prisoner re-entry initiative to expand job training and placement services , to provide transitional housing , and to help newly released prisoners get mentoring , including from faith-based groups .
america is the land of the second chance , and when the gates of the prison open , the path ahead should lead to a better life .
' greater power ' for all americans , the last three years have brought tests we did not ask for , and achievements shared by all .
by our actions , we have shown what kind of nation we are .
in grief , we found the grace to go on .
in challenge , we rediscovered the courage and daring of a free people .
in victory , we have shown the noble aims and good heart of america .
and having come this far , we sense that we live in a time set apart .
i have been a witness to the character of the american people , who have shown calm in times of danger , compassion for one another , and toughness for the long haul .
all of us have been partners in a great enterprise .
and even some of the youngest understand that we are living in historic times .
last month a girl in lincoln , rhode island , sent me a letter .
it began : " dear george w bush .
if there is anything you know i , ashley pearson age 10 , can do to help anyone , please send me a letter and tell me what i can do to save our country . "
she added this ps : " if you can send a letter to the troops , please put ' ashley pearson believes in you . '
" tonight , ashley , your message to our troops has just been conveyed .
and yes , you have some duties yourself .
study hard in school , listen to your mom or dad , help someone in need , and when you and your friends see a man or woman in uniform , say : " thank you . "
and while you do your part , all of us here in this great chamber will do our best to keep you and the rest of america safe and free .
my fellow citizens , we now move forward , with confidence and faith .
our nation is strong and steadfast .
the cause we serve is right , because it is the cause of all mankind .
the momentum of freedom in our world is unmistakable and it is not carried forward by our power alone .
we can trust in that greater power who guides the unfolding of the years .
and in all that is to come , we can know that his purposes are just and true .
may god bless the united states of america .
thank you .

here is a full transcript of his speech : mr speaker , vice president cheney , members of congress , distinguished guests , and fellow citizens : america this evening is a nation called to great responsibilities .
and we are rising to meet them .
as we gather tonight , hundreds of thousands of american servicemen and women are deployed across the world in the war on terror .
by bringing hope to the oppressed , and delivering justice to the violent , they are making america more secure .
each day , law enforcement personnel and intelligence officers are tracking terrorist threats ; analysts are examining airline passenger lists ; the men and women of our new homeland security department are patrolling our coasts and borders .
and their vigilance is protecting america .
americans are proving once again to be the hardest working people in the world .
the american economy is growing stronger .
the tax relief you passed is working .
tonight , members of congress can take pride in great works of compassion and reform that sceptics had thought impossible .
you are raising the standards of our public schools ; and you are giving our senior citizens prescription drug coverage under medicare .
we have faced serious challenges together and now we face a choice .
we can go forward with confidence and resolve - or we can turn back to the dangerous illusion that terrorists are not plotting and outlaw regimes are no threat to us .
we can press on with economic growth , and reforms in education and medicare - or we can turn back to the old policies and old divisions .
we have not come all this way - through tragedy , and trial , and war - only to falter and leave our work unfinished .
americans are rising to the tasks of history , and they expect the same of us .
in their efforts , their enterprise , and their character , the american people are showing that the state of our union is confident and strong .
defending america our greatest responsibility is the active defence of the american people .
twenty-eight months have passed since september 11 , 2001 - over two years without an attack on american soil - and it is tempting to believe that the danger is behind us .
that hope is understandable , comforting - and false .
the killing has continued in bali , jakarta , casablanca , riyadh , mombasa , jerusalem , istanbul , and baghdad .
the terrorists continue to plot against america and the civilised world .
and by our will and courage , this danger will be defeated .
inside the united states , where the war began , we must continue to give homeland security and law enforcement personnel every tool they need to defend us .
and one of those essential tools is the patriot act , which allows federal law enforcement to better share information , to track terrorists , to disrupt their cells , and to seize their assets .
for years , we have used similar provisions to catch embezzlers and drug traffickers .
if these methods are good for hunting criminals , they are even more important for hunting terrorists .
key provisions of the patriot act are set to expire next year .
the terrorist threat will not expire on that schedule .
our law enforcement needs this vital legislation to protect our citizens - you need to renew the patriot act .
america is on the offensive against the terrorists who started this war .
last march , khalid sheikh mohammed , a mastermind of september 11th , awoke to find himself in the custody of us and pakistani authorities .
last august 11th brought the capture of the terrorist hambali , who was a key player in the attack in indonesia that killed over 200 people .
we are tracking al-qaeda around the world , and nearly two-thirds of their known leaders have now been captured or killed .
thousands of very skilled and determined military personnel are on a manhunt , going after the remaining killers who hide in cities and caves and , one by one , we will bring the terrorists to justice .
regime change as part of the offensive against terror , we are also confronting the regimes that harbour and support terrorists , and could supply them with nuclear , chemical , or biological weapons .
the united states and our allies are determined : we refuse to live in the shadow of this ultimate danger .
the first to see our determination were the taleban , who made afghanistan the primary training base of al-qaeda killers .
as of this month , that country has a new constitution , guaranteeing free elections and full participation by women .
businesses are opening , health care centres are being established , and the boys and girls of afghanistan are back in school .
with help from the new afghan army , our coalition is leading aggressive raids against surviving members of the taleban and al-qaeda .
the men and women of afghanistan are building a nation that is free , and proud , and fighting terror , and america is honoured to be their friend .
since we last met in this chamber , combat forces of the united states , great britain , australia , poland , and other countries enforced the demands of the united nations , ended the rule of saddam hussein , and the people of iraq are free .
having broken the baathist regime , we face a remnant of violent saddam supporters .
men who ran away from our troops in battle are now dispersed and attack from the shadows .
these killers , joined by foreign terrorists , are a serious , continuing danger .
yet we are making progress against them .
the once all-powerful ruler of iraq was found in a hole , and now sits in a prison cell .
of the top 55 officials of the former regime , we have captured or killed 45 .
our forces are on the offensive , leading over 1,600 patrols a day , and conducting an average of 180 raids every week .
we are dealing with these thugs in iraq , just as surely as we dealt with saddam hussein 's evil regime .
the work of building a new iraq is hard , and it is right .
and america has always been willing to do what it takes for what is right .
last january , iraq 's only law was the whim of one brutal man .
today our coalition is working with the iraqi governing council to draft a basic law , with a bill of rights .
we are working with iraqis and the united nations to prepare for a transition to full iraqi sovereignty by the end of june .
as democracy takes hold in iraq , the enemies of freedom will do all in their power to spread violence and fear .
they are trying to shake the will of our country and our friends , but the united states of america will never be intimidated by thugs and assassins .
the killers will fail , and the iraqi people will live in freedom .
month by month , iraqis are assuming more responsibility for their own security and their own future .
and tonight we are honored to welcome one of iraq 's most respected leaders : the current president of the iraqi governing council , adnan pachachi .
sir , america stands with you and the iraqi people as you build a free and peaceful nation .
because of american leadership and resolve , the world is changing for the better .
last month , the leader of libya voluntarily pledged to disclose and dismantle all of his regime 's weapons of mass destruction programmes , including a uranium enrichment project for nuclear weapons .
colonel gaddaffi correctly judged that his country would be better off , and far more secure , without weapons of mass murder .
nine months of intense negotiations involving the united states and great britain succeeded with libya , while 12 years of diplomacy with iraq did not .
and one reason is clear : for diplomacy to be effective , words must be credible , and no one can now doubt the word of america .
different threats require different strategies .
along with nations in the region , we are insisting that north korea eliminate its nuclear programme .
america and the international community are demanding that iran meet its commitments and not develop nuclear weapons .
america is committed to keeping the world 's most dangerous weapons out of the hands of the world 's most dangerous regimes .
' coalition of nations ' when i came to this rostrum on september 20th , 2001 , i brought the police shield of a fallen officer , my reminder of lives that ended , and a task that does not end .
i gave to you and to all americans my complete commitment to securing our country and defeating our enemies .
and this pledge , given by one , has been kept by many .
you in the congress have provided the resources for our defence , and cast the difficult votes of war and peace .
our closest allies have been unwavering .
america 's intelligence personnel and diplomats have been skilled and tireless .
and the men and women of the american military , they have taken the hardest duty .
we have seen their skill and courage in armoured charges and midnight raids and lonely hours on faithful watch .
we have seen the joy when they return , and felt the sorrow when one is lost .
i have had the honour of meeting our servicemen and women at many posts , from the deck of a carrier in the pacific , to a mess hall in baghdad .
many of our troops are listening tonight .
and i want you and your families to know : america is proud of you .
and my administration , and this congress , will give you the resources you need to fight and win the war on terror .
i know that some people question if america is really in a war at all .
they view terrorism more as a crime , a problem to be solved mainly with law enforcement and indictments .
after the world trade center was first attacked in 1993 , some of the guilty were indicted , tried , convicted , and sent to prison .
but the matter was not settled .
the terrorists were still training and plotting in other nations , and drawing up more ambitious plans .
after the chaos and carnage of september 11th , it is not enough to serve our enemies with legal papers .
the terrorists and their supporters declared war on the united states , and war is what they got .
some in this chamber , and in our country , did not support the liberation of iraq .
objections to war often come from principled motives .
but let us be candid about the consequences of leaving saddam hussein in power .
we are seeking all the facts - already the kay report identified dozens of weapons of mass destruction-related programme activities and significant amounts of equipment that iraq concealed from the united nations .
had we failed to act , the dictator 's weapons of mass destruction programmes would continue to this day .
had we failed to act , security council resolutions on iraq would have been revealed as empty threats , weakening the united nations and encouraging defiance by dictators around the world .
iraq 's torture chambers would still be filled with victims , terrified and innocent .
the killing fields of iraq , where hundreds of thousands of men , women , and children vanished into the sands , would still be known only to the killers .
for all who love freedom and peace , the world without saddam hussein 's regime is a better and safer place .
some critics have said our duties in iraq must be internationalised .
this particular criticism is hard to explain to our partners in britain , australia , japan , south korea , the philippines , thailand , italy , spain , poland , denmark , hungary , bulgaria , ukraine , romania , the netherlands , norway , el salvador , and the 17 other countries that have committed troops to iraq .
as we debate at home , we must never ignore the vital contributions of our international partners , or dismiss their sacrifices .
from the beginning , america has sought international support for operations in afghanistan and iraq , and we have gained much support .
there is a difference , however , between leading a coalition of many nations , and submitting to the objections of a few .
america will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our country .
middle east democracy we also hear doubts that democracy is a realistic goal for the greater middle east , where freedom is rare .
yet it is mistaken , and condescending , to assume that whole cultures and great religions are incompatible with liberty and self-government .
i believe that god has planted in every human heart the desire to live in freedom .
and even when that desire is crushed by tyranny for decades , it will rise again .
as long as the middle east remains a place of tyranny , despair , and anger , it will continue to produce men and movements that threaten the safety of america and our friends .
so america is pursuing a forward strategy of freedom in the greater middle east .
we will challenge the enemies of reform , confront the allies of terror , and expect a higher standard from our friends .
to cut through the barriers of hateful propaganda , the voice of america and other broadcast services are expanding their programming in arabic and persian and soon , a new television service will begin providing reliable news and information across the region .
i will send you a proposal to double the budget of the national endowment for democracy , and to focus its new work on the development of free elections , free markets , free press , and free labour unions in the middle east .
and above all , we will finish the historic work of democracy in afghanistan and iraq , so those nations can light the way for others , and help transform a troubled part of the world .
america is a nation with a mission , and that mission comes from our most basic beliefs .
we have no desire to dominate , no ambitions of empire .
our aim is a democratic peace , a peace founded upon the dignity and rights of every man and woman .
america acts in this cause with friends and allies at our side , yet we understand our special calling : this great republic will lead the cause of freedom .
economy in these last three years , adversity has also revealed the fundamental strengths of the american economy .
we have come through recession and terrorist attack and corporate scandals , and the uncertainties of war .
and because you acted to stimulate our economy with tax relief , this economy is strong , and growing stronger .
you have doubled the child tax credit from $ 500 to $ 1,000 , reduced the marriage penalty , begun to phase out the death tax , reduced taxes on capital gains and stock dividends , cut taxes on small businesses , and you have lowered taxes for every american who pays income taxes .
americans took those dollars and put them to work , driving this economy forward .
the pace of economic growth in the third quarter of 2003 was the fastest in nearly 20 years .
new home construction , the highest in almost 20 years .
home ownership rates the highest ever .
manufacturing activity is increasing .
inflation is low .
interest rates are low .
exports are growing .
productivity is high .
and jobs are on the rise .
these numbers confirm that the american people are using their money far better than government would have , and you were right to return it .
america 's growing economy is also a changing economy .
as technology transforms the way almost every job is done , america becomes more productive , and workers need new skills .
much of our job growth will be found in high-skilled fields like health care and biotechnology .
so we must respond by helping more americans gain the skills to find good jobs in our new economy .
education all skills begin with the basics of reading and math , which are supposed to be learned in the early grades of our schools .
yet for too long , for too many children , those skills were never mastered .
by passing the no child left behind act , you have made the expectation of literacy the law of our country .
we are providing more funding for our schools , a 36 % increase since 2001 .
we are requiring higher standards .
we are regularly testing every child on the fundamentals .
we are reporting results to parents , and making sure they have better options when schools are not performing .
we are making progress toward excellence for every child .
but the status quo always has defenders .
some want to undermine the no child left behind act by weakening standards and accountability .
yet the results we require are really a matter of common sense : we expect third graders to read and do math at third grade level , and that is not asking too much .
testing is the only way to identify and help students who are falling behind .
this nation will not go back to the days of simply shuffling children along from grade to grade without them learning the basics .
i refuse to give up on any child , and the no child left behind act is opening the door of opportunity to all of america 's children .
at the same time , we must ensure that older students and adults can gain the skills they need to find work now .
many of the fastest-growing occupations require strong math and science preparation , and training beyond the high school level .
so tonight i propose a series of measures called jobs for the 21st century .
this programme will provide extra help to middle- and high school students who fall behind in reading and math , expand advanced placement programmes in low-income schools , and invite math and science professionals from the private sector to teach part-time in our high schools .
i propose larger pell grants for students who prepare for college with demanding courses in high school .
i propose increasing our support for america 's fine community colleges , so they can train workers for the industries that are creating the most new jobs .
by all these actions , we will help more and more americans to join in the growing prosperity of our country .
job training is important , and so is job creation .
we must continue to pursue an aggressive , pro-growth economic agenda .
tax cuts congress has some unfinished business on the issue of taxes .
the tax reductions you passed are set to expire .
unless you act , the unfair tax on marriage will go back up .
unless you act , millions of families will be charged $ 300 more in federal taxes for every child .
unless you act , small businesses will pay higher taxes .
unless you act , the death tax will eventually come back to life .
unless you act , americans face a tax increase .
what the congress has given , the congress should not take away : for the sake of job growth , the tax cuts you passed should be permanent .
our agenda for jobs and growth must help small business owners and employees with relief from needless federal regulation , and protect them from junk and frivolous lawsuits .
consumers and businesses need reliable supplies of energy to make our economy run , so i urge you to pass legislation to modernise our electricity system , promote conservation , and make america less dependent on foreign sources of energy .
my administration is promoting free and fair trade , to open up new markets for america 's entrepreneurs , and manufacturers , and farmers , and to create jobs for america 's workers .
younger workers should have the opportunity to build a nest egg by saving part of their social security taxes in a personal retirement account .
we should make the social security system a source of ownership for the american people .
and we should limit the burden of government on this economy by acting as good stewards of taxpayer dollars .
in two weeks , i will send you a budget that funds the war , protects the homeland , and meets important domestic needs , while limiting the growth in discretionary spending to less than 4 % .
this will require that congress focus on priorities , cut wasteful spending , and be wise with the people 's money .
by doing so , we can cut the deficit in half over the next five years .
tonight i also ask you to reform our immigration laws , so they reflect our values and benefit our economy .
i propose a new temporary worker programme to match willing foreign workers with willing employers , when no americans can be found to fill the job .
this reform will be good for our economy , because employers will find needed workers in an honest and orderly system .
a temporary worker programme will help protect our homeland , allowing border patrol and law enforcement to focus on true threats to our national security .
i oppose amnesty , because it would encourage further illegal immigration , and unfairly reward those who break our laws .
my temporary worker programe will preserve the citizenship path for those who respect the law , while bringing millions of hardworking men and women out from the shadows of american life .
health our nation 's health care system , like our economy , is also in a time of change .
amazing medical technologies are improving and saving lives .
this dramatic progress has brought its own challenge , in the rising costs of medical care and health insurance .
members of congress , we must work together to help control those costs and extend the benefits of modern medicine throughout our country .
meeting these goals requires bipartisan effort and two months ago , you showed the way .
by strengthening medicare and adding a prescription drug benefit , you kept a basic commitment to our seniors : you are giving them the modern medicine they deserve .
starting this year , under the law you passed , seniors can choose to receive a drug discount card , saving them 10 to 25 % off the retail price of most prescription drugs , and millions of low-income seniors can get an additional $ 600 to buy medicine .
beginning next year , seniors will have new coverage for preventive screenings against diabetes and heart disease , and seniors just entering medicare can receive wellness exams .
in january of 2006 , seniors can get prescription drug coverage under medicare .
for a monthly premium of about $ 35 , most seniors who do not have that coverage today can expect to see their drug bills cut roughly in half .
under this reform , senior citizens will be able to keep their medicare just as it is , or they can choose a medicare plan that fits them best , just as you , as members of congress , can choose an insurance plan that meets your needs .
and starting this year , millions of americans will be able to save money tax-free for their medical expenses , in a health savings account .
i signed this measure proudly , and any attempt to limit the choices of our seniors , or to take away their prescription drug coverage under medicare , will meet my veto .
on the critical issue of health care , our goal is to ensure that americans can choose and afford private health care coverage that best fits their individual needs .
to make insurance more affordable , congress must act to address rapidly rising health care costs .
small businesses should be able to band together and negotiate for lower insurance rates , so they can cover more workers with health insurance .
i urge you to pass association health plans .
i ask you to give lower-income americans a refundable tax credit that would allow millions to buy their own basic health insurance .
by computerising health records , we can avoid dangerous medical mistakes , reduce costs , and improve care .
to protect the doctor-patient relationship , and keep good doctors doing good work , we must eliminate wasteful and frivolous medical lawsuits .
and tonight i propose that individuals who buy catastrophic health care coverage , as part of our new health savings accounts , be allowed to deduct 100 % of the premiums from their taxes .
a government-run health care system is the wrong prescription .
by keeping costs under control , expanding access , and helping more americans afford coverage , we will preserve the system of private medicine that makes america 's health care the best in the world .
drugs and abstinence we are living in a time of great change in our world , in our economy , and in science and medicine .
yet some things endure - courage and compassion , reverence and integrity , respect for differences of faith and race .
the values we try to live by never change .
and they are instilled in us by fundamental institutions , such as families , and schools , and religious congregations .
these institutions , the unseen pillars of civilisation , must remain strong in america , and we will defend them .
we must stand with our families to help them raise healthy , responsible children .
and when it comes to helping children make right choices , there is work for all of us to do .
one of the worst decisions our children can make is to gamble their lives and futures on drugs .
our government is helping parents confront this problem , with aggressive education , treatment , and law enforcement .
drug use in high school has declined by 11 % over the past two years .
four hundred thousand fewer young people are using illegal drugs than in the year 2001 .
in my budget , i have proposed new funding to continue our aggressive , community-based strategy to reduce demand for illegal drugs .
drug testing in our schools has proven to be an effective part of this effort .
so tonight i propose an additional $ 23m dollars for schools that want to use drug testing as a tool to save children 's lives .
the aim here is not to punish children , but to send them this message : we love you , and we do n't want to lose you .
to help children make right choices , they need good examples .
athletics play such an important role in our society , but , unfortunately , some in professional sports are not setting much of an example .
the use of performance-enhancing drugs like steroids in baseball , football , and other sports is dangerous , and it sends the wrong message - that there are shortcuts to accomplishment , and that performance is more important than character .
so tonight i call on team owners , union representatives , coaches , and players to take the lead , to send the right signal , to get tough , and to get rid of steroids now .
to encourage right choices , we must be willing to confront the dangers young people face , even when they are difficult to talk about .
each year , about three million teenagers contract sexually transmitted diseases that can harm them , or kill them , or prevent them from ever becoming parents .
in my budget , i propose a grassroots campaign to help inform families about these medical risks .
we will double federal funding for abstinence programs , so schools can teach this fact of life : abstinence for young people is the only certain way to avoid sexually transmitted diseases .
decisions children make now can affect their health and character for the rest of their lives .
all of us - parents , schools , government - must work together to counter the negative influence of the culture , and to send the right messages to our children .
marriage a strong america must also value the institution of marriage .
i believe we should respect individuals as we take a principled stand for one of the most fundamental , enduring institutions of our civilisation .
congress has already taken a stand on this issue by passing the defense of marriage act , signed in 1996 by president clinton .
that statute protects marriage under federal law as the union of a man and a woman , and declares that one state may not redefine marriage for other states .
activist judges , however , have begun redefining marriage by court order , without regard for the will of the people and their elected representatives .
on an issue of such great consequence , the people 's voice must be heard .
if judges insist on forcing their arbitrary will upon the people , the only alternative left to the people would be the constitutional process .
our nation must defend the sanctity of marriage .
the outcome of this debate is important , and so is the way we conduct it .
the same moral tradition that defines marriage also teaches that each individual has dignity and value in god 's sight .
it is also important to strengthen our communities by unleashing the compassion of america 's religious institutions .
religious charities of every creed are doing some of the most vital work in our country - mentoring children , feeding the hungry , taking the hand of the lonely .
yet government has often denied social service grants and contracts to these groups , just because they have a cross or star of david or crescent on the wall .
by executive order , i have opened billions of dollars in grant money to competition that includes faith-based charities .
tonight i ask you to codify this into law , so people of faith can know that the law will never discriminate against them again .
in the past , we have worked together to bring mentors to the children of prisoners , and provide treatment for the addicted , and help for the homeless .
tonight i ask you to consider another group of americans in need of help .
this year , some 600,000 inmates will be released from prison back into society .
we know from long experience that if they ca n't find work , or a home , or help , they are much more likely to commit more crimes and return to prison .
so tonight , i propose a four-year , $ 300m prisoner re-entry initiative to expand job training and placement services , to provide transitional housing , and to help newly released prisoners get mentoring , including from faith-based groups .
america is the land of the second chance , and when the gates of the prison open , the path ahead should lead to a better life .
' greater power ' for all americans , the last three years have brought tests we did not ask for , and achievements shared by all .
by our actions , we have shown what kind of nation we are .
in grief , we found the grace to go on .
in challenge , we rediscovered the courage and daring of a free people .
in victory , we have shown the noble aims and good heart of america .
and having come this far , we sense that we live in a time set apart .
i have been a witness to the character of the american people , who have shown calm in times of danger , compassion for one another , and toughness for the long haul .
all of us have been partners in a great enterprise .
and even some of the youngest understand that we are living in historic times .
last month a girl in lincoln , rhode island , sent me a letter .
it began : " dear george w bush .
if there is anything you know i , ashley pearson age 10 , can do to help anyone , please send me a letter and tell me what i can do to save our country . "
she added this ps : " if you can send a letter to the troops , please put ' ashley pearson believes in you . '
" tonight , ashley , your message to our troops has just been conveyed .
and yes , you have some duties yourself .
study hard in school , listen to your mom or dad , help someone in need , and when you and your friends see a man or woman in uniform , say : " thank you . "
and while you do your part , all of us here in this great chamber will do our best to keep you and the rest of america safe and free .
my fellow citizens , we now move forward , with confidence and faith .
our nation is strong and steadfast .
the cause we serve is right , because it is the cause of all mankind .
the momentum of freedom in our world is unmistakable and it is not carried forward by our power alone .
we can trust in that greater power who guides the unfolding of the years .
and in all that is to come , we can know that his purposes are just and true .
may god bless the united states of america .
thank you .

government inspector susan traynor seized driver records days after the accident in france .
the company was found to be riddled with rule-breaking , which risked the safety of many road users .
" these offences we found were some of the most serious that we had ever encountered in our careers , " she said .

father and son william and david allan admitted last june that their system for monitoring the hours drivers worked was inadequate .
however , they denied tampering with tachographs to disguise the amount of hours drivers were working and their breaks .

katherine fish , 15 , died and 20 others were injured when a coach carrying pupils from largs academy in ayrshire crashed near dijon , in france .
allan 's coaches of gorebridge , midlothian , was ordered to answer the allegations in a hearing last june .
a restructuring of directors has satisfied the traffic watchdog .
the traffic commissioner , joan aitken , was due to publish her findings on wednesday .
' serious offences ' the inquiry was separate from any investigation into the crash but the commissioner had the power to withdraw an operator 's licence .
government inspector susan traynor seized driver records days after the accident in france .
the company was found to be riddled with rule-breaking , which risked the safety of many road users .
" these offences we found were some of the most serious that we had ever encountered in our careers , " she said .
" there were 54 tachograph records which we alleged had been falsified and 16 drivers who had failed to take a break after six driving days , on some occasions we found they were driving up to 54 days consecutively . "
father and son william and david allan admitted last june that their system for monitoring the hours drivers worked was inadequate .
however , they denied tampering with tachographs to disguise the amount of hours drivers were working and their breaks .
mark chisholm , who was driving the coach which crashed but who is no longer an allan 's driver , is still to stand trial in france .

the firm 's finances have long suffered as its numerous stakes in foreign mobile operators have slumped in value .
but now both docomo and us operator cingular , reports say , are looking to take control at us firm at & t wireless - in which docomo has a 17 % stake .
docomo 's shares rose 5,000 yen to 237,000 yen , bucking a falling market .
earlier on wednesday , the company 's shares had risen as much as 5 % .
at & t wireless , which was spun off from us phone giant at & t , is currently worth about $ 27bn on its stock market valuation .
reports in newspapers and wire services suggest that cingular - owned by sbc and bellsouth - is offering slightly more than that .
cingular is the us ' number two mobile carrier with 23.4 million customers , trailing verizon wireless 's 36 million by some distance but ahead of the 21.9 million claimed by at & t wireless .
docomo could offer more money , but could be handicapped by investor caution about its foreign investment strategy .
the minority stakes it took in a range of operators , including kpn in the netherlands and 3 in the uk , cost it a 1.12 trillion yen write-down in 2001 and 2002 , pushing it deep into the red .

they are accused of approving excessive bonuses for mannesmann board members when the firm was taken over by the uk 's vodafone four years ago .
the list of defendants reads like a roll call of germany 's business elite .
it includes deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann , and klaus zwickel , ex-boss of the ig metall union .
they will be appearing in the dock alongside former mannesmann chief klaus esser , and three other senior mannesmann executives .
57 million euro question the trial will determine whether the six defendants broke the law by approving bonuses totalling 57m euros in the wake of the takeover .
josef ackermann will stay on as deutsche bank chairman if found guilty , they could face up to 10 years in prison .
prosecutors allege that the bumper payouts breached laws obliging company directors to protect shareholders ' interests .
the defendants have all denied any wrongdoing , and have previously argued that the bonuses were not unreasonable given the size of the vodafone deal .
the takeover , valued at $ 180bn , at the time ranked as the biggest acquisition in corporate history .
supporters of the defendants have also claimed that the trial may deter foreign investment in germany .
bitter memories but the prosecution case has struck a chord with some germans who saw the mannesmann takeover as an assault upon the country 's social market economy .
the bonus payments - unprecedentedly large by german standards - proved hugely controversial , all the more so when it emerged that many mannesmann employees were to lose their jobs once the takeover was complete .
deutsche bank has said mr ackermann will still be able to fulfil his duties , despite having to attend hearings every wednesday and thursday in the duesseldorf regional court for the next six months .
the bank has also said it expects mr ackermann to be acquitted .
former vodafone chief executive chris gent , the architect of the mannesmann takeover , is expected to be called as a witness .

but the company 's former headquarters , centred on a thin grey tower block nearby , has long since been crested with the word " vodafone " in bright red letters .
the british company 's takeover of mannesmann four years ago sent shock-waves through germany 's business and political establishment .
it had once seemed unthinkable that an icon of this country 's economic success could fall victim to a hostile foreign bid .
now , a courtroom epilogue is beginning .
culture clash six former mannesmann directors are facing charges of breach of trust concerning payments made to five of them worth almost 60m euros -lrb- $ 75.6m -rrb- .
the payments were made as " bonuses " and compensation to the executives after they dropped their opposition to the takeover .
but what might appear at first sight a simple case of boardroom fat-cats being brought to book is , according to many observers , actually a clash of cultures .
many germans still think in terms of old prussian values , like thriftiness .
they still have to get accustomed to these amounts of money joachim jahn journalist for frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " we have this fight between the german and the anglo-american economic models , " says bernhard may from the german economic institute -lrb- diw -rrb- .
" we still have the model here in germany that you 're responsible for the whole company , including the people working there , while the american and maybe the british model is more that the ceo is responsible to the shareholders .
" here you can see that selling mannesmann took care of the shareholders while knowing that the workers would lose their jobs . "
bonus or bribe ?
the men in the dock include some big names : josef ackermann , currently head of deutsche bank ; klaus esser , the chief executive of mannesmann at the time ; and klaus zwickel , former head of the huge ig metall trade union .
big names : the current head of the deutsche bank is in the dock a key question for the court will be whether the men received inappropriately large bonuses , another area where cultural differences come into play .
mr esser 's 30m euros are a german record , for example , but generally the amount of money paid was not outstanding by anglo-american business standards .
" many germans still think in terms of old prussian values , like thriftiness .
they still have to get accustomed to these amounts of money , " says joachim jahn , who is covering the case for the german daily the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
the most important suspect did n't actually receive any of the bonuses .
mr ackermann merely approved them .
' market economy ' his lawyer , eberhard kempf , points out that the payments were also backed by a majority of shareholders .
" in the worst case scenario , if there 's a conviction , this sends a signal to all potential investors in germany - that the state prosecutors can have a say in managerial payment decisions , " he says .
" this goes against my basic understanding of what a market economy is . "
lawyers for the prosecution declined to be interviewed for this article .
but two private lawyers from stuttgart who originally instigated the case , martin sorg and mark binz , have argued in earlier remarks that the breach of trust law forbids an " improper use " of company funds - and that this had happened in this case .
