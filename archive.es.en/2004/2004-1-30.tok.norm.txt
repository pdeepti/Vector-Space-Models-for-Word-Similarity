one of the most sensational trials in german legal history ended on friday when judges convicted self-confessed cannibal , armin meiwes , to eight years and six months in prison . the trial that has riveted germany and the rest of the world for the past two months reached its culmination in a kassel courtroom on friday . armin meiwes , accused of killing a 43-year-old computer specialist from berlin , eating his genitalia , and then freezing the rest of his body to consume in later repasts , was convicted of manslaughter .
he will spend eight years and six months in prison .
state prosecutors , who had been pushing for a life sentence on a charge of murder motivated by sexual urges , failed to make their case .
the defense lawyer , harald ermel had argued on thursday that his client , known as the " cannibal of rotenburg " , should get off lightly because his victim had been willing to die and be eaten .
ermel had said that the cannibal could only be prosecuted on a charge of assisted suicide , which would carry a maximum prison term of five years .
his victim , identified in the case only as bernd-jürgen b. , volunteered to be killed after answering an internet ad placed by 42-year-old meiwes seeking " young men for real slaughter and consumption . "
complicated legal case the case had been complicated by the fact that the victim had explicitly expressed the wish to die .
during the trial meiwes ’ lawyer cited emails in which the victim insisted on being killed and eaten .
" there ’ s absolutely no way back for me , only forwards , through your teeth , " one read .
meiwes ’ video of the killing , which made for chilling viewing inside the courtroom , has convinced prosecutors that bernd-jürgen b. ’ s death was voluntary .
the video shows meiwes slaughtering his victim in a scene straight out of the " texas chainsaw massacre , " complete with meat hooks , a cage and a butcher ’ s table .
professor arthur kreuzer told reuters news agency that the case was bound to make legal history .
" it is unique that we are leveling the severest charge of murder against someone and yet have to admit that the victim , whether disturbed or not , wanted it .
the killer sought out his victim and the victim sought out his killer , " he said .
a " human butcher " but prosecutor marcus köhler said this week that meiwes had been aware that his victim was suffering from a serious personality disorder and was unable to think rationally .
" the desire to slaughter a man and eat him up was the paramount motive for his action , " köhler said .
" he slaughtered his victim like a piece of livestock and treated him as an object of fancy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd jürgen b. köhler added that the trial had proven that meiwes murdered his victim -lrb- photo -rrb- or his sexual gratification and to fulfill his cannibalistic yearnings .
according to köhler , meiwes later used his video for sexual satisfaction and to admire his work as a " human butcher . "
meiwes : " i had my big kick " meiwes , who remained calm and collected throughout the trial , said he is writing a book on how he came to live his ultimate fantasy .
a psychiatrist testifying in the case last week described meiwes as fit to stand trial .
" there ’ s no evidence of a psychological disorder , " said george stolpmann .
he added that the 42-year-old had a " schizoid personality " and has problems forming relationships .
" what we have here is an inability to have warm and tender feelings toward others , " he said .
in december , meiwes said he was not acting out of sexual desire when he killed bernd-jürgen b. , but rather out of loneliness and the desire for the brother he never had .
i wanted " someone to be part of me , " he told the court .
this week meiwes told the court he regretted the deed and would not repeat it .

one of the most sensational trials in german legal history ended on friday when judges convicted self-confessed cannibal , armin meiwes , to eight years and six months in prison . the trial that has riveted germany and the rest of the world for the past two months reached its culmination in a kassel courtroom on friday . armin meiwes , accused of killing a 43-year-old computer specialist from berlin , eating his genitalia , and then freezing the rest of his body to consume in later repasts , was convicted of manslaughter .
he will spend eight years and six months in prison .
state prosecutors , who had been pushing for a life sentence on a charge of murder motivated by sexual urges , failed to make their case .
the defense lawyer , harald ermel had argued on thursday that his client , known as the " cannibal of rotenburg " , should get off lightly because his victim had been willing to die and be eaten .
ermel had said that the cannibal could only be prosecuted on a charge of assisted suicide , which would carry a maximum prison term of five years .
his victim , identified in the case only as bernd-jürgen b. , volunteered to be killed after answering an internet ad placed by 42-year-old meiwes seeking " young men for real slaughter and consumption . "
complicated legal case the case had been complicated by the fact that the victim had explicitly expressed the wish to die .
during the trial meiwes ’ lawyer cited emails in which the victim insisted on being killed and eaten .
" there ’ s absolutely no way back for me , only forwards , through your teeth , " one read .
meiwes ’ video of the killing , which made for chilling viewing inside the courtroom , has convinced prosecutors that bernd-jürgen b. ’ s death was voluntary .
the video shows meiwes slaughtering his victim in a scene straight out of the " texas chainsaw massacre , " complete with meat hooks , a cage and a butcher ’ s table .
professor arthur kreuzer told reuters news agency that the case was bound to make legal history .
" it is unique that we are leveling the severest charge of murder against someone and yet have to admit that the victim , whether disturbed or not , wanted it .
the killer sought out his victim and the victim sought out his killer , " he said .
a " human butcher " but prosecutor marcus köhler said this week that meiwes had been aware that his victim was suffering from a serious personality disorder and was unable to think rationally .
" the desire to slaughter a man and eat him up was the paramount motive for his action , " köhler said .
" he slaughtered his victim like a piece of livestock and treated him as an object of fancy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd jürgen b. köhler added that the trial had proven that meiwes murdered his victim -lrb- photo -rrb- or his sexual gratification and to fulfill his cannibalistic yearnings .
according to köhler , meiwes later used his video for sexual satisfaction and to admire his work as a " human butcher . "

one of the most sensational trials in german legal history ended on friday when judges convicted self-confessed cannibal , armin meiwes , to eight years and six months in prison . the trial that has riveted germany and the rest of the world for the past two months reached its culmination in a kassel courtroom on friday . armin meiwes , accused of killing a 43-year-old computer specialist from berlin , eating his genitalia , and then freezing the rest of his body to consume in later repasts , was convicted of manslaughter .
he will spend eight years and six months in prison .
state prosecutors , who had been pushing for a life sentence on a charge of murder motivated by sexual urges , failed to make their case .
the defense lawyer , harald ermel had argued on thursday that his client , known as the " cannibal of rotenburg " , should get off lightly because his victim had been willing to die and be eaten .
ermel had said that the cannibal could only be prosecuted on a charge of assisted suicide , which would carry a maximum prison term of five years .
his victim , identified in the case only as bernd-jürgen b. , volunteered to be killed after answering an internet ad placed by 42-year-old meiwes seeking " young men for real slaughter and consumption . "
complicated legal case the case had been complicated by the fact that the victim had explicitly expressed the wish to die .
during the trial meiwes ’ lawyer cited emails in which the victim insisted on being killed and eaten .
" there ’ s absolutely no way back for me , only forwards , through your teeth , " one read .
meiwes ’ video of the killing , which made for chilling viewing inside the courtroom , has convinced prosecutors that bernd-jürgen b. ’ s death was voluntary .
the video shows meiwes slaughtering his victim in a scene straight out of the " texas chainsaw massacre , " complete with meat hooks , a cage and a butcher ’ s table .
professor arthur kreuzer told reuters news agency that the case was bound to make legal history .
" it is unique that we are leveling the severest charge of murder against someone and yet have to admit that the victim , whether disturbed or not , wanted it .
the killer sought out his victim and the victim sought out his killer , " he said .
a " human butcher " but prosecutor marcus köhler said this week that meiwes had been aware that his victim was suffering from a serious personality disorder and was unable to think rationally .
" the desire to slaughter a man and eat him up was the paramount motive for his action , " köhler said .
" he slaughtered his victim like a piece of livestock and treated him as an object of fancy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd jürgen b. köhler added that the trial had proven that meiwes murdered his victim -lrb- photo -rrb- or his sexual gratification and to fulfill his cannibalistic yearnings .
according to köhler , meiwes later used his video for sexual satisfaction and to admire his work as a " human butcher . "
meiwes : " i had my big kick " meiwes , who remained calm and collected throughout the trial , said he is writing a book on how he came to live his ultimate fantasy .
a psychiatrist testifying in the case last week described meiwes as fit to stand trial .
" there ’ s no evidence of a psychological disorder , " said george stolpmann .
he added that the 42-year-old had a " schizoid personality " and has problems forming relationships .
" what we have here is an inability to have warm and tender feelings toward others , " he said .
in december , meiwes said he was not acting out of sexual desire when he killed bernd-jürgen b. , but rather out of loneliness and the desire for the brother he never had .
i wanted " someone to be part of me , " he told the court .
this week meiwes told the court he regretted the deed and would not repeat it .

one of the most sensational trials in german legal history ended on friday when judges convicted self-confessed cannibal , armin meiwes , to eight years and six months in prison . the trial that has riveted germany and the rest of the world for the past two months reached its culmination in a kassel courtroom on friday . armin meiwes , accused of killing a 43-year-old computer specialist from berlin , eating his genitalia , and then freezing the rest of his body to consume in later repasts , was convicted of manslaughter .
he will spend eight years and six months in prison .
state prosecutors , who had been pushing for a life sentence on a charge of murder motivated by sexual urges , failed to make their case .
the defense lawyer , harald ermel had argued on thursday that his client , known as the " cannibal of rotenburg " , should get off lightly because his victim had been willing to die and be eaten .
ermel had said that the cannibal could only be prosecuted on a charge of assisted suicide , which would carry a maximum prison term of five years .
his victim , identified in the case only as bernd-jürgen b. , volunteered to be killed after answering an internet ad placed by 42-year-old meiwes seeking " young men for real slaughter and consumption . "
complicated legal case the case had been complicated by the fact that the victim had explicitly expressed the wish to die .
during the trial meiwes ’ lawyer cited emails in which the victim insisted on being killed and eaten .
" there ’ s absolutely no way back for me , only forwards , through your teeth , " one read .
meiwes ’ video of the killing , which made for chilling viewing inside the courtroom , has convinced prosecutors that bernd-jürgen b. ’ s death was voluntary .
the video shows meiwes slaughtering his victim in a scene straight out of the " texas chainsaw massacre , " complete with meat hooks , a cage and a butcher ’ s table .
professor arthur kreuzer told reuters news agency that the case was bound to make legal history .
" it is unique that we are leveling the severest charge of murder against someone and yet have to admit that the victim , whether disturbed or not , wanted it .
the killer sought out his victim and the victim sought out his killer , " he said .
a " human butcher " but prosecutor marcus köhler said this week that meiwes had been aware that his victim was suffering from a serious personality disorder and was unable to think rationally .
" the desire to slaughter a man and eat him up was the paramount motive for his action , " köhler said .
" he slaughtered his victim like a piece of livestock and treated him as an object of fancy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd jürgen b. köhler added that the trial had proven that meiwes murdered his victim -lrb- photo -rrb- or his sexual gratification and to fulfill his cannibalistic yearnings .
according to köhler , meiwes later used his video for sexual satisfaction and to admire his work as a " human butcher . "
meiwes : " i had my big kick " meiwes , who remained calm and collected throughout the trial , said he is writing a book on how he came to live his ultimate fantasy .
a psychiatrist testifying in the case last week described meiwes as fit to stand trial .
" there ’ s no evidence of a psychological disorder , " said george stolpmann .
he added that the 42-year-old had a " schizoid personality " and has problems forming relationships .
" what we have here is an inability to have warm and tender feelings toward others , " he said .
in december , meiwes said he was not acting out of sexual desire when he killed bernd-jürgen b. , but rather out of loneliness and the desire for the brother he never had .
i wanted " someone to be part of me , " he told the court .

his victim , identified in the case only as bernd-jürgen b. , volunteered to be killed after answering an internet ad placed by 42-year-old meiwes seeking " young men for real slaughter and consumption . "
complicated legal case the case had been complicated by the fact that the victim had explicitly expressed the wish to die .
during the trial meiwes ’ lawyer cited emails in which the victim insisted on being killed and eaten .
" there ’ s absolutely no way back for me , only forwards , through your teeth , " one read .
meiwes ’ video of the killing , which made for chilling viewing inside the courtroom , has convinced prosecutors that bernd-jürgen b. ’ s death was voluntary .
the video shows meiwes slaughtering his victim in a scene straight out of the " texas chainsaw massacre , " complete with meat hooks , a cage and a butcher ’ s table .
professor arthur kreuzer told reuters news agency that the case was bound to make legal history .
" it is unique that we are leveling the severest charge of murder against someone and yet have to admit that the victim , whether disturbed or not , wanted it .
the killer sought out his victim and the victim sought out his killer , " he said .
a " human butcher " but prosecutor marcus köhler said this week that meiwes had been aware that his victim was suffering from a serious personality disorder and was unable to think rationally .
" the desire to slaughter a man and eat him up was the paramount motive for his action , " köhler said .
" he slaughtered his victim like a piece of livestock and treated him as an object of fancy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd jürgen b. köhler added that the trial had proven that meiwes murdered his victim -lrb- photo -rrb- or his sexual gratification and to fulfill his cannibalistic yearnings .
according to köhler , meiwes later used his video for sexual satisfaction and to admire his work as a " human butcher . "
meiwes : " i had my big kick " meiwes , who remained calm and collected throughout the trial , said he is writing a book on how he came to live his ultimate fantasy .
a psychiatrist testifying in the case last week described meiwes as fit to stand trial .
" there ’ s no evidence of a psychological disorder , " said george stolpmann .
he added that the 42-year-old had a " schizoid personality " and has problems forming relationships .
" what we have here is an inability to have warm and tender feelings toward others , " he said .
in december , meiwes said he was not acting out of sexual desire when he killed bernd-jürgen b. , but rather out of loneliness and the desire for the brother he never had .
i wanted " someone to be part of me , " he told the court .
this week meiwes told the court he regretted the deed and would not repeat it .

the aim of the plan is to reduce poland 's swelling budget deficit , which stands at nearly 6 percent of its gross domestic product .
poland will not be entitled to apply to join the euro until this deficit is halved . the measures proposed include scrapping disability pensions and raising the pension age for women to 62 from the current 60 .
jobs will be cut in the public sector to save more money and political parties will have their state funding reduced .
however , the moves still have to be cleared by the polish parliament where the government does not have a majority .
this is a risky strategy on the part of the polish authorities .
although growth has been recovering in the polish economy -lrb- reaching 4 percent last year -rrb- , unemployment remains stubbornly high - at nearly 20 percent .
these measures are likely to dampen growth and increase unemployment , which may not be easy for the currently unpopular government to explain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.01.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc u.s. warns against lifting china arms embargo the eu , led by france and germany on this issue , is considering dropping the arms sanctions against china , which have been in place since the chinese government violently suppressed demonstrations at tiananmen square in 1989 .
but the spokesman , richard boucher , said , " certainly for the united states , our statutes and regulations prohibit sales of defense items to china .
we believe that others should maintain their current arms embargoes as well . "
he continued , " we believe that the u.s. and european prohibitions on arms sales are complementary , were imposed for the same reasons , specifically serious human rights abuses , and that those reasons remain valid today . "
however , the eu itself is far from united on the issue .
french president jacques chirac has recently declared that the sanctions " make no sense now , " but sweden is against lifting the embargo .
denmark , which until recently was thought to be in favour of maintaining the arms ban , appeared to have changed its mind .
according to danish paper information , the chairman of the danish parliament 's foreign policy committee has said that denmark would be in favour of lifting the ban if china agreed to concrete improvements in return , such as including human rights in its new constitution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's year in review german welfare state at a turning point europe 's integration challenge when bullies enter the military german carmakers face a bumpy ride germany -pipe- 30.01.2004 cannibal convicted of manslaughter großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 'll eat prison food for quite a while .
one of the most sensational trials in german legal history ended on friday when judges convicted self-confessed cannibal , armin meiwes , to eight years and six months in prison . the trial that has riveted germany and the rest of the world for the past two months reached its culmination in a kassel courtroom on friday . armin meiwes , accused of killing a 43-year-old computer specialist from berlin , eating his genitalia , and then freezing the rest of his body to consume in later repasts , was convicted of manslaughter .
he will spend eight years and six months in prison .
state prosecutors , who had been pushing for a life sentence on a charge of murder motivated by sexual urges , failed to make their case .
the defense lawyer , harald ermel had argued on thursday that his client , known as the " cannibal of rotenburg " , should get off lightly because his victim had been willing to die and be eaten .
ermel had said that the cannibal could only be prosecuted on a charge of assisted suicide , which would carry a maximum prison term of five years .
his victim , identified in the case only as bernd-jürgen b. , volunteered to be killed after answering an internet ad placed by 42-year-old meiwes seeking " young men for real slaughter and consumption . "
complicated legal case the case had been complicated by the fact that the victim had explicitly expressed the wish to die .
during the trial meiwes ’ lawyer cited emails in which the victim insisted on being killed and eaten .
" there ’ s absolutely no way back for me , only forwards , through your teeth , " one read .
meiwes ’ video of the killing , which made for chilling viewing inside the courtroom , has convinced prosecutors that bernd-jürgen b. ’ s death was voluntary .
the video shows meiwes slaughtering his victim in a scene straight out of the " texas chainsaw massacre , " complete with meat hooks , a cage and a butcher ’ s table .
professor arthur kreuzer told reuters news agency that the case was bound to make legal history .
" it is unique that we are leveling the severest charge of murder against someone and yet have to admit that the victim , whether disturbed or not , wanted it .
the killer sought out his victim and the victim sought out his killer , " he said .
a " human butcher " but prosecutor marcus köhler said this week that meiwes had been aware that his victim was suffering from a serious personality disorder and was unable to think rationally .
" the desire to slaughter a man and eat him up was the paramount motive for his action , " köhler said .
" he slaughtered his victim like a piece of livestock and treated him as an object of fancy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd jürgen b. köhler added that the trial had proven that meiwes murdered his victim -lrb- photo -rrb- or his sexual gratification and to fulfill his cannibalistic yearnings .
according to köhler , meiwes later used his video for sexual satisfaction and to admire his work as a " human butcher . "
meiwes : " i had my big kick " meiwes , who remained calm and collected throughout the trial , said he is writing a book on how he came to live his ultimate fantasy .
a psychiatrist testifying in the case last week described meiwes as fit to stand trial .
" there ’ s no evidence of a psychological disorder , " said george stolpmann .
he added that the 42-year-old had a " schizoid personality " and has problems forming relationships .
" what we have here is an inability to have warm and tender feelings toward others , " he said .
in december , meiwes said he was not acting out of sexual desire when he killed bernd-jürgen b. , but rather out of loneliness and the desire for the brother he never had .
i wanted " someone to be part of me , " he told the court .
this week meiwes told the court he regretted the deed and would not repeat it .

one of the most sensational trials in german legal history ended on friday when judges convicted self-confessed cannibal , armin meiwes , to eight years and six months in prison . the trial that has riveted germany and the rest of the world for the past two months reached its culmination in a kassel courtroom on friday . armin meiwes , accused of killing a 43-year-old computer specialist from berlin , eating his genitalia , and then freezing the rest of his body to consume in later repasts , was convicted of manslaughter .
he will spend eight years and six months in prison .
state prosecutors , who had been pushing for a life sentence on a charge of murder motivated by sexual urges , failed to make their case .
the defense lawyer , harald ermel had argued on thursday that his client , known as the " cannibal of rotenburg " , should get off lightly because his victim had been willing to die and be eaten .
ermel had said that the cannibal could only be prosecuted on a charge of assisted suicide , which would carry a maximum prison term of five years .
his victim , identified in the case only as bernd-jürgen b. , volunteered to be killed after answering an internet ad placed by 42-year-old meiwes seeking " young men for real slaughter and consumption . "
complicated legal case the case had been complicated by the fact that the victim had explicitly expressed the wish to die .
during the trial meiwes ’ lawyer cited emails in which the victim insisted on being killed and eaten .
" there ’ s absolutely no way back for me , only forwards , through your teeth , " one read .
meiwes ’ video of the killing , which made for chilling viewing inside the courtroom , has convinced prosecutors that bernd-jürgen b. ’ s death was voluntary .
the video shows meiwes slaughtering his victim in a scene straight out of the " texas chainsaw massacre , " complete with meat hooks , a cage and a butcher ’ s table .
professor arthur kreuzer told reuters news agency that the case was bound to make legal history .
" it is unique that we are leveling the severest charge of murder against someone and yet have to admit that the victim , whether disturbed or not , wanted it .
the killer sought out his victim and the victim sought out his killer , " he said .
a " human butcher " but prosecutor marcus köhler said this week that meiwes had been aware that his victim was suffering from a serious personality disorder and was unable to think rationally .
" the desire to slaughter a man and eat him up was the paramount motive for his action , " köhler said .
" he slaughtered his victim like a piece of livestock and treated him as an object of fancy . "

one of the most sensational trials in german legal history ended on friday when judges convicted self-confessed cannibal , armin meiwes , to eight years and six months in prison . the trial that has riveted germany and the rest of the world for the past two months reached its culmination in a kassel courtroom on friday . armin meiwes , accused of killing a 43-year-old computer specialist from berlin , eating his genitalia , and then freezing the rest of his body to consume in later repasts , was convicted of manslaughter .
he will spend eight years and six months in prison .
state prosecutors , who had been pushing for a life sentence on a charge of murder motivated by sexual urges , failed to make their case .
the defense lawyer , harald ermel had argued on thursday that his client , known as the " cannibal of rotenburg " , should get off lightly because his victim had been willing to die and be eaten .
ermel had said that the cannibal could only be prosecuted on a charge of assisted suicide , which would carry a maximum prison term of five years .
his victim , identified in the case only as bernd-jürgen b. , volunteered to be killed after answering an internet ad placed by 42-year-old meiwes seeking " young men for real slaughter and consumption . "
complicated legal case the case had been complicated by the fact that the victim had explicitly expressed the wish to die .
during the trial meiwes ’ lawyer cited emails in which the victim insisted on being killed and eaten .
" there ’ s absolutely no way back for me , only forwards , through your teeth , " one read .
meiwes ’ video of the killing , which made for chilling viewing inside the courtroom , has convinced prosecutors that bernd-jürgen b. ’ s death was voluntary .
the video shows meiwes slaughtering his victim in a scene straight out of the " texas chainsaw massacre , " complete with meat hooks , a cage and a butcher ’ s table .
professor arthur kreuzer told reuters news agency that the case was bound to make legal history .
" it is unique that we are leveling the severest charge of murder against someone and yet have to admit that the victim , whether disturbed or not , wanted it .
the killer sought out his victim and the victim sought out his killer , " he said .
a " human butcher " but prosecutor marcus köhler said this week that meiwes had been aware that his victim was suffering from a serious personality disorder and was unable to think rationally .
" the desire to slaughter a man and eat him up was the paramount motive for his action , " köhler said .
" he slaughtered his victim like a piece of livestock and treated him as an object of fancy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd jürgen b. köhler added that the trial had proven that meiwes murdered his victim -lrb- photo -rrb- or his sexual gratification and to fulfill his cannibalistic yearnings .
according to köhler , meiwes later used his video for sexual satisfaction and to admire his work as a " human butcher . "
meiwes : " i had my big kick " meiwes , who remained calm and collected throughout the trial , said he is writing a book on how he came to live his ultimate fantasy .
a psychiatrist testifying in the case last week described meiwes as fit to stand trial .
" there ’ s no evidence of a psychological disorder , " said george stolpmann .
he added that the 42-year-old had a " schizoid personality " and has problems forming relationships .
" what we have here is an inability to have warm and tender feelings toward others , " he said .
in december , meiwes said he was not acting out of sexual desire when he killed bernd-jürgen b. , but rather out of loneliness and the desire for the brother he never had .
i wanted " someone to be part of me , " he told the court .
this week meiwes told the court he regretted the deed and would not repeat it .

one of the most sensational trials in german legal history ended on friday when judges convicted self-confessed cannibal , armin meiwes , to eight years and six months in prison . the trial that has riveted germany and the rest of the world for the past two months reached its culmination in a kassel courtroom on friday . armin meiwes , accused of killing a 43-year-old computer specialist from berlin , eating his genitalia , and then freezing the rest of his body to consume in later repasts , was convicted of manslaughter .
he will spend eight years and six months in prison .
state prosecutors , who had been pushing for a life sentence on a charge of murder motivated by sexual urges , failed to make their case .
the defense lawyer , harald ermel had argued on thursday that his client , known as the " cannibal of rotenburg " , should get off lightly because his victim had been willing to die and be eaten .
ermel had said that the cannibal could only be prosecuted on a charge of assisted suicide , which would carry a maximum prison term of five years .
his victim , identified in the case only as bernd-jürgen b. , volunteered to be killed after answering an internet ad placed by 42-year-old meiwes seeking " young men for real slaughter and consumption . "
complicated legal case the case had been complicated by the fact that the victim had explicitly expressed the wish to die .
during the trial meiwes ’ lawyer cited emails in which the victim insisted on being killed and eaten .
" there ’ s absolutely no way back for me , only forwards , through your teeth , " one read .
meiwes ’ video of the killing , which made for chilling viewing inside the courtroom , has convinced prosecutors that bernd-jürgen b. ’ s death was voluntary .
the video shows meiwes slaughtering his victim in a scene straight out of the " texas chainsaw massacre , " complete with meat hooks , a cage and a butcher ’ s table .
professor arthur kreuzer told reuters news agency that the case was bound to make legal history .
" it is unique that we are leveling the severest charge of murder against someone and yet have to admit that the victim , whether disturbed or not , wanted it .
the killer sought out his victim and the victim sought out his killer , " he said .
a " human butcher " but prosecutor marcus köhler said this week that meiwes had been aware that his victim was suffering from a serious personality disorder and was unable to think rationally .
" the desire to slaughter a man and eat him up was the paramount motive for his action , " köhler said .
" he slaughtered his victim like a piece of livestock and treated him as an object of fancy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd jürgen b. köhler added that the trial had proven that meiwes murdered his victim -lrb- photo -rrb- or his sexual gratification and to fulfill his cannibalistic yearnings .

one of the most sensational trials in german legal history ended on friday when judges convicted self-confessed cannibal , armin meiwes , to eight years and six months in prison . the trial that has riveted germany and the rest of the world for the past two months reached its culmination in a kassel courtroom on friday . armin meiwes , accused of killing a 43-year-old computer specialist from berlin , eating his genitalia , and then freezing the rest of his body to consume in later repasts , was convicted of manslaughter .
he will spend eight years and six months in prison .
state prosecutors , who had been pushing for a life sentence on a charge of murder motivated by sexual urges , failed to make their case .
the defense lawyer , harald ermel had argued on thursday that his client , known as the " cannibal of rotenburg " , should get off lightly because his victim had been willing to die and be eaten .
ermel had said that the cannibal could only be prosecuted on a charge of assisted suicide , which would carry a maximum prison term of five years .
his victim , identified in the case only as bernd-jürgen b. , volunteered to be killed after answering an internet ad placed by 42-year-old meiwes seeking " young men for real slaughter and consumption . "
complicated legal case the case had been complicated by the fact that the victim had explicitly expressed the wish to die .
during the trial meiwes ’ lawyer cited emails in which the victim insisted on being killed and eaten .
" there ’ s absolutely no way back for me , only forwards , through your teeth , " one read .
meiwes ’ video of the killing , which made for chilling viewing inside the courtroom , has convinced prosecutors that bernd-jürgen b. ’ s death was voluntary .
the video shows meiwes slaughtering his victim in a scene straight out of the " texas chainsaw massacre , " complete with meat hooks , a cage and a butcher ’ s table .
professor arthur kreuzer told reuters news agency that the case was bound to make legal history .
" it is unique that we are leveling the severest charge of murder against someone and yet have to admit that the victim , whether disturbed or not , wanted it .
the killer sought out his victim and the victim sought out his killer , " he said .
a " human butcher " but prosecutor marcus köhler said this week that meiwes had been aware that his victim was suffering from a serious personality disorder and was unable to think rationally .
" the desire to slaughter a man and eat him up was the paramount motive for his action , " köhler said .
" he slaughtered his victim like a piece of livestock and treated him as an object of fancy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd jürgen b. köhler added that the trial had proven that meiwes murdered his victim -lrb- photo -rrb- or his sexual gratification and to fulfill his cannibalistic yearnings .
according to köhler , meiwes later used his video for sexual satisfaction and to admire his work as a " human butcher . "
meiwes : " i had my big kick " meiwes , who remained calm and collected throughout the trial , said he is writing a book on how he came to live his ultimate fantasy .
a psychiatrist testifying in the case last week described meiwes as fit to stand trial .
" there ’ s no evidence of a psychological disorder , " said george stolpmann .
he added that the 42-year-old had a " schizoid personality " and has problems forming relationships .
" what we have here is an inability to have warm and tender feelings toward others , " he said .
in december , meiwes said he was not acting out of sexual desire when he killed bernd-jürgen b. , but rather out of loneliness and the desire for the brother he never had .
i wanted " someone to be part of me , " he told the court .
this week meiwes told the court he regretted the deed and would not repeat it .

she started by asking him if he thought he had acted in the best interests of the bbc .
i think no one suggested , even in a report that was very critical of the bbc , no one suggested that anyone had acted improperly .
the suggestion was that we had made , i suppose , misjudgements and those had very serious consequences .
in those circumstances it was right for me to leave the bbc .
i do n't see any other way of ending it .
what matters about the bbc is not you or me and all of us , what matters is what we broadcast for the public of this country .
the bbc is a great broadcaster , it 's a great organisation and therefore what matters is that people have confidence in that .
the hutton inquiry and the hutton report has undermined that confidence and therefore i think it 's right that i should go .
has it undermined confidence in the bbc for legitimate reasons ?
do you think the management structures were not there to deal with an inquiry like this ?
did you rush to judge too quickly and ask the government for support too quickly ?
i did n't ask the government for support at any time .
what i did do , and which i said to the inquiry , is that there was a particular day in time when i got involved in the issue .
i wish in retrospect that instead of working on alistair 's campbell timetable i should have set up our own .
that 's where i made a mistake , and that 's why i am leaving .
do you think the government has pushed too hard for a full apology ?
my understanding is that you were concerned that the bbc was going to have to apologise so whole-heartedly .
no , i did n't think that at all .
i made an apology yesterday .
it was supposed to be an apology , i 'm not sure everyone recognised it was .
i think that 's probably my style .
do you think there are going to be more casualties of this at the bbc ?
not that i know of .

" we 've had a great run together - one of the most successful in hollywood history - and it 's a shame that disney wo n't be participating in pixar 's future successes , " he said .
pixar said it would complete the two films it is already committed to making with disney - the incredibles in 2004 and cars in 2005 .
after that , pixar said , it " intends to retain full ownership of its future productions " .
disney will retain the rights to distribute pixar 's first seven films , with pixar continuing to receive its current share of the profits .

now the service is launching new campaign to discourage such calls .
the was says that currently one in four of the calls it receives are inappropriate and it means hundreds of hours of their time is wasted .
they say one couple even called 999 to ask paramedics to come and fetch logs in from their shed , while another caller said she " wanted a hug " .
some inappropriate 999 calls one lady " wanted a hug " one caller lost a remote control one woman broke a fingernail a request for help to charge an pre-pay electric meter devon-based celebrity noel edmonds is giving his backing to the campaign .
the ambulance service deals with about 500 emergency calls every day from across the south west .
however , on christmas day 2003 , about 179 emergency calls out of 493 to the service were described as inappropriate , bringing the ratio up to one in three being not considered an emergency .
the service is pleading to the residents of devon , cornwall and somerset to remember that ambulances are for emergencies and not to dial 999 for trivial reasons so that patients who need life saving treatment will get help as quickly as possible .
other calls have featured one person wanting help to turn their central heating down and another who was unable to get out of their chair and who called 999 to get a crew to turn their kettle off .
the service said lives were put at risk by thoughtless use of the 999 service and that emergency ambulances should only be used in certain situations .
it said it considered suspected heart attacks , severe bleeding , accidents where immediate medical intervention is necessary or where life was threatened due to a medical condition as being appropriate .
the service said if it was not such a medical emergency , people should use other services such as nhs direct , walk in centres or even , if they are able to , making their own way to their local hospital 's accident and emergency department .

the survey by the auditor general for wales , sir john bourn , says patient care has been affected and more could have been done to tackle the problem .
more than 15 days a year - or 6 % of staff hours - are being lost in wales to sickness for every member of full-time staff .
in england , an average 4.7 % of contracted hours are being lost by nhs trust staff .
it is clear that more could have been done by the trusts to address this problem sir john bourn nurses and midwives - who together make up almost half of the nhs workforce in wales - are among the groups with the highest recorded levels of sick leave .
speaking to bbc wales on friday , liz hewitt of the royal college of nursing in wales said it was only to be expected from overworked , overstretched staff .
mistakes in recording mean actual levels of sickness absence could be even higher , according to sir john 's report .
he also warned sickness levels in the welsh nhs are continuing to rise .
sir john recognised that a certain level of sick leave was inevitable in any organisation , and said the nhs was a " stressful and potentially hazardous environment in which to work " .
but he said sickness levels on this scale placed a " significant strain " on the delivery of services by the nhs .
" it is clear that more could have been done by the trusts to address this problem , and that the assembly 's nhs wales department could have issued firmer guidance and targets by which progress should be measured , " he concluded .
no single reason was identified but poor methods for recording and monitoring absenteeism were a concern .
trusts have invested cash in schemes to try to reduce stress and protect staff from accidents .
but the report said their impact was being undermined by a lack of reliable information about the real seriousness of the situation .
procedures sir john said the introduction of an electronic staff record system across the nhs in england and wales should help - but trusts would have to wait until mid 2005 at the earliest before it is introduced .
most managers still lacked any formal training in the management of sickness absence and so underlying problems and trends in individuals ' sickness absence went unchecked .
sir john 's report will be presented to the assembly 's audit committee next month when anne lloyd , director of the nhs in wales , will also give evidence .
a spokeswoman for the welsh assembly government said it was looking forward to receiving the committee 's report in due course , but said it would be inappropriate to offer any comment before then .
" anne lloyd has already written to nhs trusts outlining the implementation of the auditor general 's report recommendations , " she added .

we have a little money saved for a deposit but we both have bad credit histories -lrb- from university and college days -rrb- . my boyfriend has now cleared his debts and i have about £ 400 left to pay .
we both work for the civil service and both our jobs are permanent .
we each earn £ 12,100 a year .
is there anything you can advise us to do ?
name withheld ray boulger , senior technical manager , charcol : the fact that you both have a bad credit history will not preclude you from getting a mortgage but it may mean you wo n't qualify for the best rates at the current time .
although a 5 % deposit may be adequate , you may need 10 % , depending on how much adverse credit you have and how long ago it was incurred .
mainstream lenders will look on your application more favourably if the remaining £ 400 of the outstanding debt has been cleared and therefore i would recommend paying this back as soon as possible .
you say that the adverse credit was incurred when you were both at university / college .
as you are now 30 i assume these debts were all incurred several years ago .
do you have a question ?
send your questions to our experts if this assumption is correct and you wait six to 12 months after you have paid off the remaining £ 400 before applying for a mortgage , and assuming all your other financial affairs are in order , you should be able to get a mortgage on normal terms from some lenders .
to improve your chances i would recommend that you make sure you operate your bank accounts in credit , or within any agreed overdraft facility , with no bounced cheques or failed direct debits .
make sure the monthly payments on any current loans or credit cards are always paid on time .

we have a little money saved for a deposit but we both have bad credit histories -lrb- from university and college days -rrb- . my boyfriend has now cleared his debts and i have about £ 400 left to pay .
we both work for the civil service and both our jobs are permanent .
we each earn £ 12,100 a year .
is there anything you can advise us to do ?
name withheld ray boulger , senior technical manager , charcol : the fact that you both have a bad credit history will not preclude you from getting a mortgage but it may mean you wo n't qualify for the best rates at the current time .
although a 5 % deposit may be adequate , you may need 10 % , depending on how much adverse credit you have and how long ago it was incurred .
mainstream lenders will look on your application more favourably if the remaining £ 400 of the outstanding debt has been cleared and therefore i would recommend paying this back as soon as possible .
you say that the adverse credit was incurred when you were both at university / college .
as you are now 30 i assume these debts were all incurred several years ago .
do you have a question ?
send your questions to our experts if this assumption is correct and you wait six to 12 months after you have paid off the remaining £ 400 before applying for a mortgage , and assuming all your other financial affairs are in order , you should be able to get a mortgage on normal terms from some lenders .
to improve your chances i would recommend that you make sure you operate your bank accounts in credit , or within any agreed overdraft facility , with no bounced cheques or failed direct debits .
make sure the monthly payments on any current loans or credit cards are always paid on time .
you should also both make sure you are on the electoral roll .

a study commissioned by plaid cymru and carried out by sheffield hallam university suggests that , while 4,600 people conwy , gwynedd and anglesey were counted as unemployed there last year , more than 11,000 were out of work .
this could be because official figures do not count people excluded from claiming job seekers allowance , nor those on government job creation schemes .
the study was commissioned by plaid cymru mep eurig wyn and carried out by sheffield hallam university and a research company based in bangor .
it concluded that the area 's economy was a long way from full employment .
the report contrasts one official unemployment figures with what it calls " real unemployed " .
in july 2003 , just over 4,600 people were claiming benefits in conwy , gwynedd and anglesey .
the survey 's authors put that closer to 16,000 .
that was because they took into account people who had retired early because they could not find a job .
different picture they also counted people living on benefits because of illness .
the report suggested some of the uk government 's data painted an unjustifiably favourable picture .
the government has pointed out that the uk 's unemployment rate is lower than most other countries .
it also said unemployment problems wales were not being ignored .
back in november official figures revealed that employment was gaining pace faster in wales than the uk average .
during the three months to september , the welsh employment rate increased by 2.9 % on a year earlier , with an extra 61,000 people entering the jobs market .
' lower than uk ' the labour force survey from national statistics showed that the uk average rise was just 0.3 % .
but wales ' employment rate - at 73 % - still trailed slightly behind the uk 's average figure of 74.6 % .
wales also had a lower unemployment rate than the uk average : it was down 0.6 % on a year earlier to 4.7 % , compared to 5 % and a fall of 0.3 % .
andrew davies , economic development and transport minister in the welsh assembly government , said the figures showed the welsh economy was still on track for long-term sustainable growth .
" our unemployment rate remains below that of the uk as a whole and we have had the biggest fall in the inactivity rate over the last year out of all the uk regions , " he said .
