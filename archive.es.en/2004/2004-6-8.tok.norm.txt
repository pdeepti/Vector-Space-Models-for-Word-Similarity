berlin is planning to give its stagnating university system a shot in the arm with a € 1.9 billion program to create germany 's version of ivy league elite colleges .
officials hope it will spur academic competition . faced with overcrowded lecture halls , outdated teaching materials and unmotivated professors , students in germany often take years to finish courses .
but chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s center-left government now wants to reinvigorate the country 's system of higher education , aiming to spend about € 1.9 billion in extra money for universities over the next five years .
education minister edelgard bulmahn says the money is to encourage competition between universities and to reward centers of excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn says elite universities will help germany compete better in the global marketplace .
" we need a climate where universities engage in competition , " bulmahn said on monday .
" we have a lot of experience funding and organizing outstanding scientific excellence in our research institutes .
but we don ’ t have high-performance universities that are acknowledged worldwide .
so that means we need more competition between universities and the willingness to attract people not only from our own universities and surroundings , but from abroad as well . "
germany ’ s long-standing image of the land of poets and philosophers has been severely tarnished in recent years as international studies on education have shown the german primary school system to be mediocre at best .
the situation in the country 's universities is only slightly better .
academic competition bulmahn wants germany to become more active in the race for the world ’ s best brains by establishing elite universities that one day , the government hopes , will rival harvard , oxford or american ivy league universities .
the plan for the extra funding has received the full backing from the country ’ s powerful state premiers , who are in charge of education here , and a competition to determine which universities get the money will be held later this year .
ten will be singled out , with each receiving an extra € 25 million a year .
a parallel program will also reward individual departments with strong academic records and leading research groups .
the competition for the pot of gold will be fierce because many university heads , including dieter lenzen of berlin ’ s free university , think they stand a good chance of winning .
" there is already a ranking of german universities , " he says .
" and after munich and heidelberg , berlin ’ s free university is in third place .
so i think we are well-positioned for the competition . "
a jury of german research and science experts is to establish criteria for selecting the best universities .

fear of neglect but some observers have warned the government against neglecting the broader spectrum of university education in its drive for top performance and elite schools .
" it is of course important to establish elite institutions , " says karl einhäuptl of the national science council , " but at the same time we must strive to maintain the high standards of our universities in general .
it ’ s not surprising that german scientists are wanted by american institutions .
that ’ s because they are well-trained . "
the initiative is also meant to attract more foreign students to german universities .
easier access to jobs here , which is expected to come with a new immigration law and the absence of tuition fees , the government hopes , will serve as extra incentives to aspiring academics from abroad . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : an elite university or a university for the elite ?

from bit player to global heavyweight a platform for protest china : the uninvited guest current affairs -pipe- 08.06.2004 g-8 leaders head to u.s. summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to the g-8 meeting will have little time to enjoy the beach g-8 leaders will gather on tuesday for a three-day summit .
george bush 's plans for iraq and the middle east will dominate the agenda , but there will also be emphasis on debt relief and the spread of hiv / aids . the leaders of the world 's top industrial nations , known as the group of eight or g-8 , will gather on sea island , just off the coast of the u.s. state georgia .

george bush 's plans for iraq and the middle east will dominate the agenda , but there will also be emphasis on debt relief and the spread of hiv / aids . the leaders of the world 's top industrial nations , known as the group of eight or g-8 , will gather on sea island , just off the coast of the u.s. state georgia .
including the u.s. , britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and russia , the g-8 summit will be shielded from protestors by heavy security and the islands remote location . u.s. president george bush will meet several leaders that just came together at this past weekend 's 60th anniversary d-day celebrations in france . bush had hoped the festivities would signal the western world 's renewed unity following last year 's divisions over iraq , but he may still face a skeptical group of allies on tuesday - the same day the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a new resolution on transferring sovereignty to iraq . despite the broad smiles and joint resolutions that are expected to mark the summit , analysts are divided over whether the meeting will help to spackle over the deep divisions , particularly those between bush and his trans-atlantic allies in europe .

however , after the draft was leaked to the press in february , international reaction to many of the proposals - particularly the reaction of many middle east leaders - has resulted in a significant reworking of the plan , which may be formally adopted by the g-8 leaders at this week 's meeting . at issue were middle eastern leader 's contention that bush and company intended to dictate and impose changes from the outside , when real change should eminate from within the region .
the plan has been renamed the " broader middle east initiative " and critics will be discussing whether or not the changes are purely cosmetic or substantive .
the new draft explicitatly states that " change can not be imposed from outside " and stresses dialog not dictates . that , however , has not proven enough to appease some middle east leaders .

leaders of the world 's richest nations will meet off georgia 's coast from june 8-10 .
the g-8 summit has moved from being an intimate fireside chat to a weighty meeting with a broad economic as well as political agenda . the first world economic summit was founded in 1975 by the then french president giscard d ' estaing and the former german chancellor helmut schmidt . the six leaders of germany , france , italy , japan , great britain and the united states met for a fireside chat at the rambouillet castle near the french capital of paris to discuss questions of international economics policies in a relaxed intimate atmosphere . from g-6 to g-8 a year later at the dorado beach , puerto rico summit , canada was accepted into the illustrious circle leading to the coining of the word ' g-7 . ' in 1977 the president of the european commission was invited to participate in the annual event , a move that resulted in a broadening of the range of topics to include questions of foreign policy . in 1998 russia , which had unofficially been a part of the g-7 talks since 1994 , was officially accepted into the fold at the birmingham summit as one of the most politically-important countries .
the move completed the g-8 or group of eight circle as it is known today . however on financial and currency matters , it was the g-7 that continued to hold talks because russia had still to take on a role comparable to the g-7 's when it came to these issues on the world stage . the g8 's agenda has also broadened significantly throughout its history .
as a result , the g8 member countries now have separate meetings throughout the year for finance , foreign and labor ministers . weighing in on international issues meanwhile the regular meetings of the eight world leaders have turned into a massive media spectacle , often accompanied by protests from anti-globalization activists and opponents of neo-liberal capitalism . the protests reached a climax in july 2001 in genoa , italy , when 23-year-old student and protestor carlo guiliani was brutally beaten and died in clashes between the demonstrators and the police . doubt has often been cast on the political significance of the g-8 talks and its effectiveness in addressing issues of international concerns . however summit participants vehemently defend themselves against the charge . at the opening address of the g-8 summit in evian , france last year , french president chirac said the meet should be based on four principles : solidarity , responsibility , security and democracy .
referring to ' responsibility ' , chirac recommended that " the g-8 states should formulate principles for a responsible market policy oriented towards permanent development , and which is accompanied by concrete actions to , for instance , fight corruption or to use research and innovation to aid the environment . " heavyweight status the german government has also long ceased to describe the g-8 meets as a mere relaxed fireside chat . " the big advantage of the g-8 cooperation is that it links a high degree of flexibility with the necessary economic and political power needed to push through its decisions .
the decisions exude a great political influence , which the individual states can not evade , " according to the german economics and finance ministry . the economic and political muscle of the g-8 is also visible in numbers : they earn more than two- thirds of the gross world product , they 're responsible for almost half of global trade , they account for over three- fourths of worldwide development aid and are the biggest paymasters in international organizations such as the oecd -lrb- organization for economic cooperation and development -rrb- , the imf -lrb- international monetary fund -rrb- and the world bank . rolf wenkel -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the view from the summit dw-world 's special on the background , history and goals of the g-8 as well as news from the summit in sea island , off georgia 's atlantic coast . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

' in 1977 the president of the european commission was invited to participate in the annual event , a move that resulted in a broadening of the range of topics to include questions of foreign policy . in 1998 russia , which had unofficially been a part of the g-7 talks since 1994 , was officially accepted into the fold at the birmingham summit as one of the most politically-important countries .
the move completed the g-8 or group of eight circle as it is known today . however on financial and currency matters , it was the g-7 that continued to hold talks because russia had still to take on a role comparable to the g-7 's when it came to these issues on the world stage . the g8 's agenda has also broadened significantly throughout its history .
as a result , the g8 member countries now have separate meetings throughout the year for finance , foreign and labor ministers . weighing in on international issues meanwhile the regular meetings of the eight world leaders have turned into a massive media spectacle , often accompanied by protests from anti-globalization activists and opponents of neo-liberal capitalism . the protests reached a climax in july 2001 in genoa , italy , when 23-year-old student and protestor carlo guiliani was brutally beaten and died in clashes between the demonstrators and the police . doubt has often been cast on the political significance of the g-8 talks and its effectiveness in addressing issues of international concerns . however summit participants vehemently defend themselves against the charge . at the opening address of the g-8 summit in evian , france last year , french president chirac said the meet should be based on four principles : solidarity , responsibility , security and democracy .
referring to ' responsibility ' , chirac recommended that " the g-8 states should formulate principles for a responsible market policy oriented towards permanent development , and which is accompanied by concrete actions to , for instance , fight corruption or to use research and innovation to aid the environment . " heavyweight status the german government has also long ceased to describe the g-8 meets as a mere relaxed fireside chat . " the big advantage of the g-8 cooperation is that it links a high degree of flexibility with the necessary economic and political power needed to push through its decisions .

german politicians are up in arms over a planned tax write-off by british telecom giant vodafone that would deny the german government more than € 20 billion in tax revenues . the write-off stems from vodafone 's 2000 takeover of germany 's mannesmann , a telecoms company .
after the telecoms bubble burst in 2001 , the price of vodafone shares dropped dramatically .
experts say the company is now taking advantage of a german tax loophole to write-off the losses it took by paying too much for mannesmann . coming at a time when the federal government is in desperate need of tax income , the planned write-off is being painted by politicians as corporate greed at the expense of the taxpayers .
" it 's an unbelievable outrage , " german member of parliament michael müller told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
the state government in north rhine-westphalia , where mannesmann was based , is also looking into the legality of the move . the state , germany 's largest , is especially dear to chancellor gerhard schröder .
in one year , state elections will prove an important litmus test for his or his social democrat party 's re-electability in federal elections in 2006 .
but tax specialists say the government 's populism on the write-off will not have much of an effect on the decision . " i 'm afraid vodafone has had a very close look at german tax laws and discovered a loophole , " tax expert wolfgang gehrke told deutsche welle .
" this loophole is costing the finance minister up to € 25 billion .
for ordinary german taxpayers this is unacceptable , but only morally and not legally . " lenient laws in 1999 , schröder 's government rewrote the tax laws to give companies leeway to offset past losses against current profits .
in 2001 , vodafone bought mannesmann for € 200 billion , a figure observers thought very high at the time .
when the telecoms bubble burst in 2002 , the price of mannesmann shares dropped from € 309 to € 200 a share , resulting in a loss of about € 50 billion to the mother company , vodafone .
the british company is arguing that the drop in value is permanent , granting it the right to write it off .
the north rhine-westphalian government said it was looking into the matter . mannesmann as scapegoat the uproar over mannesmann is a continuation of a saga surrounding the vodafone takeover and german attitudes toward capitalism . prosecutors are wrapping up a case in düsseldorf against six former mannesmann executives accused of accepting large cash bonuses in order to smooth the way for the vodafone acquisition .
now government officials want to hold mannesmann up for a practice that experts say is commonplace in the corporate world . in 2002 , deutsche telekom wrote off € 21 billion after re-valuing their mobile business in the united states .
german power company e.on wrote off € 2.4 billion of the € 8.1 billion purchase price of the british company powergen . finance ministry officials have ruled out a legislation change , say that enough measures have already been taken to close abuse of the loophole . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank boss cool under fire in mannesmann trial deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , currently facing “ breach of trust ” charges for approving controversial bonuses to mannesmann directors , told a düsseldorf court on thursday that he had nothing to hide .

german politicians are up in arms over a planned tax write-off by british telecom giant vodafone that would deny the german government more than € 20 billion in tax revenues . the write-off stems from vodafone 's 2000 takeover of germany 's mannesmann , a telecoms company .
after the telecoms bubble burst in 2001 , the price of vodafone shares dropped dramatically .
experts say the company is now taking advantage of a german tax loophole to write-off the losses it took by paying too much for mannesmann . coming at a time when the federal government is in desperate need of tax income , the planned write-off is being painted by politicians as corporate greed at the expense of the taxpayers .
" it 's an unbelievable outrage , " german member of parliament michael müller told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
the state government in north rhine-westphalia , where mannesmann was based , is also looking into the legality of the move . the state , germany 's largest , is especially dear to chancellor gerhard schröder .
in one year , state elections will prove an important litmus test for his or his social democrat party 's re-electability in federal elections in 2006 .
but tax specialists say the government 's populism on the write-off will not have much of an effect on the decision . " i 'm afraid vodafone has had a very close look at german tax laws and discovered a loophole , " tax expert wolfgang gehrke told deutsche welle .
" this loophole is costing the finance minister up to € 25 billion .
for ordinary german taxpayers this is unacceptable , but only morally and not legally . " lenient laws in 1999 , schröder 's government rewrote the tax laws to give companies leeway to offset past losses against current profits .
in 2001 , vodafone bought mannesmann for € 200 billion , a figure observers thought very high at the time .
when the telecoms bubble burst in 2002 , the price of mannesmann shares dropped from € 309 to € 200 a share , resulting in a loss of about € 50 billion to the mother company , vodafone .
the british company is arguing that the drop in value is permanent , granting it the right to write it off .

the text , drafted by the united states , which currently chairs the g8 , is set to be unveiled during the summit at sea island , georgia , which begins on june 8 .
during the months of negotiations leading up to the summit , the eu had voiced concerns that the original draft imposed reform from the outside and that a resolution of the arab-israeli conflict did not play a big enough role .
a lukewarm reception to a leaked version of the document earlier this year from arab states helped to cement the need for the group of the world 's most industrialized countries to reform the text .
" i think we have managed to shape it in a way that is very much in line with our own ideas , " a senior eu diplomat said in the run-up to the summit .
brussels is keen to emphasize that the plan is not being imposed from the outside , and that there is no " one size fits all approach . "
the text now focuses on assisting civil society as well as dealing with governments , negating the dependency the original policy would have had on the will of regimes in the region .
the current plan addresses issues of governance , democracy , rule of law , human rights , respect of minorities , rights of women , education and economic potential , according to diplomats .

the text , drafted by the united states , which currently chairs the g8 , is set to be unveiled during the summit at sea island , georgia , which begins on june 8 .
during the months of negotiations leading up to the summit , the eu had voiced concerns that the original draft imposed reform from the outside and that a resolution of the arab-israeli conflict did not play a big enough role .
a lukewarm reception to a leaked version of the document earlier this year from arab states helped to cement the need for the group of the world 's most industrialized countries to reform the text .
" i think we have managed to shape it in a way that is very much in line with our own ideas , " a senior eu diplomat said in the run-up to the summit .
brussels is keen to emphasize that the plan is not being imposed from the outside , and that there is no " one size fits all approach . "
the text now focuses on assisting civil society as well as dealing with governments , negating the dependency the original policy would have had on the will of regimes in the region .
the current plan addresses issues of governance , democracy , rule of law , human rights , respect of minorities , rights of women , education and economic potential , according to diplomats .

the paper reported that the fuel tax would be levied if the other ministers of the german cabinet fail to cooperate with eichel 's planned spending cuts of € 2 billion euros and subsidy reductions of € 1.7 billion .
a tax on jet fuel would n't need the backing of the upper house of parliament , which is controlled by the opposition cdu , who blocked the introduction of vat on international flights last year .
the proposal has been rejected by airlines such as lufthansa and welcomed by environmental groups , who believe a jet fuel tax is long overdue given that the aviation industry is highly environmentally damaging . more briefs 08.06.2004 -pipe- microsoft and sap reveal failed merger talks 08.06.2004 -pipe- germany 's jobless rate falls in may 07.06.2004 -pipe- still no decision on filters for diesel cars 07.06.2004 -pipe- schröder reportedly worried by " nationalist " french industrial policy 07.06.2004 -pipe- subscription to germany 's postbank ipo gets underway 04.06.2004 -pipe- germany and france pledge wind farms cooperation 04.06.2004 -pipe- russia agrees to lift restrictions on eu meat imports 03.06.2004 -pipe- possible swiss-lufthansa partnership seen radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.06.2004 european court to hear öcalan appeal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did turkey violate the human rights of kurdish leader abdullah öcalan ?
the european court of human rights this week takes up the fate of kurdish leader abdullah öcalan .
both ankara and öcalan 's lawyers are appealing portions of an earlier court ruling that he did not get a fair trial . the european court of human rights held in march 2003 that turkey did not give kurdish rebel leader abdullah öcalan a fair trial in 1999 after his spectacular arrest in kenya .
öcalan 's restricted access to his attorneys and other irregularities in the case , including the presence of a military judge , led the strasbourg court to rule the case had been " unfair " and its order that the turkish government to pay € 100,000 of öcalan 's legal fees .
now , both sides are contesting the ruling by the court 's lower chamber - turkey in an effort to clear its human rights record and öcalan in an effort to get a re-trial .
turkey which is currently negotiating a starting date for european union talks to become a member of the european union , was harshly criticized for its treatment of öcalan , which many viewed as inhumane .
the court 's original ruling cast an uncomfortable spotlight on turkey 's spotty human rights record .
with its strong eu aspirations , ankara has undertaken a series of major democratic reforms of its justice system and now wants to wash its hands clean of the messy case and is seeking to a reversal of the previous ruling .
during its rehearing of the case , which begins on wednesday , the court will have to answer some tough questions , including whether öcalan 's arrest , his kidnapping from kenya to turkey or his trial in a state security court was in harmony with european legal standards .
an international conspiracy ?
a turkish special commando trapped the 55-year-old leader of the militant kurdish separatist organization pkk -lrb- kurdistan worker 's party -rrb- in february 1999 , arrested him and then flew him to turkey .
öcalan had been stranded in nairobi , kenya , in february 1999 after an odyssey through several european countries following his expulsion from syria , where he was living in exile .
öcalan 's lawyers believe his arrest and kidnapping violated international legal conventions .
they are now demanding the testimony of heads of government , ministers and intelligence agency officials from a number of eu countries and turkey to buttress their case .
they have also described their client 's arrest as the result of an " international plot . "
but on that point and that of his life in isolation , öcalan faces an uphill battle with the judges .
the ruling of the court of first instance discounted öcalan 's claims of a sweeping international conspiracy , and also held that the isolated conditions of his prison , where he is the sole inmate , on imrali island near istanbul did not violate any laws .
as part of the overtures ankara is making to brussels for possible future eu membership , it recently eliminated the military courts , banned capital punishment and consequently commuted öcalan 's sentence for high treason in accord with its constitutional amendments to life imprisonment .
pkk fight against turkey according to opinion polls , the majority of turks hold öcalan accountable for the pkk 's failed bid to create an independent kurdistan on turkish soil between 1984 and 1999 .
pkk-led guerrilla fighting , which öcalan orchestrated from neighboring syria , led to the deaths of 40,000 people , including kurds and turkish soldiers .
the skirmishes injured hundreds of thousands , and millions of kurds and other minorities were displaced from settlement areas in regions of east and southeast anatolya were the heaviest fighting occurred .
the international community strongly criticized turkey at the time for its refusal to grant minority rights to the kurds .
if the strasbourg court decides in öcalan 's favor , turkey could be forced to hold a new trial .
but öcalan 's lawyers say it would be impossible for a fair trial to be held in turkey and are instead demanding that the issue , which they say effects all people in turkey , be taken up by the international criminal court in the hague . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey to abolish the death penalty in a landmark decision , the turkish parliament pushed ahead with a reform package that includes lifting the death penalty in peacetime .

the european court of human rights this week takes up the fate of kurdish leader abdullah öcalan .
both ankara and öcalan 's lawyers are appealing portions of an earlier court ruling that he did not get a fair trial . the european court of human rights held in march 2003 that turkey did not give kurdish rebel leader abdullah öcalan a fair trial in 1999 after his spectacular arrest in kenya .
öcalan 's restricted access to his attorneys and other irregularities in the case , including the presence of a military judge , led the strasbourg court to rule the case had been " unfair " and its order that the turkish government to pay € 100,000 of öcalan 's legal fees .
now , both sides are contesting the ruling by the court 's lower chamber - turkey in an effort to clear its human rights record and öcalan in an effort to get a re-trial .
turkey which is currently negotiating a starting date for european union talks to become a member of the european union , was harshly criticized for its treatment of öcalan , which many viewed as inhumane .
the court 's original ruling cast an uncomfortable spotlight on turkey 's spotty human rights record .
with its strong eu aspirations , ankara has undertaken a series of major democratic reforms of its justice system and now wants to wash its hands clean of the messy case and is seeking to a reversal of the previous ruling .
during its rehearing of the case , which begins on wednesday , the court will have to answer some tough questions , including whether öcalan 's arrest , his kidnapping from kenya to turkey or his trial in a state security court was in harmony with european legal standards .
an international conspiracy ?
a turkish special commando trapped the 55-year-old leader of the militant kurdish separatist organization pkk -lrb- kurdistan worker 's party -rrb- in february 1999 , arrested him and then flew him to turkey .
öcalan had been stranded in nairobi , kenya , in february 1999 after an odyssey through several european countries following his expulsion from syria , where he was living in exile .
öcalan 's lawyers believe his arrest and kidnapping violated international legal conventions .
they are now demanding the testimony of heads of government , ministers and intelligence agency officials from a number of eu countries and turkey to buttress their case .
they have also described their client 's arrest as the result of an " international plot . "
but on that point and that of his life in isolation , öcalan faces an uphill battle with the judges .
the ruling of the court of first instance discounted öcalan 's claims of a sweeping international conspiracy , and also held that the isolated conditions of his prison , where he is the sole inmate , on imrali island near istanbul did not violate any laws .
as part of the overtures ankara is making to brussels for possible future eu membership , it recently eliminated the military courts , banned capital punishment and consequently commuted öcalan 's sentence for high treason in accord with its constitutional amendments to life imprisonment .
pkk fight against turkey according to opinion polls , the majority of turks hold öcalan accountable for the pkk 's failed bid to create an independent kurdistan on turkish soil between 1984 and 1999 .
pkk-led guerrilla fighting , which öcalan orchestrated from neighboring syria , led to the deaths of 40,000 people , including kurds and turkish soldiers .
the skirmishes injured hundreds of thousands , and millions of kurds and other minorities were displaced from settlement areas in regions of east and southeast anatolya were the heaviest fighting occurred .
the international community strongly criticized turkey at the time for its refusal to grant minority rights to the kurds .
if the strasbourg court decides in öcalan 's favor , turkey could be forced to hold a new trial .
but öcalan 's lawyers say it would be impossible for a fair trial to be held in turkey and are instead demanding that the issue , which they say effects all people in turkey , be taken up by the international criminal court in the hague . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey to abolish the death penalty in a landmark decision , the turkish parliament pushed ahead with a reform package that includes lifting the death penalty in peacetime .

the european court of human rights this week takes up the fate of kurdish leader abdullah öcalan .
both ankara and öcalan 's lawyers are appealing portions of an earlier court ruling that he did not get a fair trial . the european court of human rights held in march 2003 that turkey did not give kurdish rebel leader abdullah öcalan a fair trial in 1999 after his spectacular arrest in kenya .
öcalan 's restricted access to his attorneys and other irregularities in the case , including the presence of a military judge , led the strasbourg court to rule the case had been " unfair " and its order that the turkish government to pay € 100,000 of öcalan 's legal fees .
now , both sides are contesting the ruling by the court 's lower chamber - turkey in an effort to clear its human rights record and öcalan in an effort to get a re-trial .
turkey which is currently negotiating a starting date for european union talks to become a member of the european union , was harshly criticized for its treatment of öcalan , which many viewed as inhumane .
the court 's original ruling cast an uncomfortable spotlight on turkey 's spotty human rights record .
with its strong eu aspirations , ankara has undertaken a series of major democratic reforms of its justice system and now wants to wash its hands clean of the messy case and is seeking to a reversal of the previous ruling .
during its rehearing of the case , which begins on wednesday , the court will have to answer some tough questions , including whether öcalan 's arrest , his kidnapping from kenya to turkey or his trial in a state security court was in harmony with european legal standards .
an international conspiracy ?
a turkish special commando trapped the 55-year-old leader of the militant kurdish separatist organization pkk -lrb- kurdistan worker 's party -rrb- in february 1999 , arrested him and then flew him to turkey .
öcalan had been stranded in nairobi , kenya , in february 1999 after an odyssey through several european countries following his expulsion from syria , where he was living in exile .
öcalan 's lawyers believe his arrest and kidnapping violated international legal conventions .
they are now demanding the testimony of heads of government , ministers and intelligence agency officials from a number of eu countries and turkey to buttress their case .
they have also described their client 's arrest as the result of an " international plot . "
but on that point and that of his life in isolation , öcalan faces an uphill battle with the judges .
the ruling of the court of first instance discounted öcalan 's claims of a sweeping international conspiracy , and also held that the isolated conditions of his prison , where he is the sole inmate , on imrali island near istanbul did not violate any laws .
as part of the overtures ankara is making to brussels for possible future eu membership , it recently eliminated the military courts , banned capital punishment and consequently commuted öcalan 's sentence for high treason in accord with its constitutional amendments to life imprisonment .
pkk fight against turkey according to opinion polls , the majority of turks hold öcalan accountable for the pkk 's failed bid to create an independent kurdistan on turkish soil between 1984 and 1999 .
pkk-led guerrilla fighting , which öcalan orchestrated from neighboring syria , led to the deaths of 40,000 people , including kurds and turkish soldiers .
the skirmishes injured hundreds of thousands , and millions of kurds and other minorities were displaced from settlement areas in regions of east and southeast anatolya were the heaviest fighting occurred .
the international community strongly criticized turkey at the time for its refusal to grant minority rights to the kurds .
if the strasbourg court decides in öcalan 's favor , turkey could be forced to hold a new trial .
but öcalan 's lawyers say it would be impossible for a fair trial to be held in turkey and are instead demanding that the issue , which they say effects all people in turkey , be taken up by the international criminal court in the hague . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey to abolish the death penalty in a landmark decision , the turkish parliament pushed ahead with a reform package that includes lifting the death penalty in peacetime .

music labels clamping down on music pirates scored their first victory in germany on tuesday .
meanwhile , the competition in the legal online music trade is heating up with the launch of apple itunes in europe next week . for one music enthusiast in the eastern german city of cottbus , the good times of downloading music for free via peer-to-peer file-sharing programs like kazaa came to an abrupt end on tuesday .
he was convicted in a german court of copyright infringement , according to a statement released by the german federal association of the phonographic industry in berlin . the 23-year-old will have to fork over a hefty € 8,000 -lrb- $ 9,855 -rrb- in fines in addition to covering the legal costs of the case . the case is expected to set a precedent for future cases , said gerd gebhard , the chairman of the association , and will also serve as a cautionary tale to those considering illegal music file-sharing . clamping down on illegal downloaders the case , one of 68 brought against people who download music illegally in germany , represents a significant victory for a music industry desperate to stem the tide of lost profits since music file-sharing and downloading software like kazaa and napster became hugely popular . in germany alone , internet piracy contributed to a 20 percent drop in profits , which has resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs , according to industry officials .
globally , losses are estimated at $ 2.4 billion -lrb- € 1.96 -rrb- a year . the strategy of pursuing illegal music pirates in the courts is part of a two-pronged approach .
in addition , music industry executives are hoping to bring illegal file-swappers back into the market by offering them the chance to download music legally - for a fee - via a host of new legal and industry-sponsored online platforms . itunes europe in june ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple launched its itunes music store to feed its wildly popular ipod digital players .
with a major announcement about the introduction of apple 's itunes music shop service in europe next week in london , the competition in the legal online music branch is about to heat up , and a price war between new entrants into the market could benefit consumers .
but perils exist for all market entrants : the already troubled german online platform , phonoline , will struggle to survive the intense competition , while apple may find marketing online tunes in europe more challenging than in the united states . shrouded in secrecy , apple ceo steve jobs has called a press conference for june 15 saying only that , " the biggest story in music is about to get even bigger " .
it is expected that apple will announce the long-anticipated launch of the european version of their online music store , which is already hugely popular in the united states .
a launch is expectedly imminently in britain , where anglo-saxon copyright rules make it easier to negotiate with rights-holders and record companies , but launches in france and germany could also come at the same time . in the first year , stateside music fans flocked to the site to download - and pay for - more than 70 million songs .
no doubt apple executives hope to repeat their success in europe .
however , they will find increased competition in the european market from a host of recently launched clones . on may 20 , napster launched in britain , joining industry leader od2 .
sony is expected to enter into the european market at the end of june .

he was convicted in a german court of copyright infringement , according to a statement released by the german federal association of the phonographic industry in berlin . the 23-year-old will have to fork over a hefty € 8,000 -lrb- $ 9,855 -rrb- in fines in addition to covering the legal costs of the case . the case is expected to set a precedent for future cases , said gerd gebhard , the chairman of the association , and will also serve as a cautionary tale to those considering illegal music file-sharing . clamping down on illegal downloaders the case , one of 68 brought against people who download music illegally in germany , represents a significant victory for a music industry desperate to stem the tide of lost profits since music file-sharing and downloading software like kazaa and napster became hugely popular . in germany alone , internet piracy contributed to a 20 percent drop in profits , which has resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs , according to industry officials .
globally , losses are estimated at $ 2.4 billion -lrb- € 1.96 -rrb- a year . the strategy of pursuing illegal music pirates in the courts is part of a two-pronged approach .

with a major announcement about the introduction of apple 's itunes music shop service in europe next week in london , the competition in the legal online music branch is about to heat up , and a price war between new entrants into the market could benefit consumers .
but perils exist for all market entrants : the already troubled german online platform , phonoline , will struggle to survive the intense competition , while apple may find marketing online tunes in europe more challenging than in the united states . shrouded in secrecy , apple ceo steve jobs has called a press conference for june 15 saying only that , " the biggest story in music is about to get even bigger " .
it is expected that apple will announce the long-anticipated launch of the european version of their online music store , which is already hugely popular in the united states .
a launch is expectedly imminently in britain , where anglo-saxon copyright rules make it easier to negotiate with rights-holders and record companies , but launches in france and germany could also come at the same time . in the first year , stateside music fans flocked to the site to download - and pay for - more than 70 million songs .

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 08.06.2004 china : the uninvited guest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is open to the west , but still not part of the g-8 the g-8 summit brings together leaders from the world 's richest and most influential countries .
but there is one country missing from the guest list - china , which has grown to be the world ’ s sixth largest economy . it ’ s difficult these days not to mention china when talking about the state of the global economy .
but the leaders of the world ’ s top nations appear to be trying to do just that at their annual g-8 summit currently underway in georgia in the southern united states .
despite the fact that china has grown into the world ’ s sixth largest economy , surpassing g-8 members russia and canada , beijing doesn ’ t have a representative at the meeting .
china feels it rightly belongs at the gathering of the world 's richest and most influential countries .
no other nation drives the world 's market for natural resources more than china with its insatiable appetite for oil , gas and steel ; and no other nation can boast a record of imports and exports that are growing at such staggering rates .
a revaluation of the yuan would send waves through financial markets worldwide , an indicator of how closely watched the asian giant is .
it therefore comes as a surprise to many chinese that their country still hasn ’ t been invited to become a member of the g-8 or at least attend the summit as a guest such as the european commission .
a new foreign strategy the chinese state media once derided the g-8 as a " club of the rich " and said it competed against the united nations for global influence .
today , however , the desire to join the club is more prevalent than ever , says beijing professor for international relations zhang xizhen .
" this altered interest is part of china ’ s new strategy of foreign policy , " he says .
" everyone knows that china was once a closed country that the west in particular couldn ’ t trust .
but recent reforms and more experience with the west have begun to change things here . "
beijing has realized that it can only deal with today ’ s challenges of globalization by cooperating with the world 's biggest economies .
" this is why china is trying to play a more international role , and it ’ s only natural that it wants to be included in the g-8 , " says xizhen .
but china ’ s failure to live up to promises it made when it joined the world trade organization compounds the group of eight 's hesitation about admitting it into the circle of top industrialized countries .
beijing 's continuing poor human rights record also weighs against china being classified as an exemplary democracy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : educating germany germans mull sweeping education reforms germany to introduce federal school standards bad grades for german schools report lambastes german schools germany -pipe- 08.06.2004 germany to spend € 1.9 billion to develop elite universities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's humboldt university is one of a number of schools that could vie for elite status .
berlin is planning to give its stagnating university system a shot in the arm with a € 1.9 billion program to create germany 's version of ivy league elite colleges .
officials hope it will spur academic competition . faced with overcrowded lecture halls , outdated teaching materials and unmotivated professors , students in germany often take years to finish courses .
but chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s center-left government now wants to reinvigorate the country 's system of higher education , aiming to spend about € 1.9 billion in extra money for universities over the next five years .
education minister edelgard bulmahn says the money is to encourage competition between universities and to reward centers of excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn says elite universities will help germany compete better in the global marketplace .
" we need a climate where universities engage in competition , " bulmahn said on monday .
" we have a lot of experience funding and organizing outstanding scientific excellence in our research institutes .
but we don ’ t have high-performance universities that are acknowledged worldwide .
so that means we need more competition between universities and the willingness to attract people not only from our own universities and surroundings , but from abroad as well . "
germany ’ s long-standing image of the land of poets and philosophers has been severely tarnished in recent years as international studies on education have shown the german primary school system to be mediocre at best .
the situation in the country 's universities is only slightly better .
academic competition bulmahn wants germany to become more active in the race for the world ’ s best brains by establishing elite universities that one day , the government hopes , will rival harvard , oxford or american ivy league universities .
the plan for the extra funding has received the full backing from the country ’ s powerful state premiers , who are in charge of education here , and a competition to determine which universities get the money will be held later this year .
ten will be singled out , with each receiving an extra € 25 million a year .
a parallel program will also reward individual departments with strong academic records and leading research groups .
the competition for the pot of gold will be fierce because many university heads , including dieter lenzen of berlin ’ s free university , think they stand a good chance of winning .
" there is already a ranking of german universities , " he says .
" and after munich and heidelberg , berlin ’ s free university is in third place .
so i think we are well-positioned for the competition . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.06.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc france and germany fight over police post the appointment of the new director of europol , the european police office , has put france and germany at loggerheads , with both backing their own candidate to get the post .
this question will surface again when eu justice and interior ministers meet on tuesday in luxembourg .
lack of agreement between these two countries could see the issue being postponed for a summit of eu leaders next week .
time is slipping away as the term of the present director , german jürgen storbeck , terminates at the end of this month .
but the need for eu member states to agree unanimously on the next person to head the office has blocked the issue for months .
the frenchman jacques franquet - director of the international and technical police cooperation service -lrb- scitp -rrb- is seen as the front runner , but germany is backing storbeck , who wants his mandate to be renewed .
although senior italian officer emanuele marotta is also a candidate , eu officials say that the race is now between the french and the german candidates .
a possible compromise has already been floated by german interior minister otto schily .
according to one eu diplomat , schily said he would consider accepting franquet if the post of director general for justice and home affairs in the council was offered to a german .
" it is clear there is still not a meeting of minds , " the irish eu presidency said on monday .

berlin is planning to give its stagnating university system a shot in the arm with a € 1.9 billion program to create germany 's version of ivy league elite colleges .
officials hope it will spur academic competition . faced with overcrowded lecture halls , outdated teaching materials and unmotivated professors , students in germany often take years to finish courses .
but chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s center-left government now wants to reinvigorate the country 's system of higher education , aiming to spend about € 1.9 billion in extra money for universities over the next five years .
education minister edelgard bulmahn says the money is to encourage competition between universities and to reward centers of excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn says elite universities will help germany compete better in the global marketplace .
" we need a climate where universities engage in competition , " bulmahn said on monday .
" we have a lot of experience funding and organizing outstanding scientific excellence in our research institutes .
but we don ’ t have high-performance universities that are acknowledged worldwide .
so that means we need more competition between universities and the willingness to attract people not only from our own universities and surroundings , but from abroad as well . "
germany ’ s long-standing image of the land of poets and philosophers has been severely tarnished in recent years as international studies on education have shown the german primary school system to be mediocre at best .
the situation in the country 's universities is only slightly better .
academic competition bulmahn wants germany to become more active in the race for the world ’ s best brains by establishing elite universities that one day , the government hopes , will rival harvard , oxford or american ivy league universities .
the plan for the extra funding has received the full backing from the country ’ s powerful state premiers , who are in charge of education here , and a competition to determine which universities get the money will be held later this year .
ten will be singled out , with each receiving an extra € 25 million a year .
a parallel program will also reward individual departments with strong academic records and leading research groups .
the competition for the pot of gold will be fierce because many university heads , including dieter lenzen of berlin ’ s free university , think they stand a good chance of winning .
" there is already a ranking of german universities , " he says .
" and after munich and heidelberg , berlin ’ s free university is in third place .
so i think we are well-positioned for the competition . "

" it is of course important to establish elite institutions , " says karl einhäuptl of the national science council , " but at the same time we must strive to maintain the high standards of our universities in general .
it ’ s not surprising that german scientists are wanted by american institutions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.06.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc france and germany fight over police post the appointment of the new director of europol , the european police office , has put france and germany at loggerheads , with both backing their own candidate to get the post .
this question will surface again when eu justice and interior ministers meet on tuesday in luxembourg .
lack of agreement between these two countries could see the issue being postponed for a summit of eu leaders next week .
time is slipping away as the term of the present director , german jürgen storbeck , terminates at the end of this month .
but the need for eu member states to agree unanimously on the next person to head the office has blocked the issue for months .
the frenchman jacques franquet - director of the international and technical police cooperation service -lrb- scitp -rrb- is seen as the front runner , but germany is backing storbeck , who wants his mandate to be renewed .
although senior italian officer emanuele marotta is also a candidate , eu officials say that the race is now between the french and the german candidates .
a possible compromise has already been floated by german interior minister otto schily .
according to one eu diplomat , schily said he would consider accepting franquet if the post of director general for justice and home affairs in the council was offered to a german .
" it is clear there is still not a meeting of minds , " the irish eu presidency said on monday .
" we are anxious to get an outcome and a decision on the filling of this post .

this question will surface again when eu justice and interior ministers meet on tuesday in luxembourg .
lack of agreement between these two countries could see the issue being postponed for a summit of eu leaders next week .
time is slipping away as the term of the present director , german jürgen storbeck , terminates at the end of this month .
but the need for eu member states to agree unanimously on the next person to head the office has blocked the issue for months .
the frenchman jacques franquet - director of the international and technical police cooperation service -lrb- scitp -rrb- is seen as the front runner , but germany is backing storbeck , who wants his mandate to be renewed .
although senior italian officer emanuele marotta is also a candidate , eu officials say that the race is now between the french and the german candidates .
a possible compromise has already been floated by german interior minister otto schily .
according to one eu diplomat , schily said he would consider accepting franquet if the post of director general for justice and home affairs in the council was offered to a german .
" it is clear there is still not a meeting of minds , " the irish eu presidency said on monday .
" we are anxious to get an outcome and a decision on the filling of this post .
it is certainly about time that a decision is taken " .
europol was set up to improve police cooperation between the member states in combating terrorism , illicit traffic in drugs and other serious forms of international crime .

german politicians are up in arms over a planned tax write-off by british telecom giant vodafone that would deny the german government more than € 20 billion in tax revenues . the write-off stems from vodafone 's 2000 takeover of germany 's mannesmann , a telecoms company .
after the telecoms bubble burst in 2001 , the price of vodafone shares dropped dramatically .
experts say the company is now taking advantage of a german tax loophole to write-off the losses it took by paying too much for mannesmann . coming at a time when the federal government is in desperate need of tax income , the planned write-off is being painted by politicians as corporate greed at the expense of the taxpayers .
" it 's an unbelievable outrage , " german member of parliament michael müller told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
the state government in north rhine-westphalia , where mannesmann was based , is also looking into the legality of the move . the state , germany 's largest , is especially dear to chancellor gerhard schröder .
in one year , state elections will prove an important litmus test for his or his social democrat party 's re-electability in federal elections in 2006 .
but tax specialists say the government 's populism on the write-off will not have much of an effect on the decision . " i 'm afraid vodafone has had a very close look at german tax laws and discovered a loophole , " tax expert wolfgang gehrke told deutsche welle .
" this loophole is costing the finance minister up to € 25 billion .
for ordinary german taxpayers this is unacceptable , but only morally and not legally . " lenient laws in 1999 , schröder 's government rewrote the tax laws to give companies leeway to offset past losses against current profits .
in 2001 , vodafone bought mannesmann for € 200 billion , a figure observers thought very high at the time .
when the telecoms bubble burst in 2002 , the price of mannesmann shares dropped from € 309 to € 200 a share , resulting in a loss of about € 50 billion to the mother company , vodafone .
the british company is arguing that the drop in value is permanent , granting it the right to write it off .
the north rhine-westphalian government said it was looking into the matter . mannesmann as scapegoat the uproar over mannesmann is a continuation of a saga surrounding the vodafone takeover and german attitudes toward capitalism . prosecutors are wrapping up a case in düsseldorf against six former mannesmann executives accused of accepting large cash bonuses in order to smooth the way for the vodafone acquisition .

berlin is planning to give its stagnating university system a shot in the arm with a € 1.9 billion program to create germany 's version of ivy league elite colleges .
officials hope it will spur academic competition . faced with overcrowded lecture halls , outdated teaching materials and unmotivated professors , students in germany often take years to finish courses .
but chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s center-left government now wants to reinvigorate the country 's system of higher education , aiming to spend about € 1.9 billion in extra money for universities over the next five years .
education minister edelgard bulmahn says the money is to encourage competition between universities and to reward centers of excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn says elite universities will help germany compete better in the global marketplace .
" we need a climate where universities engage in competition , " bulmahn said on monday .
" we have a lot of experience funding and organizing outstanding scientific excellence in our research institutes .
but we don ’ t have high-performance universities that are acknowledged worldwide .
so that means we need more competition between universities and the willingness to attract people not only from our own universities and surroundings , but from abroad as well . "
germany ’ s long-standing image of the land of poets and philosophers has been severely tarnished in recent years as international studies on education have shown the german primary school system to be mediocre at best .
the situation in the country 's universities is only slightly better .
academic competition bulmahn wants germany to become more active in the race for the world ’ s best brains by establishing elite universities that one day , the government hopes , will rival harvard , oxford or american ivy league universities .
the plan for the extra funding has received the full backing from the country ’ s powerful state premiers , who are in charge of education here , and a competition to determine which universities get the money will be held later this year .
ten will be singled out , with each receiving an extra € 25 million a year .
a parallel program will also reward individual departments with strong academic records and leading research groups .
the competition for the pot of gold will be fierce because many university heads , including dieter lenzen of berlin ’ s free university , think they stand a good chance of winning .
" there is already a ranking of german universities , " he says .
" and after munich and heidelberg , berlin ’ s free university is in third place .
so i think we are well-positioned for the competition . "
a jury of german research and science experts is to establish criteria for selecting the best universities .
internationally renowned research results and an emphasis on promoting talented students , are said to be among them .
fear of neglect but some observers have warned the government against neglecting the broader spectrum of university education in its drive for top performance and elite schools .
" it is of course important to establish elite institutions , " says karl einhäuptl of the national science council , " but at the same time we must strive to maintain the high standards of our universities in general .
it ’ s not surprising that german scientists are wanted by american institutions .
that ’ s because they are well-trained . "
the initiative is also meant to attract more foreign students to german universities .
easier access to jobs here , which is expected to come with a new immigration law and the absence of tuition fees , the government hopes , will serve as extra incentives to aspiring academics from abroad . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : an elite university or a university for the elite ?
after chancellor schröder ’ s social democrats aired proposals to set up a small network of elite universities similar to ones in the united states and britain , editorials across the country criticized the initiative .

berlin is planning to give its stagnating university system a shot in the arm with a € 1.9 billion program to create germany 's version of ivy league elite colleges .
officials hope it will spur academic competition . faced with overcrowded lecture halls , outdated teaching materials and unmotivated professors , students in germany often take years to finish courses .
but chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s center-left government now wants to reinvigorate the country 's system of higher education , aiming to spend about € 1.9 billion in extra money for universities over the next five years .
education minister edelgard bulmahn says the money is to encourage competition between universities and to reward centers of excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn says elite universities will help germany compete better in the global marketplace .
" we need a climate where universities engage in competition , " bulmahn said on monday .
" we have a lot of experience funding and organizing outstanding scientific excellence in our research institutes .
but we don ’ t have high-performance universities that are acknowledged worldwide .
so that means we need more competition between universities and the willingness to attract people not only from our own universities and surroundings , but from abroad as well . "
germany ’ s long-standing image of the land of poets and philosophers has been severely tarnished in recent years as international studies on education have shown the german primary school system to be mediocre at best .
the situation in the country 's universities is only slightly better .

german politicians are up in arms over a planned tax write-off by british telecom giant vodafone that would deny the german government more than € 20 billion in tax revenues . the write-off stems from vodafone 's 2000 takeover of germany 's mannesmann , a telecoms company .
after the telecoms bubble burst in 2001 , the price of vodafone shares dropped dramatically .
experts say the company is now taking advantage of a german tax loophole to write-off the losses it took by paying too much for mannesmann . coming at a time when the federal government is in desperate need of tax income , the planned write-off is being painted by politicians as corporate greed at the expense of the taxpayers .
" it 's an unbelievable outrage , " german member of parliament michael müller told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
the state government in north rhine-westphalia , where mannesmann was based , is also looking into the legality of the move . the state , germany 's largest , is especially dear to chancellor gerhard schröder .
in one year , state elections will prove an important litmus test for his or his social democrat party 's re-electability in federal elections in 2006 .
but tax specialists say the government 's populism on the write-off will not have much of an effect on the decision . " i 'm afraid vodafone has had a very close look at german tax laws and discovered a loophole , " tax expert wolfgang gehrke told deutsche welle .
" this loophole is costing the finance minister up to € 25 billion .
for ordinary german taxpayers this is unacceptable , but only morally and not legally . " lenient laws in 1999 , schröder 's government rewrote the tax laws to give companies leeway to offset past losses against current profits .
in 2001 , vodafone bought mannesmann for € 200 billion , a figure observers thought very high at the time .
when the telecoms bubble burst in 2002 , the price of mannesmann shares dropped from € 309 to € 200 a share , resulting in a loss of about € 50 billion to the mother company , vodafone .
the british company is arguing that the drop in value is permanent , granting it the right to write it off .
the north rhine-westphalian government said it was looking into the matter . mannesmann as scapegoat the uproar over mannesmann is a continuation of a saga surrounding the vodafone takeover and german attitudes toward capitalism . prosecutors are wrapping up a case in düsseldorf against six former mannesmann executives accused of accepting large cash bonuses in order to smooth the way for the vodafone acquisition .
now government officials want to hold mannesmann up for a practice that experts say is commonplace in the corporate world . in 2002 , deutsche telekom wrote off € 21 billion after re-valuing their mobile business in the united states .
german power company e.on wrote off € 2.4 billion of the € 8.1 billion purchase price of the british company powergen . finance ministry officials have ruled out a legislation change , say that enough measures have already been taken to close abuse of the loophole . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank boss cool under fire in mannesmann trial deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , currently facing “ breach of trust ” charges for approving controversial bonuses to mannesmann directors , told a düsseldorf court on thursday that he had nothing to hide .

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 08.06.2004 china : the uninvited guest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is open to the west , but still not part of the g-8 the g-8 summit brings together leaders from the world 's richest and most influential countries .
but there is one country missing from the guest list - china , which has grown to be the world ’ s sixth largest economy . it ’ s difficult these days not to mention china when talking about the state of the global economy .
but the leaders of the world ’ s top nations appear to be trying to do just that at their annual g-8 summit currently underway in georgia in the southern united states .
despite the fact that china has grown into the world ’ s sixth largest economy , surpassing g-8 members russia and canada , beijing doesn ’ t have a representative at the meeting .
china feels it rightly belongs at the gathering of the world 's richest and most influential countries .
no other nation drives the world 's market for natural resources more than china with its insatiable appetite for oil , gas and steel ; and no other nation can boast a record of imports and exports that are growing at such staggering rates .
a revaluation of the yuan would send waves through financial markets worldwide , an indicator of how closely watched the asian giant is .
it therefore comes as a surprise to many chinese that their country still hasn ’ t been invited to become a member of the g-8 or at least attend the summit as a guest such as the european commission .
a new foreign strategy the chinese state media once derided the g-8 as a " club of the rich " and said it competed against the united nations for global influence .
today , however , the desire to join the club is more prevalent than ever , says beijing professor for international relations zhang xizhen .
" this altered interest is part of china ’ s new strategy of foreign policy , " he says .
" everyone knows that china was once a closed country that the west in particular couldn ’ t trust .
but recent reforms and more experience with the west have begun to change things here . "
beijing has realized that it can only deal with today ’ s challenges of globalization by cooperating with the world 's biggest economies .
" this is why china is trying to play a more international role , and it ’ s only natural that it wants to be included in the g-8 , " says xizhen .
but china ’ s failure to live up to promises it made when it joined the world trade organization compounds the group of eight 's hesitation about admitting it into the circle of top industrialized countries .
beijing 's continuing poor human rights record also weighs against china being classified as an exemplary democracy .

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 08.06.2004 china : the uninvited guest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is open to the west , but still not part of the g-8 the g-8 summit brings together leaders from the world 's richest and most influential countries .
but there is one country missing from the guest list - china , which has grown to be the world ’ s sixth largest economy . it ’ s difficult these days not to mention china when talking about the state of the global economy .
but the leaders of the world ’ s top nations appear to be trying to do just that at their annual g-8 summit currently underway in georgia in the southern united states .
despite the fact that china has grown into the world ’ s sixth largest economy , surpassing g-8 members russia and canada , beijing doesn ’ t have a representative at the meeting .
china feels it rightly belongs at the gathering of the world 's richest and most influential countries .
no other nation drives the world 's market for natural resources more than china with its insatiable appetite for oil , gas and steel ; and no other nation can boast a record of imports and exports that are growing at such staggering rates .
a revaluation of the yuan would send waves through financial markets worldwide , an indicator of how closely watched the asian giant is .
it therefore comes as a surprise to many chinese that their country still hasn ’ t been invited to become a member of the g-8 or at least attend the summit as a guest such as the european commission .
a new foreign strategy the chinese state media once derided the g-8 as a " club of the rich " and said it competed against the united nations for global influence .
today , however , the desire to join the club is more prevalent than ever , says beijing professor for international relations zhang xizhen .
" this altered interest is part of china ’ s new strategy of foreign policy , " he says .
" everyone knows that china was once a closed country that the west in particular couldn ’ t trust .
but recent reforms and more experience with the west have begun to change things here . "
beijing has realized that it can only deal with today ’ s challenges of globalization by cooperating with the world 's biggest economies .
" this is why china is trying to play a more international role , and it ’ s only natural that it wants to be included in the g-8 , " says xizhen .
but china ’ s failure to live up to promises it made when it joined the world trade organization compounds the group of eight 's hesitation about admitting it into the circle of top industrialized countries .
beijing 's continuing poor human rights record also weighs against china being classified as an exemplary democracy .
the chinese , however , counter such skepticism by claiming their country can only get on the proper track with the aid of the international community . kerstin lohse for mdr -lrb- sh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the view from the summit dw-world 's special on the background , history and goals of the g-8 as well as news from the summit in sea island , off georgia 's atlantic coast bmw moves into high gear in china bmw became the latest heavyweight investor on the chinese car market this week with the opening of its own factory in shenyang , making china one of the biggest foreign production sites for german automakers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.06.2004 german music industry wins first court case against music pirates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilfering kazaa users have seen better days in germany .
music labels clamping down on music pirates scored their first victory in germany on tuesday .
meanwhile , the competition in the legal online music trade is heating up with the launch of apple itunes in europe next week . for one music enthusiast in the eastern german city of cottbus , the good times of downloading music for free via peer-to-peer file-sharing programs like kazaa came to an abrupt end on tuesday .
he was convicted in a german court of copyright infringement , according to a statement released by the german federal association of the phonographic industry in berlin . the 23-year-old will have to fork over a hefty € 8,000 -lrb- $ 9,855 -rrb- in fines in addition to covering the legal costs of the case . the case is expected to set a precedent for future cases , said gerd gebhard , the chairman of the association , and will also serve as a cautionary tale to those considering illegal music file-sharing . clamping down on illegal downloaders the case , one of 68 brought against people who download music illegally in germany , represents a significant victory for a music industry desperate to stem the tide of lost profits since music file-sharing and downloading software like kazaa and napster became hugely popular . in germany alone , internet piracy contributed to a 20 percent drop in profits , which has resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs , according to industry officials .
globally , losses are estimated at $ 2.4 billion -lrb- € 1.96 -rrb- a year . the strategy of pursuing illegal music pirates in the courts is part of a two-pronged approach .
in addition , music industry executives are hoping to bring illegal file-swappers back into the market by offering them the chance to download music legally - for a fee - via a host of new legal and industry-sponsored online platforms . itunes europe in june ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple launched its itunes music store to feed its wildly popular ipod digital players .
with a major announcement about the introduction of apple 's itunes music shop service in europe next week in london , the competition in the legal online music branch is about to heat up , and a price war between new entrants into the market could benefit consumers .
but perils exist for all market entrants : the already troubled german online platform , phonoline , will struggle to survive the intense competition , while apple may find marketing online tunes in europe more challenging than in the united states . shrouded in secrecy , apple ceo steve jobs has called a press conference for june 15 saying only that , " the biggest story in music is about to get even bigger " .
it is expected that apple will announce the long-anticipated launch of the european version of their online music store , which is already hugely popular in the united states .
a launch is expectedly imminently in britain , where anglo-saxon copyright rules make it easier to negotiate with rights-holders and record companies , but launches in france and germany could also come at the same time . in the first year , stateside music fans flocked to the site to download - and pay for - more than 70 million songs .
no doubt apple executives hope to repeat their success in europe .
however , they will find increased competition in the european market from a host of recently launched clones . on may 20 , napster launched in britain , joining industry leader od2 .
sony is expected to enter into the european market at the end of june .
in germany , music labels launched their own online music store , phoneline , in march , though the effort has been plagued by criticisms that the library is too limited and prices too high . individual members of the music industry throughout europe are engaged in a bitter struggle to attract customers amidst fierce competition . dw staff -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german online music platform 's troubled first weeks just weeks after its launch , phonoline , germany 's first online music platform , is the object of much criticism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.06.2004 european court to hear öcalan appeal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did turkey violate the human rights of kurdish leader abdullah öcalan ?
the european court of human rights this week takes up the fate of kurdish leader abdullah öcalan .
both ankara and öcalan 's lawyers are appealing portions of an earlier court ruling that he did not get a fair trial . the european court of human rights held in march 2003 that turkey did not give kurdish rebel leader abdullah öcalan a fair trial in 1999 after his spectacular arrest in kenya .
öcalan 's restricted access to his attorneys and other irregularities in the case , including the presence of a military judge , led the strasbourg court to rule the case had been " unfair " and its order that the turkish government to pay € 100,000 of öcalan 's legal fees .
now , both sides are contesting the ruling by the court 's lower chamber - turkey in an effort to clear its human rights record and öcalan in an effort to get a re-trial .
turkey which is currently negotiating a starting date for european union talks to become a member of the european union , was harshly criticized for its treatment of öcalan , which many viewed as inhumane .
the court 's original ruling cast an uncomfortable spotlight on turkey 's spotty human rights record .
with its strong eu aspirations , ankara has undertaken a series of major democratic reforms of its justice system and now wants to wash its hands clean of the messy case and is seeking to a reversal of the previous ruling .
during its rehearing of the case , which begins on wednesday , the court will have to answer some tough questions , including whether öcalan 's arrest , his kidnapping from kenya to turkey or his trial in a state security court was in harmony with european legal standards .
an international conspiracy ?
a turkish special commando trapped the 55-year-old leader of the militant kurdish separatist organization pkk -lrb- kurdistan worker 's party -rrb- in february 1999 , arrested him and then flew him to turkey .
öcalan had been stranded in nairobi , kenya , in february 1999 after an odyssey through several european countries following his expulsion from syria , where he was living in exile .
öcalan 's lawyers believe his arrest and kidnapping violated international legal conventions .
they are now demanding the testimony of heads of government , ministers and intelligence agency officials from a number of eu countries and turkey to buttress their case .
they have also described their client 's arrest as the result of an " international plot . "
but on that point and that of his life in isolation , öcalan faces an uphill battle with the judges .
the ruling of the court of first instance discounted öcalan 's claims of a sweeping international conspiracy , and also held that the isolated conditions of his prison , where he is the sole inmate , on imrali island near istanbul did not violate any laws .
as part of the overtures ankara is making to brussels for possible future eu membership , it recently eliminated the military courts , banned capital punishment and consequently commuted öcalan 's sentence for high treason in accord with its constitutional amendments to life imprisonment .
pkk fight against turkey according to opinion polls , the majority of turks hold öcalan accountable for the pkk 's failed bid to create an independent kurdistan on turkish soil between 1984 and 1999 .
pkk-led guerrilla fighting , which öcalan orchestrated from neighboring syria , led to the deaths of 40,000 people , including kurds and turkish soldiers .
the skirmishes injured hundreds of thousands , and millions of kurds and other minorities were displaced from settlement areas in regions of east and southeast anatolya were the heaviest fighting occurred .
the international community strongly criticized turkey at the time for its refusal to grant minority rights to the kurds .
if the strasbourg court decides in öcalan 's favor , turkey could be forced to hold a new trial .
but öcalan 's lawyers say it would be impossible for a fair trial to be held in turkey and are instead demanding that the issue , which they say effects all people in turkey , be taken up by the international criminal court in the hague . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey to abolish the death penalty in a landmark decision , the turkish parliament pushed ahead with a reform package that includes lifting the death penalty in peacetime .

öcalan 's restricted access to his attorneys and other irregularities in the case , including the presence of a military judge , led the strasbourg court to rule the case had been " unfair " and its order that the turkish government to pay € 100,000 of öcalan 's legal fees .
now , both sides are contesting the ruling by the court 's lower chamber - turkey in an effort to clear its human rights record and öcalan in an effort to get a re-trial .
turkey which is currently negotiating a starting date for european union talks to become a member of the european union , was harshly criticized for its treatment of öcalan , which many viewed as inhumane .
the court 's original ruling cast an uncomfortable spotlight on turkey 's spotty human rights record .
with its strong eu aspirations , ankara has undertaken a series of major democratic reforms of its justice system and now wants to wash its hands clean of the messy case and is seeking to a reversal of the previous ruling .
during its rehearing of the case , which begins on wednesday , the court will have to answer some tough questions , including whether öcalan 's arrest , his kidnapping from kenya to turkey or his trial in a state security court was in harmony with european legal standards .
an international conspiracy ?
a turkish special commando trapped the 55-year-old leader of the militant kurdish separatist organization pkk -lrb- kurdistan worker 's party -rrb- in february 1999 , arrested him and then flew him to turkey .
öcalan had been stranded in nairobi , kenya , in february 1999 after an odyssey through several european countries following his expulsion from syria , where he was living in exile .
öcalan 's lawyers believe his arrest and kidnapping violated international legal conventions .
they are now demanding the testimony of heads of government , ministers and intelligence agency officials from a number of eu countries and turkey to buttress their case .
they have also described their client 's arrest as the result of an " international plot . "
but on that point and that of his life in isolation , öcalan faces an uphill battle with the judges .
the ruling of the court of first instance discounted öcalan 's claims of a sweeping international conspiracy , and also held that the isolated conditions of his prison , where he is the sole inmate , on imrali island near istanbul did not violate any laws .
as part of the overtures ankara is making to brussels for possible future eu membership , it recently eliminated the military courts , banned capital punishment and consequently commuted öcalan 's sentence for high treason in accord with its constitutional amendments to life imprisonment .
pkk fight against turkey according to opinion polls , the majority of turks hold öcalan accountable for the pkk 's failed bid to create an independent kurdistan on turkish soil between 1984 and 1999 .
pkk-led guerrilla fighting , which öcalan orchestrated from neighboring syria , led to the deaths of 40,000 people , including kurds and turkish soldiers .
the skirmishes injured hundreds of thousands , and millions of kurds and other minorities were displaced from settlement areas in regions of east and southeast anatolya were the heaviest fighting occurred .
the international community strongly criticized turkey at the time for its refusal to grant minority rights to the kurds .
if the strasbourg court decides in öcalan 's favor , turkey could be forced to hold a new trial .
but öcalan 's lawyers say it would be impossible for a fair trial to be held in turkey and are instead demanding that the issue , which they say effects all people in turkey , be taken up by the international criminal court in the hague . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey to abolish the death penalty in a landmark decision , the turkish parliament pushed ahead with a reform package that includes lifting the death penalty in peacetime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.06.2004 way looks clear for new u.n. iraq resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last minute changes to the u.n. resolution might have done the trick france and germany appear ready to approve a u.n. resolution on the transfer of power in iraq on tuesday , following last-minute changes to the draft by the u.s. and great britain . france , one of five permanent security council members with veto power , said tuesday morning that it will vote in favor of the u.s.-british resolution .
" we find many of our ideas in this text , " foreign minister michel barnier told french radio .
though russia and china , the remaining permanent members , have yet to voice full support for the draft , diplomats expected the resolution to pass without a hitch on tuesday .
the news came after a last-minute compromise on the structure of the security partnership between coalition forces and the new iraqi government that takes power june 30 .
france and germany wanted the iraqi government of prime minister iyad allawi to have veto power over military operations conducted by the multinational force commanded by the u.s. in the new draft , the government " has authority to commit iraqi security forces to the multinational force " and new security institutions will be employed to reach agreement on military operations , according to the associated press .
" i think we have reached a stage where the resoultion has a very good text , " said gunter pleuger , germany 's u.n. ambassador .
" my feeling is we have found a compromise . "
coming more than a year after the war began to oust saddam hussein , the draft - the fourth in two weeks - marks the final piece in the quest to restore democracy and hand over power to the iraqi people by june 30 .
it is also the result of weeks of intense back-and-forth negotiations as in particular france and germany - which holds a rotating seat on the 15-member security council - held out against approving earlier drafts which in their opinion did not go far enough to ensuring iraqi sovereignty in matters of security .
france 's u.n. ambassador , jean-marc de la sabliere had sought changes that would require the u.s.-led forces to seek approval from the iraqi interim government for " sensitive offensive operations " after june 30 .
washington 's u.n. ambassador john negroponte played down suggestions council members were asking for iraq to have veto power over military action , something washington has repeatedly refused to accept .
" veto is not really an appropriate term , " he said .
" but will these things be coordinated , will we work hard to ensure the greatest possible harmony on these issues ?
yes , " he said .
in letters to the security council , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and prime minister allawi pledged that baghdad and the multinational force would cooperate on any military action .
neither referred to veto powers .
pledges of military cooperation in his letter , powell said that the u.s.-led multinational force -lrb- mnf -rrb- would continue " activities necessary to counter ongoing security threats posed by forces seeking to influence iraq 's political future through violence . "
he pledged that the mnf would work with allawi 's government to " reach agreement on the full range of fundamental security and policy issues , including policy on sensitive offensive operations . "
allawi , speaking for the interim government , said that iraq would establish a national security committee and invite mnf commanders to " attend and participate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi men watch iraq 's new prime minister , iyad allawi , in his first televised address to the nation since his appointment .
allawi told the nation on june 4 that the presence of american and other foreign troops would guarantee iraqi security after the nation regains its sovereignty on june 30 .
" until we are able to provide security for ourselves , including the defense of iraq 's land , sea and air space , we ask for the support of the security council and the international community in this endeavor , " the prime minister wrote .
" since these are sensitive issues for a number of sovereign governments , including iraq and the united states , they need to be resolved in the framework of a mutual understanding on our strategic partnership , " he said , but stopped short of calling for veto powers .
a deal on tuesday ?
russia , a permanent member with veto powers like france , said the draft was not quite a done deal .
even though " intensive diplomatic negotiations " on sunday had produced " positive results " , deputy foreign minister juri fedotow was quoted by interfax wire service as saying several points still needed to be addressed before the resolution could be approved .
without elaborating on the details , he said discussions would continue on monday and he hoped russia 's position would be incorporated in the final draft .
" we 're confident that it does the trick , " said british ambassador emyr jones parry , whose country co-sponsored the draft .
" it presents the model in the way we always expected , a partnership on security issues and full sovereignty for the government of iraq .

" we find many of our ideas in this text , " foreign minister michel barnier told french radio .
though russia and china , the remaining permanent members , have yet to voice full support for the draft , diplomats expected the resolution to pass without a hitch on tuesday .
the news came after a last-minute compromise on the structure of the security partnership between coalition forces and the new iraqi government that takes power june 30 .
france and germany wanted the iraqi government of prime minister iyad allawi to have veto power over military operations conducted by the multinational force commanded by the u.s. in the new draft , the government " has authority to commit iraqi security forces to the multinational force " and new security institutions will be employed to reach agreement on military operations , according to the associated press .
" i think we have reached a stage where the resoultion has a very good text , " said gunter pleuger , germany 's u.n. ambassador .
" my feeling is we have found a compromise . "
coming more than a year after the war began to oust saddam hussein , the draft - the fourth in two weeks - marks the final piece in the quest to restore democracy and hand over power to the iraqi people by june 30 .
it is also the result of weeks of intense back-and-forth negotiations as in particular france and germany - which holds a rotating seat on the 15-member security council - held out against approving earlier drafts which in their opinion did not go far enough to ensuring iraqi sovereignty in matters of security .
france 's u.n. ambassador , jean-marc de la sabliere had sought changes that would require the u.s.-led forces to seek approval from the iraqi interim government for " sensitive offensive operations " after june 30 .
washington 's u.n. ambassador john negroponte played down suggestions council members were asking for iraq to have veto power over military action , something washington has repeatedly refused to accept .
" veto is not really an appropriate term , " he said .
" but will these things be coordinated , will we work hard to ensure the greatest possible harmony on these issues ?
yes , " he said .
in letters to the security council , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and prime minister allawi pledged that baghdad and the multinational force would cooperate on any military action .
neither referred to veto powers .
pledges of military cooperation in his letter , powell said that the u.s.-led multinational force -lrb- mnf -rrb- would continue " activities necessary to counter ongoing security threats posed by forces seeking to influence iraq 's political future through violence . "
he pledged that the mnf would work with allawi 's government to " reach agreement on the full range of fundamental security and policy issues , including policy on sensitive offensive operations . "
allawi , speaking for the interim government , said that iraq would establish a national security committee and invite mnf commanders to " attend and participate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi men watch iraq 's new prime minister , iyad allawi , in his first televised address to the nation since his appointment .
allawi told the nation on june 4 that the presence of american and other foreign troops would guarantee iraqi security after the nation regains its sovereignty on june 30 .
" until we are able to provide security for ourselves , including the defense of iraq 's land , sea and air space , we ask for the support of the security council and the international community in this endeavor , " the prime minister wrote .
" since these are sensitive issues for a number of sovereign governments , including iraq and the united states , they need to be resolved in the framework of a mutual understanding on our strategic partnership , " he said , but stopped short of calling for veto powers .
a deal on tuesday ?
russia , a permanent member with veto powers like france , said the draft was not quite a done deal .
even though " intensive diplomatic negotiations " on sunday had produced " positive results " , deputy foreign minister juri fedotow was quoted by interfax wire service as saying several points still needed to be addressed before the resolution could be approved .
without elaborating on the details , he said discussions would continue on monday and he hoped russia 's position would be incorporated in the final draft .
" we 're confident that it does the trick , " said british ambassador emyr jones parry , whose country co-sponsored the draft .
" it presents the model in the way we always expected , a partnership on security issues and full sovereignty for the government of iraq .

george bush 's plans for iraq and the middle east will dominate the agenda , but there will also be emphasis on debt relief and the spread of hiv / aids . the leaders of the world 's top industrial nations , known as the group of eight or g-8 , will gather on sea island , just off the coast of the u.s. state georgia .
including the u.s. , britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and russia , the g-8 summit will be shielded from protestors by heavy security and the islands remote location . u.s. president george bush will meet several leaders that just came together at this past weekend 's 60th anniversary d-day celebrations in france . bush had hoped the festivities would signal the western world 's renewed unity following last year 's divisions over iraq , but he may still face a skeptical group of allies on tuesday - the same day the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a new resolution on transferring sovereignty to iraq . despite the broad smiles and joint resolutions that are expected to mark the summit , analysts are divided over whether the meeting will help to spackle over the deep divisions , particularly those between bush and his trans-atlantic allies in europe . " i 'm skeptical that the gathering at sea island will do much to repair the relationship , " charles kupchan , a professor of international relations at georgetown university , told reuters .
" i expect there to be a show of unity and an agreement on outlines of a program to promote political reform in the broader middle east , but i do n't expect there to be a serious advance in the transatlantic dialogue . " dialogue not dictates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four of the eight leaders : u.s. president bush , japanese prime minister koizumi , german chancellor schröder and french president chirac bush had hoped to make the so-called " greater middle east initiative " the center piece of this week 's meeting .
in the original draft version of the document , he expanded on his plans to bring democracy and stability to the region .
however , after the draft was leaked to the press in february , international reaction to many of the proposals - particularly the reaction of many middle east leaders - has resulted in a significant reworking of the plan , which may be formally adopted by the g-8 leaders at this week 's meeting . at issue were middle eastern leader 's contention that bush and company intended to dictate and impose changes from the outside , when real change should eminate from within the region .
the plan has been renamed the " broader middle east initiative " and critics will be discussing whether or not the changes are purely cosmetic or substantive .
the new draft explicitatly states that " change can not be imposed from outside " and stresses dialog not dictates . that , however , has not proven enough to appease some middle east leaders .
bush invited many to a special lunch meeting with himself and the other g-8 leaders on wednesday to discuss the region 's future .
notably , the leaders of two of the most powerful countries , saudi arabia and egypt , have declined to attend . concern about oil price despite continuing tensions over the situation in the middle east , the gathering heads of state will have one thing to smile about : the world economy seems to be on the comeback trail .
the situation has n't looked this good for 15 years with the growth rate averaging 4 percent and the recovery , with the exception of some regions of africa , appears to be taking hold everywhere . now it will be up to the g-8 leaders to formulate policies to help keep things that way .
of particular concern is the price of oil .
they may issue a call to opec members to further increase production .
the price per barrel oil has declined since it reached a high of $ 40 a barrel , but some are concerned that it could shoot-up as high as $ 45 a barrel . if that happens , it could prove a serious drag on the world 's economic recovery . calls for a more balanced agenda while g-8 leaders are expected to be largely pre-occupied with the middle east and maintaining economic recovery , several advocacy groups and some prominent politicians have called for a more balanced agenda - an agenda that pays more than lip service to the problems of the third world and the spread of hiv / aids . these issues will , no doubt , be a topic of discussion .
following an agreement at the cologne summit in 1999 , the leaders will discuss whether or not to extend debt relief provided for in the heavily indebted poor countries -lrb- hipc -rrb- initiative to additional countries .
furthermore , they will discuss the progress of the new partnership for africa 's development -lrb- nepad -rrb- plan , which was formulated at a summit two years ago in canada .
at the time , it was described as a " marshal plan for africa " , but some contend that it - as well as plans to relieve debt - have not progressed at a fast enough pace . writing in the british newspaper the independent last week , the british chancellor gordon brown wrote that international targets to cut global poverty in half would be missed by more than a century .

china : the uninvited guest europe -pipe- 08.06.2004 from bit player to global heavyweight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich and influential .
leaders of the world 's richest nations will meet off georgia 's coast from june 8-10 .
the g-8 summit has moved from being an intimate fireside chat to a weighty meeting with a broad economic as well as political agenda . the first world economic summit was founded in 1975 by the then french president giscard d ' estaing and the former german chancellor helmut schmidt . the six leaders of germany , france , italy , japan , great britain and the united states met for a fireside chat at the rambouillet castle near the french capital of paris to discuss questions of international economics policies in a relaxed intimate atmosphere . from g-6 to g-8 a year later at the dorado beach , puerto rico summit , canada was accepted into the illustrious circle leading to the coining of the word ' g-7 .

" we find many of our ideas in this text , " foreign minister michel barnier told french radio .
though russia and china , the remaining permanent members , have yet to voice full support for the draft , diplomats expected the resolution to pass without a hitch on tuesday .
the news came after a last-minute compromise on the structure of the security partnership between coalition forces and the new iraqi government that takes power june 30 .
france and germany wanted the iraqi government of prime minister iyad allawi to have veto power over military operations conducted by the multinational force commanded by the u.s. in the new draft , the government " has authority to commit iraqi security forces to the multinational force " and new security institutions will be employed to reach agreement on military operations , according to the associated press .
" i think we have reached a stage where the resoultion has a very good text , " said gunter pleuger , germany 's u.n. ambassador .
" my feeling is we have found a compromise . "
coming more than a year after the war began to oust saddam hussein , the draft - the fourth in two weeks - marks the final piece in the quest to restore democracy and hand over power to the iraqi people by june 30 .
it is also the result of weeks of intense back-and-forth negotiations as in particular france and germany - which holds a rotating seat on the 15-member security council - held out against approving earlier drafts which in their opinion did not go far enough to ensuring iraqi sovereignty in matters of security .
france 's u.n. ambassador , jean-marc de la sabliere had sought changes that would require the u.s.-led forces to seek approval from the iraqi interim government for " sensitive offensive operations " after june 30 .
washington 's u.n. ambassador john negroponte played down suggestions council members were asking for iraq to have veto power over military action , something washington has repeatedly refused to accept .
" veto is not really an appropriate term , " he said .
" but will these things be coordinated , will we work hard to ensure the greatest possible harmony on these issues ?
yes , " he said .
in letters to the security council , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and prime minister allawi pledged that baghdad and the multinational force would cooperate on any military action .
neither referred to veto powers .
pledges of military cooperation in his letter , powell said that the u.s.-led multinational force -lrb- mnf -rrb- would continue " activities necessary to counter ongoing security threats posed by forces seeking to influence iraq 's political future through violence . "
he pledged that the mnf would work with allawi 's government to " reach agreement on the full range of fundamental security and policy issues , including policy on sensitive offensive operations . "
allawi , speaking for the interim government , said that iraq would establish a national security committee and invite mnf commanders to " attend and participate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi men watch iraq 's new prime minister , iyad allawi , in his first televised address to the nation since his appointment .
allawi told the nation on june 4 that the presence of american and other foreign troops would guarantee iraqi security after the nation regains its sovereignty on june 30 .
" until we are able to provide security for ourselves , including the defense of iraq 's land , sea and air space , we ask for the support of the security council and the international community in this endeavor , " the prime minister wrote .
" since these are sensitive issues for a number of sovereign governments , including iraq and the united states , they need to be resolved in the framework of a mutual understanding on our strategic partnership , " he said , but stopped short of calling for veto powers .
a deal on tuesday ?
russia , a permanent member with veto powers like france , said the draft was not quite a done deal .
even though " intensive diplomatic negotiations " on sunday had produced " positive results " , deputy foreign minister juri fedotow was quoted by interfax wire service as saying several points still needed to be addressed before the resolution could be approved .
without elaborating on the details , he said discussions would continue on monday and he hoped russia 's position would be incorporated in the final draft .
" we 're confident that it does the trick , " said british ambassador emyr jones parry , whose country co-sponsored the draft .
" it presents the model in the way we always expected , a partnership on security issues and full sovereignty for the government of iraq .

" we find many of our ideas in this text , " foreign minister michel barnier told french radio .
though russia and china , the remaining permanent members , have yet to voice full support for the draft , diplomats expected the resolution to pass without a hitch on tuesday .
the news came after a last-minute compromise on the structure of the security partnership between coalition forces and the new iraqi government that takes power june 30 .
france and germany wanted the iraqi government of prime minister iyad allawi to have veto power over military operations conducted by the multinational force commanded by the u.s. in the new draft , the government " has authority to commit iraqi security forces to the multinational force " and new security institutions will be employed to reach agreement on military operations , according to the associated press .
" i think we have reached a stage where the resoultion has a very good text , " said gunter pleuger , germany 's u.n. ambassador .
" my feeling is we have found a compromise . "
coming more than a year after the war began to oust saddam hussein , the draft - the fourth in two weeks - marks the final piece in the quest to restore democracy and hand over power to the iraqi people by june 30 .
it is also the result of weeks of intense back-and-forth negotiations as in particular france and germany - which holds a rotating seat on the 15-member security council - held out against approving earlier drafts which in their opinion did not go far enough to ensuring iraqi sovereignty in matters of security .
france 's u.n. ambassador , jean-marc de la sabliere had sought changes that would require the u.s.-led forces to seek approval from the iraqi interim government for " sensitive offensive operations " after june 30 .
washington 's u.n. ambassador john negroponte played down suggestions council members were asking for iraq to have veto power over military action , something washington has repeatedly refused to accept .
" veto is not really an appropriate term , " he said .
" but will these things be coordinated , will we work hard to ensure the greatest possible harmony on these issues ?
yes , " he said .
in letters to the security council , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and prime minister allawi pledged that baghdad and the multinational force would cooperate on any military action .
neither referred to veto powers .
pledges of military cooperation in his letter , powell said that the u.s.-led multinational force -lrb- mnf -rrb- would continue " activities necessary to counter ongoing security threats posed by forces seeking to influence iraq 's political future through violence . "
he pledged that the mnf would work with allawi 's government to " reach agreement on the full range of fundamental security and policy issues , including policy on sensitive offensive operations . "

" we find many of our ideas in this text , " foreign minister michel barnier told french radio .
though russia and china , the remaining permanent members , have yet to voice full support for the draft , diplomats expected the resolution to pass without a hitch on tuesday .
the news came after a last-minute compromise on the structure of the security partnership between coalition forces and the new iraqi government that takes power june 30 .
france and germany wanted the iraqi government of prime minister iyad allawi to have veto power over military operations conducted by the multinational force commanded by the u.s. in the new draft , the government " has authority to commit iraqi security forces to the multinational force " and new security institutions will be employed to reach agreement on military operations , according to the associated press .
" i think we have reached a stage where the resoultion has a very good text , " said gunter pleuger , germany 's u.n. ambassador .
" my feeling is we have found a compromise . "
coming more than a year after the war began to oust saddam hussein , the draft - the fourth in two weeks - marks the final piece in the quest to restore democracy and hand over power to the iraqi people by june 30 .
it is also the result of weeks of intense back-and-forth negotiations as in particular france and germany - which holds a rotating seat on the 15-member security council - held out against approving earlier drafts which in their opinion did not go far enough to ensuring iraqi sovereignty in matters of security .
france 's u.n. ambassador , jean-marc de la sabliere had sought changes that would require the u.s.-led forces to seek approval from the iraqi interim government for " sensitive offensive operations " after june 30 .
washington 's u.n. ambassador john negroponte played down suggestions council members were asking for iraq to have veto power over military action , something washington has repeatedly refused to accept .
" veto is not really an appropriate term , " he said .
" but will these things be coordinated , will we work hard to ensure the greatest possible harmony on these issues ?
yes , " he said .
in letters to the security council , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and prime minister allawi pledged that baghdad and the multinational force would cooperate on any military action .
neither referred to veto powers .
pledges of military cooperation in his letter , powell said that the u.s.-led multinational force -lrb- mnf -rrb- would continue " activities necessary to counter ongoing security threats posed by forces seeking to influence iraq 's political future through violence . "
he pledged that the mnf would work with allawi 's government to " reach agreement on the full range of fundamental security and policy issues , including policy on sensitive offensive operations . "
allawi , speaking for the interim government , said that iraq would establish a national security committee and invite mnf commanders to " attend and participate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi men watch iraq 's new prime minister , iyad allawi , in his first televised address to the nation since his appointment .
allawi told the nation on june 4 that the presence of american and other foreign troops would guarantee iraqi security after the nation regains its sovereignty on june 30 .
" until we are able to provide security for ourselves , including the defense of iraq 's land , sea and air space , we ask for the support of the security council and the international community in this endeavor , " the prime minister wrote .
" since these are sensitive issues for a number of sovereign governments , including iraq and the united states , they need to be resolved in the framework of a mutual understanding on our strategic partnership , " he said , but stopped short of calling for veto powers .
a deal on tuesday ?
russia , a permanent member with veto powers like france , said the draft was not quite a done deal .
even though " intensive diplomatic negotiations " on sunday had produced " positive results " , deputy foreign minister juri fedotow was quoted by interfax wire service as saying several points still needed to be addressed before the resolution could be approved .
without elaborating on the details , he said discussions would continue on monday and he hoped russia 's position would be incorporated in the final draft .
" we 're confident that it does the trick , " said british ambassador emyr jones parry , whose country co-sponsored the draft .
" it presents the model in the way we always expected , a partnership on security issues and full sovereignty for the government of iraq .

leaders of the world 's richest nations will meet off georgia 's coast from june 8-10 .
the g-8 summit has moved from being an intimate fireside chat to a weighty meeting with a broad economic as well as political agenda . the first world economic summit was founded in 1975 by the then french president giscard d ' estaing and the former german chancellor helmut schmidt . the six leaders of germany , france , italy , japan , great britain and the united states met for a fireside chat at the rambouillet castle near the french capital of paris to discuss questions of international economics policies in a relaxed intimate atmosphere . from g-6 to g-8 a year later at the dorado beach , puerto rico summit , canada was accepted into the illustrious circle leading to the coining of the word ' g-7 . ' in 1977 the president of the european commission was invited to participate in the annual event , a move that resulted in a broadening of the range of topics to include questions of foreign policy . in 1998 russia , which had unofficially been a part of the g-7 talks since 1994 , was officially accepted into the fold at the birmingham summit as one of the most politically-important countries .
the move completed the g-8 or group of eight circle as it is known today . however on financial and currency matters , it was the g-7 that continued to hold talks because russia had still to take on a role comparable to the g-7 's when it came to these issues on the world stage . the g8 's agenda has also broadened significantly throughout its history .
as a result , the g8 member countries now have separate meetings throughout the year for finance , foreign and labor ministers . weighing in on international issues meanwhile the regular meetings of the eight world leaders have turned into a massive media spectacle , often accompanied by protests from anti-globalization activists and opponents of neo-liberal capitalism . the protests reached a climax in july 2001 in genoa , italy , when 23-year-old student and protestor carlo guiliani was brutally beaten and died in clashes between the demonstrators and the police . doubt has often been cast on the political significance of the g-8 talks and its effectiveness in addressing issues of international concerns . however summit participants vehemently defend themselves against the charge . at the opening address of the g-8 summit in evian , france last year , french president chirac said the meet should be based on four principles : solidarity , responsibility , security and democracy .
referring to ' responsibility ' , chirac recommended that " the g-8 states should formulate principles for a responsible market policy oriented towards permanent development , and which is accompanied by concrete actions to , for instance , fight corruption or to use research and innovation to aid the environment . " heavyweight status the german government has also long ceased to describe the g-8 meets as a mere relaxed fireside chat . " the big advantage of the g-8 cooperation is that it links a high degree of flexibility with the necessary economic and political power needed to push through its decisions .
the decisions exude a great political influence , which the individual states can not evade , " according to the german economics and finance ministry . the economic and political muscle of the g-8 is also visible in numbers : they earn more than two- thirds of the gross world product , they 're responsible for almost half of global trade , they account for over three- fourths of worldwide development aid and are the biggest paymasters in international organizations such as the oecd -lrb- organization for economic cooperation and development -rrb- , the imf -lrb- international monetary fund -rrb- and the world bank . rolf wenkel -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the view from the summit dw-world 's special on the background , history and goals of the g-8 as well as news from the summit in sea island , off georgia 's atlantic coast .

german politicians are up in arms over a planned tax write-off by british telecom giant vodafone that would deny the german government more than € 20 billion in tax revenues . the write-off stems from vodafone 's 2000 takeover of germany 's mannesmann , a telecoms company .
after the telecoms bubble burst in 2001 , the price of vodafone shares dropped dramatically .
experts say the company is now taking advantage of a german tax loophole to write-off the losses it took by paying too much for mannesmann . coming at a time when the federal government is in desperate need of tax income , the planned write-off is being painted by politicians as corporate greed at the expense of the taxpayers .
" it 's an unbelievable outrage , " german member of parliament michael müller told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
the state government in north rhine-westphalia , where mannesmann was based , is also looking into the legality of the move . the state , germany 's largest , is especially dear to chancellor gerhard schröder .
in one year , state elections will prove an important litmus test for his or his social democrat party 's re-electability in federal elections in 2006 .
but tax specialists say the government 's populism on the write-off will not have much of an effect on the decision . " i 'm afraid vodafone has had a very close look at german tax laws and discovered a loophole , " tax expert wolfgang gehrke told deutsche welle .
" this loophole is costing the finance minister up to € 25 billion .
for ordinary german taxpayers this is unacceptable , but only morally and not legally . " lenient laws in 1999 , schröder 's government rewrote the tax laws to give companies leeway to offset past losses against current profits .
in 2001 , vodafone bought mannesmann for € 200 billion , a figure observers thought very high at the time .
when the telecoms bubble burst in 2002 , the price of mannesmann shares dropped from € 309 to € 200 a share , resulting in a loss of about € 50 billion to the mother company , vodafone .
the british company is arguing that the drop in value is permanent , granting it the right to write it off .
the north rhine-westphalian government said it was looking into the matter . mannesmann as scapegoat the uproar over mannesmann is a continuation of a saga surrounding the vodafone takeover and german attitudes toward capitalism . prosecutors are wrapping up a case in düsseldorf against six former mannesmann executives accused of accepting large cash bonuses in order to smooth the way for the vodafone acquisition .
now government officials want to hold mannesmann up for a practice that experts say is commonplace in the corporate world . in 2002 , deutsche telekom wrote off € 21 billion after re-valuing their mobile business in the united states .
german power company e.on wrote off € 2.4 billion of the € 8.1 billion purchase price of the british company powergen . finance ministry officials have ruled out a legislation change , say that enough measures have already been taken to close abuse of the loophole . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank boss cool under fire in mannesmann trial deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , currently facing “ breach of trust ” charges for approving controversial bonuses to mannesmann directors , told a düsseldorf court on thursday that he had nothing to hide .

german politicians are up in arms over a planned tax write-off by british telecom giant vodafone that would deny the german government more than € 20 billion in tax revenues . the write-off stems from vodafone 's 2000 takeover of germany 's mannesmann , a telecoms company .
after the telecoms bubble burst in 2001 , the price of vodafone shares dropped dramatically .
experts say the company is now taking advantage of a german tax loophole to write-off the losses it took by paying too much for mannesmann . coming at a time when the federal government is in desperate need of tax income , the planned write-off is being painted by politicians as corporate greed at the expense of the taxpayers .
" it 's an unbelievable outrage , " german member of parliament michael müller told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
the state government in north rhine-westphalia , where mannesmann was based , is also looking into the legality of the move . the state , germany 's largest , is especially dear to chancellor gerhard schröder .
in one year , state elections will prove an important litmus test for his or his social democrat party 's re-electability in federal elections in 2006 .
but tax specialists say the government 's populism on the write-off will not have much of an effect on the decision . " i 'm afraid vodafone has had a very close look at german tax laws and discovered a loophole , " tax expert wolfgang gehrke told deutsche welle .
" this loophole is costing the finance minister up to € 25 billion .
for ordinary german taxpayers this is unacceptable , but only morally and not legally . " lenient laws in 1999 , schröder 's government rewrote the tax laws to give companies leeway to offset past losses against current profits .
in 2001 , vodafone bought mannesmann for € 200 billion , a figure observers thought very high at the time .
when the telecoms bubble burst in 2002 , the price of mannesmann shares dropped from € 309 to € 200 a share , resulting in a loss of about € 50 billion to the mother company , vodafone .
the british company is arguing that the drop in value is permanent , granting it the right to write it off .

the european court of human rights this week takes up the fate of kurdish leader abdullah öcalan .
both ankara and öcalan 's lawyers are appealing portions of an earlier court ruling that he did not get a fair trial . the european court of human rights held in march 2003 that turkey did not give kurdish rebel leader abdullah öcalan a fair trial in 1999 after his spectacular arrest in kenya .
öcalan 's restricted access to his attorneys and other irregularities in the case , including the presence of a military judge , led the strasbourg court to rule the case had been " unfair " and its order that the turkish government to pay € 100,000 of öcalan 's legal fees .
now , both sides are contesting the ruling by the court 's lower chamber - turkey in an effort to clear its human rights record and öcalan in an effort to get a re-trial .
turkey which is currently negotiating a starting date for european union talks to become a member of the european union , was harshly criticized for its treatment of öcalan , which many viewed as inhumane .
the court 's original ruling cast an uncomfortable spotlight on turkey 's spotty human rights record .
with its strong eu aspirations , ankara has undertaken a series of major democratic reforms of its justice system and now wants to wash its hands clean of the messy case and is seeking to a reversal of the previous ruling .
during its rehearing of the case , which begins on wednesday , the court will have to answer some tough questions , including whether öcalan 's arrest , his kidnapping from kenya to turkey or his trial in a state security court was in harmony with european legal standards .
an international conspiracy ?
a turkish special commando trapped the 55-year-old leader of the militant kurdish separatist organization pkk -lrb- kurdistan worker 's party -rrb- in february 1999 , arrested him and then flew him to turkey .
öcalan had been stranded in nairobi , kenya , in february 1999 after an odyssey through several european countries following his expulsion from syria , where he was living in exile .
öcalan 's lawyers believe his arrest and kidnapping violated international legal conventions .
they are now demanding the testimony of heads of government , ministers and intelligence agency officials from a number of eu countries and turkey to buttress their case .
they have also described their client 's arrest as the result of an " international plot . "
but on that point and that of his life in isolation , öcalan faces an uphill battle with the judges .
the ruling of the court of first instance discounted öcalan 's claims of a sweeping international conspiracy , and also held that the isolated conditions of his prison , where he is the sole inmate , on imrali island near istanbul did not violate any laws .
as part of the overtures ankara is making to brussels for possible future eu membership , it recently eliminated the military courts , banned capital punishment and consequently commuted öcalan 's sentence for high treason in accord with its constitutional amendments to life imprisonment .
pkk fight against turkey according to opinion polls , the majority of turks hold öcalan accountable for the pkk 's failed bid to create an independent kurdistan on turkish soil between 1984 and 1999 .
pkk-led guerrilla fighting , which öcalan orchestrated from neighboring syria , led to the deaths of 40,000 people , including kurds and turkish soldiers .
the skirmishes injured hundreds of thousands , and millions of kurds and other minorities were displaced from settlement areas in regions of east and southeast anatolya were the heaviest fighting occurred .
the international community strongly criticized turkey at the time for its refusal to grant minority rights to the kurds .
if the strasbourg court decides in öcalan 's favor , turkey could be forced to hold a new trial .
but öcalan 's lawyers say it would be impossible for a fair trial to be held in turkey and are instead demanding that the issue , which they say effects all people in turkey , be taken up by the international criminal court in the hague . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey to abolish the death penalty in a landmark decision , the turkish parliament pushed ahead with a reform package that includes lifting the death penalty in peacetime .

the european court of human rights this week takes up the fate of kurdish leader abdullah öcalan .
both ankara and öcalan 's lawyers are appealing portions of an earlier court ruling that he did not get a fair trial . the european court of human rights held in march 2003 that turkey did not give kurdish rebel leader abdullah öcalan a fair trial in 1999 after his spectacular arrest in kenya .
öcalan 's restricted access to his attorneys and other irregularities in the case , including the presence of a military judge , led the strasbourg court to rule the case had been " unfair " and its order that the turkish government to pay € 100,000 of öcalan 's legal fees .
now , both sides are contesting the ruling by the court 's lower chamber - turkey in an effort to clear its human rights record and öcalan in an effort to get a re-trial .
turkey which is currently negotiating a starting date for european union talks to become a member of the european union , was harshly criticized for its treatment of öcalan , which many viewed as inhumane .
the court 's original ruling cast an uncomfortable spotlight on turkey 's spotty human rights record .
with its strong eu aspirations , ankara has undertaken a series of major democratic reforms of its justice system and now wants to wash its hands clean of the messy case and is seeking to a reversal of the previous ruling .
during its rehearing of the case , which begins on wednesday , the court will have to answer some tough questions , including whether öcalan 's arrest , his kidnapping from kenya to turkey or his trial in a state security court was in harmony with european legal standards .
an international conspiracy ?
a turkish special commando trapped the 55-year-old leader of the militant kurdish separatist organization pkk -lrb- kurdistan worker 's party -rrb- in february 1999 , arrested him and then flew him to turkey .
öcalan had been stranded in nairobi , kenya , in february 1999 after an odyssey through several european countries following his expulsion from syria , where he was living in exile .
öcalan 's lawyers believe his arrest and kidnapping violated international legal conventions .
they are now demanding the testimony of heads of government , ministers and intelligence agency officials from a number of eu countries and turkey to buttress their case .
they have also described their client 's arrest as the result of an " international plot . "
but on that point and that of his life in isolation , öcalan faces an uphill battle with the judges .
the ruling of the court of first instance discounted öcalan 's claims of a sweeping international conspiracy , and also held that the isolated conditions of his prison , where he is the sole inmate , on imrali island near istanbul did not violate any laws .
as part of the overtures ankara is making to brussels for possible future eu membership , it recently eliminated the military courts , banned capital punishment and consequently commuted öcalan 's sentence for high treason in accord with its constitutional amendments to life imprisonment .
pkk fight against turkey according to opinion polls , the majority of turks hold öcalan accountable for the pkk 's failed bid to create an independent kurdistan on turkish soil between 1984 and 1999 .
pkk-led guerrilla fighting , which öcalan orchestrated from neighboring syria , led to the deaths of 40,000 people , including kurds and turkish soldiers .
the skirmishes injured hundreds of thousands , and millions of kurds and other minorities were displaced from settlement areas in regions of east and southeast anatolya were the heaviest fighting occurred .
the international community strongly criticized turkey at the time for its refusal to grant minority rights to the kurds .
if the strasbourg court decides in öcalan 's favor , turkey could be forced to hold a new trial .
but öcalan 's lawyers say it would be impossible for a fair trial to be held in turkey and are instead demanding that the issue , which they say effects all people in turkey , be taken up by the international criminal court in the hague . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey to abolish the death penalty in a landmark decision , the turkish parliament pushed ahead with a reform package that includes lifting the death penalty in peacetime .

george bush 's plans for iraq and the middle east will dominate the agenda , but there will also be emphasis on debt relief and the spread of hiv / aids . the leaders of the world 's top industrial nations , known as the group of eight or g-8 , will gather on sea island , just off the coast of the u.s. state georgia .
including the u.s. , britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and russia , the g-8 summit will be shielded from protestors by heavy security and the islands remote location . u.s. president george bush will meet several leaders that just came together at this past weekend 's 60th anniversary d-day celebrations in france . bush had hoped the festivities would signal the western world 's renewed unity following last year 's divisions over iraq , but he may still face a skeptical group of allies on tuesday - the same day the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a new resolution on transferring sovereignty to iraq . despite the broad smiles and joint resolutions that are expected to mark the summit , analysts are divided over whether the meeting will help to spackle over the deep divisions , particularly those between bush and his trans-atlantic allies in europe . " i 'm skeptical that the gathering at sea island will do much to repair the relationship , " charles kupchan , a professor of international relations at georgetown university , told reuters .

however , after the draft was leaked to the press in february , international reaction to many of the proposals - particularly the reaction of many middle east leaders - has resulted in a significant reworking of the plan , which may be formally adopted by the g-8 leaders at this week 's meeting . at issue were middle eastern leader 's contention that bush and company intended to dictate and impose changes from the outside , when real change should eminate from within the region .
the plan has been renamed the " broader middle east initiative " and critics will be discussing whether or not the changes are purely cosmetic or substantive .

music labels clamping down on music pirates scored their first victory in germany on tuesday .
meanwhile , the competition in the legal online music trade is heating up with the launch of apple itunes in europe next week . for one music enthusiast in the eastern german city of cottbus , the good times of downloading music for free via peer-to-peer file-sharing programs like kazaa came to an abrupt end on tuesday .
he was convicted in a german court of copyright infringement , according to a statement released by the german federal association of the phonographic industry in berlin . the 23-year-old will have to fork over a hefty € 8,000 -lrb- $ 9,855 -rrb- in fines in addition to covering the legal costs of the case . the case is expected to set a precedent for future cases , said gerd gebhard , the chairman of the association , and will also serve as a cautionary tale to those considering illegal music file-sharing . clamping down on illegal downloaders the case , one of 68 brought against people who download music illegally in germany , represents a significant victory for a music industry desperate to stem the tide of lost profits since music file-sharing and downloading software like kazaa and napster became hugely popular . in germany alone , internet piracy contributed to a 20 percent drop in profits , which has resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs , according to industry officials .
globally , losses are estimated at $ 2.4 billion -lrb- € 1.96 -rrb- a year . the strategy of pursuing illegal music pirates in the courts is part of a two-pronged approach .
in addition , music industry executives are hoping to bring illegal file-swappers back into the market by offering them the chance to download music legally - for a fee - via a host of new legal and industry-sponsored online platforms . itunes europe in june ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple launched its itunes music store to feed its wildly popular ipod digital players .
with a major announcement about the introduction of apple 's itunes music shop service in europe next week in london , the competition in the legal online music branch is about to heat up , and a price war between new entrants into the market could benefit consumers .

music labels clamping down on music pirates scored their first victory in germany on tuesday .
meanwhile , the competition in the legal online music trade is heating up with the launch of apple itunes in europe next week . for one music enthusiast in the eastern german city of cottbus , the good times of downloading music for free via peer-to-peer file-sharing programs like kazaa came to an abrupt end on tuesday .
he was convicted in a german court of copyright infringement , according to a statement released by the german federal association of the phonographic industry in berlin . the 23-year-old will have to fork over a hefty € 8,000 -lrb- $ 9,855 -rrb- in fines in addition to covering the legal costs of the case . the case is expected to set a precedent for future cases , said gerd gebhard , the chairman of the association , and will also serve as a cautionary tale to those considering illegal music file-sharing . clamping down on illegal downloaders the case , one of 68 brought against people who download music illegally in germany , represents a significant victory for a music industry desperate to stem the tide of lost profits since music file-sharing and downloading software like kazaa and napster became hugely popular . in germany alone , internet piracy contributed to a 20 percent drop in profits , which has resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs , according to industry officials .
globally , losses are estimated at $ 2.4 billion -lrb- € 1.96 -rrb- a year . the strategy of pursuing illegal music pirates in the courts is part of a two-pronged approach .

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 08.06.2004 china : the uninvited guest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is open to the west , but still not part of the g-8 the g-8 summit brings together leaders from the world 's richest and most influential countries .
but there is one country missing from the guest list - china , which has grown to be the world ’ s sixth largest economy . it ’ s difficult these days not to mention china when talking about the state of the global economy .
but the leaders of the world ’ s top nations appear to be trying to do just that at their annual g-8 summit currently underway in georgia in the southern united states .
despite the fact that china has grown into the world ’ s sixth largest economy , surpassing g-8 members russia and canada , beijing doesn ’ t have a representative at the meeting .
china feels it rightly belongs at the gathering of the world 's richest and most influential countries .
no other nation drives the world 's market for natural resources more than china with its insatiable appetite for oil , gas and steel ; and no other nation can boast a record of imports and exports that are growing at such staggering rates .
a revaluation of the yuan would send waves through financial markets worldwide , an indicator of how closely watched the asian giant is .
it therefore comes as a surprise to many chinese that their country still hasn ’ t been invited to become a member of the g-8 or at least attend the summit as a guest such as the european commission .
a new foreign strategy the chinese state media once derided the g-8 as a " club of the rich " and said it competed against the united nations for global influence .
today , however , the desire to join the club is more prevalent than ever , says beijing professor for international relations zhang xizhen .
" this altered interest is part of china ’ s new strategy of foreign policy , " he says .
" everyone knows that china was once a closed country that the west in particular couldn ’ t trust .
but recent reforms and more experience with the west have begun to change things here . "
beijing has realized that it can only deal with today ’ s challenges of globalization by cooperating with the world 's biggest economies .
" this is why china is trying to play a more international role , and it ’ s only natural that it wants to be included in the g-8 , " says xizhen .
but china ’ s failure to live up to promises it made when it joined the world trade organization compounds the group of eight 's hesitation about admitting it into the circle of top industrialized countries .
beijing 's continuing poor human rights record also weighs against china being classified as an exemplary democracy .
the chinese , however , counter such skepticism by claiming their country can only get on the proper track with the aid of the international community . kerstin lohse for mdr -lrb- sh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the view from the summit dw-world 's special on the background , history and goals of the g-8 as well as news from the summit in sea island , off georgia 's atlantic coast bmw moves into high gear in china bmw became the latest heavyweight investor on the chinese car market this week with the opening of its own factory in shenyang , making china one of the biggest foreign production sites for german automakers .

berlin is planning to give its stagnating university system a shot in the arm with a € 1.9 billion program to create germany 's version of ivy league elite colleges .
officials hope it will spur academic competition . faced with overcrowded lecture halls , outdated teaching materials and unmotivated professors , students in germany often take years to finish courses .
but chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s center-left government now wants to reinvigorate the country 's system of higher education , aiming to spend about € 1.9 billion in extra money for universities over the next five years .
education minister edelgard bulmahn says the money is to encourage competition between universities and to reward centers of excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn says elite universities will help germany compete better in the global marketplace .
" we need a climate where universities engage in competition , " bulmahn said on monday .
" we have a lot of experience funding and organizing outstanding scientific excellence in our research institutes .
but we don ’ t have high-performance universities that are acknowledged worldwide .
so that means we need more competition between universities and the willingness to attract people not only from our own universities and surroundings , but from abroad as well . "
germany ’ s long-standing image of the land of poets and philosophers has been severely tarnished in recent years as international studies on education have shown the german primary school system to be mediocre at best .
the situation in the country 's universities is only slightly better .
academic competition bulmahn wants germany to become more active in the race for the world ’ s best brains by establishing elite universities that one day , the government hopes , will rival harvard , oxford or american ivy league universities .
the plan for the extra funding has received the full backing from the country ’ s powerful state premiers , who are in charge of education here , and a competition to determine which universities get the money will be held later this year .
ten will be singled out , with each receiving an extra € 25 million a year .
a parallel program will also reward individual departments with strong academic records and leading research groups .
the competition for the pot of gold will be fierce because many university heads , including dieter lenzen of berlin ’ s free university , think they stand a good chance of winning .
" there is already a ranking of german universities , " he says .
" and after munich and heidelberg , berlin ’ s free university is in third place .
so i think we are well-positioned for the competition . "
a jury of german research and science experts is to establish criteria for selecting the best universities .
internationally renowned research results and an emphasis on promoting talented students , are said to be among them .
fear of neglect but some observers have warned the government against neglecting the broader spectrum of university education in its drive for top performance and elite schools .
" it is of course important to establish elite institutions , " says karl einhäuptl of the national science council , " but at the same time we must strive to maintain the high standards of our universities in general .
it ’ s not surprising that german scientists are wanted by american institutions .
that ’ s because they are well-trained . "
the initiative is also meant to attract more foreign students to german universities .
easier access to jobs here , which is expected to come with a new immigration law and the absence of tuition fees , the government hopes , will serve as extra incentives to aspiring academics from abroad . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : an elite university or a university for the elite ?

from bit player to global heavyweight a platform for protest china : the uninvited guest current affairs -pipe- 08.06.2004 g-8 leaders head to u.s. summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to the g-8 meeting will have little time to enjoy the beach g-8 leaders will gather on tuesday for a three-day summit .
george bush 's plans for iraq and the middle east will dominate the agenda , but there will also be emphasis on debt relief and the spread of hiv / aids . the leaders of the world 's top industrial nations , known as the group of eight or g-8 , will gather on sea island , just off the coast of the u.s. state georgia .
including the u.s. , britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and russia , the g-8 summit will be shielded from protestors by heavy security and the islands remote location . u.s. president george bush will meet several leaders that just came together at this past weekend 's 60th anniversary d-day celebrations in france . bush had hoped the festivities would signal the western world 's renewed unity following last year 's divisions over iraq , but he may still face a skeptical group of allies on tuesday - the same day the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a new resolution on transferring sovereignty to iraq . despite the broad smiles and joint resolutions that are expected to mark the summit , analysts are divided over whether the meeting will help to spackle over the deep divisions , particularly those between bush and his trans-atlantic allies in europe . " i 'm skeptical that the gathering at sea island will do much to repair the relationship , " charles kupchan , a professor of international relations at georgetown university , told reuters .
" i expect there to be a show of unity and an agreement on outlines of a program to promote political reform in the broader middle east , but i do n't expect there to be a serious advance in the transatlantic dialogue . " dialogue not dictates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four of the eight leaders : u.s. president bush , japanese prime minister koizumi , german chancellor schröder and french president chirac bush had hoped to make the so-called " greater middle east initiative " the center piece of this week 's meeting .
in the original draft version of the document , he expanded on his plans to bring democracy and stability to the region .
however , after the draft was leaked to the press in february , international reaction to many of the proposals - particularly the reaction of many middle east leaders - has resulted in a significant reworking of the plan , which may be formally adopted by the g-8 leaders at this week 's meeting . at issue were middle eastern leader 's contention that bush and company intended to dictate and impose changes from the outside , when real change should eminate from within the region .
the plan has been renamed the " broader middle east initiative " and critics will be discussing whether or not the changes are purely cosmetic or substantive .
the new draft explicitatly states that " change can not be imposed from outside " and stresses dialog not dictates . that , however , has not proven enough to appease some middle east leaders .
bush invited many to a special lunch meeting with himself and the other g-8 leaders on wednesday to discuss the region 's future .
notably , the leaders of two of the most powerful countries , saudi arabia and egypt , have declined to attend . concern about oil price despite continuing tensions over the situation in the middle east , the gathering heads of state will have one thing to smile about : the world economy seems to be on the comeback trail .
the situation has n't looked this good for 15 years with the growth rate averaging 4 percent and the recovery , with the exception of some regions of africa , appears to be taking hold everywhere . now it will be up to the g-8 leaders to formulate policies to help keep things that way .
of particular concern is the price of oil .
they may issue a call to opec members to further increase production .
the price per barrel oil has declined since it reached a high of $ 40 a barrel , but some are concerned that it could shoot-up as high as $ 45 a barrel . if that happens , it could prove a serious drag on the world 's economic recovery . calls for a more balanced agenda while g-8 leaders are expected to be largely pre-occupied with the middle east and maintaining economic recovery , several advocacy groups and some prominent politicians have called for a more balanced agenda - an agenda that pays more than lip service to the problems of the third world and the spread of hiv / aids . these issues will , no doubt , be a topic of discussion .
following an agreement at the cologne summit in 1999 , the leaders will discuss whether or not to extend debt relief provided for in the heavily indebted poor countries -lrb- hipc -rrb- initiative to additional countries .
furthermore , they will discuss the progress of the new partnership for africa 's development -lrb- nepad -rrb- plan , which was formulated at a summit two years ago in canada .
at the time , it was described as a " marshal plan for africa " , but some contend that it - as well as plans to relieve debt - have not progressed at a fast enough pace . writing in the british newspaper the independent last week , the british chancellor gordon brown wrote that international targets to cut global poverty in half would be missed by more than a century .
" the richest countries can not continue setting targets , failing to meet them and then expecting the poorest countries to trust our word , " he wrote .
he claimed that britain would urge other countries to remove " the burden of unpayable debt " . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : allied d-day soldiers did n't die in vain saying germany had learned its lessons from world war ii and successfully mounted a return to the international community , gerhard schröder on sunday closed the final chapter in post-wwii history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.06.2004 way looks clear for new u.n. iraq resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last minute changes to the u.n. resolution might have done the trick france and germany appear ready to approve a u.n. resolution on the transfer of power in iraq on tuesday , following last-minute changes to the draft by the u.s. and great britain . france , one of five permanent security council members with veto power , said tuesday morning that it will vote in favor of the u.s.-british resolution .
" we find many of our ideas in this text , " foreign minister michel barnier told french radio .
though russia and china , the remaining permanent members , have yet to voice full support for the draft , diplomats expected the resolution to pass without a hitch on tuesday .
the news came after a last-minute compromise on the structure of the security partnership between coalition forces and the new iraqi government that takes power june 30 .
france and germany wanted the iraqi government of prime minister iyad allawi to have veto power over military operations conducted by the multinational force commanded by the u.s. in the new draft , the government " has authority to commit iraqi security forces to the multinational force " and new security institutions will be employed to reach agreement on military operations , according to the associated press .
" i think we have reached a stage where the resoultion has a very good text , " said gunter pleuger , germany 's u.n. ambassador .
" my feeling is we have found a compromise . "
coming more than a year after the war began to oust saddam hussein , the draft - the fourth in two weeks - marks the final piece in the quest to restore democracy and hand over power to the iraqi people by june 30 .
it is also the result of weeks of intense back-and-forth negotiations as in particular france and germany - which holds a rotating seat on the 15-member security council - held out against approving earlier drafts which in their opinion did not go far enough to ensuring iraqi sovereignty in matters of security .
france 's u.n. ambassador , jean-marc de la sabliere had sought changes that would require the u.s.-led forces to seek approval from the iraqi interim government for " sensitive offensive operations " after june 30 .
washington 's u.n. ambassador john negroponte played down suggestions council members were asking for iraq to have veto power over military action , something washington has repeatedly refused to accept .
" veto is not really an appropriate term , " he said .
" but will these things be coordinated , will we work hard to ensure the greatest possible harmony on these issues ?
yes , " he said .
in letters to the security council , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and prime minister allawi pledged that baghdad and the multinational force would cooperate on any military action .
neither referred to veto powers .
pledges of military cooperation in his letter , powell said that the u.s.-led multinational force -lrb- mnf -rrb- would continue " activities necessary to counter ongoing security threats posed by forces seeking to influence iraq 's political future through violence . "
he pledged that the mnf would work with allawi 's government to " reach agreement on the full range of fundamental security and policy issues , including policy on sensitive offensive operations . "
allawi , speaking for the interim government , said that iraq would establish a national security committee and invite mnf commanders to " attend and participate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi men watch iraq 's new prime minister , iyad allawi , in his first televised address to the nation since his appointment .
allawi told the nation on june 4 that the presence of american and other foreign troops would guarantee iraqi security after the nation regains its sovereignty on june 30 .
" until we are able to provide security for ourselves , including the defense of iraq 's land , sea and air space , we ask for the support of the security council and the international community in this endeavor , " the prime minister wrote .
" since these are sensitive issues for a number of sovereign governments , including iraq and the united states , they need to be resolved in the framework of a mutual understanding on our strategic partnership , " he said , but stopped short of calling for veto powers .
a deal on tuesday ?
russia , a permanent member with veto powers like france , said the draft was not quite a done deal .
even though " intensive diplomatic negotiations " on sunday had produced " positive results " , deputy foreign minister juri fedotow was quoted by interfax wire service as saying several points still needed to be addressed before the resolution could be approved .
without elaborating on the details , he said discussions would continue on monday and he hoped russia 's position would be incorporated in the final draft .
" we 're confident that it does the trick , " said british ambassador emyr jones parry , whose country co-sponsored the draft .
" it presents the model in the way we always expected , a partnership on security issues and full sovereignty for the government of iraq .

" we find many of our ideas in this text , " foreign minister michel barnier told french radio .
though russia and china , the remaining permanent members , have yet to voice full support for the draft , diplomats expected the resolution to pass without a hitch on tuesday .
the news came after a last-minute compromise on the structure of the security partnership between coalition forces and the new iraqi government that takes power june 30 .
france and germany wanted the iraqi government of prime minister iyad allawi to have veto power over military operations conducted by the multinational force commanded by the u.s. in the new draft , the government " has authority to commit iraqi security forces to the multinational force " and new security institutions will be employed to reach agreement on military operations , according to the associated press .
" i think we have reached a stage where the resoultion has a very good text , " said gunter pleuger , germany 's u.n. ambassador .
" my feeling is we have found a compromise . "
coming more than a year after the war began to oust saddam hussein , the draft - the fourth in two weeks - marks the final piece in the quest to restore democracy and hand over power to the iraqi people by june 30 .
it is also the result of weeks of intense back-and-forth negotiations as in particular france and germany - which holds a rotating seat on the 15-member security council - held out against approving earlier drafts which in their opinion did not go far enough to ensuring iraqi sovereignty in matters of security .
france 's u.n. ambassador , jean-marc de la sabliere had sought changes that would require the u.s.-led forces to seek approval from the iraqi interim government for " sensitive offensive operations " after june 30 .
washington 's u.n. ambassador john negroponte played down suggestions council members were asking for iraq to have veto power over military action , something washington has repeatedly refused to accept .
" veto is not really an appropriate term , " he said .
" but will these things be coordinated , will we work hard to ensure the greatest possible harmony on these issues ?
yes , " he said .
in letters to the security council , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and prime minister allawi pledged that baghdad and the multinational force would cooperate on any military action .
neither referred to veto powers .
pledges of military cooperation in his letter , powell said that the u.s.-led multinational force -lrb- mnf -rrb- would continue " activities necessary to counter ongoing security threats posed by forces seeking to influence iraq 's political future through violence . "
he pledged that the mnf would work with allawi 's government to " reach agreement on the full range of fundamental security and policy issues , including policy on sensitive offensive operations . "
allawi , speaking for the interim government , said that iraq would establish a national security committee and invite mnf commanders to " attend and participate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi men watch iraq 's new prime minister , iyad allawi , in his first televised address to the nation since his appointment .
allawi told the nation on june 4 that the presence of american and other foreign troops would guarantee iraqi security after the nation regains its sovereignty on june 30 .
" until we are able to provide security for ourselves , including the defense of iraq 's land , sea and air space , we ask for the support of the security council and the international community in this endeavor , " the prime minister wrote .
" since these are sensitive issues for a number of sovereign governments , including iraq and the united states , they need to be resolved in the framework of a mutual understanding on our strategic partnership , " he said , but stopped short of calling for veto powers .
a deal on tuesday ?
russia , a permanent member with veto powers like france , said the draft was not quite a done deal .
even though " intensive diplomatic negotiations " on sunday had produced " positive results " , deputy foreign minister juri fedotow was quoted by interfax wire service as saying several points still needed to be addressed before the resolution could be approved .
without elaborating on the details , he said discussions would continue on monday and he hoped russia 's position would be incorporated in the final draft .
" we 're confident that it does the trick , " said british ambassador emyr jones parry , whose country co-sponsored the draft .
" it presents the model in the way we always expected , a partnership on security issues and full sovereignty for the government of iraq .

the news came after a last-minute compromise on the structure of the security partnership between coalition forces and the new iraqi government that takes power june 30 .
france and germany wanted the iraqi government of prime minister iyad allawi to have veto power over military operations conducted by the multinational force commanded by the u.s. in the new draft , the government " has authority to commit iraqi security forces to the multinational force " and new security institutions will be employed to reach agreement on military operations , according to the associated press .
" i think we have reached a stage where the resoultion has a very good text , " said gunter pleuger , germany 's u.n. ambassador .
" my feeling is we have found a compromise . "
coming more than a year after the war began to oust saddam hussein , the draft - the fourth in two weeks - marks the final piece in the quest to restore democracy and hand over power to the iraqi people by june 30 .
it is also the result of weeks of intense back-and-forth negotiations as in particular france and germany - which holds a rotating seat on the 15-member security council - held out against approving earlier drafts which in their opinion did not go far enough to ensuring iraqi sovereignty in matters of security .
france 's u.n. ambassador , jean-marc de la sabliere had sought changes that would require the u.s.-led forces to seek approval from the iraqi interim government for " sensitive offensive operations " after june 30 .
washington 's u.n. ambassador john negroponte played down suggestions council members were asking for iraq to have veto power over military action , something washington has repeatedly refused to accept .
" veto is not really an appropriate term , " he said .
" but will these things be coordinated , will we work hard to ensure the greatest possible harmony on these issues ?
yes , " he said .
in letters to the security council , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and prime minister allawi pledged that baghdad and the multinational force would cooperate on any military action .
neither referred to veto powers .
pledges of military cooperation in his letter , powell said that the u.s.-led multinational force -lrb- mnf -rrb- would continue " activities necessary to counter ongoing security threats posed by forces seeking to influence iraq 's political future through violence . "
he pledged that the mnf would work with allawi 's government to " reach agreement on the full range of fundamental security and policy issues , including policy on sensitive offensive operations . "
allawi , speaking for the interim government , said that iraq would establish a national security committee and invite mnf commanders to " attend and participate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi men watch iraq 's new prime minister , iyad allawi , in his first televised address to the nation since his appointment .
allawi told the nation on june 4 that the presence of american and other foreign troops would guarantee iraqi security after the nation regains its sovereignty on june 30 .
" until we are able to provide security for ourselves , including the defense of iraq 's land , sea and air space , we ask for the support of the security council and the international community in this endeavor , " the prime minister wrote .
" since these are sensitive issues for a number of sovereign governments , including iraq and the united states , they need to be resolved in the framework of a mutual understanding on our strategic partnership , " he said , but stopped short of calling for veto powers .
a deal on tuesday ?
russia , a permanent member with veto powers like france , said the draft was not quite a done deal .
even though " intensive diplomatic negotiations " on sunday had produced " positive results " , deputy foreign minister juri fedotow was quoted by interfax wire service as saying several points still needed to be addressed before the resolution could be approved .
without elaborating on the details , he said discussions would continue on monday and he hoped russia 's position would be incorporated in the final draft .
" we 're confident that it does the trick , " said british ambassador emyr jones parry , whose country co-sponsored the draft .

from bit player to global heavyweight a platform for protest china : the uninvited guest current affairs -pipe- 08.06.2004 g-8 leaders head to u.s. summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to the g-8 meeting will have little time to enjoy the beach g-8 leaders will gather on tuesday for a three-day summit .
george bush 's plans for iraq and the middle east will dominate the agenda , but there will also be emphasis on debt relief and the spread of hiv / aids . the leaders of the world 's top industrial nations , known as the group of eight or g-8 , will gather on sea island , just off the coast of the u.s. state georgia .
including the u.s. , britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and russia , the g-8 summit will be shielded from protestors by heavy security and the islands remote location . u.s. president george bush will meet several leaders that just came together at this past weekend 's 60th anniversary d-day celebrations in france . bush had hoped the festivities would signal the western world 's renewed unity following last year 's divisions over iraq , but he may still face a skeptical group of allies on tuesday - the same day the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a new resolution on transferring sovereignty to iraq . despite the broad smiles and joint resolutions that are expected to mark the summit , analysts are divided over whether the meeting will help to spackle over the deep divisions , particularly those between bush and his trans-atlantic allies in europe . " i 'm skeptical that the gathering at sea island will do much to repair the relationship , " charles kupchan , a professor of international relations at georgetown university , told reuters .
" i expect there to be a show of unity and an agreement on outlines of a program to promote political reform in the broader middle east , but i do n't expect there to be a serious advance in the transatlantic dialogue . " dialogue not dictates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four of the eight leaders : u.s. president bush , japanese prime minister koizumi , german chancellor schröder and french president chirac bush had hoped to make the so-called " greater middle east initiative " the center piece of this week 's meeting .
in the original draft version of the document , he expanded on his plans to bring democracy and stability to the region .
however , after the draft was leaked to the press in february , international reaction to many of the proposals - particularly the reaction of many middle east leaders - has resulted in a significant reworking of the plan , which may be formally adopted by the g-8 leaders at this week 's meeting . at issue were middle eastern leader 's contention that bush and company intended to dictate and impose changes from the outside , when real change should eminate from within the region .
the plan has been renamed the " broader middle east initiative " and critics will be discussing whether or not the changes are purely cosmetic or substantive .
the new draft explicitatly states that " change can not be imposed from outside " and stresses dialog not dictates . that , however , has not proven enough to appease some middle east leaders .
bush invited many to a special lunch meeting with himself and the other g-8 leaders on wednesday to discuss the region 's future .
notably , the leaders of two of the most powerful countries , saudi arabia and egypt , have declined to attend . concern about oil price despite continuing tensions over the situation in the middle east , the gathering heads of state will have one thing to smile about : the world economy seems to be on the comeback trail .
the situation has n't looked this good for 15 years with the growth rate averaging 4 percent and the recovery , with the exception of some regions of africa , appears to be taking hold everywhere . now it will be up to the g-8 leaders to formulate policies to help keep things that way .
of particular concern is the price of oil .
they may issue a call to opec members to further increase production .
the price per barrel oil has declined since it reached a high of $ 40 a barrel , but some are concerned that it could shoot-up as high as $ 45 a barrel . if that happens , it could prove a serious drag on the world 's economic recovery . calls for a more balanced agenda while g-8 leaders are expected to be largely pre-occupied with the middle east and maintaining economic recovery , several advocacy groups and some prominent politicians have called for a more balanced agenda - an agenda that pays more than lip service to the problems of the third world and the spread of hiv / aids . these issues will , no doubt , be a topic of discussion .
following an agreement at the cologne summit in 1999 , the leaders will discuss whether or not to extend debt relief provided for in the heavily indebted poor countries -lrb- hipc -rrb- initiative to additional countries .
furthermore , they will discuss the progress of the new partnership for africa 's development -lrb- nepad -rrb- plan , which was formulated at a summit two years ago in canada .
at the time , it was described as a " marshal plan for africa " , but some contend that it - as well as plans to relieve debt - have not progressed at a fast enough pace . writing in the british newspaper the independent last week , the british chancellor gordon brown wrote that international targets to cut global poverty in half would be missed by more than a century .
" the richest countries can not continue setting targets , failing to meet them and then expecting the poorest countries to trust our word , " he wrote .

the situation has n't looked this good for 15 years with the growth rate averaging 4 percent and the recovery , with the exception of some regions of africa , appears to be taking hold everywhere . now it will be up to the g-8 leaders to formulate policies to help keep things that way .
of particular concern is the price of oil .
they may issue a call to opec members to further increase production .
the price per barrel oil has declined since it reached a high of $ 40 a barrel , but some are concerned that it could shoot-up as high as $ 45 a barrel . if that happens , it could prove a serious drag on the world 's economic recovery . calls for a more balanced agenda while g-8 leaders are expected to be largely pre-occupied with the middle east and maintaining economic recovery , several advocacy groups and some prominent politicians have called for a more balanced agenda - an agenda that pays more than lip service to the problems of the third world and the spread of hiv / aids . these issues will , no doubt , be a topic of discussion .
following an agreement at the cologne summit in 1999 , the leaders will discuss whether or not to extend debt relief provided for in the heavily indebted poor countries -lrb- hipc -rrb- initiative to additional countries .
furthermore , they will discuss the progress of the new partnership for africa 's development -lrb- nepad -rrb- plan , which was formulated at a summit two years ago in canada .
at the time , it was described as a " marshal plan for africa " , but some contend that it - as well as plans to relieve debt - have not progressed at a fast enough pace . writing in the british newspaper the independent last week , the british chancellor gordon brown wrote that international targets to cut global poverty in half would be missed by more than a century .
" the richest countries can not continue setting targets , failing to meet them and then expecting the poorest countries to trust our word , " he wrote .
he claimed that britain would urge other countries to remove " the burden of unpayable debt " . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : allied d-day soldiers did n't die in vain saying germany had learned its lessons from world war ii and successfully mounted a return to the international community , gerhard schröder on sunday closed the final chapter in post-wwii history .

the g-8 summit has moved from being an intimate fireside chat to a weighty meeting with a broad economic as well as political agenda . the first world economic summit was founded in 1975 by the then french president giscard d ' estaing and the former german chancellor helmut schmidt . the six leaders of germany , france , italy , japan , great britain and the united states met for a fireside chat at the rambouillet castle near the french capital of paris to discuss questions of international economics policies in a relaxed intimate atmosphere . from g-6 to g-8 a year later at the dorado beach , puerto rico summit , canada was accepted into the illustrious circle leading to the coining of the word ' g-7 . ' in 1977 the president of the european commission was invited to participate in the annual event , a move that resulted in a broadening of the range of topics to include questions of foreign policy . in 1998 russia , which had unofficially been a part of the g-7 talks since 1994 , was officially accepted into the fold at the birmingham summit as one of the most politically-important countries .
the move completed the g-8 or group of eight circle as it is known today . however on financial and currency matters , it was the g-7 that continued to hold talks because russia had still to take on a role comparable to the g-7 's when it came to these issues on the world stage . the g8 's agenda has also broadened significantly throughout its history .
as a result , the g8 member countries now have separate meetings throughout the year for finance , foreign and labor ministers . weighing in on international issues meanwhile the regular meetings of the eight world leaders have turned into a massive media spectacle , often accompanied by protests from anti-globalization activists and opponents of neo-liberal capitalism . the protests reached a climax in july 2001 in genoa , italy , when 23-year-old student and protestor carlo guiliani was brutally beaten and died in clashes between the demonstrators and the police . doubt has often been cast on the political significance of the g-8 talks and its effectiveness in addressing issues of international concerns . however summit participants vehemently defend themselves against the charge . at the opening address of the g-8 summit in evian , france last year , french president chirac said the meet should be based on four principles : solidarity , responsibility , security and democracy .
referring to ' responsibility ' , chirac recommended that " the g-8 states should formulate principles for a responsible market policy oriented towards permanent development , and which is accompanied by concrete actions to , for instance , fight corruption or to use research and innovation to aid the environment . " heavyweight status the german government has also long ceased to describe the g-8 meets as a mere relaxed fireside chat . " the big advantage of the g-8 cooperation is that it links a high degree of flexibility with the necessary economic and political power needed to push through its decisions .
the decisions exude a great political influence , which the individual states can not evade , " according to the german economics and finance ministry . the economic and political muscle of the g-8 is also visible in numbers : they earn more than two- thirds of the gross world product , they 're responsible for almost half of global trade , they account for over three- fourths of worldwide development aid and are the biggest paymasters in international organizations such as the oecd -lrb- organization for economic cooperation and development -rrb- , the imf -lrb- international monetary fund -rrb- and the world bank . rolf wenkel -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the view from the summit dw-world 's special on the background , history and goals of the g-8 as well as news from the summit in sea island , off georgia 's atlantic coast .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.06.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc france and germany fight over police post the appointment of the new director of europol , the european police office , has put france and germany at loggerheads , with both backing their own candidate to get the post .
this question will surface again when eu justice and interior ministers meet on tuesday in luxembourg .
lack of agreement between these two countries could see the issue being postponed for a summit of eu leaders next week .
time is slipping away as the term of the present director , german jürgen storbeck , terminates at the end of this month .
but the need for eu member states to agree unanimously on the next person to head the office has blocked the issue for months .
the frenchman jacques franquet - director of the international and technical police cooperation service -lrb- scitp -rrb- is seen as the front runner , but germany is backing storbeck , who wants his mandate to be renewed .
although senior italian officer emanuele marotta is also a candidate , eu officials say that the race is now between the french and the german candidates .
a possible compromise has already been floated by german interior minister otto schily .
according to one eu diplomat , schily said he would consider accepting franquet if the post of director general for justice and home affairs in the council was offered to a german .
" it is clear there is still not a meeting of minds , " the irish eu presidency said on monday .
" we are anxious to get an outcome and a decision on the filling of this post .
it is certainly about time that a decision is taken " .
europol was set up to improve police cooperation between the member states in combating terrorism , illicit traffic in drugs and other serious forms of international crime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : educating germany germans mull sweeping education reforms germany to introduce federal school standards bad grades for german schools report lambastes german schools germany -pipe- 08.06.2004 germany to spend € 1.9 billion to develop elite universities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's humboldt university is one of a number of schools that could vie for elite status .
berlin is planning to give its stagnating university system a shot in the arm with a € 1.9 billion program to create germany 's version of ivy league elite colleges .
officials hope it will spur academic competition . faced with overcrowded lecture halls , outdated teaching materials and unmotivated professors , students in germany often take years to finish courses .
but chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s center-left government now wants to reinvigorate the country 's system of higher education , aiming to spend about € 1.9 billion in extra money for universities over the next five years .
education minister edelgard bulmahn says the money is to encourage competition between universities and to reward centers of excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn says elite universities will help germany compete better in the global marketplace .
" we need a climate where universities engage in competition , " bulmahn said on monday .
" we have a lot of experience funding and organizing outstanding scientific excellence in our research institutes .
but we don ’ t have high-performance universities that are acknowledged worldwide .
so that means we need more competition between universities and the willingness to attract people not only from our own universities and surroundings , but from abroad as well . "
germany ’ s long-standing image of the land of poets and philosophers has been severely tarnished in recent years as international studies on education have shown the german primary school system to be mediocre at best .
the situation in the country 's universities is only slightly better .
academic competition bulmahn wants germany to become more active in the race for the world ’ s best brains by establishing elite universities that one day , the government hopes , will rival harvard , oxford or american ivy league universities .
the plan for the extra funding has received the full backing from the country ’ s powerful state premiers , who are in charge of education here , and a competition to determine which universities get the money will be held later this year .
ten will be singled out , with each receiving an extra € 25 million a year .
a parallel program will also reward individual departments with strong academic records and leading research groups .
the competition for the pot of gold will be fierce because many university heads , including dieter lenzen of berlin ’ s free university , think they stand a good chance of winning .
" there is already a ranking of german universities , " he says .
" and after munich and heidelberg , berlin ’ s free university is in third place .
so i think we are well-positioned for the competition . "
a jury of german research and science experts is to establish criteria for selecting the best universities .
internationally renowned research results and an emphasis on promoting talented students , are said to be among them .
fear of neglect but some observers have warned the government against neglecting the broader spectrum of university education in its drive for top performance and elite schools .
" it is of course important to establish elite institutions , " says karl einhäuptl of the national science council , " but at the same time we must strive to maintain the high standards of our universities in general .
it ’ s not surprising that german scientists are wanted by american institutions .
that ’ s because they are well-trained . "
the initiative is also meant to attract more foreign students to german universities .
easier access to jobs here , which is expected to come with a new immigration law and the absence of tuition fees , the government hopes , will serve as extra incentives to aspiring academics from abroad . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : an elite university or a university for the elite ?
after chancellor schröder ’ s social democrats aired proposals to set up a small network of elite universities similar to ones in the united states and britain , editorials across the country criticized the initiative .

german politicians are up in arms over a planned tax write-off by british telecom giant vodafone that would deny the german government more than € 20 billion in tax revenues . the write-off stems from vodafone 's 2000 takeover of germany 's mannesmann , a telecoms company .
after the telecoms bubble burst in 2001 , the price of vodafone shares dropped dramatically .
experts say the company is now taking advantage of a german tax loophole to write-off the losses it took by paying too much for mannesmann . coming at a time when the federal government is in desperate need of tax income , the planned write-off is being painted by politicians as corporate greed at the expense of the taxpayers .
" it 's an unbelievable outrage , " german member of parliament michael müller told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
the state government in north rhine-westphalia , where mannesmann was based , is also looking into the legality of the move . the state , germany 's largest , is especially dear to chancellor gerhard schröder .
in one year , state elections will prove an important litmus test for his or his social democrat party 's re-electability in federal elections in 2006 .
but tax specialists say the government 's populism on the write-off will not have much of an effect on the decision . " i 'm afraid vodafone has had a very close look at german tax laws and discovered a loophole , " tax expert wolfgang gehrke told deutsche welle .
" this loophole is costing the finance minister up to € 25 billion .
for ordinary german taxpayers this is unacceptable , but only morally and not legally . " lenient laws in 1999 , schröder 's government rewrote the tax laws to give companies leeway to offset past losses against current profits .
in 2001 , vodafone bought mannesmann for € 200 billion , a figure observers thought very high at the time .
when the telecoms bubble burst in 2002 , the price of mannesmann shares dropped from € 309 to € 200 a share , resulting in a loss of about € 50 billion to the mother company , vodafone .
the british company is arguing that the drop in value is permanent , granting it the right to write it off .
the north rhine-westphalian government said it was looking into the matter . mannesmann as scapegoat the uproar over mannesmann is a continuation of a saga surrounding the vodafone takeover and german attitudes toward capitalism . prosecutors are wrapping up a case in düsseldorf against six former mannesmann executives accused of accepting large cash bonuses in order to smooth the way for the vodafone acquisition .
now government officials want to hold mannesmann up for a practice that experts say is commonplace in the corporate world . in 2002 , deutsche telekom wrote off € 21 billion after re-valuing their mobile business in the united states .

music labels clamping down on music pirates scored their first victory in germany on tuesday .
meanwhile , the competition in the legal online music trade is heating up with the launch of apple itunes in europe next week . for one music enthusiast in the eastern german city of cottbus , the good times of downloading music for free via peer-to-peer file-sharing programs like kazaa came to an abrupt end on tuesday .
he was convicted in a german court of copyright infringement , according to a statement released by the german federal association of the phonographic industry in berlin . the 23-year-old will have to fork over a hefty € 8,000 -lrb- $ 9,855 -rrb- in fines in addition to covering the legal costs of the case . the case is expected to set a precedent for future cases , said gerd gebhard , the chairman of the association , and will also serve as a cautionary tale to those considering illegal music file-sharing . clamping down on illegal downloaders the case , one of 68 brought against people who download music illegally in germany , represents a significant victory for a music industry desperate to stem the tide of lost profits since music file-sharing and downloading software like kazaa and napster became hugely popular . in germany alone , internet piracy contributed to a 20 percent drop in profits , which has resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs , according to industry officials .
globally , losses are estimated at $ 2.4 billion -lrb- € 1.96 -rrb- a year . the strategy of pursuing illegal music pirates in the courts is part of a two-pronged approach .
in addition , music industry executives are hoping to bring illegal file-swappers back into the market by offering them the chance to download music legally - for a fee - via a host of new legal and industry-sponsored online platforms . itunes europe in june ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple launched its itunes music store to feed its wildly popular ipod digital players .
with a major announcement about the introduction of apple 's itunes music shop service in europe next week in london , the competition in the legal online music branch is about to heat up , and a price war between new entrants into the market could benefit consumers .
but perils exist for all market entrants : the already troubled german online platform , phonoline , will struggle to survive the intense competition , while apple may find marketing online tunes in europe more challenging than in the united states . shrouded in secrecy , apple ceo steve jobs has called a press conference for june 15 saying only that , " the biggest story in music is about to get even bigger " .
it is expected that apple will announce the long-anticipated launch of the european version of their online music store , which is already hugely popular in the united states .
a launch is expectedly imminently in britain , where anglo-saxon copyright rules make it easier to negotiate with rights-holders and record companies , but launches in france and germany could also come at the same time . in the first year , stateside music fans flocked to the site to download - and pay for - more than 70 million songs .
no doubt apple executives hope to repeat their success in europe .
however , they will find increased competition in the european market from a host of recently launched clones . on may 20 , napster launched in britain , joining industry leader od2 .
sony is expected to enter into the european market at the end of june .
in germany , music labels launched their own online music store , phoneline , in march , though the effort has been plagued by criticisms that the library is too limited and prices too high . individual members of the music industry throughout europe are engaged in a bitter struggle to attract customers amidst fierce competition . dw staff -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german online music platform 's troubled first weeks just weeks after its launch , phonoline , germany 's first online music platform , is the object of much criticism .

from bit player to global heavyweight a platform for protest china : the uninvited guest current affairs -pipe- 08.06.2004 g-8 leaders head to u.s. summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to the g-8 meeting will have little time to enjoy the beach g-8 leaders will gather on tuesday for a three-day summit .
george bush 's plans for iraq and the middle east will dominate the agenda , but there will also be emphasis on debt relief and the spread of hiv / aids . the leaders of the world 's top industrial nations , known as the group of eight or g-8 , will gather on sea island , just off the coast of the u.s. state georgia .
including the u.s. , britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and russia , the g-8 summit will be shielded from protestors by heavy security and the islands remote location . u.s. president george bush will meet several leaders that just came together at this past weekend 's 60th anniversary d-day celebrations in france . bush had hoped the festivities would signal the western world 's renewed unity following last year 's divisions over iraq , but he may still face a skeptical group of allies on tuesday - the same day the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a new resolution on transferring sovereignty to iraq . despite the broad smiles and joint resolutions that are expected to mark the summit , analysts are divided over whether the meeting will help to spackle over the deep divisions , particularly those between bush and his trans-atlantic allies in europe . " i 'm skeptical that the gathering at sea island will do much to repair the relationship , " charles kupchan , a professor of international relations at georgetown university , told reuters .
" i expect there to be a show of unity and an agreement on outlines of a program to promote political reform in the broader middle east , but i do n't expect there to be a serious advance in the transatlantic dialogue . " dialogue not dictates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four of the eight leaders : u.s. president bush , japanese prime minister koizumi , german chancellor schröder and french president chirac bush had hoped to make the so-called " greater middle east initiative " the center piece of this week 's meeting .
in the original draft version of the document , he expanded on his plans to bring democracy and stability to the region .
however , after the draft was leaked to the press in february , international reaction to many of the proposals - particularly the reaction of many middle east leaders - has resulted in a significant reworking of the plan , which may be formally adopted by the g-8 leaders at this week 's meeting . at issue were middle eastern leader 's contention that bush and company intended to dictate and impose changes from the outside , when real change should eminate from within the region .
the plan has been renamed the " broader middle east initiative " and critics will be discussing whether or not the changes are purely cosmetic or substantive .
the new draft explicitatly states that " change can not be imposed from outside " and stresses dialog not dictates . that , however , has not proven enough to appease some middle east leaders .
bush invited many to a special lunch meeting with himself and the other g-8 leaders on wednesday to discuss the region 's future .
notably , the leaders of two of the most powerful countries , saudi arabia and egypt , have declined to attend . concern about oil price despite continuing tensions over the situation in the middle east , the gathering heads of state will have one thing to smile about : the world economy seems to be on the comeback trail .
the situation has n't looked this good for 15 years with the growth rate averaging 4 percent and the recovery , with the exception of some regions of africa , appears to be taking hold everywhere . now it will be up to the g-8 leaders to formulate policies to help keep things that way .
of particular concern is the price of oil .
they may issue a call to opec members to further increase production .
the price per barrel oil has declined since it reached a high of $ 40 a barrel , but some are concerned that it could shoot-up as high as $ 45 a barrel . if that happens , it could prove a serious drag on the world 's economic recovery . calls for a more balanced agenda while g-8 leaders are expected to be largely pre-occupied with the middle east and maintaining economic recovery , several advocacy groups and some prominent politicians have called for a more balanced agenda - an agenda that pays more than lip service to the problems of the third world and the spread of hiv / aids . these issues will , no doubt , be a topic of discussion .
following an agreement at the cologne summit in 1999 , the leaders will discuss whether or not to extend debt relief provided for in the heavily indebted poor countries -lrb- hipc -rrb- initiative to additional countries .
furthermore , they will discuss the progress of the new partnership for africa 's development -lrb- nepad -rrb- plan , which was formulated at a summit two years ago in canada .
at the time , it was described as a " marshal plan for africa " , but some contend that it - as well as plans to relieve debt - have not progressed at a fast enough pace . writing in the british newspaper the independent last week , the british chancellor gordon brown wrote that international targets to cut global poverty in half would be missed by more than a century .
" the richest countries can not continue setting targets , failing to meet them and then expecting the poorest countries to trust our word , " he wrote .
he claimed that britain would urge other countries to remove " the burden of unpayable debt " . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : allied d-day soldiers did n't die in vain saying germany had learned its lessons from world war ii and successfully mounted a return to the international community , gerhard schröder on sunday closed the final chapter in post-wwii history .

the price per barrel oil has declined since it reached a high of $ 40 a barrel , but some are concerned that it could shoot-up as high as $ 45 a barrel . if that happens , it could prove a serious drag on the world 's economic recovery . calls for a more balanced agenda while g-8 leaders are expected to be largely pre-occupied with the middle east and maintaining economic recovery , several advocacy groups and some prominent politicians have called for a more balanced agenda - an agenda that pays more than lip service to the problems of the third world and the spread of hiv / aids . these issues will , no doubt , be a topic of discussion .
following an agreement at the cologne summit in 1999 , the leaders will discuss whether or not to extend debt relief provided for in the heavily indebted poor countries -lrb- hipc -rrb- initiative to additional countries .
furthermore , they will discuss the progress of the new partnership for africa 's development -lrb- nepad -rrb- plan , which was formulated at a summit two years ago in canada .
at the time , it was described as a " marshal plan for africa " , but some contend that it - as well as plans to relieve debt - have not progressed at a fast enough pace . writing in the british newspaper the independent last week , the british chancellor gordon brown wrote that international targets to cut global poverty in half would be missed by more than a century .
" the richest countries can not continue setting targets , failing to meet them and then expecting the poorest countries to trust our word , " he wrote .

" we find many of our ideas in this text , " foreign minister michel barnier told french radio .
though russia and china , the remaining permanent members , have yet to voice full support for the draft , diplomats expected the resolution to pass without a hitch on tuesday .
the news came after a last-minute compromise on the structure of the security partnership between coalition forces and the new iraqi government that takes power june 30 .
france and germany wanted the iraqi government of prime minister iyad allawi to have veto power over military operations conducted by the multinational force commanded by the u.s. in the new draft , the government " has authority to commit iraqi security forces to the multinational force " and new security institutions will be employed to reach agreement on military operations , according to the associated press .
" i think we have reached a stage where the resoultion has a very good text , " said gunter pleuger , germany 's u.n. ambassador .
" my feeling is we have found a compromise . "
coming more than a year after the war began to oust saddam hussein , the draft - the fourth in two weeks - marks the final piece in the quest to restore democracy and hand over power to the iraqi people by june 30 .
it is also the result of weeks of intense back-and-forth negotiations as in particular france and germany - which holds a rotating seat on the 15-member security council - held out against approving earlier drafts which in their opinion did not go far enough to ensuring iraqi sovereignty in matters of security .
france 's u.n. ambassador , jean-marc de la sabliere had sought changes that would require the u.s.-led forces to seek approval from the iraqi interim government for " sensitive offensive operations " after june 30 .
washington 's u.n. ambassador john negroponte played down suggestions council members were asking for iraq to have veto power over military action , something washington has repeatedly refused to accept .
" veto is not really an appropriate term , " he said .
" but will these things be coordinated , will we work hard to ensure the greatest possible harmony on these issues ?
yes , " he said .
in letters to the security council , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and prime minister allawi pledged that baghdad and the multinational force would cooperate on any military action .
neither referred to veto powers .
pledges of military cooperation in his letter , powell said that the u.s.-led multinational force -lrb- mnf -rrb- would continue " activities necessary to counter ongoing security threats posed by forces seeking to influence iraq 's political future through violence . "
he pledged that the mnf would work with allawi 's government to " reach agreement on the full range of fundamental security and policy issues , including policy on sensitive offensive operations . "
allawi , speaking for the interim government , said that iraq would establish a national security committee and invite mnf commanders to " attend and participate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi men watch iraq 's new prime minister , iyad allawi , in his first televised address to the nation since his appointment .
allawi told the nation on june 4 that the presence of american and other foreign troops would guarantee iraqi security after the nation regains its sovereignty on june 30 .
" until we are able to provide security for ourselves , including the defense of iraq 's land , sea and air space , we ask for the support of the security council and the international community in this endeavor , " the prime minister wrote .
" since these are sensitive issues for a number of sovereign governments , including iraq and the united states , they need to be resolved in the framework of a mutual understanding on our strategic partnership , " he said , but stopped short of calling for veto powers .
a deal on tuesday ?
russia , a permanent member with veto powers like france , said the draft was not quite a done deal .
even though " intensive diplomatic negotiations " on sunday had produced " positive results " , deputy foreign minister juri fedotow was quoted by interfax wire service as saying several points still needed to be addressed before the resolution could be approved .
without elaborating on the details , he said discussions would continue on monday and he hoped russia 's position would be incorporated in the final draft .

china : the uninvited guest europe -pipe- 08.06.2004 from bit player to global heavyweight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich and influential .
leaders of the world 's richest nations will meet off georgia 's coast from june 8-10 .
the g-8 summit has moved from being an intimate fireside chat to a weighty meeting with a broad economic as well as political agenda . the first world economic summit was founded in 1975 by the then french president giscard d ' estaing and the former german chancellor helmut schmidt . the six leaders of germany , france , italy , japan , great britain and the united states met for a fireside chat at the rambouillet castle near the french capital of paris to discuss questions of international economics policies in a relaxed intimate atmosphere . from g-6 to g-8 a year later at the dorado beach , puerto rico summit , canada was accepted into the illustrious circle leading to the coining of the word ' g-7 . ' in 1977 the president of the european commission was invited to participate in the annual event , a move that resulted in a broadening of the range of topics to include questions of foreign policy . in 1998 russia , which had unofficially been a part of the g-7 talks since 1994 , was officially accepted into the fold at the birmingham summit as one of the most politically-important countries .
the move completed the g-8 or group of eight circle as it is known today . however on financial and currency matters , it was the g-7 that continued to hold talks because russia had still to take on a role comparable to the g-7 's when it came to these issues on the world stage . the g8 's agenda has also broadened significantly throughout its history .
as a result , the g8 member countries now have separate meetings throughout the year for finance , foreign and labor ministers . weighing in on international issues meanwhile the regular meetings of the eight world leaders have turned into a massive media spectacle , often accompanied by protests from anti-globalization activists and opponents of neo-liberal capitalism . the protests reached a climax in july 2001 in genoa , italy , when 23-year-old student and protestor carlo guiliani was brutally beaten and died in clashes between the demonstrators and the police . doubt has often been cast on the political significance of the g-8 talks and its effectiveness in addressing issues of international concerns . however summit participants vehemently defend themselves against the charge . at the opening address of the g-8 summit in evian , france last year , french president chirac said the meet should be based on four principles : solidarity , responsibility , security and democracy .
referring to ' responsibility ' , chirac recommended that " the g-8 states should formulate principles for a responsible market policy oriented towards permanent development , and which is accompanied by concrete actions to , for instance , fight corruption or to use research and innovation to aid the environment . " heavyweight status the german government has also long ceased to describe the g-8 meets as a mere relaxed fireside chat . " the big advantage of the g-8 cooperation is that it links a high degree of flexibility with the necessary economic and political power needed to push through its decisions .
the decisions exude a great political influence , which the individual states can not evade , " according to the german economics and finance ministry . the economic and political muscle of the g-8 is also visible in numbers : they earn more than two- thirds of the gross world product , they 're responsible for almost half of global trade , they account for over three- fourths of worldwide development aid and are the biggest paymasters in international organizations such as the oecd -lrb- organization for economic cooperation and development -rrb- , the imf -lrb- international monetary fund -rrb- and the world bank . rolf wenkel -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the view from the summit dw-world 's special on the background , history and goals of the g-8 as well as news from the summit in sea island , off georgia 's atlantic coast .

" we find many of our ideas in this text , " foreign minister michel barnier told french radio .
though russia and china , the remaining permanent members , have yet to voice full support for the draft , diplomats expected the resolution to pass without a hitch on tuesday .
the news came after a last-minute compromise on the structure of the security partnership between coalition forces and the new iraqi government that takes power june 30 .
france and germany wanted the iraqi government of prime minister iyad allawi to have veto power over military operations conducted by the multinational force commanded by the u.s. in the new draft , the government " has authority to commit iraqi security forces to the multinational force " and new security institutions will be employed to reach agreement on military operations , according to the associated press .
" i think we have reached a stage where the resoultion has a very good text , " said gunter pleuger , germany 's u.n. ambassador .
" my feeling is we have found a compromise . "
coming more than a year after the war began to oust saddam hussein , the draft - the fourth in two weeks - marks the final piece in the quest to restore democracy and hand over power to the iraqi people by june 30 .
it is also the result of weeks of intense back-and-forth negotiations as in particular france and germany - which holds a rotating seat on the 15-member security council - held out against approving earlier drafts which in their opinion did not go far enough to ensuring iraqi sovereignty in matters of security .
france 's u.n. ambassador , jean-marc de la sabliere had sought changes that would require the u.s.-led forces to seek approval from the iraqi interim government for " sensitive offensive operations " after june 30 .
washington 's u.n. ambassador john negroponte played down suggestions council members were asking for iraq to have veto power over military action , something washington has repeatedly refused to accept .
" veto is not really an appropriate term , " he said .
" but will these things be coordinated , will we work hard to ensure the greatest possible harmony on these issues ?
yes , " he said .
in letters to the security council , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and prime minister allawi pledged that baghdad and the multinational force would cooperate on any military action .
neither referred to veto powers .
pledges of military cooperation in his letter , powell said that the u.s.-led multinational force -lrb- mnf -rrb- would continue " activities necessary to counter ongoing security threats posed by forces seeking to influence iraq 's political future through violence . "
he pledged that the mnf would work with allawi 's government to " reach agreement on the full range of fundamental security and policy issues , including policy on sensitive offensive operations . "
allawi , speaking for the interim government , said that iraq would establish a national security committee and invite mnf commanders to " attend and participate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi men watch iraq 's new prime minister , iyad allawi , in his first televised address to the nation since his appointment .
allawi told the nation on june 4 that the presence of american and other foreign troops would guarantee iraqi security after the nation regains its sovereignty on june 30 .
" until we are able to provide security for ourselves , including the defense of iraq 's land , sea and air space , we ask for the support of the security council and the international community in this endeavor , " the prime minister wrote .
" since these are sensitive issues for a number of sovereign governments , including iraq and the united states , they need to be resolved in the framework of a mutual understanding on our strategic partnership , " he said , but stopped short of calling for veto powers .
a deal on tuesday ?
russia , a permanent member with veto powers like france , said the draft was not quite a done deal .
even though " intensive diplomatic negotiations " on sunday had produced " positive results " , deputy foreign minister juri fedotow was quoted by interfax wire service as saying several points still needed to be addressed before the resolution could be approved .
without elaborating on the details , he said discussions would continue on monday and he hoped russia 's position would be incorporated in the final draft .
" we 're confident that it does the trick , " said british ambassador emyr jones parry , whose country co-sponsored the draft .
" it presents the model in the way we always expected , a partnership on security issues and full sovereignty for the government of iraq .

music labels clamping down on music pirates scored their first victory in germany on tuesday .
meanwhile , the competition in the legal online music trade is heating up with the launch of apple itunes in europe next week . for one music enthusiast in the eastern german city of cottbus , the good times of downloading music for free via peer-to-peer file-sharing programs like kazaa came to an abrupt end on tuesday .
he was convicted in a german court of copyright infringement , according to a statement released by the german federal association of the phonographic industry in berlin . the 23-year-old will have to fork over a hefty € 8,000 -lrb- $ 9,855 -rrb- in fines in addition to covering the legal costs of the case . the case is expected to set a precedent for future cases , said gerd gebhard , the chairman of the association , and will also serve as a cautionary tale to those considering illegal music file-sharing . clamping down on illegal downloaders the case , one of 68 brought against people who download music illegally in germany , represents a significant victory for a music industry desperate to stem the tide of lost profits since music file-sharing and downloading software like kazaa and napster became hugely popular . in germany alone , internet piracy contributed to a 20 percent drop in profits , which has resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs , according to industry officials .
globally , losses are estimated at $ 2.4 billion -lrb- € 1.96 -rrb- a year . the strategy of pursuing illegal music pirates in the courts is part of a two-pronged approach .
in addition , music industry executives are hoping to bring illegal file-swappers back into the market by offering them the chance to download music legally - for a fee - via a host of new legal and industry-sponsored online platforms . itunes europe in june ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple launched its itunes music store to feed its wildly popular ipod digital players .
with a major announcement about the introduction of apple 's itunes music shop service in europe next week in london , the competition in the legal online music branch is about to heat up , and a price war between new entrants into the market could benefit consumers .
but perils exist for all market entrants : the already troubled german online platform , phonoline , will struggle to survive the intense competition , while apple may find marketing online tunes in europe more challenging than in the united states . shrouded in secrecy , apple ceo steve jobs has called a press conference for june 15 saying only that , " the biggest story in music is about to get even bigger " .
it is expected that apple will announce the long-anticipated launch of the european version of their online music store , which is already hugely popular in the united states .
a launch is expectedly imminently in britain , where anglo-saxon copyright rules make it easier to negotiate with rights-holders and record companies , but launches in france and germany could also come at the same time . in the first year , stateside music fans flocked to the site to download - and pay for - more than 70 million songs .
no doubt apple executives hope to repeat their success in europe .
however , they will find increased competition in the european market from a host of recently launched clones . on may 20 , napster launched in britain , joining industry leader od2 .
sony is expected to enter into the european market at the end of june .
in germany , music labels launched their own online music store , phoneline , in march , though the effort has been plagued by criticisms that the library is too limited and prices too high . individual members of the music industry throughout europe are engaged in a bitter struggle to attract customers amidst fierce competition . dw staff -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german online music platform 's troubled first weeks just weeks after its launch , phonoline , germany 's first online music platform , is the object of much criticism .

with a major announcement about the introduction of apple 's itunes music shop service in europe next week in london , the competition in the legal online music branch is about to heat up , and a price war between new entrants into the market could benefit consumers .
but perils exist for all market entrants : the already troubled german online platform , phonoline , will struggle to survive the intense competition , while apple may find marketing online tunes in europe more challenging than in the united states . shrouded in secrecy , apple ceo steve jobs has called a press conference for june 15 saying only that , " the biggest story in music is about to get even bigger " .
it is expected that apple will announce the long-anticipated launch of the european version of their online music store , which is already hugely popular in the united states .
a launch is expectedly imminently in britain , where anglo-saxon copyright rules make it easier to negotiate with rights-holders and record companies , but launches in france and germany could also come at the same time . in the first year , stateside music fans flocked to the site to download - and pay for - more than 70 million songs .
no doubt apple executives hope to repeat their success in europe .
however , they will find increased competition in the european market from a host of recently launched clones . on may 20 , napster launched in britain , joining industry leader od2 .
sony is expected to enter into the european market at the end of june .
in germany , music labels launched their own online music store , phoneline , in march , though the effort has been plagued by criticisms that the library is too limited and prices too high . individual members of the music industry throughout europe are engaged in a bitter struggle to attract customers amidst fierce competition . dw staff -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german online music platform 's troubled first weeks just weeks after its launch , phonoline , germany 's first online music platform , is the object of much criticism .

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 08.06.2004 china : the uninvited guest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is open to the west , but still not part of the g-8 the g-8 summit brings together leaders from the world 's richest and most influential countries .
but there is one country missing from the guest list - china , which has grown to be the world ’ s sixth largest economy . it ’ s difficult these days not to mention china when talking about the state of the global economy .
but the leaders of the world ’ s top nations appear to be trying to do just that at their annual g-8 summit currently underway in georgia in the southern united states .
despite the fact that china has grown into the world ’ s sixth largest economy , surpassing g-8 members russia and canada , beijing doesn ’ t have a representative at the meeting .
china feels it rightly belongs at the gathering of the world 's richest and most influential countries .
no other nation drives the world 's market for natural resources more than china with its insatiable appetite for oil , gas and steel ; and no other nation can boast a record of imports and exports that are growing at such staggering rates .
a revaluation of the yuan would send waves through financial markets worldwide , an indicator of how closely watched the asian giant is .
it therefore comes as a surprise to many chinese that their country still hasn ’ t been invited to become a member of the g-8 or at least attend the summit as a guest such as the european commission .
a new foreign strategy the chinese state media once derided the g-8 as a " club of the rich " and said it competed against the united nations for global influence .
today , however , the desire to join the club is more prevalent than ever , says beijing professor for international relations zhang xizhen .
" this altered interest is part of china ’ s new strategy of foreign policy , " he says .
" everyone knows that china was once a closed country that the west in particular couldn ’ t trust .
but recent reforms and more experience with the west have begun to change things here . "
beijing has realized that it can only deal with today ’ s challenges of globalization by cooperating with the world 's biggest economies .
" this is why china is trying to play a more international role , and it ’ s only natural that it wants to be included in the g-8 , " says xizhen .
but china ’ s failure to live up to promises it made when it joined the world trade organization compounds the group of eight 's hesitation about admitting it into the circle of top industrialized countries .
beijing 's continuing poor human rights record also weighs against china being classified as an exemplary democracy .
the chinese , however , counter such skepticism by claiming their country can only get on the proper track with the aid of the international community . kerstin lohse for mdr -lrb- sh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the view from the summit dw-world 's special on the background , history and goals of the g-8 as well as news from the summit in sea island , off georgia 's atlantic coast bmw moves into high gear in china bmw became the latest heavyweight investor on the chinese car market this week with the opening of its own factory in shenyang , making china one of the biggest foreign production sites for german automakers .

" in principle the german government would have no reservations about an export licence , " he stressed , adding that " we are fully conscious of israel 's security needs .
but we are not in a position to make any form of financial concessions " . in other words , the price of € 500 million per submarine wo n't be reduced - unlike the last time israel bought submarines from germany , when berlin allowed a huge discount .
struck made clear that this wo n't be happening again . israeli jets hit lebanon for now , the issue remains undecided .
a final decision on exporting submarines to a crisis zone such as israel would have to be taken by germany 's security council , whose meetings are not made public . in fact , german government policy is to limit arms exports to conflict regions .
but tension in the middle east shows no sign of letting up . a day after struck 's comments , israeli warplanes carried out an air strike close to the lebanese capital , beirut , with a spokesman for the israeli military saying it had struck at a guerrilla target in response to missile fire on an israeli naval vessel , while lebanese sources said the target was a palestinian guerrilla base south of beirut . intensified bilateral cooperation nonetheless , struck seems optimistic that the deal will go ahead and also suggested the deal would be reciprocal . " israel has a special experience when it comes to un-crewed airplanes , " he said , pointing out that " right now such planes are mostly deployed for surveillance .
but israel is very advanced in the development and armament of this system .
that ’ s very interesting for us .
and we will follow up on this point in the course of our intensified bilateral co-operation . " the german government also continues to offer assistance in the exchange of prisoners between israel and the lebanese hezbollah militias .
german mediation prompted successful completion of such an exchange in january this year .
as struck said " the israeli president and the prime minister both thanked us for the assistance that we provided .
we offered our help whenever it was necessary .
and i hope that there will be further opportunities to exchange prisoners with the assistance of the german air force .

berlin is planning to give its stagnating university system a shot in the arm with a € 1.9 billion program to create germany 's version of ivy league elite colleges .
officials hope it will spur academic competition . faced with overcrowded lecture halls , outdated teaching materials and unmotivated professors , students in germany often take years to finish courses .
but chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s center-left government now wants to reinvigorate the country 's system of higher education , aiming to spend about € 1.9 billion in extra money for universities over the next five years .
education minister edelgard bulmahn says the money is to encourage competition between universities and to reward centers of excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn says elite universities will help germany compete better in the global marketplace .
" we need a climate where universities engage in competition , " bulmahn said on monday .
" we have a lot of experience funding and organizing outstanding scientific excellence in our research institutes .
but we don ’ t have high-performance universities that are acknowledged worldwide .
so that means we need more competition between universities and the willingness to attract people not only from our own universities and surroundings , but from abroad as well . "
germany ’ s long-standing image of the land of poets and philosophers has been severely tarnished in recent years as international studies on education have shown the german primary school system to be mediocre at best .
the situation in the country 's universities is only slightly better .
academic competition bulmahn wants germany to become more active in the race for the world ’ s best brains by establishing elite universities that one day , the government hopes , will rival harvard , oxford or american ivy league universities .
the plan for the extra funding has received the full backing from the country ’ s powerful state premiers , who are in charge of education here , and a competition to determine which universities get the money will be held later this year .
ten will be singled out , with each receiving an extra € 25 million a year .
a parallel program will also reward individual departments with strong academic records and leading research groups .
the competition for the pot of gold will be fierce because many university heads , including dieter lenzen of berlin ’ s free university , think they stand a good chance of winning .
" there is already a ranking of german universities , " he says .
" and after munich and heidelberg , berlin ’ s free university is in third place .
so i think we are well-positioned for the competition . "
a jury of german research and science experts is to establish criteria for selecting the best universities .
internationally renowned research results and an emphasis on promoting talented students , are said to be among them .
fear of neglect but some observers have warned the government against neglecting the broader spectrum of university education in its drive for top performance and elite schools .
" it is of course important to establish elite institutions , " says karl einhäuptl of the national science council , " but at the same time we must strive to maintain the high standards of our universities in general .
it ’ s not surprising that german scientists are wanted by american institutions .
that ’ s because they are well-trained . "
the initiative is also meant to attract more foreign students to german universities .
easier access to jobs here , which is expected to come with a new immigration law and the absence of tuition fees , the government hopes , will serve as extra incentives to aspiring academics from abroad . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : an elite university or a university for the elite ?

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 08.06.2004 china : the uninvited guest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is open to the west , but still not part of the g-8 the g-8 summit brings together leaders from the world 's richest and most influential countries .
but there is one country missing from the guest list - china , which has grown to be the world ’ s sixth largest economy . it ’ s difficult these days not to mention china when talking about the state of the global economy .
but the leaders of the world ’ s top nations appear to be trying to do just that at their annual g-8 summit currently underway in georgia in the southern united states .
despite the fact that china has grown into the world ’ s sixth largest economy , surpassing g-8 members russia and canada , beijing doesn ’ t have a representative at the meeting .
china feels it rightly belongs at the gathering of the world 's richest and most influential countries .
no other nation drives the world 's market for natural resources more than china with its insatiable appetite for oil , gas and steel ; and no other nation can boast a record of imports and exports that are growing at such staggering rates .
a revaluation of the yuan would send waves through financial markets worldwide , an indicator of how closely watched the asian giant is .
it therefore comes as a surprise to many chinese that their country still hasn ’ t been invited to become a member of the g-8 or at least attend the summit as a guest such as the european commission .
a new foreign strategy the chinese state media once derided the g-8 as a " club of the rich " and said it competed against the united nations for global influence .
today , however , the desire to join the club is more prevalent than ever , says beijing professor for international relations zhang xizhen .
" this altered interest is part of china ’ s new strategy of foreign policy , " he says .
" everyone knows that china was once a closed country that the west in particular couldn ’ t trust .
but recent reforms and more experience with the west have begun to change things here . "
beijing has realized that it can only deal with today ’ s challenges of globalization by cooperating with the world 's biggest economies .
" this is why china is trying to play a more international role , and it ’ s only natural that it wants to be included in the g-8 , " says xizhen .
but china ’ s failure to live up to promises it made when it joined the world trade organization compounds the group of eight 's hesitation about admitting it into the circle of top industrialized countries .
beijing 's continuing poor human rights record also weighs against china being classified as an exemplary democracy .
the chinese , however , counter such skepticism by claiming their country can only get on the proper track with the aid of the international community . kerstin lohse for mdr -lrb- sh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the view from the summit dw-world 's special on the background , history and goals of the g-8 as well as news from the summit in sea island , off georgia 's atlantic coast bmw moves into high gear in china bmw became the latest heavyweight investor on the chinese car market this week with the opening of its own factory in shenyang , making china one of the biggest foreign production sites for german automakers .

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 08.06.2004 china : the uninvited guest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is open to the west , but still not part of the g-8 the g-8 summit brings together leaders from the world 's richest and most influential countries .
but there is one country missing from the guest list - china , which has grown to be the world ’ s sixth largest economy . it ’ s difficult these days not to mention china when talking about the state of the global economy .
but the leaders of the world ’ s top nations appear to be trying to do just that at their annual g-8 summit currently underway in georgia in the southern united states .
despite the fact that china has grown into the world ’ s sixth largest economy , surpassing g-8 members russia and canada , beijing doesn ’ t have a representative at the meeting .
china feels it rightly belongs at the gathering of the world 's richest and most influential countries .
no other nation drives the world 's market for natural resources more than china with its insatiable appetite for oil , gas and steel ; and no other nation can boast a record of imports and exports that are growing at such staggering rates .
a revaluation of the yuan would send waves through financial markets worldwide , an indicator of how closely watched the asian giant is .
it therefore comes as a surprise to many chinese that their country still hasn ’ t been invited to become a member of the g-8 or at least attend the summit as a guest such as the european commission .
a new foreign strategy the chinese state media once derided the g-8 as a " club of the rich " and said it competed against the united nations for global influence .
today , however , the desire to join the club is more prevalent than ever , says beijing professor for international relations zhang xizhen .
" this altered interest is part of china ’ s new strategy of foreign policy , " he says .
" everyone knows that china was once a closed country that the west in particular couldn ’ t trust .
but recent reforms and more experience with the west have begun to change things here . "
beijing has realized that it can only deal with today ’ s challenges of globalization by cooperating with the world 's biggest economies .
" this is why china is trying to play a more international role , and it ’ s only natural that it wants to be included in the g-8 , " says xizhen .
but china ’ s failure to live up to promises it made when it joined the world trade organization compounds the group of eight 's hesitation about admitting it into the circle of top industrialized countries .

the european court of human rights this week takes up the fate of kurdish leader abdullah öcalan .
both ankara and öcalan 's lawyers are appealing portions of an earlier court ruling that he did not get a fair trial . the european court of human rights held in march 2003 that turkey did not give kurdish rebel leader abdullah öcalan a fair trial in 1999 after his spectacular arrest in kenya .
öcalan 's restricted access to his attorneys and other irregularities in the case , including the presence of a military judge , led the strasbourg court to rule the case had been " unfair " and its order that the turkish government to pay € 100,000 of öcalan 's legal fees .
now , both sides are contesting the ruling by the court 's lower chamber - turkey in an effort to clear its human rights record and öcalan in an effort to get a re-trial .
turkey which is currently negotiating a starting date for european union talks to become a member of the european union , was harshly criticized for its treatment of öcalan , which many viewed as inhumane .
the court 's original ruling cast an uncomfortable spotlight on turkey 's spotty human rights record .
with its strong eu aspirations , ankara has undertaken a series of major democratic reforms of its justice system and now wants to wash its hands clean of the messy case and is seeking to a reversal of the previous ruling .
during its rehearing of the case , which begins on wednesday , the court will have to answer some tough questions , including whether öcalan 's arrest , his kidnapping from kenya to turkey or his trial in a state security court was in harmony with european legal standards .
an international conspiracy ?
a turkish special commando trapped the 55-year-old leader of the militant kurdish separatist organization pkk -lrb- kurdistan worker 's party -rrb- in february 1999 , arrested him and then flew him to turkey .
öcalan had been stranded in nairobi , kenya , in february 1999 after an odyssey through several european countries following his expulsion from syria , where he was living in exile .
öcalan 's lawyers believe his arrest and kidnapping violated international legal conventions .
they are now demanding the testimony of heads of government , ministers and intelligence agency officials from a number of eu countries and turkey to buttress their case .
they have also described their client 's arrest as the result of an " international plot . "
but on that point and that of his life in isolation , öcalan faces an uphill battle with the judges .
the ruling of the court of first instance discounted öcalan 's claims of a sweeping international conspiracy , and also held that the isolated conditions of his prison , where he is the sole inmate , on imrali island near istanbul did not violate any laws .
as part of the overtures ankara is making to brussels for possible future eu membership , it recently eliminated the military courts , banned capital punishment and consequently commuted öcalan 's sentence for high treason in accord with its constitutional amendments to life imprisonment .
pkk fight against turkey according to opinion polls , the majority of turks hold öcalan accountable for the pkk 's failed bid to create an independent kurdistan on turkish soil between 1984 and 1999 .
pkk-led guerrilla fighting , which öcalan orchestrated from neighboring syria , led to the deaths of 40,000 people , including kurds and turkish soldiers .
the skirmishes injured hundreds of thousands , and millions of kurds and other minorities were displaced from settlement areas in regions of east and southeast anatolya were the heaviest fighting occurred .
the international community strongly criticized turkey at the time for its refusal to grant minority rights to the kurds .
if the strasbourg court decides in öcalan 's favor , turkey could be forced to hold a new trial .
but öcalan 's lawyers say it would be impossible for a fair trial to be held in turkey and are instead demanding that the issue , which they say effects all people in turkey , be taken up by the international criminal court in the hague . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey to abolish the death penalty in a landmark decision , the turkish parliament pushed ahead with a reform package that includes lifting the death penalty in peacetime .

the european court of human rights this week takes up the fate of kurdish leader abdullah öcalan .
both ankara and öcalan 's lawyers are appealing portions of an earlier court ruling that he did not get a fair trial . the european court of human rights held in march 2003 that turkey did not give kurdish rebel leader abdullah öcalan a fair trial in 1999 after his spectacular arrest in kenya .
öcalan 's restricted access to his attorneys and other irregularities in the case , including the presence of a military judge , led the strasbourg court to rule the case had been " unfair " and its order that the turkish government to pay € 100,000 of öcalan 's legal fees .
now , both sides are contesting the ruling by the court 's lower chamber - turkey in an effort to clear its human rights record and öcalan in an effort to get a re-trial .
turkey which is currently negotiating a starting date for european union talks to become a member of the european union , was harshly criticized for its treatment of öcalan , which many viewed as inhumane .
the court 's original ruling cast an uncomfortable spotlight on turkey 's spotty human rights record .
with its strong eu aspirations , ankara has undertaken a series of major democratic reforms of its justice system and now wants to wash its hands clean of the messy case and is seeking to a reversal of the previous ruling .
during its rehearing of the case , which begins on wednesday , the court will have to answer some tough questions , including whether öcalan 's arrest , his kidnapping from kenya to turkey or his trial in a state security court was in harmony with european legal standards .
an international conspiracy ?
a turkish special commando trapped the 55-year-old leader of the militant kurdish separatist organization pkk -lrb- kurdistan worker 's party -rrb- in february 1999 , arrested him and then flew him to turkey .
öcalan had been stranded in nairobi , kenya , in february 1999 after an odyssey through several european countries following his expulsion from syria , where he was living in exile .
öcalan 's lawyers believe his arrest and kidnapping violated international legal conventions .
they are now demanding the testimony of heads of government , ministers and intelligence agency officials from a number of eu countries and turkey to buttress their case .
they have also described their client 's arrest as the result of an " international plot . "
but on that point and that of his life in isolation , öcalan faces an uphill battle with the judges .
the ruling of the court of first instance discounted öcalan 's claims of a sweeping international conspiracy , and also held that the isolated conditions of his prison , where he is the sole inmate , on imrali island near istanbul did not violate any laws .
as part of the overtures ankara is making to brussels for possible future eu membership , it recently eliminated the military courts , banned capital punishment and consequently commuted öcalan 's sentence for high treason in accord with its constitutional amendments to life imprisonment .
pkk fight against turkey according to opinion polls , the majority of turks hold öcalan accountable for the pkk 's failed bid to create an independent kurdistan on turkish soil between 1984 and 1999 .
pkk-led guerrilla fighting , which öcalan orchestrated from neighboring syria , led to the deaths of 40,000 people , including kurds and turkish soldiers .
the skirmishes injured hundreds of thousands , and millions of kurds and other minorities were displaced from settlement areas in regions of east and southeast anatolya were the heaviest fighting occurred .
the international community strongly criticized turkey at the time for its refusal to grant minority rights to the kurds .
if the strasbourg court decides in öcalan 's favor , turkey could be forced to hold a new trial .
but öcalan 's lawyers say it would be impossible for a fair trial to be held in turkey and are instead demanding that the issue , which they say effects all people in turkey , be taken up by the international criminal court in the hague . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey to abolish the death penalty in a landmark decision , the turkish parliament pushed ahead with a reform package that includes lifting the death penalty in peacetime .

music labels clamping down on music pirates scored their first victory in germany on tuesday .
meanwhile , the competition in the legal online music trade is heating up with the launch of apple itunes in europe next week . for one music enthusiast in the eastern german city of cottbus , the good times of downloading music for free via peer-to-peer file-sharing programs like kazaa came to an abrupt end on tuesday .
he was convicted in a german court of copyright infringement , according to a statement released by the german federal association of the phonographic industry in berlin . the 23-year-old will have to fork over a hefty € 8,000 -lrb- $ 9,855 -rrb- in fines in addition to covering the legal costs of the case . the case is expected to set a precedent for future cases , said gerd gebhard , the chairman of the association , and will also serve as a cautionary tale to those considering illegal music file-sharing . clamping down on illegal downloaders the case , one of 68 brought against people who download music illegally in germany , represents a significant victory for a music industry desperate to stem the tide of lost profits since music file-sharing and downloading software like kazaa and napster became hugely popular . in germany alone , internet piracy contributed to a 20 percent drop in profits , which has resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs , according to industry officials .
globally , losses are estimated at $ 2.4 billion -lrb- € 1.96 -rrb- a year . the strategy of pursuing illegal music pirates in the courts is part of a two-pronged approach .
in addition , music industry executives are hoping to bring illegal file-swappers back into the market by offering them the chance to download music legally - for a fee - via a host of new legal and industry-sponsored online platforms . itunes europe in june ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple launched its itunes music store to feed its wildly popular ipod digital players .
with a major announcement about the introduction of apple 's itunes music shop service in europe next week in london , the competition in the legal online music branch is about to heat up , and a price war between new entrants into the market could benefit consumers .
but perils exist for all market entrants : the already troubled german online platform , phonoline , will struggle to survive the intense competition , while apple may find marketing online tunes in europe more challenging than in the united states . shrouded in secrecy , apple ceo steve jobs has called a press conference for june 15 saying only that , " the biggest story in music is about to get even bigger " .
it is expected that apple will announce the long-anticipated launch of the european version of their online music store , which is already hugely popular in the united states .
a launch is expectedly imminently in britain , where anglo-saxon copyright rules make it easier to negotiate with rights-holders and record companies , but launches in france and germany could also come at the same time . in the first year , stateside music fans flocked to the site to download - and pay for - more than 70 million songs .
no doubt apple executives hope to repeat their success in europe .
however , they will find increased competition in the european market from a host of recently launched clones . on may 20 , napster launched in britain , joining industry leader od2 .
sony is expected to enter into the european market at the end of june .
in germany , music labels launched their own online music store , phoneline , in march , though the effort has been plagued by criticisms that the library is too limited and prices too high . individual members of the music industry throughout europe are engaged in a bitter struggle to attract customers amidst fierce competition . dw staff -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german online music platform 's troubled first weeks just weeks after its launch , phonoline , germany 's first online music platform , is the object of much criticism .

officials hope it will spur academic competition . faced with overcrowded lecture halls , outdated teaching materials and unmotivated professors , students in germany often take years to finish courses .
but chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s center-left government now wants to reinvigorate the country 's system of higher education , aiming to spend about € 1.9 billion in extra money for universities over the next five years .

the plan for the extra funding has received the full backing from the country ’ s powerful state premiers , who are in charge of education here , and a competition to determine which universities get the money will be held later this year .

china : the uninvited guest europe -pipe- 08.06.2004 from bit player to global heavyweight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich and influential .
leaders of the world 's richest nations will meet off georgia 's coast from june 8-10 .
the g-8 summit has moved from being an intimate fireside chat to a weighty meeting with a broad economic as well as political agenda . the first world economic summit was founded in 1975 by the then french president giscard d ' estaing and the former german chancellor helmut schmidt . the six leaders of germany , france , italy , japan , great britain and the united states met for a fireside chat at the rambouillet castle near the french capital of paris to discuss questions of international economics policies in a relaxed intimate atmosphere . from g-6 to g-8 a year later at the dorado beach , puerto rico summit , canada was accepted into the illustrious circle leading to the coining of the word ' g-7 . ' in 1977 the president of the european commission was invited to participate in the annual event , a move that resulted in a broadening of the range of topics to include questions of foreign policy . in 1998 russia , which had unofficially been a part of the g-7 talks since 1994 , was officially accepted into the fold at the birmingham summit as one of the most politically-important countries .
the move completed the g-8 or group of eight circle as it is known today . however on financial and currency matters , it was the g-7 that continued to hold talks because russia had still to take on a role comparable to the g-7 's when it came to these issues on the world stage . the g8 's agenda has also broadened significantly throughout its history .

leaders of the world 's richest nations will meet off georgia 's coast from june 8-10 .
the g-8 summit has moved from being an intimate fireside chat to a weighty meeting with a broad economic as well as political agenda . the first world economic summit was founded in 1975 by the then french president giscard d ' estaing and the former german chancellor helmut schmidt . the six leaders of germany , france , italy , japan , great britain and the united states met for a fireside chat at the rambouillet castle near the french capital of paris to discuss questions of international economics policies in a relaxed intimate atmosphere . from g-6 to g-8 a year later at the dorado beach , puerto rico summit , canada was accepted into the illustrious circle leading to the coining of the word ' g-7 . ' in 1977 the president of the european commission was invited to participate in the annual event , a move that resulted in a broadening of the range of topics to include questions of foreign policy . in 1998 russia , which had unofficially been a part of the g-7 talks since 1994 , was officially accepted into the fold at the birmingham summit as one of the most politically-important countries .
the move completed the g-8 or group of eight circle as it is known today . however on financial and currency matters , it was the g-7 that continued to hold talks because russia had still to take on a role comparable to the g-7 's when it came to these issues on the world stage . the g8 's agenda has also broadened significantly throughout its history .
as a result , the g8 member countries now have separate meetings throughout the year for finance , foreign and labor ministers . weighing in on international issues meanwhile the regular meetings of the eight world leaders have turned into a massive media spectacle , often accompanied by protests from anti-globalization activists and opponents of neo-liberal capitalism . the protests reached a climax in july 2001 in genoa , italy , when 23-year-old student and protestor carlo guiliani was brutally beaten and died in clashes between the demonstrators and the police . doubt has often been cast on the political significance of the g-8 talks and its effectiveness in addressing issues of international concerns . however summit participants vehemently defend themselves against the charge . at the opening address of the g-8 summit in evian , france last year , french president chirac said the meet should be based on four principles : solidarity , responsibility , security and democracy .

german politicians are up in arms over a planned tax write-off by british telecom giant vodafone that would deny the german government more than € 20 billion in tax revenues . the write-off stems from vodafone 's 2000 takeover of germany 's mannesmann , a telecoms company .
after the telecoms bubble burst in 2001 , the price of vodafone shares dropped dramatically .
experts say the company is now taking advantage of a german tax loophole to write-off the losses it took by paying too much for mannesmann . coming at a time when the federal government is in desperate need of tax income , the planned write-off is being painted by politicians as corporate greed at the expense of the taxpayers .
" it 's an unbelievable outrage , " german member of parliament michael müller told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
the state government in north rhine-westphalia , where mannesmann was based , is also looking into the legality of the move . the state , germany 's largest , is especially dear to chancellor gerhard schröder .
in one year , state elections will prove an important litmus test for his or his social democrat party 's re-electability in federal elections in 2006 .
but tax specialists say the government 's populism on the write-off will not have much of an effect on the decision . " i 'm afraid vodafone has had a very close look at german tax laws and discovered a loophole , " tax expert wolfgang gehrke told deutsche welle .
" this loophole is costing the finance minister up to € 25 billion .
for ordinary german taxpayers this is unacceptable , but only morally and not legally . " lenient laws in 1999 , schröder 's government rewrote the tax laws to give companies leeway to offset past losses against current profits .
in 2001 , vodafone bought mannesmann for € 200 billion , a figure observers thought very high at the time .
when the telecoms bubble burst in 2002 , the price of mannesmann shares dropped from € 309 to € 200 a share , resulting in a loss of about € 50 billion to the mother company , vodafone .
the british company is arguing that the drop in value is permanent , granting it the right to write it off .
the north rhine-westphalian government said it was looking into the matter . mannesmann as scapegoat the uproar over mannesmann is a continuation of a saga surrounding the vodafone takeover and german attitudes toward capitalism . prosecutors are wrapping up a case in düsseldorf against six former mannesmann executives accused of accepting large cash bonuses in order to smooth the way for the vodafone acquisition .
now government officials want to hold mannesmann up for a practice that experts say is commonplace in the corporate world . in 2002 , deutsche telekom wrote off € 21 billion after re-valuing their mobile business in the united states .
german power company e.on wrote off € 2.4 billion of the € 8.1 billion purchase price of the british company powergen . finance ministry officials have ruled out a legislation change , say that enough measures have already been taken to close abuse of the loophole . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank boss cool under fire in mannesmann trial deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , currently facing “ breach of trust ” charges for approving controversial bonuses to mannesmann directors , told a düsseldorf court on thursday that he had nothing to hide .

leaders of the world 's richest nations will meet off georgia 's coast from june 8-10 .
the g-8 summit has moved from being an intimate fireside chat to a weighty meeting with a broad economic as well as political agenda . the first world economic summit was founded in 1975 by the then french president giscard d ' estaing and the former german chancellor helmut schmidt . the six leaders of germany , france , italy , japan , great britain and the united states met for a fireside chat at the rambouillet castle near the french capital of paris to discuss questions of international economics policies in a relaxed intimate atmosphere . from g-6 to g-8 a year later at the dorado beach , puerto rico summit , canada was accepted into the illustrious circle leading to the coining of the word ' g-7 . ' in 1977 the president of the european commission was invited to participate in the annual event , a move that resulted in a broadening of the range of topics to include questions of foreign policy . in 1998 russia , which had unofficially been a part of the g-7 talks since 1994 , was officially accepted into the fold at the birmingham summit as one of the most politically-important countries .
the move completed the g-8 or group of eight circle as it is known today . however on financial and currency matters , it was the g-7 that continued to hold talks because russia had still to take on a role comparable to the g-7 's when it came to these issues on the world stage . the g8 's agenda has also broadened significantly throughout its history .
as a result , the g8 member countries now have separate meetings throughout the year for finance , foreign and labor ministers . weighing in on international issues meanwhile the regular meetings of the eight world leaders have turned into a massive media spectacle , often accompanied by protests from anti-globalization activists and opponents of neo-liberal capitalism . the protests reached a climax in july 2001 in genoa , italy , when 23-year-old student and protestor carlo guiliani was brutally beaten and died in clashes between the demonstrators and the police . doubt has often been cast on the political significance of the g-8 talks and its effectiveness in addressing issues of international concerns . however summit participants vehemently defend themselves against the charge . at the opening address of the g-8 summit in evian , france last year , french president chirac said the meet should be based on four principles : solidarity , responsibility , security and democracy .
referring to ' responsibility ' , chirac recommended that " the g-8 states should formulate principles for a responsible market policy oriented towards permanent development , and which is accompanied by concrete actions to , for instance , fight corruption or to use research and innovation to aid the environment . " heavyweight status the german government has also long ceased to describe the g-8 meets as a mere relaxed fireside chat . " the big advantage of the g-8 cooperation is that it links a high degree of flexibility with the necessary economic and political power needed to push through its decisions .

china : the uninvited guest europe -pipe- 08.06.2004 from bit player to global heavyweight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich and influential .
leaders of the world 's richest nations will meet off georgia 's coast from june 8-10 .
the g-8 summit has moved from being an intimate fireside chat to a weighty meeting with a broad economic as well as political agenda . the first world economic summit was founded in 1975 by the then french president giscard d ' estaing and the former german chancellor helmut schmidt . the six leaders of germany , france , italy , japan , great britain and the united states met for a fireside chat at the rambouillet castle near the french capital of paris to discuss questions of international economics policies in a relaxed intimate atmosphere . from g-6 to g-8 a year later at the dorado beach , puerto rico summit , canada was accepted into the illustrious circle leading to the coining of the word ' g-7 . ' in 1977 the president of the european commission was invited to participate in the annual event , a move that resulted in a broadening of the range of topics to include questions of foreign policy . in 1998 russia , which had unofficially been a part of the g-7 talks since 1994 , was officially accepted into the fold at the birmingham summit as one of the most politically-important countries .
the move completed the g-8 or group of eight circle as it is known today . however on financial and currency matters , it was the g-7 that continued to hold talks because russia had still to take on a role comparable to the g-7 's when it came to these issues on the world stage . the g8 's agenda has also broadened significantly throughout its history .
as a result , the g8 member countries now have separate meetings throughout the year for finance , foreign and labor ministers . weighing in on international issues meanwhile the regular meetings of the eight world leaders have turned into a massive media spectacle , often accompanied by protests from anti-globalization activists and opponents of neo-liberal capitalism . the protests reached a climax in july 2001 in genoa , italy , when 23-year-old student and protestor carlo guiliani was brutally beaten and died in clashes between the demonstrators and the police . doubt has often been cast on the political significance of the g-8 talks and its effectiveness in addressing issues of international concerns . however summit participants vehemently defend themselves against the charge . at the opening address of the g-8 summit in evian , france last year , french president chirac said the meet should be based on four principles : solidarity , responsibility , security and democracy .
referring to ' responsibility ' , chirac recommended that " the g-8 states should formulate principles for a responsible market policy oriented towards permanent development , and which is accompanied by concrete actions to , for instance , fight corruption or to use research and innovation to aid the environment . " heavyweight status the german government has also long ceased to describe the g-8 meets as a mere relaxed fireside chat . " the big advantage of the g-8 cooperation is that it links a high degree of flexibility with the necessary economic and political power needed to push through its decisions .
the decisions exude a great political influence , which the individual states can not evade , " according to the german economics and finance ministry . the economic and political muscle of the g-8 is also visible in numbers : they earn more than two- thirds of the gross world product , they 're responsible for almost half of global trade , they account for over three- fourths of worldwide development aid and are the biggest paymasters in international organizations such as the oecd -lrb- organization for economic cooperation and development -rrb- , the imf -lrb- international monetary fund -rrb- and the world bank . rolf wenkel -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the view from the summit dw-world 's special on the background , history and goals of the g-8 as well as news from the summit in sea island , off georgia 's atlantic coast .

music labels clamping down on music pirates scored their first victory in germany on tuesday .
meanwhile , the competition in the legal online music trade is heating up with the launch of apple itunes in europe next week . for one music enthusiast in the eastern german city of cottbus , the good times of downloading music for free via peer-to-peer file-sharing programs like kazaa came to an abrupt end on tuesday .
he was convicted in a german court of copyright infringement , according to a statement released by the german federal association of the phonographic industry in berlin . the 23-year-old will have to fork over a hefty € 8,000 -lrb- $ 9,855 -rrb- in fines in addition to covering the legal costs of the case . the case is expected to set a precedent for future cases , said gerd gebhard , the chairman of the association , and will also serve as a cautionary tale to those considering illegal music file-sharing . clamping down on illegal downloaders the case , one of 68 brought against people who download music illegally in germany , represents a significant victory for a music industry desperate to stem the tide of lost profits since music file-sharing and downloading software like kazaa and napster became hugely popular . in germany alone , internet piracy contributed to a 20 percent drop in profits , which has resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs , according to industry officials .
globally , losses are estimated at $ 2.4 billion -lrb- € 1.96 -rrb- a year . the strategy of pursuing illegal music pirates in the courts is part of a two-pronged approach .

with a major announcement about the introduction of apple 's itunes music shop service in europe next week in london , the competition in the legal online music branch is about to heat up , and a price war between new entrants into the market could benefit consumers .
but perils exist for all market entrants : the already troubled german online platform , phonoline , will struggle to survive the intense competition , while apple may find marketing online tunes in europe more challenging than in the united states . shrouded in secrecy , apple ceo steve jobs has called a press conference for june 15 saying only that , " the biggest story in music is about to get even bigger " .
it is expected that apple will announce the long-anticipated launch of the european version of their online music store , which is already hugely popular in the united states .
a launch is expectedly imminently in britain , where anglo-saxon copyright rules make it easier to negotiate with rights-holders and record companies , but launches in france and germany could also come at the same time . in the first year , stateside music fans flocked to the site to download - and pay for - more than 70 million songs .

music labels clamping down on music pirates scored their first victory in germany on tuesday .
meanwhile , the competition in the legal online music trade is heating up with the launch of apple itunes in europe next week . for one music enthusiast in the eastern german city of cottbus , the good times of downloading music for free via peer-to-peer file-sharing programs like kazaa came to an abrupt end on tuesday .
he was convicted in a german court of copyright infringement , according to a statement released by the german federal association of the phonographic industry in berlin . the 23-year-old will have to fork over a hefty € 8,000 -lrb- $ 9,855 -rrb- in fines in addition to covering the legal costs of the case . the case is expected to set a precedent for future cases , said gerd gebhard , the chairman of the association , and will also serve as a cautionary tale to those considering illegal music file-sharing . clamping down on illegal downloaders the case , one of 68 brought against people who download music illegally in germany , represents a significant victory for a music industry desperate to stem the tide of lost profits since music file-sharing and downloading software like kazaa and napster became hugely popular . in germany alone , internet piracy contributed to a 20 percent drop in profits , which has resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs , according to industry officials .
globally , losses are estimated at $ 2.4 billion -lrb- € 1.96 -rrb- a year . the strategy of pursuing illegal music pirates in the courts is part of a two-pronged approach .
in addition , music industry executives are hoping to bring illegal file-swappers back into the market by offering them the chance to download music legally - for a fee - via a host of new legal and industry-sponsored online platforms . itunes europe in june ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple launched its itunes music store to feed its wildly popular ipod digital players .
with a major announcement about the introduction of apple 's itunes music shop service in europe next week in london , the competition in the legal online music branch is about to heat up , and a price war between new entrants into the market could benefit consumers .
but perils exist for all market entrants : the already troubled german online platform , phonoline , will struggle to survive the intense competition , while apple may find marketing online tunes in europe more challenging than in the united states . shrouded in secrecy , apple ceo steve jobs has called a press conference for june 15 saying only that , " the biggest story in music is about to get even bigger " .
it is expected that apple will announce the long-anticipated launch of the european version of their online music store , which is already hugely popular in the united states .
a launch is expectedly imminently in britain , where anglo-saxon copyright rules make it easier to negotiate with rights-holders and record companies , but launches in france and germany could also come at the same time . in the first year , stateside music fans flocked to the site to download - and pay for - more than 70 million songs .
no doubt apple executives hope to repeat their success in europe .
however , they will find increased competition in the european market from a host of recently launched clones . on may 20 , napster launched in britain , joining industry leader od2 .
sony is expected to enter into the european market at the end of june .

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 08.06.2004 china : the uninvited guest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is open to the west , but still not part of the g-8 the g-8 summit brings together leaders from the world 's richest and most influential countries .
but there is one country missing from the guest list - china , which has grown to be the world ’ s sixth largest economy . it ’ s difficult these days not to mention china when talking about the state of the global economy .
but the leaders of the world ’ s top nations appear to be trying to do just that at their annual g-8 summit currently underway in georgia in the southern united states .
despite the fact that china has grown into the world ’ s sixth largest economy , surpassing g-8 members russia and canada , beijing doesn ’ t have a representative at the meeting .
china feels it rightly belongs at the gathering of the world 's richest and most influential countries .
no other nation drives the world 's market for natural resources more than china with its insatiable appetite for oil , gas and steel ; and no other nation can boast a record of imports and exports that are growing at such staggering rates .
a revaluation of the yuan would send waves through financial markets worldwide , an indicator of how closely watched the asian giant is .
it therefore comes as a surprise to many chinese that their country still hasn ’ t been invited to become a member of the g-8 or at least attend the summit as a guest such as the european commission .
a new foreign strategy the chinese state media once derided the g-8 as a " club of the rich " and said it competed against the united nations for global influence .
today , however , the desire to join the club is more prevalent than ever , says beijing professor for international relations zhang xizhen .
" this altered interest is part of china ’ s new strategy of foreign policy , " he says .
" everyone knows that china was once a closed country that the west in particular couldn ’ t trust .
but recent reforms and more experience with the west have begun to change things here . "
beijing has realized that it can only deal with today ’ s challenges of globalization by cooperating with the world 's biggest economies .
" this is why china is trying to play a more international role , and it ’ s only natural that it wants to be included in the g-8 , " says xizhen .
but china ’ s failure to live up to promises it made when it joined the world trade organization compounds the group of eight 's hesitation about admitting it into the circle of top industrialized countries .
beijing 's continuing poor human rights record also weighs against china being classified as an exemplary democracy .
the chinese , however , counter such skepticism by claiming their country can only get on the proper track with the aid of the international community . kerstin lohse for mdr -lrb- sh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the view from the summit dw-world 's special on the background , history and goals of the g-8 as well as news from the summit in sea island , off georgia 's atlantic coast bmw moves into high gear in china bmw became the latest heavyweight investor on the chinese car market this week with the opening of its own factory in shenyang , making china one of the biggest foreign production sites for german automakers .

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 08.06.2004 china : the uninvited guest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is open to the west , but still not part of the g-8 the g-8 summit brings together leaders from the world 's richest and most influential countries .
but there is one country missing from the guest list - china , which has grown to be the world ’ s sixth largest economy . it ’ s difficult these days not to mention china when talking about the state of the global economy .
but the leaders of the world ’ s top nations appear to be trying to do just that at their annual g-8 summit currently underway in georgia in the southern united states .
despite the fact that china has grown into the world ’ s sixth largest economy , surpassing g-8 members russia and canada , beijing doesn ’ t have a representative at the meeting .
china feels it rightly belongs at the gathering of the world 's richest and most influential countries .
no other nation drives the world 's market for natural resources more than china with its insatiable appetite for oil , gas and steel ; and no other nation can boast a record of imports and exports that are growing at such staggering rates .
a revaluation of the yuan would send waves through financial markets worldwide , an indicator of how closely watched the asian giant is .
it therefore comes as a surprise to many chinese that their country still hasn ’ t been invited to become a member of the g-8 or at least attend the summit as a guest such as the european commission .
a new foreign strategy the chinese state media once derided the g-8 as a " club of the rich " and said it competed against the united nations for global influence .
today , however , the desire to join the club is more prevalent than ever , says beijing professor for international relations zhang xizhen .
" this altered interest is part of china ’ s new strategy of foreign policy , " he says .
" everyone knows that china was once a closed country that the west in particular couldn ’ t trust .
but recent reforms and more experience with the west have begun to change things here . "
beijing has realized that it can only deal with today ’ s challenges of globalization by cooperating with the world 's biggest economies .
" this is why china is trying to play a more international role , and it ’ s only natural that it wants to be included in the g-8 , " says xizhen .
but china ’ s failure to live up to promises it made when it joined the world trade organization compounds the group of eight 's hesitation about admitting it into the circle of top industrialized countries .
beijing 's continuing poor human rights record also weighs against china being classified as an exemplary democracy .
the chinese , however , counter such skepticism by claiming their country can only get on the proper track with the aid of the international community . kerstin lohse for mdr -lrb- sh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the view from the summit dw-world 's special on the background , history and goals of the g-8 as well as news from the summit in sea island , off georgia 's atlantic coast bmw moves into high gear in china bmw became the latest heavyweight investor on the chinese car market this week with the opening of its own factory in shenyang , making china one of the biggest foreign production sites for german automakers .

berlin is planning to give its stagnating university system a shot in the arm with a € 1.9 billion program to create germany 's version of ivy league elite colleges .
officials hope it will spur academic competition . faced with overcrowded lecture halls , outdated teaching materials and unmotivated professors , students in germany often take years to finish courses .
but chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s center-left government now wants to reinvigorate the country 's system of higher education , aiming to spend about € 1.9 billion in extra money for universities over the next five years .
education minister edelgard bulmahn says the money is to encourage competition between universities and to reward centers of excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn says elite universities will help germany compete better in the global marketplace .
" we need a climate where universities engage in competition , " bulmahn said on monday .
" we have a lot of experience funding and organizing outstanding scientific excellence in our research institutes .
but we don ’ t have high-performance universities that are acknowledged worldwide .
so that means we need more competition between universities and the willingness to attract people not only from our own universities and surroundings , but from abroad as well . "
germany ’ s long-standing image of the land of poets and philosophers has been severely tarnished in recent years as international studies on education have shown the german primary school system to be mediocre at best .
the situation in the country 's universities is only slightly better .
academic competition bulmahn wants germany to become more active in the race for the world ’ s best brains by establishing elite universities that one day , the government hopes , will rival harvard , oxford or american ivy league universities .
the plan for the extra funding has received the full backing from the country ’ s powerful state premiers , who are in charge of education here , and a competition to determine which universities get the money will be held later this year .
ten will be singled out , with each receiving an extra € 25 million a year .
a parallel program will also reward individual departments with strong academic records and leading research groups .
the competition for the pot of gold will be fierce because many university heads , including dieter lenzen of berlin ’ s free university , think they stand a good chance of winning .
" there is already a ranking of german universities , " he says .
" and after munich and heidelberg , berlin ’ s free university is in third place .
so i think we are well-positioned for the competition . "
a jury of german research and science experts is to establish criteria for selecting the best universities .
internationally renowned research results and an emphasis on promoting talented students , are said to be among them .
fear of neglect but some observers have warned the government against neglecting the broader spectrum of university education in its drive for top performance and elite schools .
" it is of course important to establish elite institutions , " says karl einhäuptl of the national science council , " but at the same time we must strive to maintain the high standards of our universities in general .
it ’ s not surprising that german scientists are wanted by american institutions .
that ’ s because they are well-trained . "
the initiative is also meant to attract more foreign students to german universities .
easier access to jobs here , which is expected to come with a new immigration law and the absence of tuition fees , the government hopes , will serve as extra incentives to aspiring academics from abroad . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : an elite university or a university for the elite ?

" we find many of our ideas in this text , " foreign minister michel barnier told french radio .
though russia and china , the remaining permanent members , have yet to voice full support for the draft , diplomats expected the resolution to pass without a hitch on tuesday .
the news came after a last-minute compromise on the structure of the security partnership between coalition forces and the new iraqi government that takes power june 30 .
france and germany wanted the iraqi government of prime minister iyad allawi to have veto power over military operations conducted by the multinational force commanded by the u.s. in the new draft , the government " has authority to commit iraqi security forces to the multinational force " and new security institutions will be employed to reach agreement on military operations , according to the associated press .
" i think we have reached a stage where the resoultion has a very good text , " said gunter pleuger , germany 's u.n. ambassador .
" my feeling is we have found a compromise . "
coming more than a year after the war began to oust saddam hussein , the draft - the fourth in two weeks - marks the final piece in the quest to restore democracy and hand over power to the iraqi people by june 30 .
it is also the result of weeks of intense back-and-forth negotiations as in particular france and germany - which holds a rotating seat on the 15-member security council - held out against approving earlier drafts which in their opinion did not go far enough to ensuring iraqi sovereignty in matters of security .
france 's u.n. ambassador , jean-marc de la sabliere had sought changes that would require the u.s.-led forces to seek approval from the iraqi interim government for " sensitive offensive operations " after june 30 .
washington 's u.n. ambassador john negroponte played down suggestions council members were asking for iraq to have veto power over military action , something washington has repeatedly refused to accept .
" veto is not really an appropriate term , " he said .
" but will these things be coordinated , will we work hard to ensure the greatest possible harmony on these issues ?
yes , " he said .
in letters to the security council , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and prime minister allawi pledged that baghdad and the multinational force would cooperate on any military action .
neither referred to veto powers .
pledges of military cooperation in his letter , powell said that the u.s.-led multinational force -lrb- mnf -rrb- would continue " activities necessary to counter ongoing security threats posed by forces seeking to influence iraq 's political future through violence . "
he pledged that the mnf would work with allawi 's government to " reach agreement on the full range of fundamental security and policy issues , including policy on sensitive offensive operations . "
allawi , speaking for the interim government , said that iraq would establish a national security committee and invite mnf commanders to " attend and participate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi men watch iraq 's new prime minister , iyad allawi , in his first televised address to the nation since his appointment .
allawi told the nation on june 4 that the presence of american and other foreign troops would guarantee iraqi security after the nation regains its sovereignty on june 30 .
" until we are able to provide security for ourselves , including the defense of iraq 's land , sea and air space , we ask for the support of the security council and the international community in this endeavor , " the prime minister wrote .
" since these are sensitive issues for a number of sovereign governments , including iraq and the united states , they need to be resolved in the framework of a mutual understanding on our strategic partnership , " he said , but stopped short of calling for veto powers .
a deal on tuesday ?
russia , a permanent member with veto powers like france , said the draft was not quite a done deal .
even though " intensive diplomatic negotiations " on sunday had produced " positive results " , deputy foreign minister juri fedotow was quoted by interfax wire service as saying several points still needed to be addressed before the resolution could be approved .
without elaborating on the details , he said discussions would continue on monday and he hoped russia 's position would be incorporated in the final draft .
" we 're confident that it does the trick , " said british ambassador emyr jones parry , whose country co-sponsored the draft .

berlin is planning to give its stagnating university system a shot in the arm with a € 1.9 billion program to create germany 's version of ivy league elite colleges .
officials hope it will spur academic competition . faced with overcrowded lecture halls , outdated teaching materials and unmotivated professors , students in germany often take years to finish courses .
but chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s center-left government now wants to reinvigorate the country 's system of higher education , aiming to spend about € 1.9 billion in extra money for universities over the next five years .
education minister edelgard bulmahn says the money is to encourage competition between universities and to reward centers of excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn says elite universities will help germany compete better in the global marketplace .
" we need a climate where universities engage in competition , " bulmahn said on monday .
" we have a lot of experience funding and organizing outstanding scientific excellence in our research institutes .
but we don ’ t have high-performance universities that are acknowledged worldwide .
so that means we need more competition between universities and the willingness to attract people not only from our own universities and surroundings , but from abroad as well . "
germany ’ s long-standing image of the land of poets and philosophers has been severely tarnished in recent years as international studies on education have shown the german primary school system to be mediocre at best .
the situation in the country 's universities is only slightly better .
academic competition bulmahn wants germany to become more active in the race for the world ’ s best brains by establishing elite universities that one day , the government hopes , will rival harvard , oxford or american ivy league universities .
the plan for the extra funding has received the full backing from the country ’ s powerful state premiers , who are in charge of education here , and a competition to determine which universities get the money will be held later this year .
ten will be singled out , with each receiving an extra € 25 million a year .
a parallel program will also reward individual departments with strong academic records and leading research groups .
the competition for the pot of gold will be fierce because many university heads , including dieter lenzen of berlin ’ s free university , think they stand a good chance of winning .
" there is already a ranking of german universities , " he says .
" and after munich and heidelberg , berlin ’ s free university is in third place .
so i think we are well-positioned for the competition . "
a jury of german research and science experts is to establish criteria for selecting the best universities .
internationally renowned research results and an emphasis on promoting talented students , are said to be among them .
fear of neglect but some observers have warned the government against neglecting the broader spectrum of university education in its drive for top performance and elite schools .
" it is of course important to establish elite institutions , " says karl einhäuptl of the national science council , " but at the same time we must strive to maintain the high standards of our universities in general .
it ’ s not surprising that german scientists are wanted by american institutions .
that ’ s because they are well-trained . "
the initiative is also meant to attract more foreign students to german universities .
easier access to jobs here , which is expected to come with a new immigration law and the absence of tuition fees , the government hopes , will serve as extra incentives to aspiring academics from abroad . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : an elite university or a university for the elite ?

the revelation came as oracle defended its own planned takeover of rival peoplesoft against objections from us competition watchdogs .
the mooted microsoft-sap tie-up , now abandoned , demonstrates that the software market could withstand large-scale mergers , oracle 's lawyers argued .
microsoft and sap confirmed that they did hold exploratory last year .
the software giant said it had " initiated preliminary discussions with sap to explore the possibility of a merger between the two companies . "
it added that it had ended the talks " due to the complexity of the potential transaction , " and had no intention to resume them .
big three the revelation came on the first day of a court hearing into the us department of justice 's attempt to block oracle 's long-running bid to buy smaller rival peoplesoft .
the justice department told the court that the oracle-peoplesoft merger would eliminate one of only three big suppliers of auditing and human resources software in the us , hampering competition .
" if you take peoplesoft out of the picture , oracle 's ability to raise prices will be enhanced , " doj lawyer claude scott said .
but oracle said microsoft 's planned takeover of germany 's sap showed that the doj had underestimated the intensity of competition in the software industry .
sap is the world 's biggest supplier of business software , outranking both oracle and peoplesoft in that particular segment of the software market .
oracle said the doj 's definition of the business software market was too narrow , and did not take account of emerging competitive threats from microsoft and numerous smaller suppliers .
the microsoft-sap revelations are the latest twist in oracle 's year-old attempt to acquire peoplesoft , now ranked as one of the most bitterly fought takeover battles of recent years .
peoplesoft , a specialist in human resources software , has fiercely resisted oracle 's advances , rejecting its latest $ 7.7bn offer as " inadequate . "
peoplesoft 's stance is supported by many of its staff , some of whom have set up a website promoting the benefits of keeping the firm independent .
the outcome of the trial will be watched with interest in the european union , where regulators have listed a number of objections to the oracle-peoplesoft merger .
the case is expected to last for about a month .

it is hoped that success can be mirrored in the royal court with judges allowed to refer parties to mediation .

the study , commissioned for the assembly 's broadband wales programme , showed that almost a third of those questioned used it .
nearly one in ten interviewed said they would swap a brother or sister for a broadband connection .
it is estimated that everyone in wales will have access to broadband by 2005 .
broadband is the term used to describe internet services that are much faster and more powerful than average home connections .
the study , which questioned seven to 16-year-olds , also showed that children used broadband to help them in school .
just under a third of those interviewed agreed that being able to use a computer was more important than maths or english .
over a quarter agreed that they would not be able to complete their homework without the internet . "
i have kids and i notice the difference it makes to them that they do n't have to hang around for information " michael eaton michael eaton , director of broadband wales for the welsh assembly government , said broadband meant a number of things to children .
" for them it seems to represent a blend of entertainment and homework , " he said " and they 're not scared of it .
" they take to it quite easily .
normal classroom syllabuses use computers so they 're used to it .
the research also suggested that television was being abandoned in favour of logging on to the internet .
nearly half of those spoken to agreed they would rather use a computer as entertainment than watch tv .
mr eaton described the children as being of the " instant generation " .
" i have kids and i notice the difference it makes to them that they do n't have to hang around for information , " he said .
" waiting for the internet to work is very frustrating .
" my role over five years is to increase its availability and it should be available to everyone in wales in the next 18 months , " he added .

there are only six months to go until this year 's santa run in newtown , an event that attracted a guinness world record-breaking 3,200 runners last year .
