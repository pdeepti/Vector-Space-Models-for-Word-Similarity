" despite the optimism , there 's no denying that the issue has strained relations between the two neighbors . bildunterschrift : numerous children were among the ethnic germans expelled from a polish detention camp to germany in 1950 .
an estimated 2.5 million ethnic germans were expelled or fled from poland shortly before the end of world war ii . many of them who lost property and homes when poland 's borders shifted westwards after the war are calling for compensation from poland through organizations and lawyers . the issue has created huge resentment in poland , particularly since the country 's entry to the european union last may .
most poles believe that the german losses pale into insignificance compared to the deaths of more than six million poles after adolf hitler 's army invaded the country in 1939 . a breath of fresh air the debate , which is marked by high emotions and painful memories of the survivors and their families , has often taken on a bitter tone with some ethnic germans threatening to take their claims for repatriations to polish and european courts . the fate of the expelled ethnic german refugees from eastern europe is occasionally exploited by different groups to extract political mileage . but , now a new book by german journalist and poland expert helga hirsch has been hailed as a breath of fresh air in the ongoing debate .
called " schweres gepäck " or " heavy baggage " , the book completely avoids the thorny issue of reparations and instead allows the children and grandchildren of seven ethnic german families expelled from poland , to express their feelings and memories on the subject . the result is a very personal and yet sober account of persons , who often have no own memories of expulsion and flight , but who still suffer under the burden of searching for their own identities . breaking the silence hirsch , whose own father came from present-day poland , told deutsche welle that the most difficult thing about the issue was breaking the silence over it .
" a fair punishment for the suffering that germany caused in europe " is how many children of expelled ethnic germans who grew up in postwar germany came to view and accept the issue , hirsch said .
germans were simply not viewed as victims , she added . hirsch , who 's aware that she 's treading controversial ground with her book , said that a further problem when it came to the issue was the fact that for a long time in germany there was a process of coming to grips with collective guilt , but not with suffering . " today 's generation as opposed to the 1968 one , has a general tendency to look carefully at their own families and try to determine what 's there , " said hirsch .
" we 've now learnt that both guilt and suffering can co-exist in a family .
it demands great psychological skills to endure this ambivalence - and i experience it as a great progress .

1938 the book is seen as an important contribution to the ongoing dispute between both germany and poland as well as germany and the czech republic . hirsch , however , is clear that not all ethnic germans support the idea of demanding reparations .
she has thus also started a signature campaign against compensation claims and so far managed to get 70 prominent ethnic german expellees on board . " i find it -lrb- demand for compensation -rrb- horrible in our relationship to poland and i want to make a public gesture that those demanding reparations are n't all the ethnic germans , " hirsch said .
" for poland the issue is important … and i notice when i 'm there that such a gesture from the germans gives an important signal to the poles : we respect and consider your fears . " hirsch said she hoped the process of coming to grips with the suffering of the expelled ethnic germans would someday take hold in poland and the czech republic too .
but she remained clear that the process should in no manner be driven by the german side . elena beier -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland , germany vow to squash reparations claims german chancellor gerhard schröder and polish prime minister marek belka appealed to the common sense of those germans and poles currently trying to revive a debate about world war ii reparation claims .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.10.2004 france , spain reject refugee center plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's de villepin , backed by spain , rejected the plan the controversial italian-german plan aimed at creating holding centers in north africa for would-be refugees was in danger of being sunk by france and spain on monday . the surprise opposition came during the meeting of the so-called g5 european nations in florence when french interior minister dominique de villepin told his british , spanish , german and italian counterparts that france could not accept the proposal .
" we do not want to accept camps or centers of any kind , " he said . france , traditionally a close ally of germany , would move to halt the germans and italians pressing the european union to build overseas reception camps that would filter the genuine asylum seekers and reject the rest . the proposed centers , set up outside the 25-nation eu 's borders and notably in north africa , would repatriate those who do not meet immigration requirements .
" it is not for europe to take this issue forward , " de villepin told reporters .
spain also rejected the initiative . the opponents claim that dealing with refugees should not be left to the european union alone and that groups such as the un high commissioner for refugees and non-governmental organizations must take a leading role . no consensus , laments schily bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily .
" we can not leave things as they are now , " german interior minister otto schily said on monday .
" we should offer these immigrants , before they embark on a very risky journey , advice on whether they qualify for protection . "
but he acknowledged : " no consensus has been reached . " while france 's traditional ally germany may feel aggrieved , the italians will be seething .
italy is a transit route for migrants seeking to enter europe and in the first week of october alone , some 1,800 migrants landed on the southern italian island of lampedusa .
italy airlifted more than 1,000 of them to libya , with which it has signed a new repatriation agreement . europol appointment split over favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol logo another sticking point was the appointment of a new chief for the eu 's police agency , europol , with germany and france making clear they favored their own men for the job .
there appeared to be little progress made to resolve the issue during the two-day summit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.10.2004 reconciliation instead of reparation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expelled ethnic germans from poland arrive in germany as tension simmers between germany and poland over world war ii compensation claims , a german journalist is trying to bring reason to the impassioned debate by urging ethnic germans to relinquish their claims . on monday , senior lawmakers from germany and poland met in a bid to defuse tensions between the two countries over world war ii compensation claims . speaking ahead of the talks , jozef oleksy , speaker of the polish lower house of parliament , said the question of compensation " is inevitable , but it is not the main issue " and that german-polish ties " can not be reduced to the problem of reparations . " despite the optimism , there 's no denying that the issue has strained relations between the two neighbors . bildunterschrift : numerous children were among the ethnic germans expelled from a polish detention camp to germany in 1950 .
an estimated 2.5 million ethnic germans were expelled or fled from poland shortly before the end of world war ii . many of them who lost property and homes when poland 's borders shifted westwards after the war are calling for compensation from poland through organizations and lawyers . the issue has created huge resentment in poland , particularly since the country 's entry to the european union last may .
most poles believe that the german losses pale into insignificance compared to the deaths of more than six million poles after adolf hitler 's army invaded the country in 1939 . a breath of fresh air the debate , which is marked by high emotions and painful memories of the survivors and their families , has often taken on a bitter tone with some ethnic germans threatening to take their claims for repatriations to polish and european courts . the fate of the expelled ethnic german refugees from eastern europe is occasionally exploited by different groups to extract political mileage . but , now a new book by german journalist and poland expert helga hirsch has been hailed as a breath of fresh air in the ongoing debate .
called " schweres gepäck " or " heavy baggage " , the book completely avoids the thorny issue of reparations and instead allows the children and grandchildren of seven ethnic german families expelled from poland , to express their feelings and memories on the subject . the result is a very personal and yet sober account of persons , who often have no own memories of expulsion and flight , but who still suffer under the burden of searching for their own identities . breaking the silence hirsch , whose own father came from present-day poland , told deutsche welle that the most difficult thing about the issue was breaking the silence over it .
" a fair punishment for the suffering that germany caused in europe " is how many children of expelled ethnic germans who grew up in postwar germany came to view and accept the issue , hirsch said .
germans were simply not viewed as victims , she added . hirsch , who 's aware that she 's treading controversial ground with her book , said that a further problem when it came to the issue was the fact that for a long time in germany there was a process of coming to grips with collective guilt , but not with suffering . " today 's generation as opposed to the 1968 one , has a general tendency to look carefully at their own families and try to determine what 's there , " said hirsch .
" we 've now learnt that both guilt and suffering can co-exist in a family .
it demands great psychological skills to endure this ambivalence - and i experience it as a great progress . " an important contribution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudeten germans refugees wait to board one of the trains at klingenthal station in czechoslovakia in sept .
1938 the book is seen as an important contribution to the ongoing dispute between both germany and poland as well as germany and the czech republic . hirsch , however , is clear that not all ethnic germans support the idea of demanding reparations .
she has thus also started a signature campaign against compensation claims and so far managed to get 70 prominent ethnic german expellees on board . " i find it -lrb- demand for compensation -rrb- horrible in our relationship to poland and i want to make a public gesture that those demanding reparations are n't all the ethnic germans , " hirsch said .
" for poland the issue is important … and i notice when i 'm there that such a gesture from the germans gives an important signal to the poles : we respect and consider your fears . " hirsch said she hoped the process of coming to grips with the suffering of the expelled ethnic germans would someday take hold in poland and the czech republic too .
but she remained clear that the process should in no manner be driven by the german side . elena beier -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland , germany vow to squash reparations claims german chancellor gerhard schröder and polish prime minister marek belka appealed to the common sense of those germans and poles currently trying to revive a debate about world war ii reparation claims .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's economic woes gloom deepens over german economy opinion : blame the managers , not the country negotiations at opel continue deal reached at karstadtquelle business -pipe- 18.10.2004 both sides dig in for long fight in opel stand-off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : families joined striking opel workers on the fifth day of protests managers and workers representatives at german car maker opel met on monday to resolve the bitter stand-off over proposed mass redundancies .
as negotiations continued , neither side was giving ground . workers at car maker opel halted production at a factory in bochum , north west germany , for the fifth day in a row on monday in continuing protest against plans by the group 's us parent general motors ' to slash thousands of jobs in europe . but with every sign that both sides were prepared to dig their heels in over the escalating labor conflict , politicians urged employees to end the wildcat strikes and hold constructive talks with management to negotiate the long-term future of the site . the assembly lines at bochum were silent for the fifth day in a row on monday , as workers , ignoring calls by the government and opel 's general works council for a return to work , voted unanimously to stay outside the factory gates . economy minister wolfgang clement warned that the workers ' hard-line stance could jeopardize the crucial restructuring talks between management and unions which began in opel 's headquarters in rüsselsheim on monday . " employees who stand in front of the gates will not improve the chances of safeguarding the plant , " clement said .
he could understand the workers ' point of view , " but that does change my opinion that it is wrong " , the minister said . government spokesman bela anda urged employees to talk constructively with management so as not to weaken the bochum site in the long run . regional premier calls for calm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to gm : keep the bochum plant alive , " reads the sign .
peer steinbrueck , the regional premier of the state of north rhine-westphalia , where bochum is based , also called for calm .
steinbrueck said he could understand workers ' anger , but striking would not help .
" if we want to have a long-term perspective for the bochum site and avoid compulsory redundancies , we have to remain level-headed and professional in the way we go about finding a solution , " he said . the head of the general works council at opel , klaus franz , took a similar tack .
he told the business daily handelsblatt that the work stoppages at bochum were understandable from an emotional point of view .
but the action could jeopardize negotiations between management and unions . " we need an intelligent strategy on the part of workers that entails both negotiation and fight , " he said .
franz was optimistic that a solution could be found , but he warned : " let there be no illusion - we wo n't be able to get around compulsory redundancies . " bochum workers claim self-defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum workers refuse to go back to work .
the workers at bochum , however , remained adamant .
" it 's self-defense , " said the head of bochum 's works council lothar marquardt .
" people are afraid for their livelihood . "
production at bochum has been halted since thursday . the work stoppages in bochum were already having a knock-on effect on supply of parts used to build opel 's astra model at factories elsewhere in europe , marquardt said .
a europe-wide stoppage could cost general motors € 10-30 million -lrb- $ 12-37 million -rrb- a day , he said . a labor expert in munich , volker rieble , dubbed the stoppages wildcat strikes , since the unions had not officially called for them and they were not directly connected with concrete wage demands .
as such , the wildcat strikes are illegal under germany 's labor laws . do n't expect rapid results , says negotiator a spokesman for opel cautioned the talks that began between union and management on monday were not likely to yield any rapid results .
a timeframe and the size of the cost cuts had to be established first , he said , declining to provide any details about the exact venue or the anticipated length of the first round of talks . last thursday , general motors said it planned to slash 12,000 jobs in europe - or around one fifth of its workforce in the region - in an attempt to steer its european operations back into profit after six years of losses . most of the cuts would be made in germany , with the plants in bochum and in rüsselsheim in the main line of fire . unions and employee representatives have called workers at all gm sites in europe to take part in demonstrations and protest marches on tuesday . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opel employees stage work stoppages production halted friday at the bochum factory of troubled german car maker opel as workers laid down tools for the second day in a row in protest against cuts .

as negotiations continued , neither side was giving ground . workers at car maker opel halted production at a factory in bochum , north west germany , for the fifth day in a row on monday in continuing protest against plans by the group 's us parent general motors ' to slash thousands of jobs in europe . but with every sign that both sides were prepared to dig their heels in over the escalating labor conflict , politicians urged employees to end the wildcat strikes and hold constructive talks with management to negotiate the long-term future of the site . the assembly lines at bochum were silent for the fifth day in a row on monday , as workers , ignoring calls by the government and opel 's general works council for a return to work , voted unanimously to stay outside the factory gates . economy minister wolfgang clement warned that the workers ' hard-line stance could jeopardize the crucial restructuring talks between management and unions which began in opel 's headquarters in rüsselsheim on monday .

an odd collection of new friends they are indeed that europe , the us and germany have gathered together since the sept .

the selection revolves around economic and strategic interests , and preferably both , but not human rights .
that is the dangerous thing about these new friends , the paper said : " they are dictatorships with a total disregard for human life , and no one knows whether this trust that the west has placed in them will not some day be abused - see saddam hussein . "
of course , germany , europe and the us are looking to stabilize a world gone awry and secure the supply of natural resources .
but , the paper emphasized , the question is whether handling these countries at arm ’ s length would n't be better for our credibility ?
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung turned its attention to what a number of german media outlets believe is a conspiracy within the christian democratic union to discredit and topple party leader angela merkel .
the paper didn ´ t seem concerned about the cdu ’ s upcoming party conference in düsseldorf .
merkel , the paper said , has simply declared that meeting as hers .
there are no lack of calls from within the party to settle the open chancellor candidate question for 2006 right now and in her favor .
if this is what a loss of authority looks like , the paper noted , then angela merkel has nothing to worry about .

it is bad for her image and that of the party as a whole , the paper said .
the critical voices are increasing , even among merkel ’ s allies , the paper noted .
the cdu lacks guidance and is in danger of losing the public ’ s faith in its ability to govern .
the leipziger volkszeitung pointed to the heavy-handed criticism of merkel from german business leaders , talked of intrigue and demanded from germany ’ s liberal free democrats to settle the opposition ’ s chancellor candidate issue as an obvious sign that the party conference in december could end up being a palace revolt .
the crisis in the cdu resembles the chaos theory , wrote the saarbrücker zeitung - it has a life of its own and can not be controlled .
angela merkel , the paper said , no longer holds the reins in her hands .
helplessly she has to watch as the arduously constructed image of the cdu as a competent alternative implodes .
the cdu thinks the bavarian sister party , csu , is at fault , but that diagnosis is too simple , the paper thought .
instead , too many bad choices have been made or no choices at all .
bonn ’ s general-anzeiger noted that merkel has lost a lot of public support .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.10.2004 german press review : internal conflicts german editorials on monday concerned themselves with the apparent power struggle in the country ’ s conservative christian democratic union and commented on chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s visit to libya . strange bedfellows , wrote the stuttgarter zeitung after the german chancellor ’ s visit to libya ’ s strongman , moammar gadhafi .
an odd collection of new friends they are indeed that europe , the us and germany have gathered together since the sept .
11 attacks .
the selection revolves around economic and strategic interests , and preferably both , but not human rights .
that is the dangerous thing about these new friends , the paper said : " they are dictatorships with a total disregard for human life , and no one knows whether this trust that the west has placed in them will not some day be abused - see saddam hussein . "
of course , germany , europe and the us are looking to stabilize a world gone awry and secure the supply of natural resources .
but , the paper emphasized , the question is whether handling these countries at arm ’ s length would n't be better for our credibility ?
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung turned its attention to what a number of german media outlets believe is a conspiracy within the christian democratic union to discredit and topple party leader angela merkel .
the paper didn ´ t seem concerned about the cdu ’ s upcoming party conference in düsseldorf .
merkel , the paper said , has simply declared that meeting as hers .
there are no lack of calls from within the party to settle the open chancellor candidate question for 2006 right now and in her favor .
if this is what a loss of authority looks like , the paper noted , then angela merkel has nothing to worry about .
cologne ’ s stadt-anzeiger , on the other hand , saw the power question in the cdu moving toward a climax .
merkel can not let the inner-party debate about her leadership abilities , which some people are calling an intrigue , continue .
it is bad for her image and that of the party as a whole , the paper said .
the critical voices are increasing , even among merkel ’ s allies , the paper noted .
the cdu lacks guidance and is in danger of losing the public ’ s faith in its ability to govern .
the leipziger volkszeitung pointed to the heavy-handed criticism of merkel from german business leaders , talked of intrigue and demanded from germany ’ s liberal free democrats to settle the opposition ’ s chancellor candidate issue as an obvious sign that the party conference in december could end up being a palace revolt .
the crisis in the cdu resembles the chaos theory , wrote the saarbrücker zeitung - it has a life of its own and can not be controlled .
angela merkel , the paper said , no longer holds the reins in her hands .
helplessly she has to watch as the arduously constructed image of the cdu as a competent alternative implodes .
the cdu thinks the bavarian sister party , csu , is at fault , but that diagnosis is too simple , the paper thought .
instead , too many bad choices have been made or no choices at all .
bonn ’ s general-anzeiger noted that merkel has lost a lot of public support .
people want a party that demonstrates its members have closed ranks , but the cdu and csu are anything but that .
chancellor schröder , at least , has stuck to his guns , the paper said , even though there is still the risk of failure . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.10.2004 -pipe- 09:00 utc france considers early referendum on constitution president jacques chirac has previously said that the poll would be " in the second half of 2005 " but according to french daily le monde , he met prime minister jean-pierre raffarin last thursday -lrb- oct.14 -rrb- to discuss bringing forward the date of the poll .
bringing the referendum forward looks attractive to chirac for two reasons .
first , he is trying not to allow the issue of the constitution be confused with the issue of turkey ’ s entry into the eu .
a early referendum may prevent the ' no ' camp from linking the two debates .
the second reason is to do with the length of the campaign .
but chirac also has two tricky problems to weigh up in his decision .
the first is that the french constitutional court must examine the constitutional implications for france if the european constitution is passed .
but they can only start this work , which is expected to be long and difficult , after the official signing of the text on 29 october in rome .
the court may not have concluded its deliberations by spring .
aside from the legal implications , there are pressing political problems for chirac .
raffarin is expected to step down soon .
a spring referendum would give him a chance to lead the campaign , but he may have already left by autumn .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.10.2004 -pipe- 09:00 utc france considers early referendum on constitution president jacques chirac has previously said that the poll would be " in the second half of 2005 " but according to french daily le monde , he met prime minister jean-pierre raffarin last thursday -lrb- oct.14 -rrb- to discuss bringing forward the date of the poll .
bringing the referendum forward looks attractive to chirac for two reasons .
first , he is trying not to allow the issue of the constitution be confused with the issue of turkey ’ s entry into the eu .
a early referendum may prevent the ' no ' camp from linking the two debates .
the second reason is to do with the length of the campaign .
but chirac also has two tricky problems to weigh up in his decision .
the first is that the french constitutional court must examine the constitutional implications for france if the european constitution is passed .
but they can only start this work , which is expected to be long and difficult , after the official signing of the text on 29 october in rome .
the court may not have concluded its deliberations by spring .
aside from the legal implications , there are pressing political problems for chirac .
raffarin is expected to step down soon .
a spring referendum would give him a chance to lead the campaign , but he may have already left by autumn .

human rights groups , for their part , are also opposed to setting up these camps in north africa , where they fear proper humanitarian conditions will not be provided .
libya is one of the countries mentioned as hosting such transit camps as many people set off from the libyan coast to reach lampedusa , a small island between africa and sicily .
the libyan prime minister shoukri ghanem has however turned down the idea .
in an interview published by the italian daily corriere della sera he said : " it does not seem to us -lsb- to be -rsb- a good idea to put illegal immigrants into camps in certain countries .
you must instead help them to remain where they are , and do something about creating jobs . "
hundreds of demonstrators marched through the streets of florence on saturday to protest against the meeting of the ministers from the so-called group of five -lrb- g5 -rrb- .
the g5 group has gathered regularly since meeting for the first time in spain in may last year .

he said this meant having " to conform to a new orthodoxy , accompanied by a new inquisition , but this time anti-christian . "
" there is a hate-campaign being waged against me , " claimed the conservative catholic .
his comments come after he caused a fresh storm of protest on saturday by reportedly saying that single mothers were " not very good " people .
buttiglione then said that his words had been taken out of context and on sunday said that that single mother are the " heroines of our time " .
the italian has appeared regularly in print over the last two weeks after telling a european parliament committee that he thought homosexuality is a sin .
the same committee then rejected his nomination to be a commissioner , sparking a tussle between the incoming commission president jose barroso and the brussels assembly .
the issue has come to a head with the socialist group in the european parliament threatening to veto his nomination if he is not given another portfolio - he is supposed to take on justice and home affairs from nov .

" despite the optimism , there 's no denying that the issue has strained relations between the two neighbors . bildunterschrift : numerous children were among the ethnic germans expelled from a polish detention camp to germany in 1950 .
an estimated 2.5 million ethnic germans were expelled or fled from poland shortly before the end of world war ii . many of them who lost property and homes when poland 's borders shifted westwards after the war are calling for compensation from poland through organizations and lawyers . the issue has created huge resentment in poland , particularly since the country 's entry to the european union last may .
most poles believe that the german losses pale into insignificance compared to the deaths of more than six million poles after adolf hitler 's army invaded the country in 1939 . a breath of fresh air the debate , which is marked by high emotions and painful memories of the survivors and their families , has often taken on a bitter tone with some ethnic germans threatening to take their claims for repatriations to polish and european courts . the fate of the expelled ethnic german refugees from eastern europe is occasionally exploited by different groups to extract political mileage . but , now a new book by german journalist and poland expert helga hirsch has been hailed as a breath of fresh air in the ongoing debate .
called " schweres gepäck " or " heavy baggage " , the book completely avoids the thorny issue of reparations and instead allows the children and grandchildren of seven ethnic german families expelled from poland , to express their feelings and memories on the subject . the result is a very personal and yet sober account of persons , who often have no own memories of expulsion and flight , but who still suffer under the burden of searching for their own identities . breaking the silence hirsch , whose own father came from present-day poland , told deutsche welle that the most difficult thing about the issue was breaking the silence over it .
" a fair punishment for the suffering that germany caused in europe " is how many children of expelled ethnic germans who grew up in postwar germany came to view and accept the issue , hirsch said .
germans were simply not viewed as victims , she added . hirsch , who 's aware that she 's treading controversial ground with her book , said that a further problem when it came to the issue was the fact that for a long time in germany there was a process of coming to grips with collective guilt , but not with suffering . " today 's generation as opposed to the 1968 one , has a general tendency to look carefully at their own families and try to determine what 's there , " said hirsch .
" we 've now learnt that both guilt and suffering can co-exist in a family .
it demands great psychological skills to endure this ambivalence - and i experience it as a great progress . " an important contribution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudeten germans refugees wait to board one of the trains at klingenthal station in czechoslovakia in sept .
1938 the book is seen as an important contribution to the ongoing dispute between both germany and poland as well as germany and the czech republic . hirsch , however , is clear that not all ethnic germans support the idea of demanding reparations .
she has thus also started a signature campaign against compensation claims and so far managed to get 70 prominent ethnic german expellees on board . " i find it -lrb- demand for compensation -rrb- horrible in our relationship to poland and i want to make a public gesture that those demanding reparations are n't all the ethnic germans , " hirsch said .
" for poland the issue is important … and i notice when i 'm there that such a gesture from the germans gives an important signal to the poles : we respect and consider your fears . " hirsch said she hoped the process of coming to grips with the suffering of the expelled ethnic germans would someday take hold in poland and the czech republic too .
but she remained clear that the process should in no manner be driven by the german side . elena beier -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland , germany vow to squash reparations claims german chancellor gerhard schröder and polish prime minister marek belka appealed to the common sense of those germans and poles currently trying to revive a debate about world war ii reparation claims .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.10.2004 merkel scotches rumors of power struggle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has sought to play down the recent turbulence within her party germany ’ s conservative party leader angela merkel has brushed aside allegations that some senior members of her christian democratic union are plotting against her in an effort to unseat her as party chairwoman . at the weekend some of merkel ’ s key conservative allies said that a series of political blunders committed by merkel recently were secretly masterminded by merkel ’ s inner-party rivals who want to prevent the cdu leader from becoming the next conservative candidate in the race for the chancellorship in 2006 .
on monday merkel suffered yet another blow as her choice for a prominent party post refused to take up the vacancy .
two of her closest allies in the party leadership said at the weekend that recent political mishaps , including a forced about-face on plans for a populist campaign against turkey ’ s eu bid , didn ’ t come entirely out of the blue .
they speculated that a group of party barons from western germany were bent on ousting merkel – who is from eastern germany – in an attempt to level the playing field for their own ambitions to become the conservatives ' candidate for the chancellorship .
merkel plays down alleged ouster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is not known for giving up things without a fight but merkel appeared calm and composed on monday , putting a brave face on allegations that there was a putsch underway to oust her .
but merkel brushed aside such concerns , saying this was not the time to play political games .
" against the background of economic decline which is again looming large in this country , the entire cdu presidium refused to discuss such allegations , " she told reporters .
" so this debate has come to an end before it actually started . "
string of setbacks yet merkel has had to endure a spell of dramatic setbacks in recent weeks raising questions about the cdu leader ’ s strategies and the strength of her leadership .
her blunders include a series of heavy losses at recent state and local polls , the resignation of a key cdu parliamentary figure , and unresolved policy quarrels with its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble merkel ’ s inner-party troubles were compounded on monday , after wolfgang schäuble -lrb- photo -rrb- refused to take up merkel ’ s offer of becoming the cdu ‘ s influential finance and economics spokesman in parliament .
merkel now claims schäuble refused because he felt more comfortable with foreign politics .
" this is not at all the dramatic error i ’ m said to have committed , " she said .
" i don ’ t think it is anything unusual that wolfgang schäuble refused my offer because he believes that he is more valuable to the party in his current post as the party ’ s foreign affairs expert .
so i don ’ t see this as a big deal at all . "
fear of chaos political observers , however , see this as yet another indication that scores are currently being settled within the cdu which are undermining merkel ’ s position as the undisputed ruler of the conservatives .
and already the cdu ’ s traditional allies and long-time junior partners in coalition governments – the liberal free democrats -lrb- gdp -rrb- – are beginning to worry .
" i think that unresolved power and personality issues are clearly behind those discussions , " said fdp leader guido westerwelle .
" the cdu would be well advised to decide about the conservative candidacy this year already .
otherwise i fear there is going to be never-ending chaos within the party which will tarnish our reputation among the electorate . "
a crucial cdu party congress to be held in early december will show how strong angela merkel ’ s grip on the conservatives still is , as delegates will be voting on a controversial health care reform plan .
overwhelming support for her proposals would also send a clear signal to her conservative foes that merkel may have stumbled , but will not fall . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel facing inner-party coup ?

on monday merkel suffered yet another blow as her choice for a prominent party post refused to take up the vacancy .
two of her closest allies in the party leadership said at the weekend that recent political mishaps , including a forced about-face on plans for a populist campaign against turkey ’ s eu bid , didn ’ t come entirely out of the blue .
they speculated that a group of party barons from western germany were bent on ousting merkel – who is from eastern germany – in an attempt to level the playing field for their own ambitions to become the conservatives ' candidate for the chancellorship .
merkel plays down alleged ouster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is not known for giving up things without a fight but merkel appeared calm and composed on monday , putting a brave face on allegations that there was a putsch underway to oust her .
but merkel brushed aside such concerns , saying this was not the time to play political games .
" against the background of economic decline which is again looming large in this country , the entire cdu presidium refused to discuss such allegations , " she told reporters .
" so this debate has come to an end before it actually started . "
string of setbacks yet merkel has had to endure a spell of dramatic setbacks in recent weeks raising questions about the cdu leader ’ s strategies and the strength of her leadership .
her blunders include a series of heavy losses at recent state and local polls , the resignation of a key cdu parliamentary figure , and unresolved policy quarrels with its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble merkel ’ s inner-party troubles were compounded on monday , after wolfgang schäuble -lrb- photo -rrb- refused to take up merkel ’ s offer of becoming the cdu ‘ s influential finance and economics spokesman in parliament .
merkel now claims schäuble refused because he felt more comfortable with foreign politics .
" this is not at all the dramatic error i ’ m said to have committed , " she said .
" i don ’ t think it is anything unusual that wolfgang schäuble refused my offer because he believes that he is more valuable to the party in his current post as the party ’ s foreign affairs expert .
so i don ’ t see this as a big deal at all . "
fear of chaos political observers , however , see this as yet another indication that scores are currently being settled within the cdu which are undermining merkel ’ s position as the undisputed ruler of the conservatives .
and already the cdu ’ s traditional allies and long-time junior partners in coalition governments – the liberal free democrats -lrb- gdp -rrb- – are beginning to worry .
" i think that unresolved power and personality issues are clearly behind those discussions , " said fdp leader guido westerwelle .
" the cdu would be well advised to decide about the conservative candidacy this year already .
otherwise i fear there is going to be never-ending chaos within the party which will tarnish our reputation among the electorate . "
a crucial cdu party congress to be held in early december will show how strong angela merkel ’ s grip on the conservatives still is , as delegates will be voting on a controversial health care reform plan .
overwhelming support for her proposals would also send a clear signal to her conservative foes that merkel may have stumbled , but will not fall . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel facing inner-party coup ?

on monday merkel suffered yet another blow as her choice for a prominent party post refused to take up the vacancy .
two of her closest allies in the party leadership said at the weekend that recent political mishaps , including a forced about-face on plans for a populist campaign against turkey ’ s eu bid , didn ’ t come entirely out of the blue .
they speculated that a group of party barons from western germany were bent on ousting merkel – who is from eastern germany – in an attempt to level the playing field for their own ambitions to become the conservatives ' candidate for the chancellorship .
merkel plays down alleged ouster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is not known for giving up things without a fight but merkel appeared calm and composed on monday , putting a brave face on allegations that there was a putsch underway to oust her .
but merkel brushed aside such concerns , saying this was not the time to play political games .
" against the background of economic decline which is again looming large in this country , the entire cdu presidium refused to discuss such allegations , " she told reporters .
" so this debate has come to an end before it actually started . "
string of setbacks yet merkel has had to endure a spell of dramatic setbacks in recent weeks raising questions about the cdu leader ’ s strategies and the strength of her leadership .
her blunders include a series of heavy losses at recent state and local polls , the resignation of a key cdu parliamentary figure , and unresolved policy quarrels with its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble merkel ’ s inner-party troubles were compounded on monday , after wolfgang schäuble -lrb- photo -rrb- refused to take up merkel ’ s offer of becoming the cdu ‘ s influential finance and economics spokesman in parliament .
merkel now claims schäuble refused because he felt more comfortable with foreign politics .
" this is not at all the dramatic error i ’ m said to have committed , " she said .
" i don ’ t think it is anything unusual that wolfgang schäuble refused my offer because he believes that he is more valuable to the party in his current post as the party ’ s foreign affairs expert .
so i don ’ t see this as a big deal at all . "
fear of chaos political observers , however , see this as yet another indication that scores are currently being settled within the cdu which are undermining merkel ’ s position as the undisputed ruler of the conservatives .
and already the cdu ’ s traditional allies and long-time junior partners in coalition governments – the liberal free democrats -lrb- gdp -rrb- – are beginning to worry .
" i think that unresolved power and personality issues are clearly behind those discussions , " said fdp leader guido westerwelle .
" the cdu would be well advised to decide about the conservative candidacy this year already .
otherwise i fear there is going to be never-ending chaos within the party which will tarnish our reputation among the electorate . "
a crucial cdu party congress to be held in early december will show how strong angela merkel ’ s grip on the conservatives still is , as delegates will be voting on a controversial health care reform plan .
overwhelming support for her proposals would also send a clear signal to her conservative foes that merkel may have stumbled , but will not fall . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel facing inner-party coup ?

" despite the optimism , there 's no denying that the issue has strained relations between the two neighbors . bildunterschrift : numerous children were among the ethnic germans expelled from a polish detention camp to germany in 1950 .
an estimated 2.5 million ethnic germans were expelled or fled from poland shortly before the end of world war ii . many of them who lost property and homes when poland 's borders shifted westwards after the war are calling for compensation from poland through organizations and lawyers . the issue has created huge resentment in poland , particularly since the country 's entry to the european union last may .
most poles believe that the german losses pale into insignificance compared to the deaths of more than six million poles after adolf hitler 's army invaded the country in 1939 . a breath of fresh air the debate , which is marked by high emotions and painful memories of the survivors and their families , has often taken on a bitter tone with some ethnic germans threatening to take their claims for repatriations to polish and european courts . the fate of the expelled ethnic german refugees from eastern europe is occasionally exploited by different groups to extract political mileage . but , now a new book by german journalist and poland expert helga hirsch has been hailed as a breath of fresh air in the ongoing debate .
called " schweres gepäck " or " heavy baggage " , the book completely avoids the thorny issue of reparations and instead allows the children and grandchildren of seven ethnic german families expelled from poland , to express their feelings and memories on the subject . the result is a very personal and yet sober account of persons , who often have no own memories of expulsion and flight , but who still suffer under the burden of searching for their own identities . breaking the silence hirsch , whose own father came from present-day poland , told deutsche welle that the most difficult thing about the issue was breaking the silence over it .
" a fair punishment for the suffering that germany caused in europe " is how many children of expelled ethnic germans who grew up in postwar germany came to view and accept the issue , hirsch said .
germans were simply not viewed as victims , she added . hirsch , who 's aware that she 's treading controversial ground with her book , said that a further problem when it came to the issue was the fact that for a long time in germany there was a process of coming to grips with collective guilt , but not with suffering . " today 's generation as opposed to the 1968 one , has a general tendency to look carefully at their own families and try to determine what 's there , " said hirsch .
" we 've now learnt that both guilt and suffering can co-exist in a family .

1938 the book is seen as an important contribution to the ongoing dispute between both germany and poland as well as germany and the czech republic . hirsch , however , is clear that not all ethnic germans support the idea of demanding reparations .
she has thus also started a signature campaign against compensation claims and so far managed to get 70 prominent ethnic german expellees on board . " i find it -lrb- demand for compensation -rrb- horrible in our relationship to poland and i want to make a public gesture that those demanding reparations are n't all the ethnic germans , " hirsch said .
" for poland the issue is important … and i notice when i 'm there that such a gesture from the germans gives an important signal to the poles : we respect and consider your fears .

" the decision to pursue an individual must remain in the national domain , and we do not support plans like the creation of a european prosecutor , " a junior british home office minister , caroline flint , told her parliament recently . france however has moved closer to the once controversial german position that a european police force should have a broader mandate across the european union . exchanges of information the five governments have regularly exchanged information on suspected terrorist activities since agreeing to do so at their first meeting in spain in may last year . the ministers will also discuss how to assist the european union 's newest members to tackle organized crime networks in their countries . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , italy push ahead on asylum centers despite a lukewarm reception in the eu , berlin and rome intend to press ahead with a controversial plan to create holding asylum camps for european-bound migrants in north africa as a means to combat illegal immigration .

" despite the optimism , there 's no denying that the issue has strained relations between the two neighbors . bildunterschrift : numerous children were among the ethnic germans expelled from a polish detention camp to germany in 1950 .
an estimated 2.5 million ethnic germans were expelled or fled from poland shortly before the end of world war ii . many of them who lost property and homes when poland 's borders shifted westwards after the war are calling for compensation from poland through organizations and lawyers . the issue has created huge resentment in poland , particularly since the country 's entry to the european union last may .
most poles believe that the german losses pale into insignificance compared to the deaths of more than six million poles after adolf hitler 's army invaded the country in 1939 . a breath of fresh air the debate , which is marked by high emotions and painful memories of the survivors and their families , has often taken on a bitter tone with some ethnic germans threatening to take their claims for repatriations to polish and european courts . the fate of the expelled ethnic german refugees from eastern europe is occasionally exploited by different groups to extract political mileage . but , now a new book by german journalist and poland expert helga hirsch has been hailed as a breath of fresh air in the ongoing debate .
called " schweres gepäck " or " heavy baggage " , the book completely avoids the thorny issue of reparations and instead allows the children and grandchildren of seven ethnic german families expelled from poland , to express their feelings and memories on the subject . the result is a very personal and yet sober account of persons , who often have no own memories of expulsion and flight , but who still suffer under the burden of searching for their own identities . breaking the silence hirsch , whose own father came from present-day poland , told deutsche welle that the most difficult thing about the issue was breaking the silence over it .
" a fair punishment for the suffering that germany caused in europe " is how many children of expelled ethnic germans who grew up in postwar germany came to view and accept the issue , hirsch said .
germans were simply not viewed as victims , she added . hirsch , who 's aware that she 's treading controversial ground with her book , said that a further problem when it came to the issue was the fact that for a long time in germany there was a process of coming to grips with collective guilt , but not with suffering . " today 's generation as opposed to the 1968 one , has a general tendency to look carefully at their own families and try to determine what 's there , " said hirsch .
" we 've now learnt that both guilt and suffering can co-exist in a family .

1938 the book is seen as an important contribution to the ongoing dispute between both germany and poland as well as germany and the czech republic . hirsch , however , is clear that not all ethnic germans support the idea of demanding reparations .
she has thus also started a signature campaign against compensation claims and so far managed to get 70 prominent ethnic german expellees on board . " i find it -lrb- demand for compensation -rrb- horrible in our relationship to poland and i want to make a public gesture that those demanding reparations are n't all the ethnic germans , " hirsch said .
" for poland the issue is important … and i notice when i 'm there that such a gesture from the germans gives an important signal to the poles : we respect and consider your fears . " hirsch said she hoped the process of coming to grips with the suffering of the expelled ethnic germans would someday take hold in poland and the czech republic too .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.10.2004 france , spain reject refugee center plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's de villepin , backed by spain , rejected the plan the controversial italian-german plan aimed at creating holding centers in north africa for would-be refugees was in danger of being sunk by france and spain on monday . the surprise opposition came during the meeting of the so-called g5 european nations in florence when french interior minister dominique de villepin told his british , spanish , german and italian counterparts that france could not accept the proposal .
" we do not want to accept camps or centers of any kind , " he said . france , traditionally a close ally of germany , would move to halt the germans and italians pressing the european union to build overseas reception camps that would filter the genuine asylum seekers and reject the rest . the proposed centers , set up outside the 25-nation eu 's borders and notably in north africa , would repatriate those who do not meet immigration requirements .
" it is not for europe to take this issue forward , " de villepin told reporters .
spain also rejected the initiative . the opponents claim that dealing with refugees should not be left to the european union alone and that groups such as the un high commissioner for refugees and non-governmental organizations must take a leading role . no consensus , laments schily bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily .
" we can not leave things as they are now , " german interior minister otto schily said on monday .
" we should offer these immigrants , before they embark on a very risky journey , advice on whether they qualify for protection . "
but he acknowledged : " no consensus has been reached . " while france 's traditional ally germany may feel aggrieved , the italians will be seething .
italy is a transit route for migrants seeking to enter europe and in the first week of october alone , some 1,800 migrants landed on the southern italian island of lampedusa .
italy airlifted more than 1,000 of them to libya , with which it has signed a new repatriation agreement . europol appointment split over favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol logo another sticking point was the appointment of a new chief for the eu 's police agency , europol , with germany and france making clear they favored their own men for the job .
there appeared to be little progress made to resolve the issue during the two-day summit .

abdullah gül also refuted german media reports that turkey wants to buy hundreds of german tanks . turkey currently has no interest in buying tanks from the german military , gül told the german business daily handelsblatt at the start of his two-day visit to berlin .
he added that he was surprised that the issue had even become a topic in the media .
last week , the german media began reporting that turkey was interested in buying several hundred leopard 2 tanks no longer needed by the german military . while in berlin , gül is meeting with his german counterpart , joschka fischer , among others .
referring to turkey 's negotiations to start accession talks with the european union , gül admitted that his country still had some problems to solve . " no country is perfect , " gül told handelsblatt .
" the important thing is that we 're trying to solve our problems . " german support for turkey on sunday , gül praised germany as a staunch supporter of turkey 's efforts to join the eu and expressed confidence that berlin would help in overcoming french objections to his country 's accession bid . " germany is among the countries who are the biggest supporters of turkey , " gül told reporters .
" naturally this issue is being discussed between germany and france as well , and germany is helping turkey . " gül said that ankara was watching with understanding the debate in france over whether the vast muslim nation should be allowed into the eu , but warned : " turkey should not be subjected to injustices .
it is not possible for us to accept that . " gül 's trip to germany is the first in a series of visits that turkish leaders will make to european capitals to drum up support for their country in the run-up to a crucial dec .

26 . countering discrimination gül said that in his meeting with fischer he would also raise turkish concerns over several points in the commission report which ankara considers discriminatory . the commission said the start of accession talks with turkey would not amount to a guarantee that it would one day join the eu and mentioned the possibility of imposing permanent safeguards against the free movement of turkish nationals in the bloc . in berlin gül will also meet with christian democrat opposition leader angela merkel , who is advocating a " privileged relationship " with turkey rather than full eu membership .
gül welcomed the fact that the cdu has now dropped plans to start a petition action to collect signatures from those who oppose turkey 's eu membership bid . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opposition drops petition plans against turkey 's eu bid germany 's conservative opposition has given up its idea of launching a petition against turkish entry into the european union .

on monday merkel suffered yet another blow as her choice for a prominent party post refused to take up the vacancy .
two of her closest allies in the party leadership said at the weekend that recent political mishaps , including a forced about-face on plans for a populist campaign against turkey ’ s eu bid , didn ’ t come entirely out of the blue .
they speculated that a group of party barons from western germany were bent on ousting merkel – who is from eastern germany – in an attempt to level the playing field for their own ambitions to become the conservatives ' candidate for the chancellorship .
merkel plays down alleged ouster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is not known for giving up things without a fight but merkel appeared calm and composed on monday , putting a brave face on allegations that there was a putsch underway to oust her .
but merkel brushed aside such concerns , saying this was not the time to play political games .
" against the background of economic decline which is again looming large in this country , the entire cdu presidium refused to discuss such allegations , " she told reporters .
" so this debate has come to an end before it actually started . "
string of setbacks yet merkel has had to endure a spell of dramatic setbacks in recent weeks raising questions about the cdu leader ’ s strategies and the strength of her leadership .
her blunders include a series of heavy losses at recent state and local polls , the resignation of a key cdu parliamentary figure , and unresolved policy quarrels with its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble merkel ’ s inner-party troubles were compounded on monday , after wolfgang schäuble -lrb- photo -rrb- refused to take up merkel ’ s offer of becoming the cdu ‘ s influential finance and economics spokesman in parliament .
merkel now claims schäuble refused because he felt more comfortable with foreign politics .
" this is not at all the dramatic error i ’ m said to have committed , " she said .
" i don ’ t think it is anything unusual that wolfgang schäuble refused my offer because he believes that he is more valuable to the party in his current post as the party ’ s foreign affairs expert .
so i don ’ t see this as a big deal at all . "
fear of chaos political observers , however , see this as yet another indication that scores are currently being settled within the cdu which are undermining merkel ’ s position as the undisputed ruler of the conservatives .
and already the cdu ’ s traditional allies and long-time junior partners in coalition governments – the liberal free democrats -lrb- gdp -rrb- – are beginning to worry .
" i think that unresolved power and personality issues are clearly behind those discussions , " said fdp leader guido westerwelle .
" the cdu would be well advised to decide about the conservative candidacy this year already .
otherwise i fear there is going to be never-ending chaos within the party which will tarnish our reputation among the electorate . "
a crucial cdu party congress to be held in early december will show how strong angela merkel ’ s grip on the conservatives still is , as delegates will be voting on a controversial health care reform plan .

on monday merkel suffered yet another blow as her choice for a prominent party post refused to take up the vacancy .
two of her closest allies in the party leadership said at the weekend that recent political mishaps , including a forced about-face on plans for a populist campaign against turkey ’ s eu bid , didn ’ t come entirely out of the blue .
they speculated that a group of party barons from western germany were bent on ousting merkel – who is from eastern germany – in an attempt to level the playing field for their own ambitions to become the conservatives ' candidate for the chancellorship .
merkel plays down alleged ouster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is not known for giving up things without a fight but merkel appeared calm and composed on monday , putting a brave face on allegations that there was a putsch underway to oust her .
but merkel brushed aside such concerns , saying this was not the time to play political games .
" against the background of economic decline which is again looming large in this country , the entire cdu presidium refused to discuss such allegations , " she told reporters .
" so this debate has come to an end before it actually started . "
string of setbacks yet merkel has had to endure a spell of dramatic setbacks in recent weeks raising questions about the cdu leader ’ s strategies and the strength of her leadership .
her blunders include a series of heavy losses at recent state and local polls , the resignation of a key cdu parliamentary figure , and unresolved policy quarrels with its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble merkel ’ s inner-party troubles were compounded on monday , after wolfgang schäuble -lrb- photo -rrb- refused to take up merkel ’ s offer of becoming the cdu ‘ s influential finance and economics spokesman in parliament .
merkel now claims schäuble refused because he felt more comfortable with foreign politics .
" this is not at all the dramatic error i ’ m said to have committed , " she said .
" i don ’ t think it is anything unusual that wolfgang schäuble refused my offer because he believes that he is more valuable to the party in his current post as the party ’ s foreign affairs expert .
so i don ’ t see this as a big deal at all . "
fear of chaos political observers , however , see this as yet another indication that scores are currently being settled within the cdu which are undermining merkel ’ s position as the undisputed ruler of the conservatives .
and already the cdu ’ s traditional allies and long-time junior partners in coalition governments – the liberal free democrats -lrb- gdp -rrb- – are beginning to worry .
" i think that unresolved power and personality issues are clearly behind those discussions , " said fdp leader guido westerwelle .
" the cdu would be well advised to decide about the conservative candidacy this year already .
otherwise i fear there is going to be never-ending chaos within the party which will tarnish our reputation among the electorate . "
a crucial cdu party congress to be held in early december will show how strong angela merkel ’ s grip on the conservatives still is , as delegates will be voting on a controversial health care reform plan .
overwhelming support for her proposals would also send a clear signal to her conservative foes that merkel may have stumbled , but will not fall . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel facing inner-party coup ?

" depending on the degree of the curve , chunks will be cut out of the banana , which will then be bound back together using biologically safe bandages , " lentze explained to the german tabloid bild . the curvy chunks wo n't go to waste .
lentze 's plan involves either drying them or using them in fruit salad . " after a certain introduction time , the straight cigar-banana will drive the curved banana from the market , " lentze said .
" it 's easier to eat , and easier to store . " patent pending lentze is so convinced is of his idea 's potential , that he 's applied for a patent at the german patent office in munich .
his application is supported by sketches showing how bananas will be carried along on a conveyor belt while robots chop out the curvy bits . if trends in japan are anything to go by , lentze 's idea could well bear fruit .

the selection revolves around economic and strategic interests , and preferably both , but not human rights .
that is the dangerous thing about these new friends , the paper said : " they are dictatorships with a total disregard for human life , and no one knows whether this trust that the west has placed in them will not some day be abused - see saddam hussein . "
of course , germany , europe and the us are looking to stabilize a world gone awry and secure the supply of natural resources .
but , the paper emphasized , the question is whether handling these countries at arm ’ s length would n't be better for our credibility ?
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung turned its attention to what a number of german media outlets believe is a conspiracy within the christian democratic union to discredit and topple party leader angela merkel .
the paper didn ´ t seem concerned about the cdu ’ s upcoming party conference in düsseldorf .
merkel , the paper said , has simply declared that meeting as hers .
there are no lack of calls from within the party to settle the open chancellor candidate question for 2006 right now and in her favor .

the cdu lacks guidance and is in danger of losing the public ’ s faith in its ability to govern .
the leipziger volkszeitung pointed to the heavy-handed criticism of merkel from german business leaders , talked of intrigue and demanded from germany ’ s liberal free democrats to settle the opposition ’ s chancellor candidate issue as an obvious sign that the party conference in december could end up being a palace revolt .
the crisis in the cdu resembles the chaos theory , wrote the saarbrücker zeitung - it has a life of its own and can not be controlled .
angela merkel , the paper said , no longer holds the reins in her hands .
helplessly she has to watch as the arduously constructed image of the cdu as a competent alternative implodes .
the cdu thinks the bavarian sister party , csu , is at fault , but that diagnosis is too simple , the paper thought .
instead , too many bad choices have been made or no choices at all .
bonn ’ s general-anzeiger noted that merkel has lost a lot of public support .

as negotiations continued , neither side was giving ground . workers at car maker opel halted production at a factory in bochum , north west germany , for the fifth day in a row on monday in continuing protest against plans by the group 's us parent general motors ' to slash thousands of jobs in europe . but with every sign that both sides were prepared to dig their heels in over the escalating labor conflict , politicians urged employees to end the wildcat strikes and hold constructive talks with management to negotiate the long-term future of the site . the assembly lines at bochum were silent for the fifth day in a row on monday , as workers , ignoring calls by the government and opel 's general works council for a return to work , voted unanimously to stay outside the factory gates . economy minister wolfgang clement warned that the workers ' hard-line stance could jeopardize the crucial restructuring talks between management and unions which began in opel 's headquarters in rüsselsheim on monday . " employees who stand in front of the gates will not improve the chances of safeguarding the plant , " clement said .
he could understand the workers ' point of view , " but that does change my opinion that it is wrong " , the minister said . government spokesman bela anda urged employees to talk constructively with management so as not to weaken the bochum site in the long run . regional premier calls for calm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to gm : keep the bochum plant alive , " reads the sign .
peer steinbrueck , the regional premier of the state of north rhine-westphalia , where bochum is based , also called for calm .
steinbrueck said he could understand workers ' anger , but striking would not help .
" if we want to have a long-term perspective for the bochum site and avoid compulsory redundancies , we have to remain level-headed and professional in the way we go about finding a solution , " he said . the head of the general works council at opel , klaus franz , took a similar tack .
he told the business daily handelsblatt that the work stoppages at bochum were understandable from an emotional point of view .
but the action could jeopardize negotiations between management and unions . " we need an intelligent strategy on the part of workers that entails both negotiation and fight , " he said .
franz was optimistic that a solution could be found , but he warned : " let there be no illusion - we wo n't be able to get around compulsory redundancies . " bochum workers claim self-defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum workers refuse to go back to work .
the workers at bochum , however , remained adamant .
" it 's self-defense , " said the head of bochum 's works council lothar marquardt .
" people are afraid for their livelihood . "
production at bochum has been halted since thursday . the work stoppages in bochum were already having a knock-on effect on supply of parts used to build opel 's astra model at factories elsewhere in europe , marquardt said .
a europe-wide stoppage could cost general motors € 10-30 million -lrb- $ 12-37 million -rrb- a day , he said . a labor expert in munich , volker rieble , dubbed the stoppages wildcat strikes , since the unions had not officially called for them and they were not directly connected with concrete wage demands .
as such , the wildcat strikes are illegal under germany 's labor laws . do n't expect rapid results , says negotiator a spokesman for opel cautioned the talks that began between union and management on monday were not likely to yield any rapid results .
a timeframe and the size of the cost cuts had to be established first , he said , declining to provide any details about the exact venue or the anticipated length of the first round of talks . last thursday , general motors said it planned to slash 12,000 jobs in europe - or around one fifth of its workforce in the region - in an attempt to steer its european operations back into profit after six years of losses . most of the cuts would be made in germany , with the plants in bochum and in rüsselsheim in the main line of fire . unions and employee representatives have called workers at all gm sites in europe to take part in demonstrations and protest marches on tuesday . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opel employees stage work stoppages production halted friday at the bochum factory of troubled german car maker opel as workers laid down tools for the second day in a row in protest against cuts .

as negotiations continued , neither side was giving ground . workers at car maker opel halted production at a factory in bochum , north west germany , for the fifth day in a row on monday in continuing protest against plans by the group 's us parent general motors ' to slash thousands of jobs in europe . but with every sign that both sides were prepared to dig their heels in over the escalating labor conflict , politicians urged employees to end the wildcat strikes and hold constructive talks with management to negotiate the long-term future of the site . the assembly lines at bochum were silent for the fifth day in a row on monday , as workers , ignoring calls by the government and opel 's general works council for a return to work , voted unanimously to stay outside the factory gates . economy minister wolfgang clement warned that the workers ' hard-line stance could jeopardize the crucial restructuring talks between management and unions which began in opel 's headquarters in rüsselsheim on monday . " employees who stand in front of the gates will not improve the chances of safeguarding the plant , " clement said .
he could understand the workers ' point of view , " but that does change my opinion that it is wrong " , the minister said . government spokesman bela anda urged employees to talk constructively with management so as not to weaken the bochum site in the long run . regional premier calls for calm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to gm : keep the bochum plant alive , " reads the sign .
peer steinbrueck , the regional premier of the state of north rhine-westphalia , where bochum is based , also called for calm .
steinbrueck said he could understand workers ' anger , but striking would not help .
" if we want to have a long-term perspective for the bochum site and avoid compulsory redundancies , we have to remain level-headed and professional in the way we go about finding a solution , " he said . the head of the general works council at opel , klaus franz , took a similar tack .
he told the business daily handelsblatt that the work stoppages at bochum were understandable from an emotional point of view .
but the action could jeopardize negotiations between management and unions . " we need an intelligent strategy on the part of workers that entails both negotiation and fight , " he said .
franz was optimistic that a solution could be found , but he warned : " let there be no illusion - we wo n't be able to get around compulsory redundancies . " bochum workers claim self-defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum workers refuse to go back to work .
the workers at bochum , however , remained adamant .

" the decision to pursue an individual must remain in the national domain , and we do not support plans like the creation of a european prosecutor , " a junior british home office minister , caroline flint , told her parliament recently . france however has moved closer to the once controversial german position that a european police force should have a broader mandate across the european union . exchanges of information the five governments have regularly exchanged information on suspected terrorist activities since agreeing to do so at their first meeting in spain in may last year . the ministers will also discuss how to assist the european union 's newest members to tackle organized crime networks in their countries . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , italy push ahead on asylum centers despite a lukewarm reception in the eu , berlin and rome intend to press ahead with a controversial plan to create holding asylum camps for european-bound migrants in north africa as a means to combat illegal immigration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.10.2004 merkel scotches rumors of power struggle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has sought to play down the recent turbulence within her party germany ’ s conservative party leader angela merkel has brushed aside allegations that some senior members of her christian democratic union are plotting against her in an effort to unseat her as party chairwoman . at the weekend some of merkel ’ s key conservative allies said that a series of political blunders committed by merkel recently were secretly masterminded by merkel ’ s inner-party rivals who want to prevent the cdu leader from becoming the next conservative candidate in the race for the chancellorship in 2006 .
on monday merkel suffered yet another blow as her choice for a prominent party post refused to take up the vacancy .
two of her closest allies in the party leadership said at the weekend that recent political mishaps , including a forced about-face on plans for a populist campaign against turkey ’ s eu bid , didn ’ t come entirely out of the blue .
they speculated that a group of party barons from western germany were bent on ousting merkel – who is from eastern germany – in an attempt to level the playing field for their own ambitions to become the conservatives ' candidate for the chancellorship .
merkel plays down alleged ouster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is not known for giving up things without a fight but merkel appeared calm and composed on monday , putting a brave face on allegations that there was a putsch underway to oust her .
but merkel brushed aside such concerns , saying this was not the time to play political games .
" against the background of economic decline which is again looming large in this country , the entire cdu presidium refused to discuss such allegations , " she told reporters .
" so this debate has come to an end before it actually started . "
string of setbacks yet merkel has had to endure a spell of dramatic setbacks in recent weeks raising questions about the cdu leader ’ s strategies and the strength of her leadership .
her blunders include a series of heavy losses at recent state and local polls , the resignation of a key cdu parliamentary figure , and unresolved policy quarrels with its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble merkel ’ s inner-party troubles were compounded on monday , after wolfgang schäuble -lrb- photo -rrb- refused to take up merkel ’ s offer of becoming the cdu ‘ s influential finance and economics spokesman in parliament .
merkel now claims schäuble refused because he felt more comfortable with foreign politics .
" this is not at all the dramatic error i ’ m said to have committed , " she said .
" i don ’ t think it is anything unusual that wolfgang schäuble refused my offer because he believes that he is more valuable to the party in his current post as the party ’ s foreign affairs expert .
so i don ’ t see this as a big deal at all . "
fear of chaos political observers , however , see this as yet another indication that scores are currently being settled within the cdu which are undermining merkel ’ s position as the undisputed ruler of the conservatives .
and already the cdu ’ s traditional allies and long-time junior partners in coalition governments – the liberal free democrats -lrb- gdp -rrb- – are beginning to worry .
" i think that unresolved power and personality issues are clearly behind those discussions , " said fdp leader guido westerwelle .
" the cdu would be well advised to decide about the conservative candidacy this year already .
otherwise i fear there is going to be never-ending chaos within the party which will tarnish our reputation among the electorate . "
a crucial cdu party congress to be held in early december will show how strong angela merkel ’ s grip on the conservatives still is , as delegates will be voting on a controversial health care reform plan .
overwhelming support for her proposals would also send a clear signal to her conservative foes that merkel may have stumbled , but will not fall . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel facing inner-party coup ?

fed up with the inconvenient curved shape of bananas , a berlin resident has dreamt up a way to straighten this staple of the fruit bowl , even applying to have his banana-straightening method patented . karl-friedrich lentze thinks he 's on to the biggest thing since sliced bread - the straight banana .
or as he prefers to call it , the " cigar-banana . " the 56-year old social welfare recipient has developed a method to take away the yellow-skinned fruit 's distinctive curve . " depending on the degree of the curve , chunks will be cut out of the banana , which will then be bound back together using biologically safe bandages , " lentze explained to the german tabloid bild . the curvy chunks wo n't go to waste .
lentze 's plan involves either drying them or using them in fruit salad . " after a certain introduction time , the straight cigar-banana will drive the curved banana from the market , " lentze said .
" it 's easier to eat , and easier to store . " patent pending lentze is so convinced is of his idea 's potential , that he 's applied for a patent at the german patent office in munich .
his application is supported by sketches showing how bananas will be carried along on a conveyor belt while robots chop out the curvy bits . if trends in japan are anything to go by , lentze 's idea could well bear fruit .
the japanese can already buy square melons , which are grown in glass boxes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.10.2004 turkey not interested in german tanks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül -lrb- right -rrb- will also discuss turkey 's eu accession in berlin turkey 's foreign minister is visiting berlin to discuss his country 's entry in the european union .
abdullah gül also refuted german media reports that turkey wants to buy hundreds of german tanks . turkey currently has no interest in buying tanks from the german military , gül told the german business daily handelsblatt at the start of his two-day visit to berlin .
he added that he was surprised that the issue had even become a topic in the media .
last week , the german media began reporting that turkey was interested in buying several hundred leopard 2 tanks no longer needed by the german military . while in berlin , gül is meeting with his german counterpart , joschka fischer , among others .
referring to turkey 's negotiations to start accession talks with the european union , gül admitted that his country still had some problems to solve . " no country is perfect , " gül told handelsblatt .
" the important thing is that we 're trying to solve our problems . " german support for turkey on sunday , gül praised germany as a staunch supporter of turkey 's efforts to join the eu and expressed confidence that berlin would help in overcoming french objections to his country 's accession bid . " germany is among the countries who are the biggest supporters of turkey , " gül told reporters .
" naturally this issue is being discussed between germany and france as well , and germany is helping turkey . " gül said that ankara was watching with understanding the debate in france over whether the vast muslim nation should be allowed into the eu , but warned : " turkey should not be subjected to injustices .
it is not possible for us to accept that . " gül 's trip to germany is the first in a series of visits that turkish leaders will make to european capitals to drum up support for their country in the run-up to a crucial dec .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.10.2004 german press review : internal conflicts german editorials on monday concerned themselves with the apparent power struggle in the country ’ s conservative christian democratic union and commented on chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s visit to libya . strange bedfellows , wrote the stuttgarter zeitung after the german chancellor ’ s visit to libya ’ s strongman , moammar gadhafi .
an odd collection of new friends they are indeed that europe , the us and germany have gathered together since the sept .
11 attacks .
the selection revolves around economic and strategic interests , and preferably both , but not human rights .
that is the dangerous thing about these new friends , the paper said : " they are dictatorships with a total disregard for human life , and no one knows whether this trust that the west has placed in them will not some day be abused - see saddam hussein . "
of course , germany , europe and the us are looking to stabilize a world gone awry and secure the supply of natural resources .
but , the paper emphasized , the question is whether handling these countries at arm ’ s length would n't be better for our credibility ?
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung turned its attention to what a number of german media outlets believe is a conspiracy within the christian democratic union to discredit and topple party leader angela merkel .
the paper didn ´ t seem concerned about the cdu ’ s upcoming party conference in düsseldorf .
merkel , the paper said , has simply declared that meeting as hers .
there are no lack of calls from within the party to settle the open chancellor candidate question for 2006 right now and in her favor .
if this is what a loss of authority looks like , the paper noted , then angela merkel has nothing to worry about .
cologne ’ s stadt-anzeiger , on the other hand , saw the power question in the cdu moving toward a climax .
merkel can not let the inner-party debate about her leadership abilities , which some people are calling an intrigue , continue .
it is bad for her image and that of the party as a whole , the paper said .
the critical voices are increasing , even among merkel ’ s allies , the paper noted .
the cdu lacks guidance and is in danger of losing the public ’ s faith in its ability to govern .
the leipziger volkszeitung pointed to the heavy-handed criticism of merkel from german business leaders , talked of intrigue and demanded from germany ’ s liberal free democrats to settle the opposition ’ s chancellor candidate issue as an obvious sign that the party conference in december could end up being a palace revolt .
the crisis in the cdu resembles the chaos theory , wrote the saarbrücker zeitung - it has a life of its own and can not be controlled .
angela merkel , the paper said , no longer holds the reins in her hands .
helplessly she has to watch as the arduously constructed image of the cdu as a competent alternative implodes .
the cdu thinks the bavarian sister party , csu , is at fault , but that diagnosis is too simple , the paper thought .
instead , too many bad choices have been made or no choices at all .
bonn ’ s general-anzeiger noted that merkel has lost a lot of public support .
people want a party that demonstrates its members have closed ranks , but the cdu and csu are anything but that .
chancellor schröder , at least , has stuck to his guns , the paper said , even though there is still the risk of failure . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

on monday merkel suffered yet another blow as her choice for a prominent party post refused to take up the vacancy .
two of her closest allies in the party leadership said at the weekend that recent political mishaps , including a forced about-face on plans for a populist campaign against turkey ’ s eu bid , didn ’ t come entirely out of the blue .
they speculated that a group of party barons from western germany were bent on ousting merkel – who is from eastern germany – in an attempt to level the playing field for their own ambitions to become the conservatives ' candidate for the chancellorship .
merkel plays down alleged ouster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is not known for giving up things without a fight but merkel appeared calm and composed on monday , putting a brave face on allegations that there was a putsch underway to oust her .
but merkel brushed aside such concerns , saying this was not the time to play political games .
" against the background of economic decline which is again looming large in this country , the entire cdu presidium refused to discuss such allegations , " she told reporters .
" so this debate has come to an end before it actually started . "
string of setbacks yet merkel has had to endure a spell of dramatic setbacks in recent weeks raising questions about the cdu leader ’ s strategies and the strength of her leadership .
her blunders include a series of heavy losses at recent state and local polls , the resignation of a key cdu parliamentary figure , and unresolved policy quarrels with its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble merkel ’ s inner-party troubles were compounded on monday , after wolfgang schäuble -lrb- photo -rrb- refused to take up merkel ’ s offer of becoming the cdu ‘ s influential finance and economics spokesman in parliament .
merkel now claims schäuble refused because he felt more comfortable with foreign politics .
" this is not at all the dramatic error i ’ m said to have committed , " she said .
" i don ’ t think it is anything unusual that wolfgang schäuble refused my offer because he believes that he is more valuable to the party in his current post as the party ’ s foreign affairs expert .
so i don ’ t see this as a big deal at all . "
fear of chaos political observers , however , see this as yet another indication that scores are currently being settled within the cdu which are undermining merkel ’ s position as the undisputed ruler of the conservatives .
and already the cdu ’ s traditional allies and long-time junior partners in coalition governments – the liberal free democrats -lrb- gdp -rrb- – are beginning to worry .
" i think that unresolved power and personality issues are clearly behind those discussions , " said fdp leader guido westerwelle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.10.2004 reconciliation instead of reparation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expelled ethnic germans from poland arrive in germany as tension simmers between germany and poland over world war ii compensation claims , a german journalist is trying to bring reason to the impassioned debate by urging ethnic germans to relinquish their claims . on monday , senior lawmakers from germany and poland met in a bid to defuse tensions between the two countries over world war ii compensation claims . speaking ahead of the talks , jozef oleksy , speaker of the polish lower house of parliament , said the question of compensation " is inevitable , but it is not the main issue " and that german-polish ties " can not be reduced to the problem of reparations . " despite the optimism , there 's no denying that the issue has strained relations between the two neighbors . bildunterschrift : numerous children were among the ethnic germans expelled from a polish detention camp to germany in 1950 .
an estimated 2.5 million ethnic germans were expelled or fled from poland shortly before the end of world war ii . many of them who lost property and homes when poland 's borders shifted westwards after the war are calling for compensation from poland through organizations and lawyers . the issue has created huge resentment in poland , particularly since the country 's entry to the european union last may .
most poles believe that the german losses pale into insignificance compared to the deaths of more than six million poles after adolf hitler 's army invaded the country in 1939 . a breath of fresh air the debate , which is marked by high emotions and painful memories of the survivors and their families , has often taken on a bitter tone with some ethnic germans threatening to take their claims for repatriations to polish and european courts . the fate of the expelled ethnic german refugees from eastern europe is occasionally exploited by different groups to extract political mileage . but , now a new book by german journalist and poland expert helga hirsch has been hailed as a breath of fresh air in the ongoing debate .
called " schweres gepäck " or " heavy baggage " , the book completely avoids the thorny issue of reparations and instead allows the children and grandchildren of seven ethnic german families expelled from poland , to express their feelings and memories on the subject . the result is a very personal and yet sober account of persons , who often have no own memories of expulsion and flight , but who still suffer under the burden of searching for their own identities . breaking the silence hirsch , whose own father came from present-day poland , told deutsche welle that the most difficult thing about the issue was breaking the silence over it .
" a fair punishment for the suffering that germany caused in europe " is how many children of expelled ethnic germans who grew up in postwar germany came to view and accept the issue , hirsch said .
germans were simply not viewed as victims , she added . hirsch , who 's aware that she 's treading controversial ground with her book , said that a further problem when it came to the issue was the fact that for a long time in germany there was a process of coming to grips with collective guilt , but not with suffering . " today 's generation as opposed to the 1968 one , has a general tendency to look carefully at their own families and try to determine what 's there , " said hirsch .
" we 've now learnt that both guilt and suffering can co-exist in a family .
it demands great psychological skills to endure this ambivalence - and i experience it as a great progress . " an important contribution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudeten germans refugees wait to board one of the trains at klingenthal station in czechoslovakia in sept .
1938 the book is seen as an important contribution to the ongoing dispute between both germany and poland as well as germany and the czech republic . hirsch , however , is clear that not all ethnic germans support the idea of demanding reparations .
she has thus also started a signature campaign against compensation claims and so far managed to get 70 prominent ethnic german expellees on board . " i find it -lrb- demand for compensation -rrb- horrible in our relationship to poland and i want to make a public gesture that those demanding reparations are n't all the ethnic germans , " hirsch said .
" for poland the issue is important … and i notice when i 'm there that such a gesture from the germans gives an important signal to the poles : we respect and consider your fears . " hirsch said she hoped the process of coming to grips with the suffering of the expelled ethnic germans would someday take hold in poland and the czech republic too .
but she remained clear that the process should in no manner be driven by the german side . elena beier -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland , germany vow to squash reparations claims german chancellor gerhard schröder and polish prime minister marek belka appealed to the common sense of those germans and poles currently trying to revive a debate about world war ii reparation claims .

" despite the optimism , there 's no denying that the issue has strained relations between the two neighbors . bildunterschrift : numerous children were among the ethnic germans expelled from a polish detention camp to germany in 1950 .
an estimated 2.5 million ethnic germans were expelled or fled from poland shortly before the end of world war ii . many of them who lost property and homes when poland 's borders shifted westwards after the war are calling for compensation from poland through organizations and lawyers . the issue has created huge resentment in poland , particularly since the country 's entry to the european union last may .
most poles believe that the german losses pale into insignificance compared to the deaths of more than six million poles after adolf hitler 's army invaded the country in 1939 . a breath of fresh air the debate , which is marked by high emotions and painful memories of the survivors and their families , has often taken on a bitter tone with some ethnic germans threatening to take their claims for repatriations to polish and european courts . the fate of the expelled ethnic german refugees from eastern europe is occasionally exploited by different groups to extract political mileage . but , now a new book by german journalist and poland expert helga hirsch has been hailed as a breath of fresh air in the ongoing debate .
called " schweres gepäck " or " heavy baggage " , the book completely avoids the thorny issue of reparations and instead allows the children and grandchildren of seven ethnic german families expelled from poland , to express their feelings and memories on the subject . the result is a very personal and yet sober account of persons , who often have no own memories of expulsion and flight , but who still suffer under the burden of searching for their own identities . breaking the silence hirsch , whose own father came from present-day poland , told deutsche welle that the most difficult thing about the issue was breaking the silence over it .
" a fair punishment for the suffering that germany caused in europe " is how many children of expelled ethnic germans who grew up in postwar germany came to view and accept the issue , hirsch said .
germans were simply not viewed as victims , she added . hirsch , who 's aware that she 's treading controversial ground with her book , said that a further problem when it came to the issue was the fact that for a long time in germany there was a process of coming to grips with collective guilt , but not with suffering . " today 's generation as opposed to the 1968 one , has a general tendency to look carefully at their own families and try to determine what 's there , " said hirsch .
" we 've now learnt that both guilt and suffering can co-exist in a family .
it demands great psychological skills to endure this ambivalence - and i experience it as a great progress . " an important contribution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudeten germans refugees wait to board one of the trains at klingenthal station in czechoslovakia in sept .
1938 the book is seen as an important contribution to the ongoing dispute between both germany and poland as well as germany and the czech republic . hirsch , however , is clear that not all ethnic germans support the idea of demanding reparations .
she has thus also started a signature campaign against compensation claims and so far managed to get 70 prominent ethnic german expellees on board . " i find it -lrb- demand for compensation -rrb- horrible in our relationship to poland and i want to make a public gesture that those demanding reparations are n't all the ethnic germans , " hirsch said .
" for poland the issue is important … and i notice when i 'm there that such a gesture from the germans gives an important signal to the poles : we respect and consider your fears . " hirsch said she hoped the process of coming to grips with the suffering of the expelled ethnic germans would someday take hold in poland and the czech republic too .
but she remained clear that the process should in no manner be driven by the german side . elena beier -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland , germany vow to squash reparations claims german chancellor gerhard schröder and polish prime minister marek belka appealed to the common sense of those germans and poles currently trying to revive a debate about world war ii reparation claims .

" we do not want to accept camps or centers of any kind , " he said . france , traditionally a close ally of germany , would move to halt the germans and italians pressing the european union to build overseas reception camps that would filter the genuine asylum seekers and reject the rest . the proposed centers , set up outside the 25-nation eu 's borders and notably in north africa , would repatriate those who do not meet immigration requirements .
" it is not for europe to take this issue forward , " de villepin told reporters .

" we can not leave things as they are now , " german interior minister otto schily said on monday .
" we should offer these immigrants , before they embark on a very risky journey , advice on whether they qualify for protection . "
but he acknowledged : " no consensus has been reached . " while france 's traditional ally germany may feel aggrieved , the italians will be seething .
italy is a transit route for migrants seeking to enter europe and in the first week of october alone , some 1,800 migrants landed on the southern italian island of lampedusa .
italy airlifted more than 1,000 of them to libya , with which it has signed a new repatriation agreement . europol appointment split over favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol logo another sticking point was the appointment of a new chief for the eu 's police agency , europol , with germany and france making clear they favored their own men for the job .
there appeared to be little progress made to resolve the issue during the two-day summit .
" each of us has his own candidate , " de villepin said .
" we do n't want to undermine the others , but ours is very good . " the eu missed a june deadline for naming a new head of the agency - which the ministers agree is vital to the region 's fight against organized crime and terror - as they were unable to agree on a compromise candidate . germany wanted to renew the mandate of founding director jürgen storbeck , whose term ended on june 30 , while france wanted senior french police officer jacques franquet . the agency , based in the hague , was created in 1999 to help eu states fight organized crime and its mandate has in recent times been expanded to cover the increased threat of global terrorism . digital fingerprinting tipped for 2006 despite the lack of consensus on many issues at hand , the ministers did agree on plans to introduce digital fingerprinting for eu passports from as early as 2006 .
that would come on top of plans to use digital photos to make passports more secure . however , the 2006 date will miss a us deadline of october 2005 for eu passports to incorporate such " biometric " security measures if eu citizens want visa-free travel to the united states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu big five to tackle immigration differences interior ministers from five leading eu states gather in florence on sunday hoping to smooth out differences over how to tackle illegal immigration and strengthen cooperation in the fight against terrorism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.10.2004 reconciliation instead of reparation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expelled ethnic germans from poland arrive in germany as tension simmers between germany and poland over world war ii compensation claims , a german journalist is trying to bring reason to the impassioned debate by urging ethnic germans to relinquish their claims . on monday , senior lawmakers from germany and poland met in a bid to defuse tensions between the two countries over world war ii compensation claims . speaking ahead of the talks , jozef oleksy , speaker of the polish lower house of parliament , said the question of compensation " is inevitable , but it is not the main issue " and that german-polish ties " can not be reduced to the problem of reparations . " despite the optimism , there 's no denying that the issue has strained relations between the two neighbors . bildunterschrift : numerous children were among the ethnic germans expelled from a polish detention camp to germany in 1950 .
an estimated 2.5 million ethnic germans were expelled or fled from poland shortly before the end of world war ii . many of them who lost property and homes when poland 's borders shifted westwards after the war are calling for compensation from poland through organizations and lawyers . the issue has created huge resentment in poland , particularly since the country 's entry to the european union last may .
most poles believe that the german losses pale into insignificance compared to the deaths of more than six million poles after adolf hitler 's army invaded the country in 1939 . a breath of fresh air the debate , which is marked by high emotions and painful memories of the survivors and their families , has often taken on a bitter tone with some ethnic germans threatening to take their claims for repatriations to polish and european courts . the fate of the expelled ethnic german refugees from eastern europe is occasionally exploited by different groups to extract political mileage . but , now a new book by german journalist and poland expert helga hirsch has been hailed as a breath of fresh air in the ongoing debate .
called " schweres gepäck " or " heavy baggage " , the book completely avoids the thorny issue of reparations and instead allows the children and grandchildren of seven ethnic german families expelled from poland , to express their feelings and memories on the subject . the result is a very personal and yet sober account of persons , who often have no own memories of expulsion and flight , but who still suffer under the burden of searching for their own identities . breaking the silence hirsch , whose own father came from present-day poland , told deutsche welle that the most difficult thing about the issue was breaking the silence over it .
" a fair punishment for the suffering that germany caused in europe " is how many children of expelled ethnic germans who grew up in postwar germany came to view and accept the issue , hirsch said .
germans were simply not viewed as victims , she added . hirsch , who 's aware that she 's treading controversial ground with her book , said that a further problem when it came to the issue was the fact that for a long time in germany there was a process of coming to grips with collective guilt , but not with suffering . " today 's generation as opposed to the 1968 one , has a general tendency to look carefully at their own families and try to determine what 's there , " said hirsch .
" we 've now learnt that both guilt and suffering can co-exist in a family .
it demands great psychological skills to endure this ambivalence - and i experience it as a great progress . " an important contribution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudeten germans refugees wait to board one of the trains at klingenthal station in czechoslovakia in sept .
1938 the book is seen as an important contribution to the ongoing dispute between both germany and poland as well as germany and the czech republic . hirsch , however , is clear that not all ethnic germans support the idea of demanding reparations .
she has thus also started a signature campaign against compensation claims and so far managed to get 70 prominent ethnic german expellees on board . " i find it -lrb- demand for compensation -rrb- horrible in our relationship to poland and i want to make a public gesture that those demanding reparations are n't all the ethnic germans , " hirsch said .
" for poland the issue is important … and i notice when i 'm there that such a gesture from the germans gives an important signal to the poles : we respect and consider your fears . " hirsch said she hoped the process of coming to grips with the suffering of the expelled ethnic germans would someday take hold in poland and the czech republic too .
but she remained clear that the process should in no manner be driven by the german side . elena beier -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland , germany vow to squash reparations claims german chancellor gerhard schröder and polish prime minister marek belka appealed to the common sense of those germans and poles currently trying to revive a debate about world war ii reparation claims .

" we do not want to accept camps or centers of any kind , " he said . france , traditionally a close ally of germany , would move to halt the germans and italians pressing the european union to build overseas reception camps that would filter the genuine asylum seekers and reject the rest . the proposed centers , set up outside the 25-nation eu 's borders and notably in north africa , would repatriate those who do not meet immigration requirements .
" it is not for europe to take this issue forward , " de villepin told reporters .
spain also rejected the initiative . the opponents claim that dealing with refugees should not be left to the european union alone and that groups such as the un high commissioner for refugees and non-governmental organizations must take a leading role . no consensus , laments schily bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily .
" we can not leave things as they are now , " german interior minister otto schily said on monday .
" we should offer these immigrants , before they embark on a very risky journey , advice on whether they qualify for protection . "
but he acknowledged : " no consensus has been reached . " while france 's traditional ally germany may feel aggrieved , the italians will be seething .
italy is a transit route for migrants seeking to enter europe and in the first week of october alone , some 1,800 migrants landed on the southern italian island of lampedusa .
italy airlifted more than 1,000 of them to libya , with which it has signed a new repatriation agreement . europol appointment split over favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol logo another sticking point was the appointment of a new chief for the eu 's police agency , europol , with germany and france making clear they favored their own men for the job .
there appeared to be little progress made to resolve the issue during the two-day summit .
" each of us has his own candidate , " de villepin said .
" we do n't want to undermine the others , but ours is very good . " the eu missed a june deadline for naming a new head of the agency - which the ministers agree is vital to the region 's fight against organized crime and terror - as they were unable to agree on a compromise candidate . germany wanted to renew the mandate of founding director jürgen storbeck , whose term ended on june 30 , while france wanted senior french police officer jacques franquet . the agency , based in the hague , was created in 1999 to help eu states fight organized crime and its mandate has in recent times been expanded to cover the increased threat of global terrorism . digital fingerprinting tipped for 2006 despite the lack of consensus on many issues at hand , the ministers did agree on plans to introduce digital fingerprinting for eu passports from as early as 2006 .
that would come on top of plans to use digital photos to make passports more secure . however , the 2006 date will miss a us deadline of october 2005 for eu passports to incorporate such " biometric " security measures if eu citizens want visa-free travel to the united states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu big five to tackle immigration differences interior ministers from five leading eu states gather in florence on sunday hoping to smooth out differences over how to tackle illegal immigration and strengthen cooperation in the fight against terrorism .

lentze 's plan involves either drying them or using them in fruit salad . " after a certain introduction time , the straight cigar-banana will drive the curved banana from the market , " lentze said .
" it 's easier to eat , and easier to store . " patent pending lentze is so convinced is of his idea 's potential , that he 's applied for a patent at the german patent office in munich .
his application is supported by sketches showing how bananas will be carried along on a conveyor belt while robots chop out the curvy bits . if trends in japan are anything to go by , lentze 's idea could well bear fruit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's economic woes gloom deepens over german economy opinion : blame the managers , not the country negotiations at opel continue deal reached at karstadtquelle business -pipe- 18.10.2004 both sides dig in for long fight in opel stand-off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : families joined striking opel workers on the fifth day of protests managers and workers representatives at german car maker opel met on monday to resolve the bitter stand-off over proposed mass redundancies .
as negotiations continued , neither side was giving ground . workers at car maker opel halted production at a factory in bochum , north west germany , for the fifth day in a row on monday in continuing protest against plans by the group 's us parent general motors ' to slash thousands of jobs in europe . but with every sign that both sides were prepared to dig their heels in over the escalating labor conflict , politicians urged employees to end the wildcat strikes and hold constructive talks with management to negotiate the long-term future of the site . the assembly lines at bochum were silent for the fifth day in a row on monday , as workers , ignoring calls by the government and opel 's general works council for a return to work , voted unanimously to stay outside the factory gates . economy minister wolfgang clement warned that the workers ' hard-line stance could jeopardize the crucial restructuring talks between management and unions which began in opel 's headquarters in rüsselsheim on monday . " employees who stand in front of the gates will not improve the chances of safeguarding the plant , " clement said .
he could understand the workers ' point of view , " but that does change my opinion that it is wrong " , the minister said . government spokesman bela anda urged employees to talk constructively with management so as not to weaken the bochum site in the long run . regional premier calls for calm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to gm : keep the bochum plant alive , " reads the sign .
peer steinbrueck , the regional premier of the state of north rhine-westphalia , where bochum is based , also called for calm .
steinbrueck said he could understand workers ' anger , but striking would not help .
" if we want to have a long-term perspective for the bochum site and avoid compulsory redundancies , we have to remain level-headed and professional in the way we go about finding a solution , " he said . the head of the general works council at opel , klaus franz , took a similar tack .
he told the business daily handelsblatt that the work stoppages at bochum were understandable from an emotional point of view .
but the action could jeopardize negotiations between management and unions . " we need an intelligent strategy on the part of workers that entails both negotiation and fight , " he said .
franz was optimistic that a solution could be found , but he warned : " let there be no illusion - we wo n't be able to get around compulsory redundancies . " bochum workers claim self-defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum workers refuse to go back to work .
the workers at bochum , however , remained adamant .
" it 's self-defense , " said the head of bochum 's works council lothar marquardt .
" people are afraid for their livelihood . "
production at bochum has been halted since thursday . the work stoppages in bochum were already having a knock-on effect on supply of parts used to build opel 's astra model at factories elsewhere in europe , marquardt said .
a europe-wide stoppage could cost general motors € 10-30 million -lrb- $ 12-37 million -rrb- a day , he said . a labor expert in munich , volker rieble , dubbed the stoppages wildcat strikes , since the unions had not officially called for them and they were not directly connected with concrete wage demands .
as such , the wildcat strikes are illegal under germany 's labor laws . do n't expect rapid results , says negotiator a spokesman for opel cautioned the talks that began between union and management on monday were not likely to yield any rapid results .
a timeframe and the size of the cost cuts had to be established first , he said , declining to provide any details about the exact venue or the anticipated length of the first round of talks . last thursday , general motors said it planned to slash 12,000 jobs in europe - or around one fifth of its workforce in the region - in an attempt to steer its european operations back into profit after six years of losses . most of the cuts would be made in germany , with the plants in bochum and in rüsselsheim in the main line of fire . unions and employee representatives have called workers at all gm sites in europe to take part in demonstrations and protest marches on tuesday . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opel employees stage work stoppages production halted friday at the bochum factory of troubled german car maker opel as workers laid down tools for the second day in a row in protest against cuts .

when bundesliga high flyers wolfsburg came up against hannover on sunday , the wolves were hoping to make it six wins in a row , but against a plucky hanover side , they lost their bite . vfl wolfsburg have sat proudly at the bundesliga summit for almost a month , but a 3-0 mauling at hannover on sunday saw that run come to an abrupt end .
a brace from silvio schröter , in the seventh and 64th minutes , and a late strike from daniel stendel handed wolves their second loss of the season and they now lie two points adrift of new leaders vfb stuttgart .
off-kilter the german top flight has an odd look to it with wolfsburg second and promoted mainz 05 , enjoying their first ever bundesliga season , in third spot above bayern munich . the 1983 european champions sv hamburg are bottom while the 2002 german champions borussia dortmund are 13th . controversial referee decision in sunday 's other match , borussia mönchengladbach moved out of the relegation zone with a 2-0 home triumph over kaiserslautern . forward oliver neuville pushed his claim for a recall to the german national team netting his seventh and eighth goals of the campaign to head the scoring charts . kaiserslautern were livid at referee uwe kemmling for neuville 's first goal in the 53rd minute with the striker clearly using his hand to guide the ball in . " it was not intentional but the referee did not see it and we won 2-0 , " neuville said . both teams were reduced to 10 men three minutes after the controversial goal as emotions spilled over .
neuville grabbed his second in the 78th minute , while leverkusen have netted 14 goals in eight matches but have shipped in the same tally . weekend overview bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's roque junior from brazil , center , fights for the control of the ball against berlin 's gilberto from brazil , left , and fredi bobic , right , during a match of german first soccer division between hertha bsc berlin and bayer 04 leverkusen in the olympic stadium in berlin , saturday , oct .

as negotiations continued , neither side was giving ground . workers at car maker opel halted production at a factory in bochum , north west germany , for the fifth day in a row on monday in continuing protest against plans by the group 's us parent general motors ' to slash thousands of jobs in europe . but with every sign that both sides were prepared to dig their heels in over the escalating labor conflict , politicians urged employees to end the wildcat strikes and hold constructive talks with management to negotiate the long-term future of the site . the assembly lines at bochum were silent for the fifth day in a row on monday , as workers , ignoring calls by the government and opel 's general works council for a return to work , voted unanimously to stay outside the factory gates . economy minister wolfgang clement warned that the workers ' hard-line stance could jeopardize the crucial restructuring talks between management and unions which began in opel 's headquarters in rüsselsheim on monday . " employees who stand in front of the gates will not improve the chances of safeguarding the plant , " clement said .
he could understand the workers ' point of view , " but that does change my opinion that it is wrong " , the minister said . government spokesman bela anda urged employees to talk constructively with management so as not to weaken the bochum site in the long run . regional premier calls for calm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to gm : keep the bochum plant alive , " reads the sign .

steinbrueck said he could understand workers ' anger , but striking would not help .
" if we want to have a long-term perspective for the bochum site and avoid compulsory redundancies , we have to remain level-headed and professional in the way we go about finding a solution , " he said . the head of the general works council at opel , klaus franz , took a similar tack .
he told the business daily handelsblatt that the work stoppages at bochum were understandable from an emotional point of view .
but the action could jeopardize negotiations between management and unions . " we need an intelligent strategy on the part of workers that entails both negotiation and fight , " he said .

" people are afraid for their livelihood . "
production at bochum has been halted since thursday . the work stoppages in bochum were already having a knock-on effect on supply of parts used to build opel 's astra model at factories elsewhere in europe , marquardt said .
a europe-wide stoppage could cost general motors € 10-30 million -lrb- $ 12-37 million -rrb- a day , he said . a labor expert in munich , volker rieble , dubbed the stoppages wildcat strikes , since the unions had not officially called for them and they were not directly connected with concrete wage demands .
as such , the wildcat strikes are illegal under germany 's labor laws . do n't expect rapid results , says negotiator a spokesman for opel cautioned the talks that began between union and management on monday were not likely to yield any rapid results .
a timeframe and the size of the cost cuts had to be established first , he said , declining to provide any details about the exact venue or the anticipated length of the first round of talks . last thursday , general motors said it planned to slash 12,000 jobs in europe - or around one fifth of its workforce in the region - in an attempt to steer its european operations back into profit after six years of losses . most of the cuts would be made in germany , with the plants in bochum and in rüsselsheim in the main line of fire . unions and employee representatives have called workers at all gm sites in europe to take part in demonstrations and protest marches on tuesday . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opel employees stage work stoppages production halted friday at the bochum factory of troubled german car maker opel as workers laid down tools for the second day in a row in protest against cuts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's economic woes gloom deepens over german economy opinion : blame the managers , not the country negotiations at opel continue deal reached at karstadtquelle business -pipe- 18.10.2004 both sides dig in for long fight in opel stand-off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : families joined striking opel workers on the fifth day of protests managers and workers representatives at german car maker opel met on monday to resolve the bitter stand-off over proposed mass redundancies .
as negotiations continued , neither side was giving ground . workers at car maker opel halted production at a factory in bochum , north west germany , for the fifth day in a row on monday in continuing protest against plans by the group 's us parent general motors ' to slash thousands of jobs in europe . but with every sign that both sides were prepared to dig their heels in over the escalating labor conflict , politicians urged employees to end the wildcat strikes and hold constructive talks with management to negotiate the long-term future of the site . the assembly lines at bochum were silent for the fifth day in a row on monday , as workers , ignoring calls by the government and opel 's general works council for a return to work , voted unanimously to stay outside the factory gates . economy minister wolfgang clement warned that the workers ' hard-line stance could jeopardize the crucial restructuring talks between management and unions which began in opel 's headquarters in rüsselsheim on monday . " employees who stand in front of the gates will not improve the chances of safeguarding the plant , " clement said .
he could understand the workers ' point of view , " but that does change my opinion that it is wrong " , the minister said . government spokesman bela anda urged employees to talk constructively with management so as not to weaken the bochum site in the long run . regional premier calls for calm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to gm : keep the bochum plant alive , " reads the sign .
peer steinbrueck , the regional premier of the state of north rhine-westphalia , where bochum is based , also called for calm .
steinbrueck said he could understand workers ' anger , but striking would not help .
" if we want to have a long-term perspective for the bochum site and avoid compulsory redundancies , we have to remain level-headed and professional in the way we go about finding a solution , " he said . the head of the general works council at opel , klaus franz , took a similar tack .
he told the business daily handelsblatt that the work stoppages at bochum were understandable from an emotional point of view .
but the action could jeopardize negotiations between management and unions . " we need an intelligent strategy on the part of workers that entails both negotiation and fight , " he said .
franz was optimistic that a solution could be found , but he warned : " let there be no illusion - we wo n't be able to get around compulsory redundancies . " bochum workers claim self-defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum workers refuse to go back to work .
the workers at bochum , however , remained adamant .
" it 's self-defense , " said the head of bochum 's works council lothar marquardt .
" people are afraid for their livelihood . "
production at bochum has been halted since thursday . the work stoppages in bochum were already having a knock-on effect on supply of parts used to build opel 's astra model at factories elsewhere in europe , marquardt said .
a europe-wide stoppage could cost general motors € 10-30 million -lrb- $ 12-37 million -rrb- a day , he said . a labor expert in munich , volker rieble , dubbed the stoppages wildcat strikes , since the unions had not officially called for them and they were not directly connected with concrete wage demands .
as such , the wildcat strikes are illegal under germany 's labor laws . do n't expect rapid results , says negotiator a spokesman for opel cautioned the talks that began between union and management on monday were not likely to yield any rapid results .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.10.2004 reconciliation instead of reparation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expelled ethnic germans from poland arrive in germany as tension simmers between germany and poland over world war ii compensation claims , a german journalist is trying to bring reason to the impassioned debate by urging ethnic germans to relinquish their claims . on monday , senior lawmakers from germany and poland met in a bid to defuse tensions between the two countries over world war ii compensation claims . speaking ahead of the talks , jozef oleksy , speaker of the polish lower house of parliament , said the question of compensation " is inevitable , but it is not the main issue " and that german-polish ties " can not be reduced to the problem of reparations . " despite the optimism , there 's no denying that the issue has strained relations between the two neighbors . bildunterschrift : numerous children were among the ethnic germans expelled from a polish detention camp to germany in 1950 .
an estimated 2.5 million ethnic germans were expelled or fled from poland shortly before the end of world war ii . many of them who lost property and homes when poland 's borders shifted westwards after the war are calling for compensation from poland through organizations and lawyers . the issue has created huge resentment in poland , particularly since the country 's entry to the european union last may .
most poles believe that the german losses pale into insignificance compared to the deaths of more than six million poles after adolf hitler 's army invaded the country in 1939 . a breath of fresh air the debate , which is marked by high emotions and painful memories of the survivors and their families , has often taken on a bitter tone with some ethnic germans threatening to take their claims for repatriations to polish and european courts . the fate of the expelled ethnic german refugees from eastern europe is occasionally exploited by different groups to extract political mileage . but , now a new book by german journalist and poland expert helga hirsch has been hailed as a breath of fresh air in the ongoing debate .
called " schweres gepäck " or " heavy baggage " , the book completely avoids the thorny issue of reparations and instead allows the children and grandchildren of seven ethnic german families expelled from poland , to express their feelings and memories on the subject . the result is a very personal and yet sober account of persons , who often have no own memories of expulsion and flight , but who still suffer under the burden of searching for their own identities . breaking the silence hirsch , whose own father came from present-day poland , told deutsche welle that the most difficult thing about the issue was breaking the silence over it .
" a fair punishment for the suffering that germany caused in europe " is how many children of expelled ethnic germans who grew up in postwar germany came to view and accept the issue , hirsch said .
germans were simply not viewed as victims , she added . hirsch , who 's aware that she 's treading controversial ground with her book , said that a further problem when it came to the issue was the fact that for a long time in germany there was a process of coming to grips with collective guilt , but not with suffering . " today 's generation as opposed to the 1968 one , has a general tendency to look carefully at their own families and try to determine what 's there , " said hirsch .
" we 've now learnt that both guilt and suffering can co-exist in a family .
it demands great psychological skills to endure this ambivalence - and i experience it as a great progress . " an important contribution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudeten germans refugees wait to board one of the trains at klingenthal station in czechoslovakia in sept .
1938 the book is seen as an important contribution to the ongoing dispute between both germany and poland as well as germany and the czech republic . hirsch , however , is clear that not all ethnic germans support the idea of demanding reparations .
she has thus also started a signature campaign against compensation claims and so far managed to get 70 prominent ethnic german expellees on board . " i find it -lrb- demand for compensation -rrb- horrible in our relationship to poland and i want to make a public gesture that those demanding reparations are n't all the ethnic germans , " hirsch said .
" for poland the issue is important … and i notice when i 'm there that such a gesture from the germans gives an important signal to the poles : we respect and consider your fears . " hirsch said she hoped the process of coming to grips with the suffering of the expelled ethnic germans would someday take hold in poland and the czech republic too .
but she remained clear that the process should in no manner be driven by the german side . elena beier -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland , germany vow to squash reparations claims german chancellor gerhard schröder and polish prime minister marek belka appealed to the common sense of those germans and poles currently trying to revive a debate about world war ii reparation claims .

" the decision to pursue an individual must remain in the national domain , and we do not support plans like the creation of a european prosecutor , " a junior british home office minister , caroline flint , told her parliament recently . france however has moved closer to the once controversial german position that a european police force should have a broader mandate across the european union . exchanges of information the five governments have regularly exchanged information on suspected terrorist activities since agreeing to do so at their first meeting in spain in may last year . the ministers will also discuss how to assist the european union 's newest members to tackle organized crime networks in their countries . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , italy push ahead on asylum centers despite a lukewarm reception in the eu , berlin and rome intend to press ahead with a controversial plan to create holding asylum camps for european-bound migrants in north africa as a means to combat illegal immigration .

" despite the optimism , there 's no denying that the issue has strained relations between the two neighbors . bildunterschrift : numerous children were among the ethnic germans expelled from a polish detention camp to germany in 1950 .
an estimated 2.5 million ethnic germans were expelled or fled from poland shortly before the end of world war ii . many of them who lost property and homes when poland 's borders shifted westwards after the war are calling for compensation from poland through organizations and lawyers . the issue has created huge resentment in poland , particularly since the country 's entry to the european union last may .
most poles believe that the german losses pale into insignificance compared to the deaths of more than six million poles after adolf hitler 's army invaded the country in 1939 . a breath of fresh air the debate , which is marked by high emotions and painful memories of the survivors and their families , has often taken on a bitter tone with some ethnic germans threatening to take their claims for repatriations to polish and european courts . the fate of the expelled ethnic german refugees from eastern europe is occasionally exploited by different groups to extract political mileage . but , now a new book by german journalist and poland expert helga hirsch has been hailed as a breath of fresh air in the ongoing debate .
called " schweres gepäck " or " heavy baggage " , the book completely avoids the thorny issue of reparations and instead allows the children and grandchildren of seven ethnic german families expelled from poland , to express their feelings and memories on the subject . the result is a very personal and yet sober account of persons , who often have no own memories of expulsion and flight , but who still suffer under the burden of searching for their own identities . breaking the silence hirsch , whose own father came from present-day poland , told deutsche welle that the most difficult thing about the issue was breaking the silence over it .
" a fair punishment for the suffering that germany caused in europe " is how many children of expelled ethnic germans who grew up in postwar germany came to view and accept the issue , hirsch said .
germans were simply not viewed as victims , she added . hirsch , who 's aware that she 's treading controversial ground with her book , said that a further problem when it came to the issue was the fact that for a long time in germany there was a process of coming to grips with collective guilt , but not with suffering . " today 's generation as opposed to the 1968 one , has a general tendency to look carefully at their own families and try to determine what 's there , " said hirsch .
" we 've now learnt that both guilt and suffering can co-exist in a family .
it demands great psychological skills to endure this ambivalence - and i experience it as a great progress . " an important contribution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudeten germans refugees wait to board one of the trains at klingenthal station in czechoslovakia in sept .
1938 the book is seen as an important contribution to the ongoing dispute between both germany and poland as well as germany and the czech republic . hirsch , however , is clear that not all ethnic germans support the idea of demanding reparations .
she has thus also started a signature campaign against compensation claims and so far managed to get 70 prominent ethnic german expellees on board . " i find it -lrb- demand for compensation -rrb- horrible in our relationship to poland and i want to make a public gesture that those demanding reparations are n't all the ethnic germans , " hirsch said .
" for poland the issue is important … and i notice when i 'm there that such a gesture from the germans gives an important signal to the poles : we respect and consider your fears . " hirsch said she hoped the process of coming to grips with the suffering of the expelled ethnic germans would someday take hold in poland and the czech republic too .
but she remained clear that the process should in no manner be driven by the german side . elena beier -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland , germany vow to squash reparations claims german chancellor gerhard schröder and polish prime minister marek belka appealed to the common sense of those germans and poles currently trying to revive a debate about world war ii reparation claims .

" despite the optimism , there 's no denying that the issue has strained relations between the two neighbors . bildunterschrift : numerous children were among the ethnic germans expelled from a polish detention camp to germany in 1950 .
an estimated 2.5 million ethnic germans were expelled or fled from poland shortly before the end of world war ii . many of them who lost property and homes when poland 's borders shifted westwards after the war are calling for compensation from poland through organizations and lawyers . the issue has created huge resentment in poland , particularly since the country 's entry to the european union last may .
most poles believe that the german losses pale into insignificance compared to the deaths of more than six million poles after adolf hitler 's army invaded the country in 1939 . a breath of fresh air the debate , which is marked by high emotions and painful memories of the survivors and their families , has often taken on a bitter tone with some ethnic germans threatening to take their claims for repatriations to polish and european courts . the fate of the expelled ethnic german refugees from eastern europe is occasionally exploited by different groups to extract political mileage . but , now a new book by german journalist and poland expert helga hirsch has been hailed as a breath of fresh air in the ongoing debate .
called " schweres gepäck " or " heavy baggage " , the book completely avoids the thorny issue of reparations and instead allows the children and grandchildren of seven ethnic german families expelled from poland , to express their feelings and memories on the subject . the result is a very personal and yet sober account of persons , who often have no own memories of expulsion and flight , but who still suffer under the burden of searching for their own identities . breaking the silence hirsch , whose own father came from present-day poland , told deutsche welle that the most difficult thing about the issue was breaking the silence over it .
" a fair punishment for the suffering that germany caused in europe " is how many children of expelled ethnic germans who grew up in postwar germany came to view and accept the issue , hirsch said .
germans were simply not viewed as victims , she added . hirsch , who 's aware that she 's treading controversial ground with her book , said that a further problem when it came to the issue was the fact that for a long time in germany there was a process of coming to grips with collective guilt , but not with suffering . " today 's generation as opposed to the 1968 one , has a general tendency to look carefully at their own families and try to determine what 's there , " said hirsch .
" we 've now learnt that both guilt and suffering can co-exist in a family .
it demands great psychological skills to endure this ambivalence - and i experience it as a great progress . " an important contribution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudeten germans refugees wait to board one of the trains at klingenthal station in czechoslovakia in sept .
1938 the book is seen as an important contribution to the ongoing dispute between both germany and poland as well as germany and the czech republic . hirsch , however , is clear that not all ethnic germans support the idea of demanding reparations .
she has thus also started a signature campaign against compensation claims and so far managed to get 70 prominent ethnic german expellees on board . " i find it -lrb- demand for compensation -rrb- horrible in our relationship to poland and i want to make a public gesture that those demanding reparations are n't all the ethnic germans , " hirsch said .
" for poland the issue is important … and i notice when i 'm there that such a gesture from the germans gives an important signal to the poles : we respect and consider your fears . " hirsch said she hoped the process of coming to grips with the suffering of the expelled ethnic germans would someday take hold in poland and the czech republic too .

on monday merkel suffered yet another blow as her choice for a prominent party post refused to take up the vacancy .
two of her closest allies in the party leadership said at the weekend that recent political mishaps , including a forced about-face on plans for a populist campaign against turkey ’ s eu bid , didn ’ t come entirely out of the blue .
they speculated that a group of party barons from western germany were bent on ousting merkel – who is from eastern germany – in an attempt to level the playing field for their own ambitions to become the conservatives ' candidate for the chancellorship .
merkel plays down alleged ouster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is not known for giving up things without a fight but merkel appeared calm and composed on monday , putting a brave face on allegations that there was a putsch underway to oust her .
but merkel brushed aside such concerns , saying this was not the time to play political games .
" against the background of economic decline which is again looming large in this country , the entire cdu presidium refused to discuss such allegations , " she told reporters .
" so this debate has come to an end before it actually started . "
string of setbacks yet merkel has had to endure a spell of dramatic setbacks in recent weeks raising questions about the cdu leader ’ s strategies and the strength of her leadership .
her blunders include a series of heavy losses at recent state and local polls , the resignation of a key cdu parliamentary figure , and unresolved policy quarrels with its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .

merkel now claims schäuble refused because he felt more comfortable with foreign politics .
" this is not at all the dramatic error i ’ m said to have committed , " she said .
" i don ’ t think it is anything unusual that wolfgang schäuble refused my offer because he believes that he is more valuable to the party in his current post as the party ’ s foreign affairs expert .
so i don ’ t see this as a big deal at all . "
fear of chaos political observers , however , see this as yet another indication that scores are currently being settled within the cdu which are undermining merkel ’ s position as the undisputed ruler of the conservatives .

" the cdu would be well advised to decide about the conservative candidacy this year already .

a crucial cdu party congress to be held in early december will show how strong angela merkel ’ s grip on the conservatives still is , as delegates will be voting on a controversial health care reform plan .

fed up with the inconvenient curved shape of bananas , a berlin resident has dreamt up a way to straighten this staple of the fruit bowl , even applying to have his banana-straightening method patented . karl-friedrich lentze thinks he 's on to the biggest thing since sliced bread - the straight banana .
or as he prefers to call it , the " cigar-banana . " the 56-year old social welfare recipient has developed a method to take away the yellow-skinned fruit 's distinctive curve . " depending on the degree of the curve , chunks will be cut out of the banana , which will then be bound back together using biologically safe bandages , " lentze explained to the german tabloid bild . the curvy chunks wo n't go to waste .
lentze 's plan involves either drying them or using them in fruit salad . " after a certain introduction time , the straight cigar-banana will drive the curved banana from the market , " lentze said .
" it 's easier to eat , and easier to store . " patent pending lentze is so convinced is of his idea 's potential , that he 's applied for a patent at the german patent office in munich .
his application is supported by sketches showing how bananas will be carried along on a conveyor belt while robots chop out the curvy bits . if trends in japan are anything to go by , lentze 's idea could well bear fruit .

an odd collection of new friends they are indeed that europe , the us and germany have gathered together since the sept .
11 attacks .
the selection revolves around economic and strategic interests , and preferably both , but not human rights .
that is the dangerous thing about these new friends , the paper said : " they are dictatorships with a total disregard for human life , and no one knows whether this trust that the west has placed in them will not some day be abused - see saddam hussein . "
of course , germany , europe and the us are looking to stabilize a world gone awry and secure the supply of natural resources .
but , the paper emphasized , the question is whether handling these countries at arm ’ s length would n't be better for our credibility ?
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung turned its attention to what a number of german media outlets believe is a conspiracy within the christian democratic union to discredit and topple party leader angela merkel .
the paper didn ´ t seem concerned about the cdu ’ s upcoming party conference in düsseldorf .
merkel , the paper said , has simply declared that meeting as hers .
there are no lack of calls from within the party to settle the open chancellor candidate question for 2006 right now and in her favor .
if this is what a loss of authority looks like , the paper noted , then angela merkel has nothing to worry about .
cologne ’ s stadt-anzeiger , on the other hand , saw the power question in the cdu moving toward a climax .
merkel can not let the inner-party debate about her leadership abilities , which some people are calling an intrigue , continue .
it is bad for her image and that of the party as a whole , the paper said .
the critical voices are increasing , even among merkel ’ s allies , the paper noted .
the cdu lacks guidance and is in danger of losing the public ’ s faith in its ability to govern .
the leipziger volkszeitung pointed to the heavy-handed criticism of merkel from german business leaders , talked of intrigue and demanded from germany ’ s liberal free democrats to settle the opposition ’ s chancellor candidate issue as an obvious sign that the party conference in december could end up being a palace revolt .
the crisis in the cdu resembles the chaos theory , wrote the saarbrücker zeitung - it has a life of its own and can not be controlled .
angela merkel , the paper said , no longer holds the reins in her hands .
helplessly she has to watch as the arduously constructed image of the cdu as a competent alternative implodes .
the cdu thinks the bavarian sister party , csu , is at fault , but that diagnosis is too simple , the paper thought .
instead , too many bad choices have been made or no choices at all .
bonn ’ s general-anzeiger noted that merkel has lost a lot of public support .
people want a party that demonstrates its members have closed ranks , but the cdu and csu are anything but that .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's economic woes gloom deepens over german economy opinion : blame the managers , not the country negotiations at opel continue deal reached at karstadtquelle business -pipe- 18.10.2004 both sides dig in for long fight in opel stand-off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : families joined striking opel workers on the fifth day of protests managers and workers representatives at german car maker opel met on monday to resolve the bitter stand-off over proposed mass redundancies .
as negotiations continued , neither side was giving ground . workers at car maker opel halted production at a factory in bochum , north west germany , for the fifth day in a row on monday in continuing protest against plans by the group 's us parent general motors ' to slash thousands of jobs in europe . but with every sign that both sides were prepared to dig their heels in over the escalating labor conflict , politicians urged employees to end the wildcat strikes and hold constructive talks with management to negotiate the long-term future of the site . the assembly lines at bochum were silent for the fifth day in a row on monday , as workers , ignoring calls by the government and opel 's general works council for a return to work , voted unanimously to stay outside the factory gates . economy minister wolfgang clement warned that the workers ' hard-line stance could jeopardize the crucial restructuring talks between management and unions which began in opel 's headquarters in rüsselsheim on monday . " employees who stand in front of the gates will not improve the chances of safeguarding the plant , " clement said .
he could understand the workers ' point of view , " but that does change my opinion that it is wrong " , the minister said . government spokesman bela anda urged employees to talk constructively with management so as not to weaken the bochum site in the long run . regional premier calls for calm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to gm : keep the bochum plant alive , " reads the sign .
peer steinbrueck , the regional premier of the state of north rhine-westphalia , where bochum is based , also called for calm .
steinbrueck said he could understand workers ' anger , but striking would not help .
" if we want to have a long-term perspective for the bochum site and avoid compulsory redundancies , we have to remain level-headed and professional in the way we go about finding a solution , " he said . the head of the general works council at opel , klaus franz , took a similar tack .
he told the business daily handelsblatt that the work stoppages at bochum were understandable from an emotional point of view .
but the action could jeopardize negotiations between management and unions . " we need an intelligent strategy on the part of workers that entails both negotiation and fight , " he said .
franz was optimistic that a solution could be found , but he warned : " let there be no illusion - we wo n't be able to get around compulsory redundancies . " bochum workers claim self-defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum workers refuse to go back to work .
the workers at bochum , however , remained adamant .
" it 's self-defense , " said the head of bochum 's works council lothar marquardt .
" people are afraid for their livelihood . "
production at bochum has been halted since thursday . the work stoppages in bochum were already having a knock-on effect on supply of parts used to build opel 's astra model at factories elsewhere in europe , marquardt said .
a europe-wide stoppage could cost general motors € 10-30 million -lrb- $ 12-37 million -rrb- a day , he said . a labor expert in munich , volker rieble , dubbed the stoppages wildcat strikes , since the unions had not officially called for them and they were not directly connected with concrete wage demands .
as such , the wildcat strikes are illegal under germany 's labor laws . do n't expect rapid results , says negotiator a spokesman for opel cautioned the talks that began between union and management on monday were not likely to yield any rapid results .
a timeframe and the size of the cost cuts had to be established first , he said , declining to provide any details about the exact venue or the anticipated length of the first round of talks . last thursday , general motors said it planned to slash 12,000 jobs in europe - or around one fifth of its workforce in the region - in an attempt to steer its european operations back into profit after six years of losses . most of the cuts would be made in germany , with the plants in bochum and in rüsselsheim in the main line of fire . unions and employee representatives have called workers at all gm sites in europe to take part in demonstrations and protest marches on tuesday . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opel employees stage work stoppages production halted friday at the bochum factory of troubled german car maker opel as workers laid down tools for the second day in a row in protest against cuts .

" the decision to pursue an individual must remain in the national domain , and we do not support plans like the creation of a european prosecutor , " a junior british home office minister , caroline flint , told her parliament recently . france however has moved closer to the once controversial german position that a european police force should have a broader mandate across the european union . exchanges of information the five governments have regularly exchanged information on suspected terrorist activities since agreeing to do so at their first meeting in spain in may last year . the ministers will also discuss how to assist the european union 's newest members to tackle organized crime networks in their countries . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , italy push ahead on asylum centers despite a lukewarm reception in the eu , berlin and rome intend to press ahead with a controversial plan to create holding asylum camps for european-bound migrants in north africa as a means to combat illegal immigration .

" despite the optimism , there 's no denying that the issue has strained relations between the two neighbors . bildunterschrift : numerous children were among the ethnic germans expelled from a polish detention camp to germany in 1950 .
an estimated 2.5 million ethnic germans were expelled or fled from poland shortly before the end of world war ii . many of them who lost property and homes when poland 's borders shifted westwards after the war are calling for compensation from poland through organizations and lawyers . the issue has created huge resentment in poland , particularly since the country 's entry to the european union last may .
most poles believe that the german losses pale into insignificance compared to the deaths of more than six million poles after adolf hitler 's army invaded the country in 1939 . a breath of fresh air the debate , which is marked by high emotions and painful memories of the survivors and their families , has often taken on a bitter tone with some ethnic germans threatening to take their claims for repatriations to polish and european courts . the fate of the expelled ethnic german refugees from eastern europe is occasionally exploited by different groups to extract political mileage . but , now a new book by german journalist and poland expert helga hirsch has been hailed as a breath of fresh air in the ongoing debate .
called " schweres gepäck " or " heavy baggage " , the book completely avoids the thorny issue of reparations and instead allows the children and grandchildren of seven ethnic german families expelled from poland , to express their feelings and memories on the subject . the result is a very personal and yet sober account of persons , who often have no own memories of expulsion and flight , but who still suffer under the burden of searching for their own identities . breaking the silence hirsch , whose own father came from present-day poland , told deutsche welle that the most difficult thing about the issue was breaking the silence over it .
" a fair punishment for the suffering that germany caused in europe " is how many children of expelled ethnic germans who grew up in postwar germany came to view and accept the issue , hirsch said .
germans were simply not viewed as victims , she added . hirsch , who 's aware that she 's treading controversial ground with her book , said that a further problem when it came to the issue was the fact that for a long time in germany there was a process of coming to grips with collective guilt , but not with suffering . " today 's generation as opposed to the 1968 one , has a general tendency to look carefully at their own families and try to determine what 's there , " said hirsch .
" we 've now learnt that both guilt and suffering can co-exist in a family .
it demands great psychological skills to endure this ambivalence - and i experience it as a great progress . " an important contribution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudeten germans refugees wait to board one of the trains at klingenthal station in czechoslovakia in sept .
1938 the book is seen as an important contribution to the ongoing dispute between both germany and poland as well as germany and the czech republic . hirsch , however , is clear that not all ethnic germans support the idea of demanding reparations .
she has thus also started a signature campaign against compensation claims and so far managed to get 70 prominent ethnic german expellees on board . " i find it -lrb- demand for compensation -rrb- horrible in our relationship to poland and i want to make a public gesture that those demanding reparations are n't all the ethnic germans , " hirsch said .
" for poland the issue is important … and i notice when i 'm there that such a gesture from the germans gives an important signal to the poles : we respect and consider your fears . " hirsch said she hoped the process of coming to grips with the suffering of the expelled ethnic germans would someday take hold in poland and the czech republic too .
but she remained clear that the process should in no manner be driven by the german side . elena beier -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland , germany vow to squash reparations claims german chancellor gerhard schröder and polish prime minister marek belka appealed to the common sense of those germans and poles currently trying to revive a debate about world war ii reparation claims .

" despite the optimism , there 's no denying that the issue has strained relations between the two neighbors . bildunterschrift : numerous children were among the ethnic germans expelled from a polish detention camp to germany in 1950 .
an estimated 2.5 million ethnic germans were expelled or fled from poland shortly before the end of world war ii . many of them who lost property and homes when poland 's borders shifted westwards after the war are calling for compensation from poland through organizations and lawyers . the issue has created huge resentment in poland , particularly since the country 's entry to the european union last may .
most poles believe that the german losses pale into insignificance compared to the deaths of more than six million poles after adolf hitler 's army invaded the country in 1939 . a breath of fresh air the debate , which is marked by high emotions and painful memories of the survivors and their families , has often taken on a bitter tone with some ethnic germans threatening to take their claims for repatriations to polish and european courts . the fate of the expelled ethnic german refugees from eastern europe is occasionally exploited by different groups to extract political mileage . but , now a new book by german journalist and poland expert helga hirsch has been hailed as a breath of fresh air in the ongoing debate .
called " schweres gepäck " or " heavy baggage " , the book completely avoids the thorny issue of reparations and instead allows the children and grandchildren of seven ethnic german families expelled from poland , to express their feelings and memories on the subject . the result is a very personal and yet sober account of persons , who often have no own memories of expulsion and flight , but who still suffer under the burden of searching for their own identities . breaking the silence hirsch , whose own father came from present-day poland , told deutsche welle that the most difficult thing about the issue was breaking the silence over it .
" a fair punishment for the suffering that germany caused in europe " is how many children of expelled ethnic germans who grew up in postwar germany came to view and accept the issue , hirsch said .
germans were simply not viewed as victims , she added . hirsch , who 's aware that she 's treading controversial ground with her book , said that a further problem when it came to the issue was the fact that for a long time in germany there was a process of coming to grips with collective guilt , but not with suffering . " today 's generation as opposed to the 1968 one , has a general tendency to look carefully at their own families and try to determine what 's there , " said hirsch .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.10.2004 merkel scotches rumors of power struggle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has sought to play down the recent turbulence within her party germany ’ s conservative party leader angela merkel has brushed aside allegations that some senior members of her christian democratic union are plotting against her in an effort to unseat her as party chairwoman . at the weekend some of merkel ’ s key conservative allies said that a series of political blunders committed by merkel recently were secretly masterminded by merkel ’ s inner-party rivals who want to prevent the cdu leader from becoming the next conservative candidate in the race for the chancellorship in 2006 .
on monday merkel suffered yet another blow as her choice for a prominent party post refused to take up the vacancy .
two of her closest allies in the party leadership said at the weekend that recent political mishaps , including a forced about-face on plans for a populist campaign against turkey ’ s eu bid , didn ’ t come entirely out of the blue .
they speculated that a group of party barons from western germany were bent on ousting merkel – who is from eastern germany – in an attempt to level the playing field for their own ambitions to become the conservatives ' candidate for the chancellorship .
merkel plays down alleged ouster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is not known for giving up things without a fight but merkel appeared calm and composed on monday , putting a brave face on allegations that there was a putsch underway to oust her .
but merkel brushed aside such concerns , saying this was not the time to play political games .
" against the background of economic decline which is again looming large in this country , the entire cdu presidium refused to discuss such allegations , " she told reporters .
" so this debate has come to an end before it actually started . "
string of setbacks yet merkel has had to endure a spell of dramatic setbacks in recent weeks raising questions about the cdu leader ’ s strategies and the strength of her leadership .
her blunders include a series of heavy losses at recent state and local polls , the resignation of a key cdu parliamentary figure , and unresolved policy quarrels with its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble merkel ’ s inner-party troubles were compounded on monday , after wolfgang schäuble -lrb- photo -rrb- refused to take up merkel ’ s offer of becoming the cdu ‘ s influential finance and economics spokesman in parliament .
merkel now claims schäuble refused because he felt more comfortable with foreign politics .
" this is not at all the dramatic error i ’ m said to have committed , " she said .
" i don ’ t think it is anything unusual that wolfgang schäuble refused my offer because he believes that he is more valuable to the party in his current post as the party ’ s foreign affairs expert .
so i don ’ t see this as a big deal at all . "
fear of chaos political observers , however , see this as yet another indication that scores are currently being settled within the cdu which are undermining merkel ’ s position as the undisputed ruler of the conservatives .
and already the cdu ’ s traditional allies and long-time junior partners in coalition governments – the liberal free democrats -lrb- gdp -rrb- – are beginning to worry .
" i think that unresolved power and personality issues are clearly behind those discussions , " said fdp leader guido westerwelle .
" the cdu would be well advised to decide about the conservative candidacy this year already .
otherwise i fear there is going to be never-ending chaos within the party which will tarnish our reputation among the electorate . "
a crucial cdu party congress to be held in early december will show how strong angela merkel ’ s grip on the conservatives still is , as delegates will be voting on a controversial health care reform plan .
overwhelming support for her proposals would also send a clear signal to her conservative foes that merkel may have stumbled , but will not fall . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel facing inner-party coup ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's economic woes gloom deepens over german economy opinion : blame the managers , not the country negotiations at opel continue deal reached at karstadtquelle business -pipe- 18.10.2004 both sides dig in for long fight in opel stand-off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : families joined striking opel workers on the fifth day of protests managers and workers representatives at german car maker opel met on monday to resolve the bitter stand-off over proposed mass redundancies .
as negotiations continued , neither side was giving ground . workers at car maker opel halted production at a factory in bochum , north west germany , for the fifth day in a row on monday in continuing protest against plans by the group 's us parent general motors ' to slash thousands of jobs in europe . but with every sign that both sides were prepared to dig their heels in over the escalating labor conflict , politicians urged employees to end the wildcat strikes and hold constructive talks with management to negotiate the long-term future of the site . the assembly lines at bochum were silent for the fifth day in a row on monday , as workers , ignoring calls by the government and opel 's general works council for a return to work , voted unanimously to stay outside the factory gates . economy minister wolfgang clement warned that the workers ' hard-line stance could jeopardize the crucial restructuring talks between management and unions which began in opel 's headquarters in rüsselsheim on monday . " employees who stand in front of the gates will not improve the chances of safeguarding the plant , " clement said .
he could understand the workers ' point of view , " but that does change my opinion that it is wrong " , the minister said . government spokesman bela anda urged employees to talk constructively with management so as not to weaken the bochum site in the long run . regional premier calls for calm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " to gm : keep the bochum plant alive , " reads the sign .
peer steinbrueck , the regional premier of the state of north rhine-westphalia , where bochum is based , also called for calm .
steinbrueck said he could understand workers ' anger , but striking would not help .
" if we want to have a long-term perspective for the bochum site and avoid compulsory redundancies , we have to remain level-headed and professional in the way we go about finding a solution , " he said . the head of the general works council at opel , klaus franz , took a similar tack .
he told the business daily handelsblatt that the work stoppages at bochum were understandable from an emotional point of view .
but the action could jeopardize negotiations between management and unions . " we need an intelligent strategy on the part of workers that entails both negotiation and fight , " he said .
franz was optimistic that a solution could be found , but he warned : " let there be no illusion - we wo n't be able to get around compulsory redundancies . " bochum workers claim self-defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum workers refuse to go back to work .
the workers at bochum , however , remained adamant .
" it 's self-defense , " said the head of bochum 's works council lothar marquardt .
" people are afraid for their livelihood . "
production at bochum has been halted since thursday . the work stoppages in bochum were already having a knock-on effect on supply of parts used to build opel 's astra model at factories elsewhere in europe , marquardt said .
a europe-wide stoppage could cost general motors € 10-30 million -lrb- $ 12-37 million -rrb- a day , he said . a labor expert in munich , volker rieble , dubbed the stoppages wildcat strikes , since the unions had not officially called for them and they were not directly connected with concrete wage demands .
as such , the wildcat strikes are illegal under germany 's labor laws . do n't expect rapid results , says negotiator a spokesman for opel cautioned the talks that began between union and management on monday were not likely to yield any rapid results .
a timeframe and the size of the cost cuts had to be established first , he said , declining to provide any details about the exact venue or the anticipated length of the first round of talks . last thursday , general motors said it planned to slash 12,000 jobs in europe - or around one fifth of its workforce in the region - in an attempt to steer its european operations back into profit after six years of losses . most of the cuts would be made in germany , with the plants in bochum and in rüsselsheim in the main line of fire . unions and employee representatives have called workers at all gm sites in europe to take part in demonstrations and protest marches on tuesday . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opel employees stage work stoppages production halted friday at the bochum factory of troubled german car maker opel as workers laid down tools for the second day in a row in protest against cuts .

as negotiations continued , neither side was giving ground . workers at car maker opel halted production at a factory in bochum , north west germany , for the fifth day in a row on monday in continuing protest against plans by the group 's us parent general motors ' to slash thousands of jobs in europe . but with every sign that both sides were prepared to dig their heels in over the escalating labor conflict , politicians urged employees to end the wildcat strikes and hold constructive talks with management to negotiate the long-term future of the site . the assembly lines at bochum were silent for the fifth day in a row on monday , as workers , ignoring calls by the government and opel 's general works council for a return to work , voted unanimously to stay outside the factory gates . economy minister wolfgang clement warned that the workers ' hard-line stance could jeopardize the crucial restructuring talks between management and unions which began in opel 's headquarters in rüsselsheim on monday . " employees who stand in front of the gates will not improve the chances of safeguarding the plant , " clement said .

" if we want to have a long-term perspective for the bochum site and avoid compulsory redundancies , we have to remain level-headed and professional in the way we go about finding a solution , " he said . the head of the general works council at opel , klaus franz , took a similar tack .
he told the business daily handelsblatt that the work stoppages at bochum were understandable from an emotional point of view .
but the action could jeopardize negotiations between management and unions . " we need an intelligent strategy on the part of workers that entails both negotiation and fight , " he said .

" people are afraid for their livelihood . "
production at bochum has been halted since thursday . the work stoppages in bochum were already having a knock-on effect on supply of parts used to build opel 's astra model at factories elsewhere in europe , marquardt said .
a europe-wide stoppage could cost general motors € 10-30 million -lrb- $ 12-37 million -rrb- a day , he said . a labor expert in munich , volker rieble , dubbed the stoppages wildcat strikes , since the unions had not officially called for them and they were not directly connected with concrete wage demands .
as such , the wildcat strikes are illegal under germany 's labor laws . do n't expect rapid results , says negotiator a spokesman for opel cautioned the talks that began between union and management on monday were not likely to yield any rapid results .
a timeframe and the size of the cost cuts had to be established first , he said , declining to provide any details about the exact venue or the anticipated length of the first round of talks . last thursday , general motors said it planned to slash 12,000 jobs in europe - or around one fifth of its workforce in the region - in an attempt to steer its european operations back into profit after six years of losses . most of the cuts would be made in germany , with the plants in bochum and in rüsselsheim in the main line of fire . unions and employee representatives have called workers at all gm sites in europe to take part in demonstrations and protest marches on tuesday . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opel employees stage work stoppages production halted friday at the bochum factory of troubled german car maker opel as workers laid down tools for the second day in a row in protest against cuts .

a europe-wide stoppage could cost general motors € 10-30 million -lrb- $ 12-37 million -rrb- a day , he said . a labor expert in munich , volker rieble , dubbed the stoppages wildcat strikes , since the unions had not officially called for them and they were not directly connected with concrete wage demands .
as such , the wildcat strikes are illegal under germany 's labor laws . do n't expect rapid results , says negotiator a spokesman for opel cautioned the talks that began between union and management on monday were not likely to yield any rapid results .
a timeframe and the size of the cost cuts had to be established first , he said , declining to provide any details about the exact venue or the anticipated length of the first round of talks . last thursday , general motors said it planned to slash 12,000 jobs in europe - or around one fifth of its workforce in the region - in an attempt to steer its european operations back into profit after six years of losses . most of the cuts would be made in germany , with the plants in bochum and in rüsselsheim in the main line of fire . unions and employee representatives have called workers at all gm sites in europe to take part in demonstrations and protest marches on tuesday . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opel employees stage work stoppages production halted friday at the bochum factory of troubled german car maker opel as workers laid down tools for the second day in a row in protest against cuts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.10.2004 german press review : internal conflicts german editorials on monday concerned themselves with the apparent power struggle in the country ’ s conservative christian democratic union and commented on chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s visit to libya . strange bedfellows , wrote the stuttgarter zeitung after the german chancellor ’ s visit to libya ’ s strongman , moammar gadhafi .
an odd collection of new friends they are indeed that europe , the us and germany have gathered together since the sept .
11 attacks .
the selection revolves around economic and strategic interests , and preferably both , but not human rights .
that is the dangerous thing about these new friends , the paper said : " they are dictatorships with a total disregard for human life , and no one knows whether this trust that the west has placed in them will not some day be abused - see saddam hussein . "
of course , germany , europe and the us are looking to stabilize a world gone awry and secure the supply of natural resources .
but , the paper emphasized , the question is whether handling these countries at arm ’ s length would n't be better for our credibility ?
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung turned its attention to what a number of german media outlets believe is a conspiracy within the christian democratic union to discredit and topple party leader angela merkel .
the paper didn ´ t seem concerned about the cdu ’ s upcoming party conference in düsseldorf .
merkel , the paper said , has simply declared that meeting as hers .
there are no lack of calls from within the party to settle the open chancellor candidate question for 2006 right now and in her favor .
if this is what a loss of authority looks like , the paper noted , then angela merkel has nothing to worry about .
cologne ’ s stadt-anzeiger , on the other hand , saw the power question in the cdu moving toward a climax .
merkel can not let the inner-party debate about her leadership abilities , which some people are calling an intrigue , continue .
it is bad for her image and that of the party as a whole , the paper said .
the critical voices are increasing , even among merkel ’ s allies , the paper noted .
the cdu lacks guidance and is in danger of losing the public ’ s faith in its ability to govern .
the leipziger volkszeitung pointed to the heavy-handed criticism of merkel from german business leaders , talked of intrigue and demanded from germany ’ s liberal free democrats to settle the opposition ’ s chancellor candidate issue as an obvious sign that the party conference in december could end up being a palace revolt .
the crisis in the cdu resembles the chaos theory , wrote the saarbrücker zeitung - it has a life of its own and can not be controlled .
angela merkel , the paper said , no longer holds the reins in her hands .
helplessly she has to watch as the arduously constructed image of the cdu as a competent alternative implodes .
the cdu thinks the bavarian sister party , csu , is at fault , but that diagnosis is too simple , the paper thought .
instead , too many bad choices have been made or no choices at all .
bonn ’ s general-anzeiger noted that merkel has lost a lot of public support .
people want a party that demonstrates its members have closed ranks , but the cdu and csu are anything but that .
chancellor schröder , at least , has stuck to his guns , the paper said , even though there is still the risk of failure . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

between now and 4 november , nearly two million voters in the north east can decide whether they would like an elected regional assembly .
originally , referendums were planned in the north west and yorkshire and humberside too , but in july the government announced it was postponing them because of problems with postal voting in those areas .
the decision was attacked as a cynical move to avoid contests in the two regions least likely to deliver a yes vote .
labour mps in both areas were also nervous about a no vote just months ahead of a likely general election .
region reborn so why is the north east thought to be the region most likely to say yes ?
for years now the region has complained that its remoteness from whitehall has meant it losing out on investment and funding .
quick guide uk devolution now that its scottish neighbours have their own parliament and tax-raising powers , that feeling of isolation is even more intense .
to outsiders , the rejuvenated tyneside , with the award-winning millennium bridge and baltic mill art gallery , gives the impression of a region reborn after long years of industrial decline .
the successful nissan plant in sunderland is another symbol of regrowth .
but on almost every measure - household income , output per head and health - it still lags behind other english regions .
it 's a prize the region must grasp professor john tomaney yes campaigner professor john tomaney , the newcastle academic who has been one of the main driving forces for a regional assembly , believes it would give the region the tools to bring in more investment and develop home-grown industries .
" it 's a prize the region must grasp , " he says .
but will an assembly have the powers to accomplish it ?
it would have a budget of around £ 500m - mostly inherited from transferred government functions - and influence over a further £ 500m .
it would control where investment goes for affordable housing and become the new fire and rescue authority .
but it would have no powers over the health service , police or transport .
cynical local government expert tony travers compares the proposed assembly to a christmas tree : " that is , it 's completely bare when you buy it , but with the hope you can buy interesting things - in this case new services - to hang on it . "
yes campaigners accept the powers are not all they would want , but argue that once established , the assembly could accrue more functions .
the draft assemblies bill allows this to happen without new legislation .
john prescott says he is committed to regional assemblies but the perceived weakness of the assembly has been something of a gift for opponents .
while the yes camp boasts celebrity supporters such as brendan foster , the star of the no campaign is an inflatable white elephant which they are parading around the region .
this , and the burning of fake £ 20 notes , is their way of saying that the assembly would be no more than an expensive talking shop .
at a public debate in hexham - one of several in the region organised by the journal newspaper - the issue of cost of the assembly was a major concern for older voters .
many were cynical about claims the running costs would only amount to an extra 5p a week in council tax for a band d home .
the yes camp have countered with reassurances that the assembly 's tax-raising powers would be limited by capping .
they have emphasized that , unlike scotland and wales , they will not be pushing for an expensive new headquarters .
the assembly - probably to be based in durham - is more likely to rent empty offices in the city .
how to govern ?
but as well as the battle over the need for an assembly , there is another big issue confronting voters in the counties of durham and northumberland .
on their ballot papers they will find a second question , asking them which new form of local government they would like for their area .
that is because the government has insisted that if an assembly is approved , the two-tier system of county and district councils must be reduced to one .
voters will have to choose between a unitary system based on the county council , or one where the county council is scrapped and services run by amalgamated districts .
in either case , many councillors would disappear and some argue this would make local government more remote .
much is riding on the result of this referendum .
if voters deliver a decisive yes to a regional assembly it could give a fillip to campaigns in the other regions .
but if they say no it would be a heavy blow for deputy prime minister john prescott , who has been the main cheerleader for regional devolution , and many believe it could be the kiss of death for the whole experiment .
your comments what a lot of whingers in here .
yes , parliaments cost money to run .
the question should be over what powers regional governments take back from an over-centralised westminster to help foster real democracy in this country .
but it seems that , as with other public services , the british want their democracy on the cheap !
well we 'll get what we pay for .
neil gall , edinburgh , scotland the idea of basing government and providing government services close to where people live and work is quite evidently a good one .
the uk needs to become more regionalised , and a north east assembly -lrb- delivered properly -rrb- would undoubtedly be a boost .
but -lrb- and it 's a big one -rrb- is n't the assembly in its current form simply a way of funnelling taxpayers money into labour heartlands with little benefit to anyone other than 2nd rate politicians .
the devil , as they say , is in the detail .
alistair t , durham , uk the north-east must grasp this opportunity to compete on equal terms with the capit chris smith , london , uk i am originally from teesside .
living in london i have observed two things .
firstly , i have seen the great benefits to london of an assembly and mayor with democratic legitimacy who can directly promote the interests of the region .
the north-east must grasp this opportunity to compete on equal terms with the capital .
secondly , i am appalled by the manner in which the south-east casually exerts its economic , political and cultural power upon the rest of the country .
if the north-east votes yes it will begin the process of correcting this ridiculous concentration of influence within the m25 .
north-easterners can run the north-east better than overpaid civil servants from berkshire .
chris smith , london , uk why the rush to separate the people of britain into regions ?
why the rush to abandon britain as a country , in favour of a european super state ?
what we really need is a constitution between the people of britain and their elected officials before there can be any constitution with other countries .
the government should comprise of elected men and women who , in the best interests of all the people , should administer the affairs of the nation .
this is the 21st century and it is high time for politicians to understand they work for the people , not the other way around .
democracy is a wonderful idea , perhaps we will see it in action one day .
dave , rudyard , england enough signatures have been raised in cornwall to meet the requirements of a referendum .
however this has been ignored by westminster and the county has instead been ignobly lumped into an enlarged region that seems to take in every county west of berkshire .
so instead of small populations gaining a voice through a local assembly , they will end up drowning in a sea of interest groups vying for attention from the controllers of the super region .
paul parsons , truro , england definitely not !
what 's needed is an english parliament .
barbara , northampton it 's the old story " divide and rule " !
split up the nation into regions and then play one off against the other .
why not have a referendum for everyone in england on whether there should be an england parliament ?
i guess the answer would be " yes " , but i believe the government are frightened that a single english parliament would be too strong to manage .
then again , should not everyone in england be asked if part of their country should be devolved ?
it will affect people outside the region too !
colin woodley , oxford having been born and bred in the north east , nothing had prepared me for the moment of graduating from university only to find -lrb- and to my horror -rrb- there are very few job opportunities in the north east !
so i begrudgingly up sticks and moved down south .
had the opportunities been available to me to remain in the north east , i would never have moved away from all my family and friends .
if the north east referendum can prevent the next generation from moving away from their homes in search of a career , then surely this a worth while cause ?
maria , oxford , england speaking as a northerner currently ensconced in london , i have to say i am in favour of the regional parliaments .
london has successfully devolved and has introduced a number of locally specific measures like the congestion charge that have significantly improved life in the capital .
if the regional assemblies can do something similar then they will prove successful .
writing as a civil servant i can also say that the more localised the tier of government is , the more efficient it will prove to be .
leon hughes , london , england it 's just another waste of resources , parliament just needs to give more consideration to the north - we do n't need devolution .
we 've seen an uptake in regional development companies spending european money but more needs to be given to the north east , more needs to be done to attract graduates from our universities to stay in the region , more needs to be done to encourage small business growth , house prices are starting to become phenomenal , problem is , wages are n't growing to accommodate , end result ?
we ca n't afford to buy homes .
andrew taylor , sunderland , uk we are hoping that our friends in the north will stop the balkanisation of england dead in its tracks .
these artificial ' regions ' represent nothing other the administrative convenience of the eu combined the opportunity to abolish england by stealth .
what is on offer is regionalism not devolution - few if any powers will be given up by the liberal cosmopolitan ruling elite at westminster .
instead they will be taken from existing local councils .
the region will not have powers comparable to the scottish parliament or even the welsh assembly .
it 's time , to paraphrase the scottish daily record , for the people of england to rise and be a nation again .
ian campbell , leatherhead england a yes vote in the north east will only allow all the ' usual suspects ' to set up another expensive talking shop to further their own interests and all this at our cost .
we do n't trust our local politicians and quangos to run things today so why should we trust them tomorrow ?
tw , newcastle i ca n't believe people are actually fighting against giving themselves more power duncan thorp , edinburgh , scotland it 's a real shame that so many people seem to be missing the point about english regional assemblies .
yes of course prescott has made a mess of it and yes the planned assemblies are flawed - but it 's a start .
i ca n't believe people are actually fighting against giving themselves more power and taking it way from the government !
in scotland we have actually taken responsibility for ourselves and seen westminster centralisation drain away .
to those who oppose devolution in their region : please do n't ever complain about the government again when you actually had the chance to do something about it .
duncan thorp , edinburgh , scotland the day the whitehall machine really gives up true powers in favour of the regions , any regions , is the day i 'll vote " yes " to a regional assembly .
until then , i 'll live with the tiers of government we have got - right down to the " ward committees " telling me -lrb- asking me ? -rrb- where i want the pooper scoopers to be sited in my neighbourhood .
michael , york , uk rather than a regional assembly , why ca n't we choose to vote for an english parliament or assembly as they have in scotland and wales ?
mark palmer , hull , england we ca n't afford this regional assembly malcolm c , durham , uk under no circumstances do i want to see this happening , it is a con .
how can the government expect us to believe that this is for the better after failing to deliver on education , crime , public services , etc .
although , i would say it 's a foregone conclusion knowing how strong labour is supported in my area .
this is another part of the preparation for full entry in the eu .
we are part of a national society , this move is trying to get back to " the good old days " where we are born , taught , work and die in our own local village .
that died a long time ago , unfortunately , along with the community spirit and industry for this ideal .
it will cost us more and i want to keep what little i have in my pocket , i pay more than enough in tax already .
we ca n't afford this regional assembly .
do n't do it !
malcolm c , durham , uk more bureaucracy , more tax , more politicians , more waste .
how many tiers of government do we need ?
royston smith , southampton hampshire if it 's not broke , do n't fix it !
just look at the mess we have in scotland for messing with a system that has worked until people want change for change sake or to try to make a name for themselves !
neil trotter , cleethorpes .
n.e lincolnshire why not follow the wonderful eu example and every 4 weeks move the whole parliament to newcastle and let the mps see for themselves ?
bill reynolds , whitley bay , tyne & wear i have found the overwhelming benefit of devolution is representation .
it might not seem like much , but being able to contact a number of different mp / msps -lrb- as well as meps -rrb- that directly represent you is very reassuring .
devolution in the english regions would be fantastic for the people living there , especially if a pr system similar to scotland 's is used .
it does mean more bureaucracy and will be expensive , but in my opinion it is a small price to pay for a more democratic uk .
robin , fife , scotland we in the north west have already told prescott where to get off on his devolution plans .
we view it more like westminster trying to wash its hands of any responsibility for our region , that mixed in with the fact that the govt split our region up 35 years ago in the first place does not inspire confidence in this bunch .
chris , preston , uk another talking shop ian hunter , whitby , england another talking shop , another round of council tax increases to pay for it .
we do not want it , mr.prescott !
ian hunter , whitby , england the prime minister , deputy prime minister the new labour party election supremo and several experienced local mps - what a travesty that they ca n't effectively represent the needs of the north east - surely that 's why they were elected - no more jobs for the boys in this labour stronghold please !

between now and 4 november , nearly two million voters in the north east can decide whether they would like an elected regional assembly .
originally , referendums were planned in the north west and yorkshire and humberside too , but in july the government announced it was postponing them because of problems with postal voting in those areas .
the decision was attacked as a cynical move to avoid contests in the two regions least likely to deliver a yes vote .
labour mps in both areas were also nervous about a no vote just months ahead of a likely general election .
region reborn so why is the north east thought to be the region most likely to say yes ?
for years now the region has complained that its remoteness from whitehall has meant it losing out on investment and funding .
quick guide uk devolution now that its scottish neighbours have their own parliament and tax-raising powers , that feeling of isolation is even more intense .
to outsiders , the rejuvenated tyneside , with the award-winning millennium bridge and baltic mill art gallery , gives the impression of a region reborn after long years of industrial decline .
the successful nissan plant in sunderland is another symbol of regrowth .
but on almost every measure - household income , output per head and health - it still lags behind other english regions .
it 's a prize the region must grasp professor john tomaney yes campaigner professor john tomaney , the newcastle academic who has been one of the main driving forces for a regional assembly , believes it would give the region the tools to bring in more investment and develop home-grown industries .
" it 's a prize the region must grasp , " he says .
but will an assembly have the powers to accomplish it ?
it would have a budget of around £ 500m - mostly inherited from transferred government functions - and influence over a further £ 500m .
it would control where investment goes for affordable housing and become the new fire and rescue authority .
but it would have no powers over the health service , police or transport .
cynical local government expert tony travers compares the proposed assembly to a christmas tree : " that is , it 's completely bare when you buy it , but with the hope you can buy interesting things - in this case new services - to hang on it . "
yes campaigners accept the powers are not all they would want , but argue that once established , the assembly could accrue more functions .
the draft assemblies bill allows this to happen without new legislation .
john prescott says he is committed to regional assemblies but the perceived weakness of the assembly has been something of a gift for opponents .
while the yes camp boasts celebrity supporters such as brendan foster , the star of the no campaign is an inflatable white elephant which they are parading around the region .
this , and the burning of fake £ 20 notes , is their way of saying that the assembly would be no more than an expensive talking shop .
at a public debate in hexham - one of several in the region organised by the journal newspaper - the issue of cost of the assembly was a major concern for older voters .
many were cynical about claims the running costs would only amount to an extra 5p a week in council tax for a band d home .
the yes camp have countered with reassurances that the assembly 's tax-raising powers would be limited by capping .
they have emphasized that , unlike scotland and wales , they will not be pushing for an expensive new headquarters .
the assembly - probably to be based in durham - is more likely to rent empty offices in the city .
how to govern ?
but as well as the battle over the need for an assembly , there is another big issue confronting voters in the counties of durham and northumberland .
on their ballot papers they will find a second question , asking them which new form of local government they would like for their area .
that is because the government has insisted that if an assembly is approved , the two-tier system of county and district councils must be reduced to one .
voters will have to choose between a unitary system based on the county council , or one where the county council is scrapped and services run by amalgamated districts .
in either case , many councillors would disappear and some argue this would make local government more remote .
much is riding on the result of this referendum .
if voters deliver a decisive yes to a regional assembly it could give a fillip to campaigns in the other regions .
but if they say no it would be a heavy blow for deputy prime minister john prescott , who has been the main cheerleader for regional devolution , and many believe it could be the kiss of death for the whole experiment .
your comments what a lot of whingers in here .
yes , parliaments cost money to run .
the question should be over what powers regional governments take back from an over-centralised westminster to help foster real democracy in this country .
but it seems that , as with other public services , the british want their democracy on the cheap !
well we 'll get what we pay for .
neil gall , edinburgh , scotland the idea of basing government and providing government services close to where people live and work is quite evidently a good one .
the uk needs to become more regionalised , and a north east assembly -lrb- delivered properly -rrb- would undoubtedly be a boost .
but -lrb- and it 's a big one -rrb- is n't the assembly in its current form simply a way of funnelling taxpayers money into labour heartlands with little benefit to anyone other than 2nd rate politicians .
the devil , as they say , is in the detail .
alistair t , durham , uk the north-east must grasp this opportunity to compete on equal terms with the capit chris smith , london , uk i am originally from teesside .
living in london i have observed two things .
firstly , i have seen the great benefits to london of an assembly and mayor with democratic legitimacy who can directly promote the interests of the region .
the north-east must grasp this opportunity to compete on equal terms with the capital .
secondly , i am appalled by the manner in which the south-east casually exerts its economic , political and cultural power upon the rest of the country .
if the north-east votes yes it will begin the process of correcting this ridiculous concentration of influence within the m25 .
north-easterners can run the north-east better than overpaid civil servants from berkshire .
chris smith , london , uk why the rush to separate the people of britain into regions ?
why the rush to abandon britain as a country , in favour of a european super state ?
what we really need is a constitution between the people of britain and their elected officials before there can be any constitution with other countries .
the government should comprise of elected men and women who , in the best interests of all the people , should administer the affairs of the nation .
this is the 21st century and it is high time for politicians to understand they work for the people , not the other way around .
democracy is a wonderful idea , perhaps we will see it in action one day .
dave , rudyard , england enough signatures have been raised in cornwall to meet the requirements of a referendum .
however this has been ignored by westminster and the county has instead been ignobly lumped into an enlarged region that seems to take in every county west of berkshire .

colin woodley , oxford having been born and bred in the north east , nothing had prepared me for the moment of graduating from university only to find -lrb- and to my horror -rrb- there are very few job opportunities in the north east !
so i begrudgingly up sticks and moved down south .
had the opportunities been available to me to remain in the north east , i would never have moved away from all my family and friends .
if the north east referendum can prevent the next generation from moving away from their homes in search of a career , then surely this a worth while cause ?
maria , oxford , england speaking as a northerner currently ensconced in london , i have to say i am in favour of the regional parliaments .
london has successfully devolved and has introduced a number of locally specific measures like the congestion charge that have significantly improved life in the capital .
if the regional assemblies can do something similar then they will prove successful .
writing as a civil servant i can also say that the more localised the tier of government is , the more efficient it will prove to be .
leon hughes , london , england it 's just another waste of resources , parliament just needs to give more consideration to the north - we do n't need devolution .
we 've seen an uptake in regional development companies spending european money but more needs to be given to the north east , more needs to be done to attract graduates from our universities to stay in the region , more needs to be done to encourage small business growth , house prices are starting to become phenomenal , problem is , wages are n't growing to accommodate , end result ?
we ca n't afford to buy homes .
andrew taylor , sunderland , uk we are hoping that our friends in the north will stop the balkanisation of england dead in its tracks .
these artificial ' regions ' represent nothing other the administrative convenience of the eu combined the opportunity to abolish england by stealth .
what is on offer is regionalism not devolution - few if any powers will be given up by the liberal cosmopolitan ruling elite at westminster .
instead they will be taken from existing local councils .
the region will not have powers comparable to the scottish parliament or even the welsh assembly .
it 's time , to paraphrase the scottish daily record , for the people of england to rise and be a nation again .
ian campbell , leatherhead england a yes vote in the north east will only allow all the ' usual suspects ' to set up another expensive talking shop to further their own interests and all this at our cost .
we do n't trust our local politicians and quangos to run things today so why should we trust them tomorrow ?
tw , newcastle i ca n't believe people are actually fighting against giving themselves more power duncan thorp , edinburgh , scotland it 's a real shame that so many people seem to be missing the point about english regional assemblies .
yes of course prescott has made a mess of it and yes the planned assemblies are flawed - but it 's a start .
i ca n't believe people are actually fighting against giving themselves more power and taking it way from the government !
in scotland we have actually taken responsibility for ourselves and seen westminster centralisation drain away .
to those who oppose devolution in their region : please do n't ever complain about the government again when you actually had the chance to do something about it .
duncan thorp , edinburgh , scotland the day the whitehall machine really gives up true powers in favour of the regions , any regions , is the day i 'll vote " yes " to a regional assembly .
until then , i 'll live with the tiers of government we have got - right down to the " ward committees " telling me -lrb- asking me ? -rrb- where i want the pooper scoopers to be sited in my neighbourhood .
michael , york , uk rather than a regional assembly , why ca n't we choose to vote for an english parliament or assembly as they have in scotland and wales ?
mark palmer , hull , england we ca n't afford this regional assembly malcolm c , durham , uk under no circumstances do i want to see this happening , it is a con .
how can the government expect us to believe that this is for the better after failing to deliver on education , crime , public services , etc .
although , i would say it 's a foregone conclusion knowing how strong labour is supported in my area .
this is another part of the preparation for full entry in the eu .
we are part of a national society , this move is trying to get back to " the good old days " where we are born , taught , work and die in our own local village .
that died a long time ago , unfortunately , along with the community spirit and industry for this ideal .
it will cost us more and i want to keep what little i have in my pocket , i pay more than enough in tax already .
we ca n't afford this regional assembly .
do n't do it !
malcolm c , durham , uk more bureaucracy , more tax , more politicians , more waste .
how many tiers of government do we need ?
royston smith , southampton hampshire if it 's not broke , do n't fix it !
just look at the mess we have in scotland for messing with a system that has worked until people want change for change sake or to try to make a name for themselves !
neil trotter , cleethorpes .
n.e lincolnshire why not follow the wonderful eu example and every 4 weeks move the whole parliament to newcastle and let the mps see for themselves ?
bill reynolds , whitley bay , tyne & wear i have found the overwhelming benefit of devolution is representation .
it might not seem like much , but being able to contact a number of different mp / msps -lrb- as well as meps -rrb- that directly represent you is very reassuring .
devolution in the english regions would be fantastic for the people living there , especially if a pr system similar to scotland 's is used .
it does mean more bureaucracy and will be expensive , but in my opinion it is a small price to pay for a more democratic uk .
robin , fife , scotland we in the north west have already told prescott where to get off on his devolution plans .
we view it more like westminster trying to wash its hands of any responsibility for our region , that mixed in with the fact that the govt split our region up 35 years ago in the first place does not inspire confidence in this bunch .
chris , preston , uk another talking shop ian hunter , whitby , england another talking shop , another round of council tax increases to pay for it .
we do not want it , mr.prescott !
ian hunter , whitby , england the prime minister , deputy prime minister the new labour party election supremo and several experienced local mps - what a travesty that they ca n't effectively represent the needs of the north east - surely that 's why they were elected - no more jobs for the boys in this labour stronghold please !

between now and 4 november , nearly two million voters in the north east can decide whether they would like an elected regional assembly .
originally , referendums were planned in the north west and yorkshire and humberside too , but in july the government announced it was postponing them because of problems with postal voting in those areas .
the decision was attacked as a cynical move to avoid contests in the two regions least likely to deliver a yes vote .
labour mps in both areas were also nervous about a no vote just months ahead of a likely general election .
region reborn so why is the north east thought to be the region most likely to say yes ?
for years now the region has complained that its remoteness from whitehall has meant it losing out on investment and funding .
quick guide uk devolution now that its scottish neighbours have their own parliament and tax-raising powers , that feeling of isolation is even more intense .
to outsiders , the rejuvenated tyneside , with the award-winning millennium bridge and baltic mill art gallery , gives the impression of a region reborn after long years of industrial decline .
the successful nissan plant in sunderland is another symbol of regrowth .
but on almost every measure - household income , output per head and health - it still lags behind other english regions .
it 's a prize the region must grasp professor john tomaney yes campaigner professor john tomaney , the newcastle academic who has been one of the main driving forces for a regional assembly , believes it would give the region the tools to bring in more investment and develop home-grown industries .
" it 's a prize the region must grasp , " he says .
but will an assembly have the powers to accomplish it ?
it would have a budget of around £ 500m - mostly inherited from transferred government functions - and influence over a further £ 500m .
it would control where investment goes for affordable housing and become the new fire and rescue authority .
but it would have no powers over the health service , police or transport .
cynical local government expert tony travers compares the proposed assembly to a christmas tree : " that is , it 's completely bare when you buy it , but with the hope you can buy interesting things - in this case new services - to hang on it . "
yes campaigners accept the powers are not all they would want , but argue that once established , the assembly could accrue more functions .
the draft assemblies bill allows this to happen without new legislation .
john prescott says he is committed to regional assemblies but the perceived weakness of the assembly has been something of a gift for opponents .
while the yes camp boasts celebrity supporters such as brendan foster , the star of the no campaign is an inflatable white elephant which they are parading around the region .
this , and the burning of fake £ 20 notes , is their way of saying that the assembly would be no more than an expensive talking shop .
at a public debate in hexham - one of several in the region organised by the journal newspaper - the issue of cost of the assembly was a major concern for older voters .
many were cynical about claims the running costs would only amount to an extra 5p a week in council tax for a band d home .
the yes camp have countered with reassurances that the assembly 's tax-raising powers would be limited by capping .
they have emphasized that , unlike scotland and wales , they will not be pushing for an expensive new headquarters .
the assembly - probably to be based in durham - is more likely to rent empty offices in the city .
how to govern ?
but as well as the battle over the need for an assembly , there is another big issue confronting voters in the counties of durham and northumberland .
on their ballot papers they will find a second question , asking them which new form of local government they would like for their area .
that is because the government has insisted that if an assembly is approved , the two-tier system of county and district councils must be reduced to one .
voters will have to choose between a unitary system based on the county council , or one where the county council is scrapped and services run by amalgamated districts .
in either case , many councillors would disappear and some argue this would make local government more remote .
much is riding on the result of this referendum .
if voters deliver a decisive yes to a regional assembly it could give a fillip to campaigns in the other regions .
but if they say no it would be a heavy blow for deputy prime minister john prescott , who has been the main cheerleader for regional devolution , and many believe it could be the kiss of death for the whole experiment .
your comments what a lot of whingers in here .
yes , parliaments cost money to run .
the question should be over what powers regional governments take back from an over-centralised westminster to help foster real democracy in this country .
but it seems that , as with other public services , the british want their democracy on the cheap !
well we 'll get what we pay for .
neil gall , edinburgh , scotland the idea of basing government and providing government services close to where people live and work is quite evidently a good one .
the uk needs to become more regionalised , and a north east assembly -lrb- delivered properly -rrb- would undoubtedly be a boost .
but -lrb- and it 's a big one -rrb- is n't the assembly in its current form simply a way of funnelling taxpayers money into labour heartlands with little benefit to anyone other than 2nd rate politicians .
the devil , as they say , is in the detail .
alistair t , durham , uk the north-east must grasp this opportunity to compete on equal terms with the capit chris smith , london , uk i am originally from teesside .
living in london i have observed two things .
firstly , i have seen the great benefits to london of an assembly and mayor with democratic legitimacy who can directly promote the interests of the region .
the north-east must grasp this opportunity to compete on equal terms with the capital .
secondly , i am appalled by the manner in which the south-east casually exerts its economic , political and cultural power upon the rest of the country .
if the north-east votes yes it will begin the process of correcting this ridiculous concentration of influence within the m25 .
north-easterners can run the north-east better than overpaid civil servants from berkshire .
chris smith , london , uk why the rush to separate the people of britain into regions ?
why the rush to abandon britain as a country , in favour of a european super state ?
what we really need is a constitution between the people of britain and their elected officials before there can be any constitution with other countries .
the government should comprise of elected men and women who , in the best interests of all the people , should administer the affairs of the nation .
this is the 21st century and it is high time for politicians to understand they work for the people , not the other way around .
democracy is a wonderful idea , perhaps we will see it in action one day .
dave , rudyard , england enough signatures have been raised in cornwall to meet the requirements of a referendum .
however this has been ignored by westminster and the county has instead been ignobly lumped into an enlarged region that seems to take in every county west of berkshire .
so instead of small populations gaining a voice through a local assembly , they will end up drowning in a sea of interest groups vying for attention from the controllers of the super region .
paul parsons , truro , england definitely not !
what 's needed is an english parliament .
barbara , northampton it 's the old story " divide and rule " !
split up the nation into regions and then play one off against the other .
why not have a referendum for everyone in england on whether there should be an england parliament ?
i guess the answer would be " yes " , but i believe the government are frightened that a single english parliament would be too strong to manage .
then again , should not everyone in england be asked if part of their country should be devolved ?
it will affect people outside the region too !
colin woodley , oxford having been born and bred in the north east , nothing had prepared me for the moment of graduating from university only to find -lrb- and to my horror -rrb- there are very few job opportunities in the north east !

the city council is due take charge later this week of the £ 10m braunstone leisure centre , which includes two swimming pools , a gym and sports hall .
the centre was created as a replacement for granby halls and st margaret 's baths which closed four years ago .
