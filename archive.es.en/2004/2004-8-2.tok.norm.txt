the eu 's new commission president has offered the next german commissioner , günter verheugen , the industry portfolio - a position short of what berlin had hoped for . according to german news magazine focus , newly named eu commission president josé manuel durão barroso has suggested that günter verheugen , who is currently responsible for enlargement , be moved to industry starting in november .
this falls short of the influential economic post that german chancellor gerhard schröder had been pushing for .
in the last few weeks the german leader had made no secret of his expectations of seeing a fellow countrymen head up a powerful commission and had run amiss with barroso , who said he did not appoint commissioners at the behest of any one country .
instead , the big posts , such as competition and internal markets , are expected to go the new french and british commissioners .
the announcement met with disappointment not only within schröder 's government , but among the german opposition as well .
" that is a lightweight commissioner and falls well below our expectations , " said christian social union 's economics expert hans michelbach about the industry portfolio .
24 vacancies to fill but nothing has been set in stone .
barroso has said that he will present his team of 24 commissioners towards the end of august , leaving several denominators up in the air .
the president has already made clear that he does not want any first and second class commissioners on his team - a reference to germany 's demands for a high profile " super commissioner " - and has called for at least eight women to head up the various eu executive offices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former portuguese premier jose manuel barroso takes over from romano prodi as the eu 's new commission president barroso had also called on member states to make his job easier by proposing more than one candidate from which he can choose .

the eu 's new commission president has offered the next german commissioner , günter verheugen , the industry portfolio - a position short of what berlin had hoped for . according to german news magazine focus , newly named eu commission president josé manuel durão barroso has suggested that günter verheugen , who is currently responsible for enlargement , be moved to industry starting in november .
this falls short of the influential economic post that german chancellor gerhard schröder had been pushing for .
in the last few weeks the german leader had made no secret of his expectations of seeing a fellow countrymen head up a powerful commission and had run amiss with barroso , who said he did not appoint commissioners at the behest of any one country .
instead , the big posts , such as competition and internal markets , are expected to go the new french and british commissioners .
the announcement met with disappointment not only within schröder 's government , but among the german opposition as well .
" that is a lightweight commissioner and falls well below our expectations , " said christian social union 's economics expert hans michelbach about the industry portfolio .
24 vacancies to fill but nothing has been set in stone .
barroso has said that he will present his team of 24 commissioners towards the end of august , leaving several denominators up in the air .
the president has already made clear that he does not want any first and second class commissioners on his team - a reference to germany 's demands for a high profile " super commissioner " - and has called for at least eight women to head up the various eu executive offices .

the eu 's new commission president has offered the next german commissioner , günter verheugen , the industry portfolio - a position short of what berlin had hoped for . according to german news magazine focus , newly named eu commission president josé manuel durão barroso has suggested that günter verheugen , who is currently responsible for enlargement , be moved to industry starting in november .
this falls short of the influential economic post that german chancellor gerhard schröder had been pushing for .
in the last few weeks the german leader had made no secret of his expectations of seeing a fellow countrymen head up a powerful commission and had run amiss with barroso , who said he did not appoint commissioners at the behest of any one country .
instead , the big posts , such as competition and internal markets , are expected to go the new french and british commissioners .
the announcement met with disappointment not only within schröder 's government , but among the german opposition as well .
" that is a lightweight commissioner and falls well below our expectations , " said christian social union 's economics expert hans michelbach about the industry portfolio .
24 vacancies to fill but nothing has been set in stone .
barroso has said that he will present his team of 24 commissioners towards the end of august , leaving several denominators up in the air .
the president has already made clear that he does not want any first and second class commissioners on his team - a reference to germany 's demands for a high profile " super commissioner " - and has called for at least eight women to head up the various eu executive offices .

when a group of computer scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent germany 's first e-mail 20 years ago , they had no idea they were heralding in the digital age . even though it has only been a part of our collective consciousness for the last decade , for most people life without e-mail would be unimaginable .
in both the business and private spheres , e-mail has long become part of our daily fabric .
but what is an obvious part of daily life today was practically unthinkable 20 years ago when information scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent the first german e-mail .
at that time , understated internet pioneer werner zorn described the event as a " very exciting , " development .
on august 2 , 1984 , zorn and a colleague sent the first-ever german e-mail .
it was his response to the official welcoming e-mail from csnet , a united states-developed electronic communication platform for scientists .
clicking into history it was a mouse click of historical importance .
if the senders of the electronic mail had had any clue how important the event was , they probably would have opened a bottle of champagne .
" we first learned the importance of august 2 later on , " zorn told the german news agency ddp .
back then , zorn 's e-mail address was simple to remember : zorn @ germany .
" what was new technologically at the time was that this was part of an open computer network , " he recalled .
the standardized interface made it possible for more and more people to get connected , and ultimately the technology would usurp the outmoded idea of centrally administered networks .
at the time , karlsruhe became the main mode for e-mails being sent to and from germany after it signed a contract with csnet .
with the opening of the node , germany became the fourth country to become part of the network , following canada , sweden and israel .
in germany , the network eased the work of scientists who needed to communicate with one another .
the country 's prestigious fraunhofer and max planck institutes were the first customers , followed quickly by major industrial companies like siemens and basf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has given germans an instant connection with the rest of the world .
with the working title of " interconnection through networks , " the computer scientists began their work on bringing the internet to germany in 1982 as part of a federal project to build a research network .
zorn and the professors and students around him were given the responsibility not only of connecting germany to international networks but also for making it available to individual scientists who needed access to the collective knowledge of others around the world .
after two years of work , the first successful test came on august 2 , 1984 .
trouble in paradise - for a minute zorn 's success also ran into some unexpected resistance - mainly from institutions that saw the work being done in karlsruhe as unwanted competition .
one consequence was that the university stopped receiving financial assistance for the project .
but it did n't matter much - the development was so widely accepted and adopted that the university made enough money installing mail connections for other organizations that it could ensure the project 's survival .
the full shift to the internet came in 1989 , bringing the first direct internet connections between germany and the us .
today the main internet servers in germany are still hosted in karlsruhe at the firm schlund and partner , where more the 3 million internet domains are managed - more domains than in any other european country .
life before wormy spam the internet certainly changed life for many in germany , but it also brought real problems with it , like spam , which would become such a huge pest 20 years later that it would cause billions of euros in damages for european companies and threaten the utility of e-mail for many .
mass spams are also often used to spread worms and other viruses across the internet .

but they all know its electronic doppelgänger .
anti-virus software-maker mcafee said firms are forced to spend up to € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- a year to prevent and eliminate virus and junk e-mail attacks .
the german government - which found itself under attack in may , logging 510,000 unwanted e-mails in just one week - allocates about € 7 million of its € 32 billion annual it budget for security .
under a european union directive , all member states are required to pass stringent privacy laws that make spam a crime .
but in may , the european commission criticized germany for not doing enough , legally , to stop its spread .
the country 's strict data protection laws have so far made it difficult for politicians to tackle the problem of e-mail .

when a group of computer scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent germany 's first e-mail 20 years ago , they had no idea they were heralding in the digital age . even though it has only been a part of our collective consciousness for the last decade , for most people life without e-mail would be unimaginable .
in both the business and private spheres , e-mail has long become part of our daily fabric .
but what is an obvious part of daily life today was practically unthinkable 20 years ago when information scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent the first german e-mail .
at that time , understated internet pioneer werner zorn described the event as a " very exciting , " development .
on august 2 , 1984 , zorn and a colleague sent the first-ever german e-mail .
it was his response to the official welcoming e-mail from csnet , a united states-developed electronic communication platform for scientists .
clicking into history it was a mouse click of historical importance .
if the senders of the electronic mail had had any clue how important the event was , they probably would have opened a bottle of champagne .
" we first learned the importance of august 2 later on , " zorn told the german news agency ddp .
back then , zorn 's e-mail address was simple to remember : zorn @ germany .
" what was new technologically at the time was that this was part of an open computer network , " he recalled .
the standardized interface made it possible for more and more people to get connected , and ultimately the technology would usurp the outmoded idea of centrally administered networks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.08.2004 preventing new perpetrators großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each year , about 20,000 german children are sexually abused while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focussed on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators . standing in a swimming-pool and surrounded by children , he could sense the others eyeing him suspiciously .
he felt as if a huge slippery ball was floating on the water in front of him , a ball he was struggling to submerge so that no one else could see his shame .
losing control over his life because of his sexual fantasies involving children , the man sought help from christoph joseph ahlers , who works as a clinical psychologist and sexual therapist at the institute for sexology and sexual medicine at berlin 's charite hospital .
at the time , ahlers informed him that specialized treatments exist .
unfortunately , however , the institute did n't have enough funds nor the manpower to offer therapy , he regretted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : little help has been available so far for those seeking it " we can tell people what they have , we can tell them what can be done , but we can not do anything , " ahlers told dw-world .
" we have to send people back on the street without treatment . "
preventing new victims that 's bound to change now that the institute has secured private funding for a unique project to treat pedophiles before they end up in a courtroom , and before they are caught molesting a child .
starting in january , ahlers and his colleagues hope to sign up 120 people for the three-year program .
it 's a significant step , because by and large potential perpetrators - people who sense they have sexual fantasies involving children - have been off the radar screen .
therapy money primarily flows into victim 's groups and the treatment of imprisoned sex offenders .
although a german government initiative has set aside money for a 2005 project that will work with teenage offenders , it resembles previous programs in that most of the participants have already come to attention as child abusers .
" we 're just starting to be aware of the problem and are still lacking adequate perpetrator prevention programs , " said kai sachs , the executive director of the german society against child abuse and neglect , which advises professionals who deal with cases of child abuse .
according to him , the berlin project could provide data that might help jump-start similar programs elsewhere .
ahlers is already convinced that early intervention could help prevent the suffering of the 550 german children , who are sexually abused each day , according to the federal criminal police office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the program prevent the abuse of more children ?
" in the end it 's about victims and the prevention of new victims , " ahlers stressed , adding that few therapists are qualified or interested in taking on people with sexual fantasies about children .
" we 're doing this to protect children and help the patients , " he maintained .
" we want to prove that they are patients , that they can be treated and that the treatment helps , " he said .
will people sign up ?
while welcoming the new project , others questioned whether enough people would sign up for the treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely that convicted child abuser and murderer marc dutroux would have sought treatment " the question is : ' how do you reach them , " ' michael osterheider , the director of the department of forensic psychiatry and psychotherapy at the university of regensburg , told dw-world .
he noted that some pedophiles are convinced that they are doing nothing wrong and would like to see sex between adults and children legalized .
ahlers countered that he was not worried about finding participants , because the project targets pedophiles who suffer from their sexual desire and are looking for help .
" they are waiting for treatment , " he said .
" we 're trying to offer something where there was no help before . "
the berlin institute plans to launch a publicity campaign with newspaper ads in the fall to alert people to the program .
" we hope to appeal to all those who have realized that children play a role in their sexual fantasies , " ahlers said .
promoting responsibility during the project , participants will be split in three groups : in addition to a control group , which will not receive treatment right away , one section will receive group therapy and those people in another will engage in one-on-one therapy .
the sessions are geared to helping people identify their own sexuality and begin accepting the way they are , ahlers said , describing the treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whispering children " they have to learn that they bear no guilt for their feelings , but that they are responsible for their actions , " he said , explaining that patients had to learn to stop mistaking children 's behavior as sexual overtures .
during the therapy , patients are required to talk about their sexual desires and can receive medication that lowers their sex drive .
all participants must also sign an agreement , promising not to have sexual contact with children .
helping , not protecting that 's a promise that 's hard to police , argued georg kohaupt , a member of the executive committee of the federation of child protection centers in germany , which also offers some help for sex offenders .
" there can be no absolute protection of confidence as far as i 'm concerned , " kohaupt told dw-world , adding that he 's seen cases were people continue to have sexual contact with children during treatment .
" if it were that simple for them to stop , they would not need therapy , " kohaupt said .
but ahlers said that a certain level of trust between patient and therapist was necessary to start treatment in the first place .
participants who do n't comply with the abstinence rule would be asked to leave the program , he said .
he noted that while german therapists are prohibited by law from reporting patients to the police for crimes they reveal during therapy , participants in the program would be no more protected than anyone else .
" they still face the same prosecution by law enforcement authorities as before , " he said , adding that the only realistic therapeutic goal is to help people regain control over their sexual desires at all times .

polish leaders had expected the german chancellor to take a clear stance on such restitution claims , and amid the odd whistle and boo from the crowd he lived up to anticipations : " we germans know full well who started the war and who were its first victims , " schröder said acknowledging the nazi atrocities in poland and added that because of german 's blame there was no longer room left for discussing restitution claims which " turn history on its head . "

polish leaders had expected the german chancellor to take a clear stance on such restitution claims , and amid the odd whistle and boo from the crowd he lived up to anticipations : " we germans know full well who started the war and who were its first victims , " schröder said acknowledging the nazi atrocities in poland and added that because of german 's blame there was no longer room left for discussing restitution claims which " turn history on its head . "
" property issues related to world war ii are no longer a subject of controversy between our two governments .
neither the german government nor any other serious political force supports any restitution claims still being voiced .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.08.2004 preventing new perpetrators großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each year , about 20,000 german children are sexually abused while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focussed on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators . standing in a swimming-pool and surrounded by children , he could sense the others eyeing him suspiciously .
he felt as if a huge slippery ball was floating on the water in front of him , a ball he was struggling to submerge so that no one else could see his shame .
losing control over his life because of his sexual fantasies involving children , the man sought help from christoph joseph ahlers , who works as a clinical psychologist and sexual therapist at the institute for sexology and sexual medicine at berlin 's charite hospital .
at the time , ahlers informed him that specialized treatments exist .
unfortunately , however , the institute did n't have enough funds nor the manpower to offer therapy , he regretted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : little help has been available so far for those seeking it " we can tell people what they have , we can tell them what can be done , but we can not do anything , " ahlers told dw-world .
" we have to send people back on the street without treatment . "
preventing new victims that 's bound to change now that the institute has secured private funding for a unique project to treat pedophiles before they end up in a courtroom , and before they are caught molesting a child .
starting in january , ahlers and his colleagues hope to sign up 120 people for the three-year program .
it 's a significant step , because by and large potential perpetrators - people who sense they have sexual fantasies involving children - have been off the radar screen .
therapy money primarily flows into victim 's groups and the treatment of imprisoned sex offenders .
although a german government initiative has set aside money for a 2005 project that will work with teenage offenders , it resembles previous programs in that most of the participants have already come to attention as child abusers .
" we 're just starting to be aware of the problem and are still lacking adequate perpetrator prevention programs , " said kai sachs , the executive director of the german society against child abuse and neglect , which advises professionals who deal with cases of child abuse .
according to him , the berlin project could provide data that might help jump-start similar programs elsewhere .
ahlers is already convinced that early intervention could help prevent the suffering of the 550 german children , who are sexually abused each day , according to the federal criminal police office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the program prevent the abuse of more children ?
" in the end it 's about victims and the prevention of new victims , " ahlers stressed , adding that few therapists are qualified or interested in taking on people with sexual fantasies about children .
" we 're doing this to protect children and help the patients , " he maintained .
" we want to prove that they are patients , that they can be treated and that the treatment helps , " he said .
will people sign up ?
while welcoming the new project , others questioned whether enough people would sign up for the treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely that convicted child abuser and murderer marc dutroux would have sought treatment " the question is : ' how do you reach them , " ' michael osterheider , the director of the department of forensic psychiatry and psychotherapy at the university of regensburg , told dw-world .
he noted that some pedophiles are convinced that they are doing nothing wrong and would like to see sex between adults and children legalized .
ahlers countered that he was not worried about finding participants , because the project targets pedophiles who suffer from their sexual desire and are looking for help .
" they are waiting for treatment , " he said .
" we 're trying to offer something where there was no help before . "
the berlin institute plans to launch a publicity campaign with newspaper ads in the fall to alert people to the program .
" we hope to appeal to all those who have realized that children play a role in their sexual fantasies , " ahlers said .
promoting responsibility during the project , participants will be split in three groups : in addition to a control group , which will not receive treatment right away , one section will receive group therapy and those people in another will engage in one-on-one therapy .
the sessions are geared to helping people identify their own sexuality and begin accepting the way they are , ahlers said , describing the treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whispering children " they have to learn that they bear no guilt for their feelings , but that they are responsible for their actions , " he said , explaining that patients had to learn to stop mistaking children 's behavior as sexual overtures .
during the therapy , patients are required to talk about their sexual desires and can receive medication that lowers their sex drive .
all participants must also sign an agreement , promising not to have sexual contact with children .
helping , not protecting that 's a promise that 's hard to police , argued georg kohaupt , a member of the executive committee of the federation of child protection centers in germany , which also offers some help for sex offenders .
" there can be no absolute protection of confidence as far as i 'm concerned , " kohaupt told dw-world , adding that he 's seen cases were people continue to have sexual contact with children during treatment .
" if it were that simple for them to stop , they would not need therapy , " kohaupt said .
but ahlers said that a certain level of trust between patient and therapist was necessary to start treatment in the first place .
participants who do n't comply with the abstinence rule would be asked to leave the program , he said .
he noted that while german therapists are prohibited by law from reporting patients to the police for crimes they reveal during therapy , participants in the program would be no more protected than anyone else .
" they still face the same prosecution by law enforcement authorities as before , " he said , adding that the only realistic therapeutic goal is to help people regain control over their sexual desires at all times .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whispering children " they have to learn that they bear no guilt for their feelings , but that they are responsible for their actions , " he said , explaining that patients had to learn to stop mistaking children 's behavior as sexual overtures .
during the therapy , patients are required to talk about their sexual desires and can receive medication that lowers their sex drive .
all participants must also sign an agreement , promising not to have sexual contact with children .
helping , not protecting that 's a promise that 's hard to police , argued georg kohaupt , a member of the executive committee of the federation of child protection centers in germany , which also offers some help for sex offenders .
" there can be no absolute protection of confidence as far as i 'm concerned , " kohaupt told dw-world , adding that he 's seen cases were people continue to have sexual contact with children during treatment .
" if it were that simple for them to stop , they would not need therapy , " kohaupt said .
but ahlers said that a certain level of trust between patient and therapist was necessary to start treatment in the first place .
participants who do n't comply with the abstinence rule would be asked to leave the program , he said .
he noted that while german therapists are prohibited by law from reporting patients to the police for crimes they reveal during therapy , participants in the program would be no more protected than anyone else .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.08.2004 preventing new perpetrators großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each year , about 20,000 german children are sexually abused while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focussed on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators . standing in a swimming-pool and surrounded by children , he could sense the others eyeing him suspiciously .
he felt as if a huge slippery ball was floating on the water in front of him , a ball he was struggling to submerge so that no one else could see his shame .
losing control over his life because of his sexual fantasies involving children , the man sought help from christoph joseph ahlers , who works as a clinical psychologist and sexual therapist at the institute for sexology and sexual medicine at berlin 's charite hospital .
at the time , ahlers informed him that specialized treatments exist .
unfortunately , however , the institute did n't have enough funds nor the manpower to offer therapy , he regretted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : little help has been available so far for those seeking it " we can tell people what they have , we can tell them what can be done , but we can not do anything , " ahlers told dw-world .
" we have to send people back on the street without treatment . "
preventing new victims that 's bound to change now that the institute has secured private funding for a unique project to treat pedophiles before they end up in a courtroom , and before they are caught molesting a child .
starting in january , ahlers and his colleagues hope to sign up 120 people for the three-year program .
it 's a significant step , because by and large potential perpetrators - people who sense they have sexual fantasies involving children - have been off the radar screen .
therapy money primarily flows into victim 's groups and the treatment of imprisoned sex offenders .
although a german government initiative has set aside money for a 2005 project that will work with teenage offenders , it resembles previous programs in that most of the participants have already come to attention as child abusers .
" we 're just starting to be aware of the problem and are still lacking adequate perpetrator prevention programs , " said kai sachs , the executive director of the german society against child abuse and neglect , which advises professionals who deal with cases of child abuse .
according to him , the berlin project could provide data that might help jump-start similar programs elsewhere .
ahlers is already convinced that early intervention could help prevent the suffering of the 550 german children , who are sexually abused each day , according to the federal criminal police office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the program prevent the abuse of more children ?
" in the end it 's about victims and the prevention of new victims , " ahlers stressed , adding that few therapists are qualified or interested in taking on people with sexual fantasies about children .
" we 're doing this to protect children and help the patients , " he maintained .
" we want to prove that they are patients , that they can be treated and that the treatment helps , " he said .
will people sign up ?
while welcoming the new project , others questioned whether enough people would sign up for the treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely that convicted child abuser and murderer marc dutroux would have sought treatment " the question is : ' how do you reach them , " ' michael osterheider , the director of the department of forensic psychiatry and psychotherapy at the university of regensburg , told dw-world .
he noted that some pedophiles are convinced that they are doing nothing wrong and would like to see sex between adults and children legalized .
ahlers countered that he was not worried about finding participants , because the project targets pedophiles who suffer from their sexual desire and are looking for help .
" they are waiting for treatment , " he said .
" we 're trying to offer something where there was no help before . "
the berlin institute plans to launch a publicity campaign with newspaper ads in the fall to alert people to the program .
" we hope to appeal to all those who have realized that children play a role in their sexual fantasies , " ahlers said .
promoting responsibility during the project , participants will be split in three groups : in addition to a control group , which will not receive treatment right away , one section will receive group therapy and those people in another will engage in one-on-one therapy .
the sessions are geared to helping people identify their own sexuality and begin accepting the way they are , ahlers said , describing the treatment .

polish leaders had expected the german chancellor to take a clear stance on such restitution claims , and amid the odd whistle and boo from the crowd he lived up to anticipations : " we germans know full well who started the war and who were its first victims , " schröder said acknowledging the nazi atrocities in poland and added that because of german 's blame there was no longer room left for discussing restitution claims which " turn history on its head .

even with schröder 's assurances , polish foreign minister woldzimierz cimoszewicz warned that the issue may not be closed .
" one could imagine theoretically that german expellees file claims with european tribunals even if their cases are rejected by the polish and german courts , " he said .
while praising schröder for emphasizing the pride and patriotism of the polish people , erika steinbach , president of the federation of expellees , blamed the chancellor for leaving expellees in legal limbo by not changing german legislation .

" a lot of time has passed since the events in 1944 , " he said and stressed that it is time to move on .
" the scars of war should have healed , and there are now more important tasks for our two nations to tackle jointly . "

chancellor schroeder said governments could only do so much to promote a better understanding between the two nations .
he called on ordinary people to intensify their contacts and learn each other ’ s language : " we must not let up in our efforts to promote closer cultural ties between our societies , " he said and pointed to exchange efforts between young poles and germans which will help shape the common future .
" by doing so , we ’ ll act in the spirit of those who lost their lives in the warsaw uprising , " the chancellor vowed .
schröder also used the occasion to reject a private german group ’ s idea to build a memorial center in berlin commemorating german expellees .
he dismissed the plan as " unacceptable " because it would unilaterally spotlight german suffering and play down its origin in nazi aggression . dw staff -lrb- hg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland commemorates 1944 partisan uprising on august 1 , 1944 , polish partisans began a battle to retake warsaw from its nazi occupiers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.08.2004 preventing new perpetrators großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each year , about 20,000 german children are sexually abused while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focussed on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators . standing in a swimming-pool and surrounded by children , he could sense the others eyeing him suspiciously .
he felt as if a huge slippery ball was floating on the water in front of him , a ball he was struggling to submerge so that no one else could see his shame .
losing control over his life because of his sexual fantasies involving children , the man sought help from christoph joseph ahlers , who works as a clinical psychologist and sexual therapist at the institute for sexology and sexual medicine at berlin 's charite hospital .
at the time , ahlers informed him that specialized treatments exist .
unfortunately , however , the institute did n't have enough funds nor the manpower to offer therapy , he regretted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : little help has been available so far for those seeking it " we can tell people what they have , we can tell them what can be done , but we can not do anything , " ahlers told dw-world .
" we have to send people back on the street without treatment . "
preventing new victims that 's bound to change now that the institute has secured private funding for a unique project to treat pedophiles before they end up in a courtroom , and before they are caught molesting a child .
starting in january , ahlers and his colleagues hope to sign up 120 people for the three-year program .
it 's a significant step , because by and large potential perpetrators - people who sense they have sexual fantasies involving children - have been off the radar screen .
therapy money primarily flows into victim 's groups and the treatment of imprisoned sex offenders .
although a german government initiative has set aside money for a 2005 project that will work with teenage offenders , it resembles previous programs in that most of the participants have already come to attention as child abusers .
" we 're just starting to be aware of the problem and are still lacking adequate perpetrator prevention programs , " said kai sachs , the executive director of the german society against child abuse and neglect , which advises professionals who deal with cases of child abuse .
according to him , the berlin project could provide data that might help jump-start similar programs elsewhere .
ahlers is already convinced that early intervention could help prevent the suffering of the 550 german children , who are sexually abused each day , according to the federal criminal police office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the program prevent the abuse of more children ?
" in the end it 's about victims and the prevention of new victims , " ahlers stressed , adding that few therapists are qualified or interested in taking on people with sexual fantasies about children .
" we 're doing this to protect children and help the patients , " he maintained .
" we want to prove that they are patients , that they can be treated and that the treatment helps , " he said .
will people sign up ?
while welcoming the new project , others questioned whether enough people would sign up for the treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely that convicted child abuser and murderer marc dutroux would have sought treatment " the question is : ' how do you reach them , " ' michael osterheider , the director of the department of forensic psychiatry and psychotherapy at the university of regensburg , told dw-world .
he noted that some pedophiles are convinced that they are doing nothing wrong and would like to see sex between adults and children legalized .
ahlers countered that he was not worried about finding participants , because the project targets pedophiles who suffer from their sexual desire and are looking for help .
" they are waiting for treatment , " he said .
" we 're trying to offer something where there was no help before . "
the berlin institute plans to launch a publicity campaign with newspaper ads in the fall to alert people to the program .
" we hope to appeal to all those who have realized that children play a role in their sexual fantasies , " ahlers said .
promoting responsibility during the project , participants will be split in three groups : in addition to a control group , which will not receive treatment right away , one section will receive group therapy and those people in another will engage in one-on-one therapy .
the sessions are geared to helping people identify their own sexuality and begin accepting the way they are , ahlers said , describing the treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whispering children " they have to learn that they bear no guilt for their feelings , but that they are responsible for their actions , " he said , explaining that patients had to learn to stop mistaking children 's behavior as sexual overtures .
during the therapy , patients are required to talk about their sexual desires and can receive medication that lowers their sex drive .
all participants must also sign an agreement , promising not to have sexual contact with children .
helping , not protecting that 's a promise that 's hard to police , argued georg kohaupt , a member of the executive committee of the federation of child protection centers in germany , which also offers some help for sex offenders .
" there can be no absolute protection of confidence as far as i 'm concerned , " kohaupt told dw-world , adding that he 's seen cases were people continue to have sexual contact with children during treatment .
" if it were that simple for them to stop , they would not need therapy , " kohaupt said .
but ahlers said that a certain level of trust between patient and therapist was necessary to start treatment in the first place .
participants who do n't comply with the abstinence rule would be asked to leave the program , he said .
he noted that while german therapists are prohibited by law from reporting patients to the police for crimes they reveal during therapy , participants in the program would be no more protected than anyone else .
" they still face the same prosecution by law enforcement authorities as before , " he said , adding that the only realistic therapeutic goal is to help people regain control over their sexual desires at all times .
" no pedophile can stop being a pedophile because of treatment , " the psychologist said . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin to tighten measures against dangerous criminals the german government wants to lock away particularly violent criminals and sex offenders with a law that would allow them to be held indefinitely in preventive detention even after they have been sentenced to prison .

sixty years to the day , german chancellor gerhard schröder led a list of dignitaries commemorating the uprising . three days of commemorations came to a climax on sunday when veterans laid wreaths and sang patriotic songs as world leaders and survivors joined together in warsaw to mark the 60th anniversary of the uprising by polish partisans against nazi occupiers towards the end of world war ii .
among the dignitaries attending were gerhard schröder , the first german chancellor to take part in the annual ceremonies .
" today we bow in shame in the face of the nazi troops ' crimes , " schröder said at the ceremony sunday .
" at this place of polish pride and german shame , we hope for reconciliation and peace . "
schröder 's words were followed by applause .
later he garnered even more of his hosts ' approval by assuring that germany would not support restitution claims to return ancestral property to germans who fled or were expelled from eastern europe after the nazis ' defeat .
the issue has dogged polish-german relations for years .
polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said schröder 's speech had " great meaning for poland . "
it was more than a political declaration , cimoszewicz told polish broadcasting .
schröder 's rejection of restitution claims could be " very important " to fend off claims to the european court or the human rights tribunal , he said .
although schröder was warmly received throughout his visit to poland , he did encounter sporadic jeers .
at the warsaw uprising cemetery , he was met with a sign that read : " heil schröder , do n't come to the place where our countrymen are honoured who were murdered by your countrymen - without compensation even today . "
u.s. secretary of state colin powell and britain 's deputy prime minister , john prescott were also among those marking the anniversary with the laying of wreaths and a commemorative concert , as well as the opening of new , interactive museum about the uprising .

the first the german army knew of the battle to liberate warsaw - the first european capital they had taken nearly five years before - was a wave of explosions followed by rifle fire throughout the city .
the timing of the uprising was chosen for maximum effect as the germans appeared to be about to withdraw from warsaw after being forced to retreat over the previous few months in the face of a sustained attack from the red army , which had forced the wehrmacht out of the baltic states , belorussia and western poland .
an estimated 40,000 troops , including 4,000 women , made up the polish home army , or armia krajowa , under the command of general tadeusz ' bor ' komorowski , who estimated they could hold out for about five days without help .
in fact , the insurgents held out for much longer than that , battling the vastly superior german army for 63 days .
komorowski rallied his troops at the start of battle with a rousing call to arms : " today i have issued the order you have been waiting for , the order to begin open battle against poland 's age-old enemy , the german invader . "
" after nearly five years of uninterrupted and heavy fighting underground , today you will carry your arms in the open in order to free your country again and to render exemplary punishment to the german criminals for the terror and crimes committed on polish soil . "
soviets , allies left poles to their fate although barely armed , the plan was to hold out for the rapidly advancing soviet army , which had just reached the outskirts of warsaw at the time of the uprising .
there were also hopes that britain and the united states , would come to their aid in time .
in reality , little assistance was offered , and the red army halted its advance and observed the battle from the other side of warsaw 's vistula river , watching as the ss commanders carried out hitler 's orders to level the city and kill or deport its inhabitants .

sixty years to the day , german chancellor gerhard schröder led a list of dignitaries commemorating the uprising . three days of commemorations came to a climax on sunday when veterans laid wreaths and sang patriotic songs as world leaders and survivors joined together in warsaw to mark the 60th anniversary of the uprising by polish partisans against nazi occupiers towards the end of world war ii .
among the dignitaries attending were gerhard schröder , the first german chancellor to take part in the annual ceremonies .
" today we bow in shame in the face of the nazi troops ' crimes , " schröder said at the ceremony sunday .
" at this place of polish pride and german shame , we hope for reconciliation and peace . "
schröder 's words were followed by applause .
later he garnered even more of his hosts ' approval by assuring that germany would not support restitution claims to return ancestral property to germans who fled or were expelled from eastern europe after the nazis ' defeat .
the issue has dogged polish-german relations for years .
polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said schröder 's speech had " great meaning for poland . "
it was more than a political declaration , cimoszewicz told polish broadcasting .
schröder 's rejection of restitution claims could be " very important " to fend off claims to the european court or the human rights tribunal , he said .
although schröder was warmly received throughout his visit to poland , he did encounter sporadic jeers .
at the warsaw uprising cemetery , he was met with a sign that read : " heil schröder , do n't come to the place where our countrymen are honoured who were murdered by your countrymen - without compensation even today . "
u.s. secretary of state colin powell and britain 's deputy prime minister , john prescott were also among those marking the anniversary with the laying of wreaths and a commemorative concert , as well as the opening of new , interactive museum about the uprising .
russia did not send a representative to the ceremonies .
rebellion was timed for maximum effect the partisan uprising broke out at 5 o 'clock on august 1 , 1944 , following the broadcast of the code signal " tempest . "
the first the german army knew of the battle to liberate warsaw - the first european capital they had taken nearly five years before - was a wave of explosions followed by rifle fire throughout the city .
the timing of the uprising was chosen for maximum effect as the germans appeared to be about to withdraw from warsaw after being forced to retreat over the previous few months in the face of a sustained attack from the red army , which had forced the wehrmacht out of the baltic states , belorussia and western poland .
an estimated 40,000 troops , including 4,000 women , made up the polish home army , or armia krajowa , under the command of general tadeusz ' bor ' komorowski , who estimated they could hold out for about five days without help .
in fact , the insurgents held out for much longer than that , battling the vastly superior german army for 63 days .
komorowski rallied his troops at the start of battle with a rousing call to arms : " today i have issued the order you have been waiting for , the order to begin open battle against poland 's age-old enemy , the german invader . "
" after nearly five years of uninterrupted and heavy fighting underground , today you will carry your arms in the open in order to free your country again and to render exemplary punishment to the german criminals for the terror and crimes committed on polish soil . "
soviets , allies left poles to their fate although barely armed , the plan was to hold out for the rapidly advancing soviet army , which had just reached the outskirts of warsaw at the time of the uprising .
there were also hopes that britain and the united states , would come to their aid in time .
in reality , little assistance was offered , and the red army halted its advance and observed the battle from the other side of warsaw 's vistula river , watching as the ss commanders carried out hitler 's orders to level the city and kill or deport its inhabitants .
more than 200,000 civilians were killed and warsaw was left in ruins .
months later , the soviet army took over a city of rubble and stalin installed a puppet government which occupied poland for more than four decades . dw staff -lrb- nda / ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german leader rejects restitution claims speaking at an event in warsaw to commemorate the 1944 uprising against the nazis , chancellor gerhard schröder made clear that his government did not endorse german claims for the return of ancestral property in poland .

the international community could have acted earlier . the un security council finally agreed on a resolution on sudan .
in view of the members ' closely intertwined interests , only politicians ' dreams could have anticipated sharper or even military actions .
the resolution 's key passage gives the sudanese government 30 days ' time to guarantee the safety of the people in darfur .
after this time limit , the security council will decide what further measures are necessary .
thus , the security council reckons with uncertain activities in the future , where actions are already overdue .
the region 's future remains in question , and what hope can the oppressed refugees gain from the practically cynical wrestling over the word " sanctions , " which was finally watered down to " measures ? "
the case of darfur again raises the question of how the international community - whether individual countries or international organizations - can promote peace to resolve conflicts .
the example of sudan does n't provide an answer - at least not an encouraging one .
instead , darfur has tragically revealed the international community 's impotence .
consistently turning a blind eye , underestimating , playing down and ignoring the actual situation , combined with pursuing individual interests provided the catastrophe in darfur with a devastating backdrop .
strategic maneuvering prevails where decisiveness and quick action were overdue , strategic maneuvers and divergences prevailed .
beyond desperately needed humanitarian aid , the international community , sharply contrasted by an immense media campaign , lacks a concept for long-term solutions that could make a sustainable peace in the region possible .
the escalating situation in darfur in past months and the killing it caused as well as the streams of refugees suggest that strategic maneuvering and demagogy prevail over african and international diplomatic mediation attempts .
another lesson shows that the international community can only intervene energetically in crises such as in darfur when it is n't weighed down by internal rivalries .
the tragedy in darfur was also substantially influenced not by international ignorance , but by opposing political , economic and cultural interests .
a neglected continent furthermore , like other african regions , sudan was for too long a neglected urgent case - with devastating consequences .
certainly , the african union has so far failed to prove that it can resolve african conflicts itself .
however , action rarely reflects african concepts .
the inception , execution and completion of international missions are usually determined by interests outside of africa .
what remains again is a united nations whose credibility has been shaken , a rather reserved international willingness to take action and the continuing discussion not only about early recognition of crisis situations but also about rapid reaction .
the hesitancy , the tactical preconditions , the political ulterior motives in the case of darfur result in the question of whether the international community gages conflicts with a double standard .
in a self-critical condemnation of the rwandan genocide , former u.s. president bill clinton said : " we did n't act quickly enough after the killing began .
we did not immediately call these crimes by their rightful name . "
and un secretary general kofi annan said upon presentation of an action plan for conflict prevention in april : " only so can we honor the victims whom we remember today .

" after four years of mulling over claims by the families of jewish slave laborers who worked in nazi death camps before and during world war ii , and 59 years after the camps were liberated by advancing allied troops , the german government has agreed to pay € 6,800 -lrb- $ 8172 -rrb- each in compensation .
the sum has caused outrage among relatives , survivors and campaigners as it is much less than the € 7,669.38 german law had set for individual payment .
millions of people , many of them jewish , were ordered by the nazis to work in labor camps .
ever since the end of wwii , jewish groups have been campaigning for compensation for survivors of these work camps , which have become synonymous with the atrocities of the nazis .
the compensation was agreed in principle by the german government in 2000 but subsequent bureaucratic stalling and bundles of red tape has meant that it has taken since then to finalize the amount to be paid to each survivor .
the total sum earmarked for the use of compensation was € 4.9 billion which would come from " the foundation : remembrance , responsibility and future , " the organization funded by the german government and german businesses that profited from slave labor .
running out of time the number of surviving former slave laborers eligible for compensation under the government scheme totaled half a million in 1999 .
those who have died since , have passed the eligibility to their surviving relatives .
the foundation stated in june this year that it wanted to complete the final compensation payments by mid-2005 as more survivors reached the end of their days .
" many victims are now in their seventies and eighties , " said board of trustees chairman dieter kastrup at the time .
so far , some € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- have been distributed to victims by partner organizations such as the jewish claims conference -lrb- jcc -rrb- and the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .

polish leaders had expected the german chancellor to take a clear stance on such restitution claims , and amid the odd whistle and boo from the crowd he lived up to anticipations : " we germans know full well who started the war and who were its first victims , " schröder said acknowledging the nazi atrocities in poland and added that because of german 's blame there was no longer room left for discussing restitution claims which " turn history on its head .

" property issues related to world war ii are no longer a subject of controversy between our two governments .
neither the german government nor any other serious political force supports any restitution claims still being voiced .

he called on ordinary people to intensify their contacts and learn each other ’ s language : " we must not let up in our efforts to promote closer cultural ties between our societies , " he said and pointed to exchange efforts between young poles and germans which will help shape the common future .
" by doing so , we ’ ll act in the spirit of those who lost their lives in the warsaw uprising , " the chancellor vowed .
schröder also used the occasion to reject a private german group ’ s idea to build a memorial center in berlin commemorating german expellees .
he dismissed the plan as " unacceptable " because it would unilaterally spotlight german suffering and play down its origin in nazi aggression . dw staff -lrb- hg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland commemorates 1944 partisan uprising on august 1 , 1944 , polish partisans began a battle to retake warsaw from its nazi occupiers .

the eu 's new commission president has offered the next german commissioner , günter verheugen , the industry portfolio - a position short of what berlin had hoped for . according to german news magazine focus , newly named eu commission president josé manuel durão barroso has suggested that günter verheugen , who is currently responsible for enlargement , be moved to industry starting in november .
this falls short of the influential economic post that german chancellor gerhard schröder had been pushing for .
in the last few weeks the german leader had made no secret of his expectations of seeing a fellow countrymen head up a powerful commission and had run amiss with barroso , who said he did not appoint commissioners at the behest of any one country .
instead , the big posts , such as competition and internal markets , are expected to go the new french and british commissioners .
the announcement met with disappointment not only within schröder 's government , but among the german opposition as well .
" that is a lightweight commissioner and falls well below our expectations , " said christian social union 's economics expert hans michelbach about the industry portfolio .
24 vacancies to fill but nothing has been set in stone .
barroso has said that he will present his team of 24 commissioners towards the end of august , leaving several denominators up in the air .
the president has already made clear that he does not want any first and second class commissioners on his team - a reference to germany 's demands for a high profile " super commissioner " - and has called for at least eight women to head up the various eu executive offices .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.08.2004 preventing new perpetrators großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each year , about 20,000 german children are sexually abused while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focussed on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators . standing in a swimming-pool and surrounded by children , he could sense the others eyeing him suspiciously .
he felt as if a huge slippery ball was floating on the water in front of him , a ball he was struggling to submerge so that no one else could see his shame .
losing control over his life because of his sexual fantasies involving children , the man sought help from christoph joseph ahlers , who works as a clinical psychologist and sexual therapist at the institute for sexology and sexual medicine at berlin 's charite hospital .
at the time , ahlers informed him that specialized treatments exist .
unfortunately , however , the institute did n't have enough funds nor the manpower to offer therapy , he regretted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : little help has been available so far for those seeking it " we can tell people what they have , we can tell them what can be done , but we can not do anything , " ahlers told dw-world .
" we have to send people back on the street without treatment . "
preventing new victims that 's bound to change now that the institute has secured private funding for a unique project to treat pedophiles before they end up in a courtroom , and before they are caught molesting a child .
starting in january , ahlers and his colleagues hope to sign up 120 people for the three-year program .
it 's a significant step , because by and large potential perpetrators - people who sense they have sexual fantasies involving children - have been off the radar screen .
therapy money primarily flows into victim 's groups and the treatment of imprisoned sex offenders .
although a german government initiative has set aside money for a 2005 project that will work with teenage offenders , it resembles previous programs in that most of the participants have already come to attention as child abusers .
" we 're just starting to be aware of the problem and are still lacking adequate perpetrator prevention programs , " said kai sachs , the executive director of the german society against child abuse and neglect , which advises professionals who deal with cases of child abuse .
according to him , the berlin project could provide data that might help jump-start similar programs elsewhere .
ahlers is already convinced that early intervention could help prevent the suffering of the 550 german children , who are sexually abused each day , according to the federal criminal police office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the program prevent the abuse of more children ?
" in the end it 's about victims and the prevention of new victims , " ahlers stressed , adding that few therapists are qualified or interested in taking on people with sexual fantasies about children .
" we 're doing this to protect children and help the patients , " he maintained .
" we want to prove that they are patients , that they can be treated and that the treatment helps , " he said .
will people sign up ?
while welcoming the new project , others questioned whether enough people would sign up for the treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely that convicted child abuser and murderer marc dutroux would have sought treatment " the question is : ' how do you reach them , " ' michael osterheider , the director of the department of forensic psychiatry and psychotherapy at the university of regensburg , told dw-world .
he noted that some pedophiles are convinced that they are doing nothing wrong and would like to see sex between adults and children legalized .
ahlers countered that he was not worried about finding participants , because the project targets pedophiles who suffer from their sexual desire and are looking for help .
" they are waiting for treatment , " he said .
" we 're trying to offer something where there was no help before . "
the berlin institute plans to launch a publicity campaign with newspaper ads in the fall to alert people to the program .
" we hope to appeal to all those who have realized that children play a role in their sexual fantasies , " ahlers said .
promoting responsibility during the project , participants will be split in three groups : in addition to a control group , which will not receive treatment right away , one section will receive group therapy and those people in another will engage in one-on-one therapy .
the sessions are geared to helping people identify their own sexuality and begin accepting the way they are , ahlers said , describing the treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whispering children " they have to learn that they bear no guilt for their feelings , but that they are responsible for their actions , " he said , explaining that patients had to learn to stop mistaking children 's behavior as sexual overtures .
during the therapy , patients are required to talk about their sexual desires and can receive medication that lowers their sex drive .
all participants must also sign an agreement , promising not to have sexual contact with children .
helping , not protecting that 's a promise that 's hard to police , argued georg kohaupt , a member of the executive committee of the federation of child protection centers in germany , which also offers some help for sex offenders .
" there can be no absolute protection of confidence as far as i 'm concerned , " kohaupt told dw-world , adding that he 's seen cases were people continue to have sexual contact with children during treatment .
" if it were that simple for them to stop , they would not need therapy , " kohaupt said .
but ahlers said that a certain level of trust between patient and therapist was necessary to start treatment in the first place .
participants who do n't comply with the abstinence rule would be asked to leave the program , he said .
he noted that while german therapists are prohibited by law from reporting patients to the police for crimes they reveal during therapy , participants in the program would be no more protected than anyone else .
" they still face the same prosecution by law enforcement authorities as before , " he said , adding that the only realistic therapeutic goal is to help people regain control over their sexual desires at all times .

while welcoming the new project , others questioned whether enough people would sign up for the treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely that convicted child abuser and murderer marc dutroux would have sought treatment " the question is : ' how do you reach them , " ' michael osterheider , the director of the department of forensic psychiatry and psychotherapy at the university of regensburg , told dw-world .
he noted that some pedophiles are convinced that they are doing nothing wrong and would like to see sex between adults and children legalized .
ahlers countered that he was not worried about finding participants , because the project targets pedophiles who suffer from their sexual desire and are looking for help .
" they are waiting for treatment , " he said .
" we 're trying to offer something where there was no help before . "
the berlin institute plans to launch a publicity campaign with newspaper ads in the fall to alert people to the program .

promoting responsibility during the project , participants will be split in three groups : in addition to a control group , which will not receive treatment right away , one section will receive group therapy and those people in another will engage in one-on-one therapy .
the sessions are geared to helping people identify their own sexuality and begin accepting the way they are , ahlers said , describing the treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whispering children " they have to learn that they bear no guilt for their feelings , but that they are responsible for their actions , " he said , explaining that patients had to learn to stop mistaking children 's behavior as sexual overtures .
during the therapy , patients are required to talk about their sexual desires and can receive medication that lowers their sex drive .
all participants must also sign an agreement , promising not to have sexual contact with children .
helping , not protecting that 's a promise that 's hard to police , argued georg kohaupt , a member of the executive committee of the federation of child protection centers in germany , which also offers some help for sex offenders .
" there can be no absolute protection of confidence as far as i 'm concerned , " kohaupt told dw-world , adding that he 's seen cases were people continue to have sexual contact with children during treatment .

he felt as if a huge slippery ball was floating on the water in front of him , a ball he was struggling to submerge so that no one else could see his shame .
losing control over his life because of his sexual fantasies involving children , the man sought help from christoph joseph ahlers , who works as a clinical psychologist and sexual therapist at the institute for sexology and sexual medicine at berlin 's charite hospital .
at the time , ahlers informed him that specialized treatments exist .
unfortunately , however , the institute did n't have enough funds nor the manpower to offer therapy , he regretted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : little help has been available so far for those seeking it " we can tell people what they have , we can tell them what can be done , but we can not do anything , " ahlers told dw-world .
" we have to send people back on the street without treatment . "
preventing new victims that 's bound to change now that the institute has secured private funding for a unique project to treat pedophiles before they end up in a courtroom , and before they are caught molesting a child .
starting in january , ahlers and his colleagues hope to sign up 120 people for the three-year program .
it 's a significant step , because by and large potential perpetrators - people who sense they have sexual fantasies involving children - have been off the radar screen .
therapy money primarily flows into victim 's groups and the treatment of imprisoned sex offenders .
although a german government initiative has set aside money for a 2005 project that will work with teenage offenders , it resembles previous programs in that most of the participants have already come to attention as child abusers .
" we 're just starting to be aware of the problem and are still lacking adequate perpetrator prevention programs , " said kai sachs , the executive director of the german society against child abuse and neglect , which advises professionals who deal with cases of child abuse .
according to him , the berlin project could provide data that might help jump-start similar programs elsewhere .
ahlers is already convinced that early intervention could help prevent the suffering of the 550 german children , who are sexually abused each day , according to the federal criminal police office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the program prevent the abuse of more children ?
" in the end it 's about victims and the prevention of new victims , " ahlers stressed , adding that few therapists are qualified or interested in taking on people with sexual fantasies about children .

sixty years to the day , german chancellor gerhard schröder led a list of dignitaries commemorating the uprising . three days of commemorations came to a climax on sunday when veterans laid wreaths and sang patriotic songs as world leaders and survivors joined together in warsaw to mark the 60th anniversary of the uprising by polish partisans against nazi occupiers towards the end of world war ii .
among the dignitaries attending were gerhard schröder , the first german chancellor to take part in the annual ceremonies .
" today we bow in shame in the face of the nazi troops ' crimes , " schröder said at the ceremony sunday .
" at this place of polish pride and german shame , we hope for reconciliation and peace . "
schröder 's words were followed by applause .
later he garnered even more of his hosts ' approval by assuring that germany would not support restitution claims to return ancestral property to germans who fled or were expelled from eastern europe after the nazis ' defeat .
the issue has dogged polish-german relations for years .
polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said schröder 's speech had " great meaning for poland . "
it was more than a political declaration , cimoszewicz told polish broadcasting .
schröder 's rejection of restitution claims could be " very important " to fend off claims to the european court or the human rights tribunal , he said .
although schröder was warmly received throughout his visit to poland , he did encounter sporadic jeers .
at the warsaw uprising cemetery , he was met with a sign that read : " heil schröder , do n't come to the place where our countrymen are honoured who were murdered by your countrymen - without compensation even today . "
u.s. secretary of state colin powell and britain 's deputy prime minister , john prescott were also among those marking the anniversary with the laying of wreaths and a commemorative concert , as well as the opening of new , interactive museum about the uprising .
russia did not send a representative to the ceremonies .
rebellion was timed for maximum effect the partisan uprising broke out at 5 o 'clock on august 1 , 1944 , following the broadcast of the code signal " tempest . "
the first the german army knew of the battle to liberate warsaw - the first european capital they had taken nearly five years before - was a wave of explosions followed by rifle fire throughout the city .
the timing of the uprising was chosen for maximum effect as the germans appeared to be about to withdraw from warsaw after being forced to retreat over the previous few months in the face of a sustained attack from the red army , which had forced the wehrmacht out of the baltic states , belorussia and western poland .
an estimated 40,000 troops , including 4,000 women , made up the polish home army , or armia krajowa , under the command of general tadeusz ' bor ' komorowski , who estimated they could hold out for about five days without help .
in fact , the insurgents held out for much longer than that , battling the vastly superior german army for 63 days .
komorowski rallied his troops at the start of battle with a rousing call to arms : " today i have issued the order you have been waiting for , the order to begin open battle against poland 's age-old enemy , the german invader . "
" after nearly five years of uninterrupted and heavy fighting underground , today you will carry your arms in the open in order to free your country again and to render exemplary punishment to the german criminals for the terror and crimes committed on polish soil . "
soviets , allies left poles to their fate although barely armed , the plan was to hold out for the rapidly advancing soviet army , which had just reached the outskirts of warsaw at the time of the uprising .
there were also hopes that britain and the united states , would come to their aid in time .
in reality , little assistance was offered , and the red army halted its advance and observed the battle from the other side of warsaw 's vistula river , watching as the ss commanders carried out hitler 's orders to level the city and kill or deport its inhabitants .
more than 200,000 civilians were killed and warsaw was left in ruins .
months later , the soviet army took over a city of rubble and stalin installed a puppet government which occupied poland for more than four decades . dw staff -lrb- nda / ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german leader rejects restitution claims speaking at an event in warsaw to commemorate the 1944 uprising against the nazis , chancellor gerhard schröder made clear that his government did not endorse german claims for the return of ancestral property in poland .

when a group of computer scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent germany 's first e-mail 20 years ago , they had no idea they were heralding in the digital age . even though it has only been a part of our collective consciousness for the last decade , for most people life without e-mail would be unimaginable .
in both the business and private spheres , e-mail has long become part of our daily fabric .
but what is an obvious part of daily life today was practically unthinkable 20 years ago when information scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent the first german e-mail .
at that time , understated internet pioneer werner zorn described the event as a " very exciting , " development .
on august 2 , 1984 , zorn and a colleague sent the first-ever german e-mail .
it was his response to the official welcoming e-mail from csnet , a united states-developed electronic communication platform for scientists .
clicking into history it was a mouse click of historical importance .
if the senders of the electronic mail had had any clue how important the event was , they probably would have opened a bottle of champagne .
" we first learned the importance of august 2 later on , " zorn told the german news agency ddp .
back then , zorn 's e-mail address was simple to remember : zorn @ germany .
" what was new technologically at the time was that this was part of an open computer network , " he recalled .
the standardized interface made it possible for more and more people to get connected , and ultimately the technology would usurp the outmoded idea of centrally administered networks .
at the time , karlsruhe became the main mode for e-mails being sent to and from germany after it signed a contract with csnet .
with the opening of the node , germany became the fourth country to become part of the network , following canada , sweden and israel .
in germany , the network eased the work of scientists who needed to communicate with one another .
the country 's prestigious fraunhofer and max planck institutes were the first customers , followed quickly by major industrial companies like siemens and basf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has given germans an instant connection with the rest of the world .
with the working title of " interconnection through networks , " the computer scientists began their work on bringing the internet to germany in 1982 as part of a federal project to build a research network .
zorn and the professors and students around him were given the responsibility not only of connecting germany to international networks but also for making it available to individual scientists who needed access to the collective knowledge of others around the world .
after two years of work , the first successful test came on august 2 , 1984 .
trouble in paradise - for a minute zorn 's success also ran into some unexpected resistance - mainly from institutions that saw the work being done in karlsruhe as unwanted competition .
one consequence was that the university stopped receiving financial assistance for the project .
but it did n't matter much - the development was so widely accepted and adopted that the university made enough money installing mail connections for other organizations that it could ensure the project 's survival .
the full shift to the internet came in 1989 , bringing the first direct internet connections between germany and the us .
today the main internet servers in germany are still hosted in karlsruhe at the firm schlund and partner , where more the 3 million internet domains are managed - more domains than in any other european country .
life before wormy spam the internet certainly changed life for many in germany , but it also brought real problems with it , like spam , which would become such a huge pest 20 years later that it would cause billions of euros in damages for european companies and threaten the utility of e-mail for many .
mass spams are also often used to spread worms and other viruses across the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few germans are familiar with the unique taste of this american pork product .
but they all know its electronic doppelgänger .
anti-virus software-maker mcafee said firms are forced to spend up to € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- a year to prevent and eliminate virus and junk e-mail attacks .
the german government - which found itself under attack in may , logging 510,000 unwanted e-mails in just one week - allocates about € 7 million of its € 32 billion annual it budget for security .
under a european union directive , all member states are required to pass stringent privacy laws that make spam a crime .
but in may , the european commission criticized germany for not doing enough , legally , to stop its spread .
the country 's strict data protection laws have so far made it difficult for politicians to tackle the problem of e-mail .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government proposed a bill earlier this year designed to punish spam abusers , but the bill is still awaiting a vote in parliament .
back when the first e-mails were exchanged in germany 20 years ago , an obscure canned american pork by product could n't have been further from people 's minds .

when a group of computer scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent germany 's first e-mail 20 years ago , they had no idea they were heralding in the digital age . even though it has only been a part of our collective consciousness for the last decade , for most people life without e-mail would be unimaginable .
in both the business and private spheres , e-mail has long become part of our daily fabric .
but what is an obvious part of daily life today was practically unthinkable 20 years ago when information scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent the first german e-mail .
at that time , understated internet pioneer werner zorn described the event as a " very exciting , " development .
on august 2 , 1984 , zorn and a colleague sent the first-ever german e-mail .
it was his response to the official welcoming e-mail from csnet , a united states-developed electronic communication platform for scientists .
clicking into history it was a mouse click of historical importance .
if the senders of the electronic mail had had any clue how important the event was , they probably would have opened a bottle of champagne .
" we first learned the importance of august 2 later on , " zorn told the german news agency ddp .
back then , zorn 's e-mail address was simple to remember : zorn @ germany .
" what was new technologically at the time was that this was part of an open computer network , " he recalled .
the standardized interface made it possible for more and more people to get connected , and ultimately the technology would usurp the outmoded idea of centrally administered networks .
at the time , karlsruhe became the main mode for e-mails being sent to and from germany after it signed a contract with csnet .
with the opening of the node , germany became the fourth country to become part of the network , following canada , sweden and israel .
in germany , the network eased the work of scientists who needed to communicate with one another .
the country 's prestigious fraunhofer and max planck institutes were the first customers , followed quickly by major industrial companies like siemens and basf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has given germans an instant connection with the rest of the world .
with the working title of " interconnection through networks , " the computer scientists began their work on bringing the internet to germany in 1982 as part of a federal project to build a research network .
zorn and the professors and students around him were given the responsibility not only of connecting germany to international networks but also for making it available to individual scientists who needed access to the collective knowledge of others around the world .
after two years of work , the first successful test came on august 2 , 1984 .
trouble in paradise - for a minute zorn 's success also ran into some unexpected resistance - mainly from institutions that saw the work being done in karlsruhe as unwanted competition .
one consequence was that the university stopped receiving financial assistance for the project .
but it did n't matter much - the development was so widely accepted and adopted that the university made enough money installing mail connections for other organizations that it could ensure the project 's survival .
the full shift to the internet came in 1989 , bringing the first direct internet connections between germany and the us .
today the main internet servers in germany are still hosted in karlsruhe at the firm schlund and partner , where more the 3 million internet domains are managed - more domains than in any other european country .
life before wormy spam the internet certainly changed life for many in germany , but it also brought real problems with it , like spam , which would become such a huge pest 20 years later that it would cause billions of euros in damages for european companies and threaten the utility of e-mail for many .
mass spams are also often used to spread worms and other viruses across the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few germans are familiar with the unique taste of this american pork product .
but they all know its electronic doppelgänger .
anti-virus software-maker mcafee said firms are forced to spend up to € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- a year to prevent and eliminate virus and junk e-mail attacks .
the german government - which found itself under attack in may , logging 510,000 unwanted e-mails in just one week - allocates about € 7 million of its € 32 billion annual it budget for security .
under a european union directive , all member states are required to pass stringent privacy laws that make spam a crime .
but in may , the european commission criticized germany for not doing enough , legally , to stop its spread .
the country 's strict data protection laws have so far made it difficult for politicians to tackle the problem of e-mail .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government proposed a bill earlier this year designed to punish spam abusers , but the bill is still awaiting a vote in parliament .
back when the first e-mails were exchanged in germany 20 years ago , an obscure canned american pork by product could n't have been further from people 's minds .
zorn and his people had one thought : csnet and its welcome message .
" this is your official welcome to csnet !

" after four years of mulling over claims by the families of jewish slave laborers who worked in nazi death camps before and during world war ii , and 59 years after the camps were liberated by advancing allied troops , the german government has agreed to pay € 6,800 -lrb- $ 8172 -rrb- each in compensation .
the sum has caused outrage among relatives , survivors and campaigners as it is much less than the € 7,669.38 german law had set for individual payment .
millions of people , many of them jewish , were ordered by the nazis to work in labor camps .
ever since the end of wwii , jewish groups have been campaigning for compensation for survivors of these work camps , which have become synonymous with the atrocities of the nazis .
the compensation was agreed in principle by the german government in 2000 but subsequent bureaucratic stalling and bundles of red tape has meant that it has taken since then to finalize the amount to be paid to each survivor .
the total sum earmarked for the use of compensation was € 4.9 billion which would come from " the foundation : remembrance , responsibility and future , " the organization funded by the german government and german businesses that profited from slave labor .
running out of time the number of surviving former slave laborers eligible for compensation under the government scheme totaled half a million in 1999 .
those who have died since , have passed the eligibility to their surviving relatives .
the foundation stated in june this year that it wanted to complete the final compensation payments by mid-2005 as more survivors reached the end of their days .

" after four years of mulling over claims by the families of jewish slave laborers who worked in nazi death camps before and during world war ii , and 59 years after the camps were liberated by advancing allied troops , the german government has agreed to pay € 6,800 -lrb- $ 8172 -rrb- each in compensation .
the sum has caused outrage among relatives , survivors and campaigners as it is much less than the € 7,669.38 german law had set for individual payment .
millions of people , many of them jewish , were ordered by the nazis to work in labor camps .
ever since the end of wwii , jewish groups have been campaigning for compensation for survivors of these work camps , which have become synonymous with the atrocities of the nazis .
the compensation was agreed in principle by the german government in 2000 but subsequent bureaucratic stalling and bundles of red tape has meant that it has taken since then to finalize the amount to be paid to each survivor .
the total sum earmarked for the use of compensation was € 4.9 billion which would come from " the foundation : remembrance , responsibility and future , " the organization funded by the german government and german businesses that profited from slave labor .
running out of time the number of surviving former slave laborers eligible for compensation under the government scheme totaled half a million in 1999 .
those who have died since , have passed the eligibility to their surviving relatives .
the foundation stated in june this year that it wanted to complete the final compensation payments by mid-2005 as more survivors reached the end of their days .
" many victims are now in their seventies and eighties , " said board of trustees chairman dieter kastrup at the time .
so far , some € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- have been distributed to victims by partner organizations such as the jewish claims conference -lrb- jcc -rrb- and the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .

" the gist of the problem is n't just the salary amount , but the fact , that remuneration is based on the wrong goals , " dietmar hexe , a member of the dgb 's executive board , told handelsblatt newspaper . instead of linking salaries to share value , board members should look at executives ' accomplishments to guarantee a company 's well-being in the long term . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de miss manners for companies two years ago , a so-called corporate governance code was established as a guideline for german companies .

the international community could have acted earlier . the un security council finally agreed on a resolution on sudan .
in view of the members ' closely intertwined interests , only politicians ' dreams could have anticipated sharper or even military actions .
the resolution 's key passage gives the sudanese government 30 days ' time to guarantee the safety of the people in darfur .
after this time limit , the security council will decide what further measures are necessary .
thus , the security council reckons with uncertain activities in the future , where actions are already overdue .
the region 's future remains in question , and what hope can the oppressed refugees gain from the practically cynical wrestling over the word " sanctions , " which was finally watered down to " measures ? "
the case of darfur again raises the question of how the international community - whether individual countries or international organizations - can promote peace to resolve conflicts .
the example of sudan does n't provide an answer - at least not an encouraging one .
instead , darfur has tragically revealed the international community 's impotence .
consistently turning a blind eye , underestimating , playing down and ignoring the actual situation , combined with pursuing individual interests provided the catastrophe in darfur with a devastating backdrop .
strategic maneuvering prevails where decisiveness and quick action were overdue , strategic maneuvers and divergences prevailed .
beyond desperately needed humanitarian aid , the international community , sharply contrasted by an immense media campaign , lacks a concept for long-term solutions that could make a sustainable peace in the region possible .
the escalating situation in darfur in past months and the killing it caused as well as the streams of refugees suggest that strategic maneuvering and demagogy prevail over african and international diplomatic mediation attempts .
another lesson shows that the international community can only intervene energetically in crises such as in darfur when it is n't weighed down by internal rivalries .
the tragedy in darfur was also substantially influenced not by international ignorance , but by opposing political , economic and cultural interests .
a neglected continent furthermore , like other african regions , sudan was for too long a neglected urgent case - with devastating consequences .
certainly , the african union has so far failed to prove that it can resolve african conflicts itself .
however , action rarely reflects african concepts .
the inception , execution and completion of international missions are usually determined by interests outside of africa .
what remains again is a united nations whose credibility has been shaken , a rather reserved international willingness to take action and the continuing discussion not only about early recognition of crisis situations but also about rapid reaction .
the hesitancy , the tactical preconditions , the political ulterior motives in the case of darfur result in the question of whether the international community gages conflicts with a double standard .
in a self-critical condemnation of the rwandan genocide , former u.s. president bill clinton said : " we did n't act quickly enough after the killing began .
we did not immediately call these crimes by their rightful name . "
and un secretary general kofi annan said upon presentation of an action plan for conflict prevention in april : " only so can we honor the victims whom we remember today .

the international community could have acted earlier . the un security council finally agreed on a resolution on sudan .
in view of the members ' closely intertwined interests , only politicians ' dreams could have anticipated sharper or even military actions .
the resolution 's key passage gives the sudanese government 30 days ' time to guarantee the safety of the people in darfur .
after this time limit , the security council will decide what further measures are necessary .
thus , the security council reckons with uncertain activities in the future , where actions are already overdue .
the region 's future remains in question , and what hope can the oppressed refugees gain from the practically cynical wrestling over the word " sanctions , " which was finally watered down to " measures ? "
the case of darfur again raises the question of how the international community - whether individual countries or international organizations - can promote peace to resolve conflicts .
the example of sudan does n't provide an answer - at least not an encouraging one .
instead , darfur has tragically revealed the international community 's impotence .
consistently turning a blind eye , underestimating , playing down and ignoring the actual situation , combined with pursuing individual interests provided the catastrophe in darfur with a devastating backdrop .
strategic maneuvering prevails where decisiveness and quick action were overdue , strategic maneuvers and divergences prevailed .
beyond desperately needed humanitarian aid , the international community , sharply contrasted by an immense media campaign , lacks a concept for long-term solutions that could make a sustainable peace in the region possible .

when a group of computer scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent germany 's first e-mail 20 years ago , they had no idea they were heralding in the digital age . even though it has only been a part of our collective consciousness for the last decade , for most people life without e-mail would be unimaginable .
in both the business and private spheres , e-mail has long become part of our daily fabric .
but what is an obvious part of daily life today was practically unthinkable 20 years ago when information scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent the first german e-mail .
at that time , understated internet pioneer werner zorn described the event as a " very exciting , " development .
on august 2 , 1984 , zorn and a colleague sent the first-ever german e-mail .
it was his response to the official welcoming e-mail from csnet , a united states-developed electronic communication platform for scientists .
clicking into history it was a mouse click of historical importance .
if the senders of the electronic mail had had any clue how important the event was , they probably would have opened a bottle of champagne .
" we first learned the importance of august 2 later on , " zorn told the german news agency ddp .
back then , zorn 's e-mail address was simple to remember : zorn @ germany .
" what was new technologically at the time was that this was part of an open computer network , " he recalled .
the standardized interface made it possible for more and more people to get connected , and ultimately the technology would usurp the outmoded idea of centrally administered networks .
at the time , karlsruhe became the main mode for e-mails being sent to and from germany after it signed a contract with csnet .
with the opening of the node , germany became the fourth country to become part of the network , following canada , sweden and israel .
in germany , the network eased the work of scientists who needed to communicate with one another .
the country 's prestigious fraunhofer and max planck institutes were the first customers , followed quickly by major industrial companies like siemens and basf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has given germans an instant connection with the rest of the world .
with the working title of " interconnection through networks , " the computer scientists began their work on bringing the internet to germany in 1982 as part of a federal project to build a research network .
zorn and the professors and students around him were given the responsibility not only of connecting germany to international networks but also for making it available to individual scientists who needed access to the collective knowledge of others around the world .
after two years of work , the first successful test came on august 2 , 1984 .
trouble in paradise - for a minute zorn 's success also ran into some unexpected resistance - mainly from institutions that saw the work being done in karlsruhe as unwanted competition .
one consequence was that the university stopped receiving financial assistance for the project .
but it did n't matter much - the development was so widely accepted and adopted that the university made enough money installing mail connections for other organizations that it could ensure the project 's survival .
the full shift to the internet came in 1989 , bringing the first direct internet connections between germany and the us .
today the main internet servers in germany are still hosted in karlsruhe at the firm schlund and partner , where more the 3 million internet domains are managed - more domains than in any other european country .
life before wormy spam the internet certainly changed life for many in germany , but it also brought real problems with it , like spam , which would become such a huge pest 20 years later that it would cause billions of euros in damages for european companies and threaten the utility of e-mail for many .
mass spams are also often used to spread worms and other viruses across the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few germans are familiar with the unique taste of this american pork product .
but they all know its electronic doppelgänger .
anti-virus software-maker mcafee said firms are forced to spend up to € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- a year to prevent and eliminate virus and junk e-mail attacks .
the german government - which found itself under attack in may , logging 510,000 unwanted e-mails in just one week - allocates about € 7 million of its € 32 billion annual it budget for security .
under a european union directive , all member states are required to pass stringent privacy laws that make spam a crime .
but in may , the european commission criticized germany for not doing enough , legally , to stop its spread .
the country 's strict data protection laws have so far made it difficult for politicians to tackle the problem of e-mail .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government proposed a bill earlier this year designed to punish spam abusers , but the bill is still awaiting a vote in parliament .
back when the first e-mails were exchanged in germany 20 years ago , an obscure canned american pork by product could n't have been further from people 's minds .
zorn and his people had one thought : csnet and its welcome message .
" this is your official welcome to csnet !
we are glad to have you aboard . "
germany certainly was . dw staff -lrb- dsl / dre / ddp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spammers jam german government e-mail the german government 's e-mail system was brought to a standstill by spammers over the last week .

when a group of computer scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent germany 's first e-mail 20 years ago , they had no idea they were heralding in the digital age . even though it has only been a part of our collective consciousness for the last decade , for most people life without e-mail would be unimaginable .
in both the business and private spheres , e-mail has long become part of our daily fabric .
but what is an obvious part of daily life today was practically unthinkable 20 years ago when information scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent the first german e-mail .
at that time , understated internet pioneer werner zorn described the event as a " very exciting , " development .
on august 2 , 1984 , zorn and a colleague sent the first-ever german e-mail .
it was his response to the official welcoming e-mail from csnet , a united states-developed electronic communication platform for scientists .
clicking into history it was a mouse click of historical importance .
if the senders of the electronic mail had had any clue how important the event was , they probably would have opened a bottle of champagne .
" we first learned the importance of august 2 later on , " zorn told the german news agency ddp .
back then , zorn 's e-mail address was simple to remember : zorn @ germany .
" what was new technologically at the time was that this was part of an open computer network , " he recalled .
the standardized interface made it possible for more and more people to get connected , and ultimately the technology would usurp the outmoded idea of centrally administered networks .
at the time , karlsruhe became the main mode for e-mails being sent to and from germany after it signed a contract with csnet .
with the opening of the node , germany became the fourth country to become part of the network , following canada , sweden and israel .
in germany , the network eased the work of scientists who needed to communicate with one another .
the country 's prestigious fraunhofer and max planck institutes were the first customers , followed quickly by major industrial companies like siemens and basf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has given germans an instant connection with the rest of the world .
with the working title of " interconnection through networks , " the computer scientists began their work on bringing the internet to germany in 1982 as part of a federal project to build a research network .
zorn and the professors and students around him were given the responsibility not only of connecting germany to international networks but also for making it available to individual scientists who needed access to the collective knowledge of others around the world .
after two years of work , the first successful test came on august 2 , 1984 .
trouble in paradise - for a minute zorn 's success also ran into some unexpected resistance - mainly from institutions that saw the work being done in karlsruhe as unwanted competition .
one consequence was that the university stopped receiving financial assistance for the project .
but it did n't matter much - the development was so widely accepted and adopted that the university made enough money installing mail connections for other organizations that it could ensure the project 's survival .
the full shift to the internet came in 1989 , bringing the first direct internet connections between germany and the us .
today the main internet servers in germany are still hosted in karlsruhe at the firm schlund and partner , where more the 3 million internet domains are managed - more domains than in any other european country .
life before wormy spam the internet certainly changed life for many in germany , but it also brought real problems with it , like spam , which would become such a huge pest 20 years later that it would cause billions of euros in damages for european companies and threaten the utility of e-mail for many .
mass spams are also often used to spread worms and other viruses across the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few germans are familiar with the unique taste of this american pork product .
but they all know its electronic doppelgänger .
anti-virus software-maker mcafee said firms are forced to spend up to € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- a year to prevent and eliminate virus and junk e-mail attacks .
the german government - which found itself under attack in may , logging 510,000 unwanted e-mails in just one week - allocates about € 7 million of its € 32 billion annual it budget for security .
under a european union directive , all member states are required to pass stringent privacy laws that make spam a crime .
but in may , the european commission criticized germany for not doing enough , legally , to stop its spread .
the country 's strict data protection laws have so far made it difficult for politicians to tackle the problem of e-mail .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government proposed a bill earlier this year designed to punish spam abusers , but the bill is still awaiting a vote in parliament .
back when the first e-mails were exchanged in germany 20 years ago , an obscure canned american pork by product could n't have been further from people 's minds .

when a group of computer scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent germany 's first e-mail 20 years ago , they had no idea they were heralding in the digital age . even though it has only been a part of our collective consciousness for the last decade , for most people life without e-mail would be unimaginable .
in both the business and private spheres , e-mail has long become part of our daily fabric .
but what is an obvious part of daily life today was practically unthinkable 20 years ago when information scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent the first german e-mail .
at that time , understated internet pioneer werner zorn described the event as a " very exciting , " development .
on august 2 , 1984 , zorn and a colleague sent the first-ever german e-mail .
it was his response to the official welcoming e-mail from csnet , a united states-developed electronic communication platform for scientists .
clicking into history it was a mouse click of historical importance .
if the senders of the electronic mail had had any clue how important the event was , they probably would have opened a bottle of champagne .
" we first learned the importance of august 2 later on , " zorn told the german news agency ddp .
back then , zorn 's e-mail address was simple to remember : zorn @ germany .
" what was new technologically at the time was that this was part of an open computer network , " he recalled .
the standardized interface made it possible for more and more people to get connected , and ultimately the technology would usurp the outmoded idea of centrally administered networks .
at the time , karlsruhe became the main mode for e-mails being sent to and from germany after it signed a contract with csnet .
with the opening of the node , germany became the fourth country to become part of the network , following canada , sweden and israel .
in germany , the network eased the work of scientists who needed to communicate with one another .
the country 's prestigious fraunhofer and max planck institutes were the first customers , followed quickly by major industrial companies like siemens and basf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has given germans an instant connection with the rest of the world .
with the working title of " interconnection through networks , " the computer scientists began their work on bringing the internet to germany in 1982 as part of a federal project to build a research network .
zorn and the professors and students around him were given the responsibility not only of connecting germany to international networks but also for making it available to individual scientists who needed access to the collective knowledge of others around the world .
after two years of work , the first successful test came on august 2 , 1984 .
trouble in paradise - for a minute zorn 's success also ran into some unexpected resistance - mainly from institutions that saw the work being done in karlsruhe as unwanted competition .
one consequence was that the university stopped receiving financial assistance for the project .
but it did n't matter much - the development was so widely accepted and adopted that the university made enough money installing mail connections for other organizations that it could ensure the project 's survival .
the full shift to the internet came in 1989 , bringing the first direct internet connections between germany and the us .
today the main internet servers in germany are still hosted in karlsruhe at the firm schlund and partner , where more the 3 million internet domains are managed - more domains than in any other european country .
life before wormy spam the internet certainly changed life for many in germany , but it also brought real problems with it , like spam , which would become such a huge pest 20 years later that it would cause billions of euros in damages for european companies and threaten the utility of e-mail for many .
mass spams are also often used to spread worms and other viruses across the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few germans are familiar with the unique taste of this american pork product .
but they all know its electronic doppelgänger .
anti-virus software-maker mcafee said firms are forced to spend up to € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- a year to prevent and eliminate virus and junk e-mail attacks .
the german government - which found itself under attack in may , logging 510,000 unwanted e-mails in just one week - allocates about € 7 million of its € 32 billion annual it budget for security .
under a european union directive , all member states are required to pass stringent privacy laws that make spam a crime .
but in may , the european commission criticized germany for not doing enough , legally , to stop its spread .
the country 's strict data protection laws have so far made it difficult for politicians to tackle the problem of e-mail .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government proposed a bill earlier this year designed to punish spam abusers , but the bill is still awaiting a vote in parliament .
back when the first e-mails were exchanged in germany 20 years ago , an obscure canned american pork by product could n't have been further from people 's minds .
zorn and his people had one thought : csnet and its welcome message .
" this is your official welcome to csnet !
we are glad to have you aboard . "
germany certainly was . dw staff -lrb- dsl / dre / ddp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spammers jam german government e-mail the german government 's e-mail system was brought to a standstill by spammers over the last week .

the eu 's new commission president has offered the next german commissioner , günter verheugen , the industry portfolio - a position short of what berlin had hoped for . according to german news magazine focus , newly named eu commission president josé manuel durão barroso has suggested that günter verheugen , who is currently responsible for enlargement , be moved to industry starting in november .
this falls short of the influential economic post that german chancellor gerhard schröder had been pushing for .
in the last few weeks the german leader had made no secret of his expectations of seeing a fellow countrymen head up a powerful commission and had run amiss with barroso , who said he did not appoint commissioners at the behest of any one country .
instead , the big posts , such as competition and internal markets , are expected to go the new french and british commissioners .
the announcement met with disappointment not only within schröder 's government , but among the german opposition as well .
" that is a lightweight commissioner and falls well below our expectations , " said christian social union 's economics expert hans michelbach about the industry portfolio .
24 vacancies to fill but nothing has been set in stone .
barroso has said that he will present his team of 24 commissioners towards the end of august , leaving several denominators up in the air .
the president has already made clear that he does not want any first and second class commissioners on his team - a reference to germany 's demands for a high profile " super commissioner " - and has called for at least eight women to head up the various eu executive offices .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.08.2004 preventing new perpetrators großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each year , about 20,000 german children are sexually abused while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focussed on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators . standing in a swimming-pool and surrounded by children , he could sense the others eyeing him suspiciously .
he felt as if a huge slippery ball was floating on the water in front of him , a ball he was struggling to submerge so that no one else could see his shame .
losing control over his life because of his sexual fantasies involving children , the man sought help from christoph joseph ahlers , who works as a clinical psychologist and sexual therapist at the institute for sexology and sexual medicine at berlin 's charite hospital .
at the time , ahlers informed him that specialized treatments exist .
unfortunately , however , the institute did n't have enough funds nor the manpower to offer therapy , he regretted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : little help has been available so far for those seeking it " we can tell people what they have , we can tell them what can be done , but we can not do anything , " ahlers told dw-world .
" we have to send people back on the street without treatment . "
preventing new victims that 's bound to change now that the institute has secured private funding for a unique project to treat pedophiles before they end up in a courtroom , and before they are caught molesting a child .
starting in january , ahlers and his colleagues hope to sign up 120 people for the three-year program .
it 's a significant step , because by and large potential perpetrators - people who sense they have sexual fantasies involving children - have been off the radar screen .
therapy money primarily flows into victim 's groups and the treatment of imprisoned sex offenders .
although a german government initiative has set aside money for a 2005 project that will work with teenage offenders , it resembles previous programs in that most of the participants have already come to attention as child abusers .
" we 're just starting to be aware of the problem and are still lacking adequate perpetrator prevention programs , " said kai sachs , the executive director of the german society against child abuse and neglect , which advises professionals who deal with cases of child abuse .
according to him , the berlin project could provide data that might help jump-start similar programs elsewhere .
ahlers is already convinced that early intervention could help prevent the suffering of the 550 german children , who are sexually abused each day , according to the federal criminal police office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the program prevent the abuse of more children ?
" in the end it 's about victims and the prevention of new victims , " ahlers stressed , adding that few therapists are qualified or interested in taking on people with sexual fantasies about children .
" we 're doing this to protect children and help the patients , " he maintained .
" we want to prove that they are patients , that they can be treated and that the treatment helps , " he said .
will people sign up ?
while welcoming the new project , others questioned whether enough people would sign up for the treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely that convicted child abuser and murderer marc dutroux would have sought treatment " the question is : ' how do you reach them , " ' michael osterheider , the director of the department of forensic psychiatry and psychotherapy at the university of regensburg , told dw-world .
he noted that some pedophiles are convinced that they are doing nothing wrong and would like to see sex between adults and children legalized .
ahlers countered that he was not worried about finding participants , because the project targets pedophiles who suffer from their sexual desire and are looking for help .
" they are waiting for treatment , " he said .
" we 're trying to offer something where there was no help before . "
the berlin institute plans to launch a publicity campaign with newspaper ads in the fall to alert people to the program .
" we hope to appeal to all those who have realized that children play a role in their sexual fantasies , " ahlers said .
promoting responsibility during the project , participants will be split in three groups : in addition to a control group , which will not receive treatment right away , one section will receive group therapy and those people in another will engage in one-on-one therapy .
the sessions are geared to helping people identify their own sexuality and begin accepting the way they are , ahlers said , describing the treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whispering children " they have to learn that they bear no guilt for their feelings , but that they are responsible for their actions , " he said , explaining that patients had to learn to stop mistaking children 's behavior as sexual overtures .
during the therapy , patients are required to talk about their sexual desires and can receive medication that lowers their sex drive .
all participants must also sign an agreement , promising not to have sexual contact with children .
helping , not protecting that 's a promise that 's hard to police , argued georg kohaupt , a member of the executive committee of the federation of child protection centers in germany , which also offers some help for sex offenders .
" there can be no absolute protection of confidence as far as i 'm concerned , " kohaupt told dw-world , adding that he 's seen cases were people continue to have sexual contact with children during treatment .
" if it were that simple for them to stop , they would not need therapy , " kohaupt said .
but ahlers said that a certain level of trust between patient and therapist was necessary to start treatment in the first place .
participants who do n't comply with the abstinence rule would be asked to leave the program , he said .
he noted that while german therapists are prohibited by law from reporting patients to the police for crimes they reveal during therapy , participants in the program would be no more protected than anyone else .
" they still face the same prosecution by law enforcement authorities as before , " he said , adding that the only realistic therapeutic goal is to help people regain control over their sexual desires at all times .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.08.2004 preventing new perpetrators großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each year , about 20,000 german children are sexually abused while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focussed on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators . standing in a swimming-pool and surrounded by children , he could sense the others eyeing him suspiciously .
he felt as if a huge slippery ball was floating on the water in front of him , a ball he was struggling to submerge so that no one else could see his shame .
losing control over his life because of his sexual fantasies involving children , the man sought help from christoph joseph ahlers , who works as a clinical psychologist and sexual therapist at the institute for sexology and sexual medicine at berlin 's charite hospital .
at the time , ahlers informed him that specialized treatments exist .
unfortunately , however , the institute did n't have enough funds nor the manpower to offer therapy , he regretted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : little help has been available so far for those seeking it " we can tell people what they have , we can tell them what can be done , but we can not do anything , " ahlers told dw-world .
" we have to send people back on the street without treatment . "
preventing new victims that 's bound to change now that the institute has secured private funding for a unique project to treat pedophiles before they end up in a courtroom , and before they are caught molesting a child .
starting in january , ahlers and his colleagues hope to sign up 120 people for the three-year program .
it 's a significant step , because by and large potential perpetrators - people who sense they have sexual fantasies involving children - have been off the radar screen .
therapy money primarily flows into victim 's groups and the treatment of imprisoned sex offenders .
although a german government initiative has set aside money for a 2005 project that will work with teenage offenders , it resembles previous programs in that most of the participants have already come to attention as child abusers .
" we 're just starting to be aware of the problem and are still lacking adequate perpetrator prevention programs , " said kai sachs , the executive director of the german society against child abuse and neglect , which advises professionals who deal with cases of child abuse .
according to him , the berlin project could provide data that might help jump-start similar programs elsewhere .
ahlers is already convinced that early intervention could help prevent the suffering of the 550 german children , who are sexually abused each day , according to the federal criminal police office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the program prevent the abuse of more children ?
" in the end it 's about victims and the prevention of new victims , " ahlers stressed , adding that few therapists are qualified or interested in taking on people with sexual fantasies about children .
" we 're doing this to protect children and help the patients , " he maintained .
" we want to prove that they are patients , that they can be treated and that the treatment helps , " he said .
will people sign up ?
while welcoming the new project , others questioned whether enough people would sign up for the treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely that convicted child abuser and murderer marc dutroux would have sought treatment " the question is : ' how do you reach them , " ' michael osterheider , the director of the department of forensic psychiatry and psychotherapy at the university of regensburg , told dw-world .
he noted that some pedophiles are convinced that they are doing nothing wrong and would like to see sex between adults and children legalized .
ahlers countered that he was not worried about finding participants , because the project targets pedophiles who suffer from their sexual desire and are looking for help .
" they are waiting for treatment , " he said .
" we 're trying to offer something where there was no help before . "
the berlin institute plans to launch a publicity campaign with newspaper ads in the fall to alert people to the program .
" we hope to appeal to all those who have realized that children play a role in their sexual fantasies , " ahlers said .
promoting responsibility during the project , participants will be split in three groups : in addition to a control group , which will not receive treatment right away , one section will receive group therapy and those people in another will engage in one-on-one therapy .
the sessions are geared to helping people identify their own sexuality and begin accepting the way they are , ahlers said , describing the treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whispering children " they have to learn that they bear no guilt for their feelings , but that they are responsible for their actions , " he said , explaining that patients had to learn to stop mistaking children 's behavior as sexual overtures .
during the therapy , patients are required to talk about their sexual desires and can receive medication that lowers their sex drive .
all participants must also sign an agreement , promising not to have sexual contact with children .

in an interview , the social democrat said the eu should examine whether a " test center could be created in northern africa . "
however , the head of the opposition neo-liberal free democrats , guido westerwelle , said the government should end its debate over possible processing centers in africa because he believes they are unconstitutional .
human rights groups have also criticized schily 's proposal , citing possible violations of the refugee provisions in the geneva convention .
but schily has said the constitution does not apply because the centers would be outside of eu jurisdiction .

the national railway said it would eliminate 25 percent of its 4,000 positions at ticket counters in train stations across the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 02.08.2004 poland commemorates 1944 partisan uprising großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder paid tribute to polish suffering under the nazis on august 1 , 1944 , polish partisans began a battle to retake warsaw from its nazi occupiers .
sixty years to the day , german chancellor gerhard schröder led a list of dignitaries commemorating the uprising . three days of commemorations came to a climax on sunday when veterans laid wreaths and sang patriotic songs as world leaders and survivors joined together in warsaw to mark the 60th anniversary of the uprising by polish partisans against nazi occupiers towards the end of world war ii .
among the dignitaries attending were gerhard schröder , the first german chancellor to take part in the annual ceremonies .
" today we bow in shame in the face of the nazi troops ' crimes , " schröder said at the ceremony sunday .
" at this place of polish pride and german shame , we hope for reconciliation and peace . "
schröder 's words were followed by applause .
later he garnered even more of his hosts ' approval by assuring that germany would not support restitution claims to return ancestral property to germans who fled or were expelled from eastern europe after the nazis ' defeat .
the issue has dogged polish-german relations for years .
polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said schröder 's speech had " great meaning for poland . "
it was more than a political declaration , cimoszewicz told polish broadcasting .
schröder 's rejection of restitution claims could be " very important " to fend off claims to the european court or the human rights tribunal , he said .
although schröder was warmly received throughout his visit to poland , he did encounter sporadic jeers .
at the warsaw uprising cemetery , he was met with a sign that read : " heil schröder , do n't come to the place where our countrymen are honoured who were murdered by your countrymen - without compensation even today . "
u.s. secretary of state colin powell and britain 's deputy prime minister , john prescott were also among those marking the anniversary with the laying of wreaths and a commemorative concert , as well as the opening of new , interactive museum about the uprising .
russia did not send a representative to the ceremonies .
rebellion was timed for maximum effect the partisan uprising broke out at 5 o 'clock on august 1 , 1944 , following the broadcast of the code signal " tempest . "
the first the german army knew of the battle to liberate warsaw - the first european capital they had taken nearly five years before - was a wave of explosions followed by rifle fire throughout the city .
the timing of the uprising was chosen for maximum effect as the germans appeared to be about to withdraw from warsaw after being forced to retreat over the previous few months in the face of a sustained attack from the red army , which had forced the wehrmacht out of the baltic states , belorussia and western poland .
an estimated 40,000 troops , including 4,000 women , made up the polish home army , or armia krajowa , under the command of general tadeusz ' bor ' komorowski , who estimated they could hold out for about five days without help .
in fact , the insurgents held out for much longer than that , battling the vastly superior german army for 63 days .
komorowski rallied his troops at the start of battle with a rousing call to arms : " today i have issued the order you have been waiting for , the order to begin open battle against poland 's age-old enemy , the german invader . "
" after nearly five years of uninterrupted and heavy fighting underground , today you will carry your arms in the open in order to free your country again and to render exemplary punishment to the german criminals for the terror and crimes committed on polish soil . "
soviets , allies left poles to their fate although barely armed , the plan was to hold out for the rapidly advancing soviet army , which had just reached the outskirts of warsaw at the time of the uprising .
there were also hopes that britain and the united states , would come to their aid in time .
in reality , little assistance was offered , and the red army halted its advance and observed the battle from the other side of warsaw 's vistula river , watching as the ss commanders carried out hitler 's orders to level the city and kill or deport its inhabitants .
more than 200,000 civilians were killed and warsaw was left in ruins .
months later , the soviet army took over a city of rubble and stalin installed a puppet government which occupied poland for more than four decades . dw staff -lrb- nda / ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german leader rejects restitution claims speaking at an event in warsaw to commemorate the 1944 uprising against the nazis , chancellor gerhard schröder made clear that his government did not endorse german claims for the return of ancestral property in poland .

schröder 's words were followed by applause .
later he garnered even more of his hosts ' approval by assuring that germany would not support restitution claims to return ancestral property to germans who fled or were expelled from eastern europe after the nazis ' defeat .
the issue has dogged polish-german relations for years .
polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said schröder 's speech had " great meaning for poland . "
it was more than a political declaration , cimoszewicz told polish broadcasting .
schröder 's rejection of restitution claims could be " very important " to fend off claims to the european court or the human rights tribunal , he said .
although schröder was warmly received throughout his visit to poland , he did encounter sporadic jeers .
at the warsaw uprising cemetery , he was met with a sign that read : " heil schröder , do n't come to the place where our countrymen are honoured who were murdered by your countrymen - without compensation even today . "
u.s. secretary of state colin powell and britain 's deputy prime minister , john prescott were also among those marking the anniversary with the laying of wreaths and a commemorative concert , as well as the opening of new , interactive museum about the uprising .
russia did not send a representative to the ceremonies .
rebellion was timed for maximum effect the partisan uprising broke out at 5 o 'clock on august 1 , 1944 , following the broadcast of the code signal " tempest . "
the first the german army knew of the battle to liberate warsaw - the first european capital they had taken nearly five years before - was a wave of explosions followed by rifle fire throughout the city .
the timing of the uprising was chosen for maximum effect as the germans appeared to be about to withdraw from warsaw after being forced to retreat over the previous few months in the face of a sustained attack from the red army , which had forced the wehrmacht out of the baltic states , belorussia and western poland .
an estimated 40,000 troops , including 4,000 women , made up the polish home army , or armia krajowa , under the command of general tadeusz ' bor ' komorowski , who estimated they could hold out for about five days without help .
in fact , the insurgents held out for much longer than that , battling the vastly superior german army for 63 days .
komorowski rallied his troops at the start of battle with a rousing call to arms : " today i have issued the order you have been waiting for , the order to begin open battle against poland 's age-old enemy , the german invader . "
" after nearly five years of uninterrupted and heavy fighting underground , today you will carry your arms in the open in order to free your country again and to render exemplary punishment to the german criminals for the terror and crimes committed on polish soil . "
soviets , allies left poles to their fate although barely armed , the plan was to hold out for the rapidly advancing soviet army , which had just reached the outskirts of warsaw at the time of the uprising .
there were also hopes that britain and the united states , would come to their aid in time .
in reality , little assistance was offered , and the red army halted its advance and observed the battle from the other side of warsaw 's vistula river , watching as the ss commanders carried out hitler 's orders to level the city and kill or deport its inhabitants .
more than 200,000 civilians were killed and warsaw was left in ruins .
months later , the soviet army took over a city of rubble and stalin installed a puppet government which occupied poland for more than four decades . dw staff -lrb- nda / ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german leader rejects restitution claims speaking at an event in warsaw to commemorate the 1944 uprising against the nazis , chancellor gerhard schröder made clear that his government did not endorse german claims for the return of ancestral property in poland .

polish leaders had expected the german chancellor to take a clear stance on such restitution claims , and amid the odd whistle and boo from the crowd he lived up to anticipations : " we germans know full well who started the war and who were its first victims , " schröder said acknowledging the nazi atrocities in poland and added that because of german 's blame there was no longer room left for discussing restitution claims which " turn history on its head . "
" property issues related to world war ii are no longer a subject of controversy between our two governments .
neither the german government nor any other serious political force supports any restitution claims still being voiced .
this is our position , and we won ’ t hesitate to make this position clear before international courts , if need be , " he stressed .
even with schröder 's assurances , polish foreign minister woldzimierz cimoszewicz warned that the issue may not be closed .
" one could imagine theoretically that german expellees file claims with european tribunals even if their cases are rejected by the polish and german courts , " he said .
while praising schröder for emphasizing the pride and patriotism of the polish people , erika steinbach , president of the federation of expellees , blamed the chancellor for leaving expellees in legal limbo by not changing german legislation .
time to move on jerzy stabinsky , a polish author who was in warsaw during the 1944 uprising against the nazi occupiers , said it ’ s high time the two nations left their war-related debates behind to look forward to a future as members of and partners in the european union .
" a lot of time has passed since the events in 1944 , " he said and stressed that it is time to move on .
" the scars of war should have healed , and there are now more important tasks for our two nations to tackle jointly . "

chancellor schroeder said governments could only do so much to promote a better understanding between the two nations .
he called on ordinary people to intensify their contacts and learn each other ’ s language : " we must not let up in our efforts to promote closer cultural ties between our societies , " he said and pointed to exchange efforts between young poles and germans which will help shape the common future .
" by doing so , we ’ ll act in the spirit of those who lost their lives in the warsaw uprising , " the chancellor vowed .
schröder also used the occasion to reject a private german group ’ s idea to build a memorial center in berlin commemorating german expellees .
he dismissed the plan as " unacceptable " because it would unilaterally spotlight german suffering and play down its origin in nazi aggression . dw staff -lrb- hg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland commemorates 1944 partisan uprising on august 1 , 1944 , polish partisans began a battle to retake warsaw from its nazi occupiers .

polish leaders had expected the german chancellor to take a clear stance on such restitution claims , and amid the odd whistle and boo from the crowd he lived up to anticipations : " we germans know full well who started the war and who were its first victims , " schröder said acknowledging the nazi atrocities in poland and added that because of german 's blame there was no longer room left for discussing restitution claims which " turn history on its head . "
" property issues related to world war ii are no longer a subject of controversy between our two governments .
neither the german government nor any other serious political force supports any restitution claims still being voiced .
this is our position , and we won ’ t hesitate to make this position clear before international courts , if need be , " he stressed .
even with schröder 's assurances , polish foreign minister woldzimierz cimoszewicz warned that the issue may not be closed .
" one could imagine theoretically that german expellees file claims with european tribunals even if their cases are rejected by the polish and german courts , " he said .
while praising schröder for emphasizing the pride and patriotism of the polish people , erika steinbach , president of the federation of expellees , blamed the chancellor for leaving expellees in legal limbo by not changing german legislation .

" the scars of war should have healed , and there are now more important tasks for our two nations to tackle jointly . "

" by doing so , we ’ ll act in the spirit of those who lost their lives in the warsaw uprising , " the chancellor vowed .

" after four years of mulling over claims by the families of jewish slave laborers who worked in nazi death camps before and during world war ii , and 59 years after the camps were liberated by advancing allied troops , the german government has agreed to pay € 6,800 -lrb- $ 8172 -rrb- each in compensation .
the sum has caused outrage among relatives , survivors and campaigners as it is much less than the € 7,669.38 german law had set for individual payment .
millions of people , many of them jewish , were ordered by the nazis to work in labor camps .
ever since the end of wwii , jewish groups have been campaigning for compensation for survivors of these work camps , which have become synonymous with the atrocities of the nazis .
the compensation was agreed in principle by the german government in 2000 but subsequent bureaucratic stalling and bundles of red tape has meant that it has taken since then to finalize the amount to be paid to each survivor .
the total sum earmarked for the use of compensation was € 4.9 billion which would come from " the foundation : remembrance , responsibility and future , " the organization funded by the german government and german businesses that profited from slave labor .
running out of time the number of surviving former slave laborers eligible for compensation under the government scheme totaled half a million in 1999 .
those who have died since , have passed the eligibility to their surviving relatives .
the foundation stated in june this year that it wanted to complete the final compensation payments by mid-2005 as more survivors reached the end of their days .

" after four years of mulling over claims by the families of jewish slave laborers who worked in nazi death camps before and during world war ii , and 59 years after the camps were liberated by advancing allied troops , the german government has agreed to pay € 6,800 -lrb- $ 8172 -rrb- each in compensation .
the sum has caused outrage among relatives , survivors and campaigners as it is much less than the € 7,669.38 german law had set for individual payment .
millions of people , many of them jewish , were ordered by the nazis to work in labor camps .
ever since the end of wwii , jewish groups have been campaigning for compensation for survivors of these work camps , which have become synonymous with the atrocities of the nazis .
the compensation was agreed in principle by the german government in 2000 but subsequent bureaucratic stalling and bundles of red tape has meant that it has taken since then to finalize the amount to be paid to each survivor .
the total sum earmarked for the use of compensation was € 4.9 billion which would come from " the foundation : remembrance , responsibility and future , " the organization funded by the german government and german businesses that profited from slave labor .
running out of time the number of surviving former slave laborers eligible for compensation under the government scheme totaled half a million in 1999 .

polish leaders had expected the german chancellor to take a clear stance on such restitution claims , and amid the odd whistle and boo from the crowd he lived up to anticipations : " we germans know full well who started the war and who were its first victims , " schröder said acknowledging the nazi atrocities in poland and added that because of german 's blame there was no longer room left for discussing restitution claims which " turn history on its head . "
" property issues related to world war ii are no longer a subject of controversy between our two governments .
neither the german government nor any other serious political force supports any restitution claims still being voiced .
this is our position , and we won ’ t hesitate to make this position clear before international courts , if need be , " he stressed .
even with schröder 's assurances , polish foreign minister woldzimierz cimoszewicz warned that the issue may not be closed .
" one could imagine theoretically that german expellees file claims with european tribunals even if their cases are rejected by the polish and german courts , " he said .
while praising schröder for emphasizing the pride and patriotism of the polish people , erika steinbach , president of the federation of expellees , blamed the chancellor for leaving expellees in legal limbo by not changing german legislation .

" a lot of time has passed since the events in 1944 , " he said and stressed that it is time to move on .
" the scars of war should have healed , and there are now more important tasks for our two nations to tackle jointly . "

" by doing so , we ’ ll act in the spirit of those who lost their lives in the warsaw uprising , " the chancellor vowed .

the international community could have acted earlier . the un security council finally agreed on a resolution on sudan .
in view of the members ' closely intertwined interests , only politicians ' dreams could have anticipated sharper or even military actions .
the resolution 's key passage gives the sudanese government 30 days ' time to guarantee the safety of the people in darfur .
after this time limit , the security council will decide what further measures are necessary .
thus , the security council reckons with uncertain activities in the future , where actions are already overdue .
the region 's future remains in question , and what hope can the oppressed refugees gain from the practically cynical wrestling over the word " sanctions , " which was finally watered down to " measures ? "
the case of darfur again raises the question of how the international community - whether individual countries or international organizations - can promote peace to resolve conflicts .
the example of sudan does n't provide an answer - at least not an encouraging one .
instead , darfur has tragically revealed the international community 's impotence .
consistently turning a blind eye , underestimating , playing down and ignoring the actual situation , combined with pursuing individual interests provided the catastrophe in darfur with a devastating backdrop .
strategic maneuvering prevails where decisiveness and quick action were overdue , strategic maneuvers and divergences prevailed .
beyond desperately needed humanitarian aid , the international community , sharply contrasted by an immense media campaign , lacks a concept for long-term solutions that could make a sustainable peace in the region possible .
the escalating situation in darfur in past months and the killing it caused as well as the streams of refugees suggest that strategic maneuvering and demagogy prevail over african and international diplomatic mediation attempts .
another lesson shows that the international community can only intervene energetically in crises such as in darfur when it is n't weighed down by internal rivalries .
the tragedy in darfur was also substantially influenced not by international ignorance , but by opposing political , economic and cultural interests .
a neglected continent furthermore , like other african regions , sudan was for too long a neglected urgent case - with devastating consequences .
certainly , the african union has so far failed to prove that it can resolve african conflicts itself .
however , action rarely reflects african concepts .
the inception , execution and completion of international missions are usually determined by interests outside of africa .
what remains again is a united nations whose credibility has been shaken , a rather reserved international willingness to take action and the continuing discussion not only about early recognition of crisis situations but also about rapid reaction .
the hesitancy , the tactical preconditions , the political ulterior motives in the case of darfur result in the question of whether the international community gages conflicts with a double standard .
in a self-critical condemnation of the rwandan genocide , former u.s. president bill clinton said : " we did n't act quickly enough after the killing began .
we did not immediately call these crimes by their rightful name . "
and un secretary general kofi annan said upon presentation of an action plan for conflict prevention in april : " only so can we honor the victims whom we remember today .

the international community could have acted earlier . the un security council finally agreed on a resolution on sudan .
in view of the members ' closely intertwined interests , only politicians ' dreams could have anticipated sharper or even military actions .
the resolution 's key passage gives the sudanese government 30 days ' time to guarantee the safety of the people in darfur .
after this time limit , the security council will decide what further measures are necessary .
thus , the security council reckons with uncertain activities in the future , where actions are already overdue .
the region 's future remains in question , and what hope can the oppressed refugees gain from the practically cynical wrestling over the word " sanctions , " which was finally watered down to " measures ? "
the case of darfur again raises the question of how the international community - whether individual countries or international organizations - can promote peace to resolve conflicts .
the example of sudan does n't provide an answer - at least not an encouraging one .
instead , darfur has tragically revealed the international community 's impotence .
consistently turning a blind eye , underestimating , playing down and ignoring the actual situation , combined with pursuing individual interests provided the catastrophe in darfur with a devastating backdrop .
strategic maneuvering prevails where decisiveness and quick action were overdue , strategic maneuvers and divergences prevailed .
beyond desperately needed humanitarian aid , the international community , sharply contrasted by an immense media campaign , lacks a concept for long-term solutions that could make a sustainable peace in the region possible .
the escalating situation in darfur in past months and the killing it caused as well as the streams of refugees suggest that strategic maneuvering and demagogy prevail over african and international diplomatic mediation attempts .
another lesson shows that the international community can only intervene energetically in crises such as in darfur when it is n't weighed down by internal rivalries .
the tragedy in darfur was also substantially influenced not by international ignorance , but by opposing political , economic and cultural interests .
a neglected continent furthermore , like other african regions , sudan was for too long a neglected urgent case - with devastating consequences .
certainly , the african union has so far failed to prove that it can resolve african conflicts itself .
however , action rarely reflects african concepts .
the inception , execution and completion of international missions are usually determined by interests outside of africa .
what remains again is a united nations whose credibility has been shaken , a rather reserved international willingness to take action and the continuing discussion not only about early recognition of crisis situations but also about rapid reaction .
the hesitancy , the tactical preconditions , the political ulterior motives in the case of darfur result in the question of whether the international community gages conflicts with a double standard .
in a self-critical condemnation of the rwandan genocide , former u.s. president bill clinton said : " we did n't act quickly enough after the killing began .
we did not immediately call these crimes by their rightful name . "
and un secretary general kofi annan said upon presentation of an action plan for conflict prevention in april : " only so can we honor the victims whom we remember today .

sixty years to the day , german chancellor gerhard schröder led a list of dignitaries commemorating the uprising . three days of commemorations came to a climax on sunday when veterans laid wreaths and sang patriotic songs as world leaders and survivors joined together in warsaw to mark the 60th anniversary of the uprising by polish partisans against nazi occupiers towards the end of world war ii .
among the dignitaries attending were gerhard schröder , the first german chancellor to take part in the annual ceremonies .
" today we bow in shame in the face of the nazi troops ' crimes , " schröder said at the ceremony sunday .
" at this place of polish pride and german shame , we hope for reconciliation and peace . "
schröder 's words were followed by applause .
later he garnered even more of his hosts ' approval by assuring that germany would not support restitution claims to return ancestral property to germans who fled or were expelled from eastern europe after the nazis ' defeat .
the issue has dogged polish-german relations for years .
polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said schröder 's speech had " great meaning for poland . "
it was more than a political declaration , cimoszewicz told polish broadcasting .
schröder 's rejection of restitution claims could be " very important " to fend off claims to the european court or the human rights tribunal , he said .
although schröder was warmly received throughout his visit to poland , he did encounter sporadic jeers .
at the warsaw uprising cemetery , he was met with a sign that read : " heil schröder , do n't come to the place where our countrymen are honoured who were murdered by your countrymen - without compensation even today . "
u.s. secretary of state colin powell and britain 's deputy prime minister , john prescott were also among those marking the anniversary with the laying of wreaths and a commemorative concert , as well as the opening of new , interactive museum about the uprising .
russia did not send a representative to the ceremonies .
rebellion was timed for maximum effect the partisan uprising broke out at 5 o 'clock on august 1 , 1944 , following the broadcast of the code signal " tempest . "
the first the german army knew of the battle to liberate warsaw - the first european capital they had taken nearly five years before - was a wave of explosions followed by rifle fire throughout the city .
the timing of the uprising was chosen for maximum effect as the germans appeared to be about to withdraw from warsaw after being forced to retreat over the previous few months in the face of a sustained attack from the red army , which had forced the wehrmacht out of the baltic states , belorussia and western poland .
an estimated 40,000 troops , including 4,000 women , made up the polish home army , or armia krajowa , under the command of general tadeusz ' bor ' komorowski , who estimated they could hold out for about five days without help .
in fact , the insurgents held out for much longer than that , battling the vastly superior german army for 63 days .
komorowski rallied his troops at the start of battle with a rousing call to arms : " today i have issued the order you have been waiting for , the order to begin open battle against poland 's age-old enemy , the german invader . "
" after nearly five years of uninterrupted and heavy fighting underground , today you will carry your arms in the open in order to free your country again and to render exemplary punishment to the german criminals for the terror and crimes committed on polish soil . "
soviets , allies left poles to their fate although barely armed , the plan was to hold out for the rapidly advancing soviet army , which had just reached the outskirts of warsaw at the time of the uprising .
there were also hopes that britain and the united states , would come to their aid in time .
in reality , little assistance was offered , and the red army halted its advance and observed the battle from the other side of warsaw 's vistula river , watching as the ss commanders carried out hitler 's orders to level the city and kill or deport its inhabitants .
more than 200,000 civilians were killed and warsaw was left in ruins .
months later , the soviet army took over a city of rubble and stalin installed a puppet government which occupied poland for more than four decades . dw staff -lrb- nda / ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german leader rejects restitution claims speaking at an event in warsaw to commemorate the 1944 uprising against the nazis , chancellor gerhard schröder made clear that his government did not endorse german claims for the return of ancestral property in poland .

rebellion was timed for maximum effect the partisan uprising broke out at 5 o 'clock on august 1 , 1944 , following the broadcast of the code signal " tempest . "
the first the german army knew of the battle to liberate warsaw - the first european capital they had taken nearly five years before - was a wave of explosions followed by rifle fire throughout the city .
the timing of the uprising was chosen for maximum effect as the germans appeared to be about to withdraw from warsaw after being forced to retreat over the previous few months in the face of a sustained attack from the red army , which had forced the wehrmacht out of the baltic states , belorussia and western poland .
an estimated 40,000 troops , including 4,000 women , made up the polish home army , or armia krajowa , under the command of general tadeusz ' bor ' komorowski , who estimated they could hold out for about five days without help .
in fact , the insurgents held out for much longer than that , battling the vastly superior german army for 63 days .
komorowski rallied his troops at the start of battle with a rousing call to arms : " today i have issued the order you have been waiting for , the order to begin open battle against poland 's age-old enemy , the german invader . "
" after nearly five years of uninterrupted and heavy fighting underground , today you will carry your arms in the open in order to free your country again and to render exemplary punishment to the german criminals for the terror and crimes committed on polish soil . "
soviets , allies left poles to their fate although barely armed , the plan was to hold out for the rapidly advancing soviet army , which had just reached the outskirts of warsaw at the time of the uprising .
there were also hopes that britain and the united states , would come to their aid in time .
in reality , little assistance was offered , and the red army halted its advance and observed the battle from the other side of warsaw 's vistula river , watching as the ss commanders carried out hitler 's orders to level the city and kill or deport its inhabitants .
more than 200,000 civilians were killed and warsaw was left in ruins .
months later , the soviet army took over a city of rubble and stalin installed a puppet government which occupied poland for more than four decades . dw staff -lrb- nda / ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german leader rejects restitution claims speaking at an event in warsaw to commemorate the 1944 uprising against the nazis , chancellor gerhard schröder made clear that his government did not endorse german claims for the return of ancestral property in poland .

when a group of computer scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent germany 's first e-mail 20 years ago , they had no idea they were heralding in the digital age . even though it has only been a part of our collective consciousness for the last decade , for most people life without e-mail would be unimaginable .
in both the business and private spheres , e-mail has long become part of our daily fabric .
but what is an obvious part of daily life today was practically unthinkable 20 years ago when information scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent the first german e-mail .
at that time , understated internet pioneer werner zorn described the event as a " very exciting , " development .
on august 2 , 1984 , zorn and a colleague sent the first-ever german e-mail .
it was his response to the official welcoming e-mail from csnet , a united states-developed electronic communication platform for scientists .
clicking into history it was a mouse click of historical importance .
if the senders of the electronic mail had had any clue how important the event was , they probably would have opened a bottle of champagne .
" we first learned the importance of august 2 later on , " zorn told the german news agency ddp .
back then , zorn 's e-mail address was simple to remember : zorn @ germany .
" what was new technologically at the time was that this was part of an open computer network , " he recalled .
the standardized interface made it possible for more and more people to get connected , and ultimately the technology would usurp the outmoded idea of centrally administered networks .
at the time , karlsruhe became the main mode for e-mails being sent to and from germany after it signed a contract with csnet .
with the opening of the node , germany became the fourth country to become part of the network , following canada , sweden and israel .
in germany , the network eased the work of scientists who needed to communicate with one another .
the country 's prestigious fraunhofer and max planck institutes were the first customers , followed quickly by major industrial companies like siemens and basf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has given germans an instant connection with the rest of the world .
with the working title of " interconnection through networks , " the computer scientists began their work on bringing the internet to germany in 1982 as part of a federal project to build a research network .
zorn and the professors and students around him were given the responsibility not only of connecting germany to international networks but also for making it available to individual scientists who needed access to the collective knowledge of others around the world .
after two years of work , the first successful test came on august 2 , 1984 .
trouble in paradise - for a minute zorn 's success also ran into some unexpected resistance - mainly from institutions that saw the work being done in karlsruhe as unwanted competition .
one consequence was that the university stopped receiving financial assistance for the project .
but it did n't matter much - the development was so widely accepted and adopted that the university made enough money installing mail connections for other organizations that it could ensure the project 's survival .
the full shift to the internet came in 1989 , bringing the first direct internet connections between germany and the us .
today the main internet servers in germany are still hosted in karlsruhe at the firm schlund and partner , where more the 3 million internet domains are managed - more domains than in any other european country .
life before wormy spam the internet certainly changed life for many in germany , but it also brought real problems with it , like spam , which would become such a huge pest 20 years later that it would cause billions of euros in damages for european companies and threaten the utility of e-mail for many .
mass spams are also often used to spread worms and other viruses across the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few germans are familiar with the unique taste of this american pork product .
but they all know its electronic doppelgänger .
anti-virus software-maker mcafee said firms are forced to spend up to € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- a year to prevent and eliminate virus and junk e-mail attacks .
the german government - which found itself under attack in may , logging 510,000 unwanted e-mails in just one week - allocates about € 7 million of its € 32 billion annual it budget for security .
under a european union directive , all member states are required to pass stringent privacy laws that make spam a crime .
but in may , the european commission criticized germany for not doing enough , legally , to stop its spread .
the country 's strict data protection laws have so far made it difficult for politicians to tackle the problem of e-mail .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government proposed a bill earlier this year designed to punish spam abusers , but the bill is still awaiting a vote in parliament .

when a group of computer scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent germany 's first e-mail 20 years ago , they had no idea they were heralding in the digital age . even though it has only been a part of our collective consciousness for the last decade , for most people life without e-mail would be unimaginable .
in both the business and private spheres , e-mail has long become part of our daily fabric .
but what is an obvious part of daily life today was practically unthinkable 20 years ago when information scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent the first german e-mail .
at that time , understated internet pioneer werner zorn described the event as a " very exciting , " development .
on august 2 , 1984 , zorn and a colleague sent the first-ever german e-mail .
it was his response to the official welcoming e-mail from csnet , a united states-developed electronic communication platform for scientists .
clicking into history it was a mouse click of historical importance .
if the senders of the electronic mail had had any clue how important the event was , they probably would have opened a bottle of champagne .
" we first learned the importance of august 2 later on , " zorn told the german news agency ddp .
back then , zorn 's e-mail address was simple to remember : zorn @ germany .
" what was new technologically at the time was that this was part of an open computer network , " he recalled .
the standardized interface made it possible for more and more people to get connected , and ultimately the technology would usurp the outmoded idea of centrally administered networks .
at the time , karlsruhe became the main mode for e-mails being sent to and from germany after it signed a contract with csnet .
with the opening of the node , germany became the fourth country to become part of the network , following canada , sweden and israel .
in germany , the network eased the work of scientists who needed to communicate with one another .
the country 's prestigious fraunhofer and max planck institutes were the first customers , followed quickly by major industrial companies like siemens and basf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has given germans an instant connection with the rest of the world .
with the working title of " interconnection through networks , " the computer scientists began their work on bringing the internet to germany in 1982 as part of a federal project to build a research network .
zorn and the professors and students around him were given the responsibility not only of connecting germany to international networks but also for making it available to individual scientists who needed access to the collective knowledge of others around the world .
after two years of work , the first successful test came on august 2 , 1984 .
trouble in paradise - for a minute zorn 's success also ran into some unexpected resistance - mainly from institutions that saw the work being done in karlsruhe as unwanted competition .
one consequence was that the university stopped receiving financial assistance for the project .
but it did n't matter much - the development was so widely accepted and adopted that the university made enough money installing mail connections for other organizations that it could ensure the project 's survival .
the full shift to the internet came in 1989 , bringing the first direct internet connections between germany and the us .
today the main internet servers in germany are still hosted in karlsruhe at the firm schlund and partner , where more the 3 million internet domains are managed - more domains than in any other european country .
life before wormy spam the internet certainly changed life for many in germany , but it also brought real problems with it , like spam , which would become such a huge pest 20 years later that it would cause billions of euros in damages for european companies and threaten the utility of e-mail for many .

the eu 's new commission president has offered the next german commissioner , günter verheugen , the industry portfolio - a position short of what berlin had hoped for . according to german news magazine focus , newly named eu commission president josé manuel durão barroso has suggested that günter verheugen , who is currently responsible for enlargement , be moved to industry starting in november .
this falls short of the influential economic post that german chancellor gerhard schröder had been pushing for .
in the last few weeks the german leader had made no secret of his expectations of seeing a fellow countrymen head up a powerful commission and had run amiss with barroso , who said he did not appoint commissioners at the behest of any one country .
instead , the big posts , such as competition and internal markets , are expected to go the new french and british commissioners .
the announcement met with disappointment not only within schröder 's government , but among the german opposition as well .
" that is a lightweight commissioner and falls well below our expectations , " said christian social union 's economics expert hans michelbach about the industry portfolio .
24 vacancies to fill but nothing has been set in stone .
barroso has said that he will present his team of 24 commissioners towards the end of august , leaving several denominators up in the air .
the president has already made clear that he does not want any first and second class commissioners on his team - a reference to germany 's demands for a high profile " super commissioner " - and has called for at least eight women to head up the various eu executive offices .

the eu 's new commission president has offered the next german commissioner , günter verheugen , the industry portfolio - a position short of what berlin had hoped for . according to german news magazine focus , newly named eu commission president josé manuel durão barroso has suggested that günter verheugen , who is currently responsible for enlargement , be moved to industry starting in november .
this falls short of the influential economic post that german chancellor gerhard schröder had been pushing for .
in the last few weeks the german leader had made no secret of his expectations of seeing a fellow countrymen head up a powerful commission and had run amiss with barroso , who said he did not appoint commissioners at the behest of any one country .
instead , the big posts , such as competition and internal markets , are expected to go the new french and british commissioners .
the announcement met with disappointment not only within schröder 's government , but among the german opposition as well .
" that is a lightweight commissioner and falls well below our expectations , " said christian social union 's economics expert hans michelbach about the industry portfolio .
24 vacancies to fill but nothing has been set in stone .
barroso has said that he will present his team of 24 commissioners towards the end of august , leaving several denominators up in the air .
the president has already made clear that he does not want any first and second class commissioners on his team - a reference to germany 's demands for a high profile " super commissioner " - and has called for at least eight women to head up the various eu executive offices .

in an interview , the social democrat said the eu should examine whether a " test center could be created in northern africa . "
however , the head of the opposition neo-liberal free democrats , guido westerwelle , said the government should end its debate over possible processing centers in africa because he believes they are unconstitutional .
human rights groups have also criticized schily 's proposal , citing possible violations of the refugee provisions in the geneva convention .
but schily has said the constitution does not apply because the centers would be outside of eu jurisdiction .
the current debate broke out last month after the german aid organization cap anamur rescued several dozen african refugees from their flimsy boat and illegally took them to port in italy .

the national railway said it would eliminate 25 percent of its 4,000 positions at ticket counters in train stations across the country .
selling tickets for long-distance journeys alone costs the company is € 500 million a year against sales of € 3 billion , and it is looking to dramatically cut costs .
in 2000 , the company reduced the number of ticket counters and travel centers in stations from 896 to 592 .
the company wants to dramatically increase the percentage of customers who buy their tickets over the internet or from automated machines in stations .
according to the süddeutsche report , bahn 's long-distance , high-speed and intercity trains are currently only running at 40 percent of their passenger capacities .
the paper cited an internal government report stating that this figure would have to rise at least to 50 percent to make deutsche bahn attractive to stock market investors .
the company is seeking to raise passenger levels through special offers that include € 29 tickets to anywhere in germany during august and as little as € 39 to destinations in neighboring countries , like holland or austria . dw-world.de taking stock of deutsche bahn 10 years on germany 's railway celebrates a decade as a private company on wednesday .

polish leaders had expected the german chancellor to take a clear stance on such restitution claims , and amid the odd whistle and boo from the crowd he lived up to anticipations : " we germans know full well who started the war and who were its first victims , " schröder said acknowledging the nazi atrocities in poland and added that because of german 's blame there was no longer room left for discussing restitution claims which " turn history on its head . "
" property issues related to world war ii are no longer a subject of controversy between our two governments .
neither the german government nor any other serious political force supports any restitution claims still being voiced .
this is our position , and we won ’ t hesitate to make this position clear before international courts , if need be , " he stressed .
even with schröder 's assurances , polish foreign minister woldzimierz cimoszewicz warned that the issue may not be closed .
" one could imagine theoretically that german expellees file claims with european tribunals even if their cases are rejected by the polish and german courts , " he said .
while praising schröder for emphasizing the pride and patriotism of the polish people , erika steinbach , president of the federation of expellees , blamed the chancellor for leaving expellees in legal limbo by not changing german legislation .

polish leaders had expected the german chancellor to take a clear stance on such restitution claims , and amid the odd whistle and boo from the crowd he lived up to anticipations : " we germans know full well who started the war and who were its first victims , " schröder said acknowledging the nazi atrocities in poland and added that because of german 's blame there was no longer room left for discussing restitution claims which " turn history on its head .

the international community could have acted earlier . the un security council finally agreed on a resolution on sudan .
in view of the members ' closely intertwined interests , only politicians ' dreams could have anticipated sharper or even military actions .
the resolution 's key passage gives the sudanese government 30 days ' time to guarantee the safety of the people in darfur .
after this time limit , the security council will decide what further measures are necessary .
thus , the security council reckons with uncertain activities in the future , where actions are already overdue .
the region 's future remains in question , and what hope can the oppressed refugees gain from the practically cynical wrestling over the word " sanctions , " which was finally watered down to " measures ? "
the case of darfur again raises the question of how the international community - whether individual countries or international organizations - can promote peace to resolve conflicts .
the example of sudan does n't provide an answer - at least not an encouraging one .
instead , darfur has tragically revealed the international community 's impotence .
consistently turning a blind eye , underestimating , playing down and ignoring the actual situation , combined with pursuing individual interests provided the catastrophe in darfur with a devastating backdrop .
strategic maneuvering prevails where decisiveness and quick action were overdue , strategic maneuvers and divergences prevailed .
beyond desperately needed humanitarian aid , the international community , sharply contrasted by an immense media campaign , lacks a concept for long-term solutions that could make a sustainable peace in the region possible .
the escalating situation in darfur in past months and the killing it caused as well as the streams of refugees suggest that strategic maneuvering and demagogy prevail over african and international diplomatic mediation attempts .
another lesson shows that the international community can only intervene energetically in crises such as in darfur when it is n't weighed down by internal rivalries .
the tragedy in darfur was also substantially influenced not by international ignorance , but by opposing political , economic and cultural interests .
a neglected continent furthermore , like other african regions , sudan was for too long a neglected urgent case - with devastating consequences .
certainly , the african union has so far failed to prove that it can resolve african conflicts itself .
however , action rarely reflects african concepts .
the inception , execution and completion of international missions are usually determined by interests outside of africa .
what remains again is a united nations whose credibility has been shaken , a rather reserved international willingness to take action and the continuing discussion not only about early recognition of crisis situations but also about rapid reaction .
the hesitancy , the tactical preconditions , the political ulterior motives in the case of darfur result in the question of whether the international community gages conflicts with a double standard .
in a self-critical condemnation of the rwandan genocide , former u.s. president bill clinton said : " we did n't act quickly enough after the killing began .
we did not immediately call these crimes by their rightful name . "
and un secretary general kofi annan said upon presentation of an action plan for conflict prevention in april : " only so can we honor the victims whom we remember today .

the international community could have acted earlier . the un security council finally agreed on a resolution on sudan .
in view of the members ' closely intertwined interests , only politicians ' dreams could have anticipated sharper or even military actions .
the resolution 's key passage gives the sudanese government 30 days ' time to guarantee the safety of the people in darfur .
after this time limit , the security council will decide what further measures are necessary .
thus , the security council reckons with uncertain activities in the future , where actions are already overdue .
the region 's future remains in question , and what hope can the oppressed refugees gain from the practically cynical wrestling over the word " sanctions , " which was finally watered down to " measures ? "
the case of darfur again raises the question of how the international community - whether individual countries or international organizations - can promote peace to resolve conflicts .
the example of sudan does n't provide an answer - at least not an encouraging one .
instead , darfur has tragically revealed the international community 's impotence .
consistently turning a blind eye , underestimating , playing down and ignoring the actual situation , combined with pursuing individual interests provided the catastrophe in darfur with a devastating backdrop .
strategic maneuvering prevails where decisiveness and quick action were overdue , strategic maneuvers and divergences prevailed .
beyond desperately needed humanitarian aid , the international community , sharply contrasted by an immense media campaign , lacks a concept for long-term solutions that could make a sustainable peace in the region possible .
the escalating situation in darfur in past months and the killing it caused as well as the streams of refugees suggest that strategic maneuvering and demagogy prevail over african and international diplomatic mediation attempts .
another lesson shows that the international community can only intervene energetically in crises such as in darfur when it is n't weighed down by internal rivalries .
the tragedy in darfur was also substantially influenced not by international ignorance , but by opposing political , economic and cultural interests .
a neglected continent furthermore , like other african regions , sudan was for too long a neglected urgent case - with devastating consequences .
certainly , the african union has so far failed to prove that it can resolve african conflicts itself .
however , action rarely reflects african concepts .
the inception , execution and completion of international missions are usually determined by interests outside of africa .
what remains again is a united nations whose credibility has been shaken , a rather reserved international willingness to take action and the continuing discussion not only about early recognition of crisis situations but also about rapid reaction .
the hesitancy , the tactical preconditions , the political ulterior motives in the case of darfur result in the question of whether the international community gages conflicts with a double standard .
in a self-critical condemnation of the rwandan genocide , former u.s. president bill clinton said : " we did n't act quickly enough after the killing began .
we did not immediately call these crimes by their rightful name . "
and un secretary general kofi annan said upon presentation of an action plan for conflict prevention in april : " only so can we honor the victims whom we remember today .
only so can we save those who might be victims tomorrow . "

" after four years of mulling over claims by the families of jewish slave laborers who worked in nazi death camps before and during world war ii , and 59 years after the camps were liberated by advancing allied troops , the german government has agreed to pay € 6,800 -lrb- $ 8172 -rrb- each in compensation .
the sum has caused outrage among relatives , survivors and campaigners as it is much less than the € 7,669.38 german law had set for individual payment .
millions of people , many of them jewish , were ordered by the nazis to work in labor camps .
ever since the end of wwii , jewish groups have been campaigning for compensation for survivors of these work camps , which have become synonymous with the atrocities of the nazis .
the compensation was agreed in principle by the german government in 2000 but subsequent bureaucratic stalling and bundles of red tape has meant that it has taken since then to finalize the amount to be paid to each survivor .
the total sum earmarked for the use of compensation was € 4.9 billion which would come from " the foundation : remembrance , responsibility and future , " the organization funded by the german government and german businesses that profited from slave labor .
running out of time the number of surviving former slave laborers eligible for compensation under the government scheme totaled half a million in 1999 .
those who have died since , have passed the eligibility to their surviving relatives .
the foundation stated in june this year that it wanted to complete the final compensation payments by mid-2005 as more survivors reached the end of their days .
" many victims are now in their seventies and eighties , " said board of trustees chairman dieter kastrup at the time .
so far , some € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- have been distributed to victims by partner organizations such as the jewish claims conference -lrb- jcc -rrb- and the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .

" after four years of mulling over claims by the families of jewish slave laborers who worked in nazi death camps before and during world war ii , and 59 years after the camps were liberated by advancing allied troops , the german government has agreed to pay € 6,800 -lrb- $ 8172 -rrb- each in compensation .
the sum has caused outrage among relatives , survivors and campaigners as it is much less than the € 7,669.38 german law had set for individual payment .
millions of people , many of them jewish , were ordered by the nazis to work in labor camps .
ever since the end of wwii , jewish groups have been campaigning for compensation for survivors of these work camps , which have become synonymous with the atrocities of the nazis .
the compensation was agreed in principle by the german government in 2000 but subsequent bureaucratic stalling and bundles of red tape has meant that it has taken since then to finalize the amount to be paid to each survivor .
the total sum earmarked for the use of compensation was € 4.9 billion which would come from " the foundation : remembrance , responsibility and future , " the organization funded by the german government and german businesses that profited from slave labor .
running out of time the number of surviving former slave laborers eligible for compensation under the government scheme totaled half a million in 1999 .
those who have died since , have passed the eligibility to their surviving relatives .
the foundation stated in june this year that it wanted to complete the final compensation payments by mid-2005 as more survivors reached the end of their days .
" many victims are now in their seventies and eighties , " said board of trustees chairman dieter kastrup at the time .
so far , some € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- have been distributed to victims by partner organizations such as the jewish claims conference -lrb- jcc -rrb- and the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.08.2004 preventing new perpetrators großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each year , about 20,000 german children are sexually abused while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focussed on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators . standing in a swimming-pool and surrounded by children , he could sense the others eyeing him suspiciously .
he felt as if a huge slippery ball was floating on the water in front of him , a ball he was struggling to submerge so that no one else could see his shame .
losing control over his life because of his sexual fantasies involving children , the man sought help from christoph joseph ahlers , who works as a clinical psychologist and sexual therapist at the institute for sexology and sexual medicine at berlin 's charite hospital .
at the time , ahlers informed him that specialized treatments exist .
unfortunately , however , the institute did n't have enough funds nor the manpower to offer therapy , he regretted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : little help has been available so far for those seeking it " we can tell people what they have , we can tell them what can be done , but we can not do anything , " ahlers told dw-world .
" we have to send people back on the street without treatment . "
preventing new victims that 's bound to change now that the institute has secured private funding for a unique project to treat pedophiles before they end up in a courtroom , and before they are caught molesting a child .
starting in january , ahlers and his colleagues hope to sign up 120 people for the three-year program .
it 's a significant step , because by and large potential perpetrators - people who sense they have sexual fantasies involving children - have been off the radar screen .
therapy money primarily flows into victim 's groups and the treatment of imprisoned sex offenders .
although a german government initiative has set aside money for a 2005 project that will work with teenage offenders , it resembles previous programs in that most of the participants have already come to attention as child abusers .
" we 're just starting to be aware of the problem and are still lacking adequate perpetrator prevention programs , " said kai sachs , the executive director of the german society against child abuse and neglect , which advises professionals who deal with cases of child abuse .
according to him , the berlin project could provide data that might help jump-start similar programs elsewhere .
ahlers is already convinced that early intervention could help prevent the suffering of the 550 german children , who are sexually abused each day , according to the federal criminal police office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the program prevent the abuse of more children ?
" in the end it 's about victims and the prevention of new victims , " ahlers stressed , adding that few therapists are qualified or interested in taking on people with sexual fantasies about children .
" we 're doing this to protect children and help the patients , " he maintained .
" we want to prove that they are patients , that they can be treated and that the treatment helps , " he said .
will people sign up ?
while welcoming the new project , others questioned whether enough people would sign up for the treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely that convicted child abuser and murderer marc dutroux would have sought treatment " the question is : ' how do you reach them , " ' michael osterheider , the director of the department of forensic psychiatry and psychotherapy at the university of regensburg , told dw-world .
he noted that some pedophiles are convinced that they are doing nothing wrong and would like to see sex between adults and children legalized .
ahlers countered that he was not worried about finding participants , because the project targets pedophiles who suffer from their sexual desire and are looking for help .
" they are waiting for treatment , " he said .
" we 're trying to offer something where there was no help before . "
the berlin institute plans to launch a publicity campaign with newspaper ads in the fall to alert people to the program .
" we hope to appeal to all those who have realized that children play a role in their sexual fantasies , " ahlers said .
promoting responsibility during the project , participants will be split in three groups : in addition to a control group , which will not receive treatment right away , one section will receive group therapy and those people in another will engage in one-on-one therapy .
the sessions are geared to helping people identify their own sexuality and begin accepting the way they are , ahlers said , describing the treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whispering children " they have to learn that they bear no guilt for their feelings , but that they are responsible for their actions , " he said , explaining that patients had to learn to stop mistaking children 's behavior as sexual overtures .
during the therapy , patients are required to talk about their sexual desires and can receive medication that lowers their sex drive .
all participants must also sign an agreement , promising not to have sexual contact with children .
helping , not protecting that 's a promise that 's hard to police , argued georg kohaupt , a member of the executive committee of the federation of child protection centers in germany , which also offers some help for sex offenders .
" there can be no absolute protection of confidence as far as i 'm concerned , " kohaupt told dw-world , adding that he 's seen cases were people continue to have sexual contact with children during treatment .
" if it were that simple for them to stop , they would not need therapy , " kohaupt said .
but ahlers said that a certain level of trust between patient and therapist was necessary to start treatment in the first place .
participants who do n't comply with the abstinence rule would be asked to leave the program , he said .
he noted that while german therapists are prohibited by law from reporting patients to the police for crimes they reveal during therapy , participants in the program would be no more protected than anyone else .
" they still face the same prosecution by law enforcement authorities as before , " he said , adding that the only realistic therapeutic goal is to help people regain control over their sexual desires at all times .

he felt as if a huge slippery ball was floating on the water in front of him , a ball he was struggling to submerge so that no one else could see his shame .
losing control over his life because of his sexual fantasies involving children , the man sought help from christoph joseph ahlers , who works as a clinical psychologist and sexual therapist at the institute for sexology and sexual medicine at berlin 's charite hospital .
at the time , ahlers informed him that specialized treatments exist .
unfortunately , however , the institute did n't have enough funds nor the manpower to offer therapy , he regretted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : little help has been available so far for those seeking it " we can tell people what they have , we can tell them what can be done , but we can not do anything , " ahlers told dw-world .
" we have to send people back on the street without treatment . "
preventing new victims that 's bound to change now that the institute has secured private funding for a unique project to treat pedophiles before they end up in a courtroom , and before they are caught molesting a child .
starting in january , ahlers and his colleagues hope to sign up 120 people for the three-year program .
it 's a significant step , because by and large potential perpetrators - people who sense they have sexual fantasies involving children - have been off the radar screen .
therapy money primarily flows into victim 's groups and the treatment of imprisoned sex offenders .
although a german government initiative has set aside money for a 2005 project that will work with teenage offenders , it resembles previous programs in that most of the participants have already come to attention as child abusers .
" we 're just starting to be aware of the problem and are still lacking adequate perpetrator prevention programs , " said kai sachs , the executive director of the german society against child abuse and neglect , which advises professionals who deal with cases of child abuse .
according to him , the berlin project could provide data that might help jump-start similar programs elsewhere .
ahlers is already convinced that early intervention could help prevent the suffering of the 550 german children , who are sexually abused each day , according to the federal criminal police office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the program prevent the abuse of more children ?
" in the end it 's about victims and the prevention of new victims , " ahlers stressed , adding that few therapists are qualified or interested in taking on people with sexual fantasies about children .
" we 're doing this to protect children and help the patients , " he maintained .
" we want to prove that they are patients , that they can be treated and that the treatment helps , " he said .
will people sign up ?
while welcoming the new project , others questioned whether enough people would sign up for the treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely that convicted child abuser and murderer marc dutroux would have sought treatment " the question is : ' how do you reach them , " ' michael osterheider , the director of the department of forensic psychiatry and psychotherapy at the university of regensburg , told dw-world .
he noted that some pedophiles are convinced that they are doing nothing wrong and would like to see sex between adults and children legalized .
ahlers countered that he was not worried about finding participants , because the project targets pedophiles who suffer from their sexual desire and are looking for help .
" they are waiting for treatment , " he said .
" we 're trying to offer something where there was no help before . "
the berlin institute plans to launch a publicity campaign with newspaper ads in the fall to alert people to the program .
" we hope to appeal to all those who have realized that children play a role in their sexual fantasies , " ahlers said .
promoting responsibility during the project , participants will be split in three groups : in addition to a control group , which will not receive treatment right away , one section will receive group therapy and those people in another will engage in one-on-one therapy .
the sessions are geared to helping people identify their own sexuality and begin accepting the way they are , ahlers said , describing the treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whispering children " they have to learn that they bear no guilt for their feelings , but that they are responsible for their actions , " he said , explaining that patients had to learn to stop mistaking children 's behavior as sexual overtures .
during the therapy , patients are required to talk about their sexual desires and can receive medication that lowers their sex drive .
all participants must also sign an agreement , promising not to have sexual contact with children .
helping , not protecting that 's a promise that 's hard to police , argued georg kohaupt , a member of the executive committee of the federation of child protection centers in germany , which also offers some help for sex offenders .
" there can be no absolute protection of confidence as far as i 'm concerned , " kohaupt told dw-world , adding that he 's seen cases were people continue to have sexual contact with children during treatment .
" if it were that simple for them to stop , they would not need therapy , " kohaupt said .

participants who do n't comply with the abstinence rule would be asked to leave the program , he said .
he noted that while german therapists are prohibited by law from reporting patients to the police for crimes they reveal during therapy , participants in the program would be no more protected than anyone else .
" they still face the same prosecution by law enforcement authorities as before , " he said , adding that the only realistic therapeutic goal is to help people regain control over their sexual desires at all times .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.08.2004 preventing new perpetrators großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each year , about 20,000 german children are sexually abused while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focussed on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators . standing in a swimming-pool and surrounded by children , he could sense the others eyeing him suspiciously .
he felt as if a huge slippery ball was floating on the water in front of him , a ball he was struggling to submerge so that no one else could see his shame .
losing control over his life because of his sexual fantasies involving children , the man sought help from christoph joseph ahlers , who works as a clinical psychologist and sexual therapist at the institute for sexology and sexual medicine at berlin 's charite hospital .
at the time , ahlers informed him that specialized treatments exist .
unfortunately , however , the institute did n't have enough funds nor the manpower to offer therapy , he regretted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : little help has been available so far for those seeking it " we can tell people what they have , we can tell them what can be done , but we can not do anything , " ahlers told dw-world .
" we have to send people back on the street without treatment . "
preventing new victims that 's bound to change now that the institute has secured private funding for a unique project to treat pedophiles before they end up in a courtroom , and before they are caught molesting a child .
starting in january , ahlers and his colleagues hope to sign up 120 people for the three-year program .
it 's a significant step , because by and large potential perpetrators - people who sense they have sexual fantasies involving children - have been off the radar screen .
therapy money primarily flows into victim 's groups and the treatment of imprisoned sex offenders .
although a german government initiative has set aside money for a 2005 project that will work with teenage offenders , it resembles previous programs in that most of the participants have already come to attention as child abusers .
" we 're just starting to be aware of the problem and are still lacking adequate perpetrator prevention programs , " said kai sachs , the executive director of the german society against child abuse and neglect , which advises professionals who deal with cases of child abuse .
according to him , the berlin project could provide data that might help jump-start similar programs elsewhere .
ahlers is already convinced that early intervention could help prevent the suffering of the 550 german children , who are sexually abused each day , according to the federal criminal police office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the program prevent the abuse of more children ?
" in the end it 's about victims and the prevention of new victims , " ahlers stressed , adding that few therapists are qualified or interested in taking on people with sexual fantasies about children .
" we 're doing this to protect children and help the patients , " he maintained .
" we want to prove that they are patients , that they can be treated and that the treatment helps , " he said .
will people sign up ?
while welcoming the new project , others questioned whether enough people would sign up for the treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely that convicted child abuser and murderer marc dutroux would have sought treatment " the question is : ' how do you reach them , " ' michael osterheider , the director of the department of forensic psychiatry and psychotherapy at the university of regensburg , told dw-world .
he noted that some pedophiles are convinced that they are doing nothing wrong and would like to see sex between adults and children legalized .
ahlers countered that he was not worried about finding participants , because the project targets pedophiles who suffer from their sexual desire and are looking for help .
" they are waiting for treatment , " he said .
" we 're trying to offer something where there was no help before . "
the berlin institute plans to launch a publicity campaign with newspaper ads in the fall to alert people to the program .
" we hope to appeal to all those who have realized that children play a role in their sexual fantasies , " ahlers said .
promoting responsibility during the project , participants will be split in three groups : in addition to a control group , which will not receive treatment right away , one section will receive group therapy and those people in another will engage in one-on-one therapy .
the sessions are geared to helping people identify their own sexuality and begin accepting the way they are , ahlers said , describing the treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whispering children " they have to learn that they bear no guilt for their feelings , but that they are responsible for their actions , " he said , explaining that patients had to learn to stop mistaking children 's behavior as sexual overtures .
during the therapy , patients are required to talk about their sexual desires and can receive medication that lowers their sex drive .
all participants must also sign an agreement , promising not to have sexual contact with children .
helping , not protecting that 's a promise that 's hard to police , argued georg kohaupt , a member of the executive committee of the federation of child protection centers in germany , which also offers some help for sex offenders .
" there can be no absolute protection of confidence as far as i 'm concerned , " kohaupt told dw-world , adding that he 's seen cases were people continue to have sexual contact with children during treatment .
" if it were that simple for them to stop , they would not need therapy , " kohaupt said .
but ahlers said that a certain level of trust between patient and therapist was necessary to start treatment in the first place .
participants who do n't comply with the abstinence rule would be asked to leave the program , he said .
he noted that while german therapists are prohibited by law from reporting patients to the police for crimes they reveal during therapy , participants in the program would be no more protected than anyone else .
" they still face the same prosecution by law enforcement authorities as before , " he said , adding that the only realistic therapeutic goal is to help people regain control over their sexual desires at all times .

sixty years to the day , german chancellor gerhard schröder led a list of dignitaries commemorating the uprising . three days of commemorations came to a climax on sunday when veterans laid wreaths and sang patriotic songs as world leaders and survivors joined together in warsaw to mark the 60th anniversary of the uprising by polish partisans against nazi occupiers towards the end of world war ii .
among the dignitaries attending were gerhard schröder , the first german chancellor to take part in the annual ceremonies .
" today we bow in shame in the face of the nazi troops ' crimes , " schröder said at the ceremony sunday .
" at this place of polish pride and german shame , we hope for reconciliation and peace . "
schröder 's words were followed by applause .
later he garnered even more of his hosts ' approval by assuring that germany would not support restitution claims to return ancestral property to germans who fled or were expelled from eastern europe after the nazis ' defeat .
the issue has dogged polish-german relations for years .
polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said schröder 's speech had " great meaning for poland . "
it was more than a political declaration , cimoszewicz told polish broadcasting .
schröder 's rejection of restitution claims could be " very important " to fend off claims to the european court or the human rights tribunal , he said .
although schröder was warmly received throughout his visit to poland , he did encounter sporadic jeers .
at the warsaw uprising cemetery , he was met with a sign that read : " heil schröder , do n't come to the place where our countrymen are honoured who were murdered by your countrymen - without compensation even today . "
u.s. secretary of state colin powell and britain 's deputy prime minister , john prescott were also among those marking the anniversary with the laying of wreaths and a commemorative concert , as well as the opening of new , interactive museum about the uprising .
russia did not send a representative to the ceremonies .
rebellion was timed for maximum effect the partisan uprising broke out at 5 o 'clock on august 1 , 1944 , following the broadcast of the code signal " tempest . "
the first the german army knew of the battle to liberate warsaw - the first european capital they had taken nearly five years before - was a wave of explosions followed by rifle fire throughout the city .
the timing of the uprising was chosen for maximum effect as the germans appeared to be about to withdraw from warsaw after being forced to retreat over the previous few months in the face of a sustained attack from the red army , which had forced the wehrmacht out of the baltic states , belorussia and western poland .
an estimated 40,000 troops , including 4,000 women , made up the polish home army , or armia krajowa , under the command of general tadeusz ' bor ' komorowski , who estimated they could hold out for about five days without help .
in fact , the insurgents held out for much longer than that , battling the vastly superior german army for 63 days .
komorowski rallied his troops at the start of battle with a rousing call to arms : " today i have issued the order you have been waiting for , the order to begin open battle against poland 's age-old enemy , the german invader . "
" after nearly five years of uninterrupted and heavy fighting underground , today you will carry your arms in the open in order to free your country again and to render exemplary punishment to the german criminals for the terror and crimes committed on polish soil . "
soviets , allies left poles to their fate although barely armed , the plan was to hold out for the rapidly advancing soviet army , which had just reached the outskirts of warsaw at the time of the uprising .
there were also hopes that britain and the united states , would come to their aid in time .
in reality , little assistance was offered , and the red army halted its advance and observed the battle from the other side of warsaw 's vistula river , watching as the ss commanders carried out hitler 's orders to level the city and kill or deport its inhabitants .
more than 200,000 civilians were killed and warsaw was left in ruins .
months later , the soviet army took over a city of rubble and stalin installed a puppet government which occupied poland for more than four decades . dw staff -lrb- nda / ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german leader rejects restitution claims speaking at an event in warsaw to commemorate the 1944 uprising against the nazis , chancellor gerhard schröder made clear that his government did not endorse german claims for the return of ancestral property in poland .

sixty years to the day , german chancellor gerhard schröder led a list of dignitaries commemorating the uprising . three days of commemorations came to a climax on sunday when veterans laid wreaths and sang patriotic songs as world leaders and survivors joined together in warsaw to mark the 60th anniversary of the uprising by polish partisans against nazi occupiers towards the end of world war ii .
among the dignitaries attending were gerhard schröder , the first german chancellor to take part in the annual ceremonies .
" today we bow in shame in the face of the nazi troops ' crimes , " schröder said at the ceremony sunday .
" at this place of polish pride and german shame , we hope for reconciliation and peace . "
schröder 's words were followed by applause .
later he garnered even more of his hosts ' approval by assuring that germany would not support restitution claims to return ancestral property to germans who fled or were expelled from eastern europe after the nazis ' defeat .
the issue has dogged polish-german relations for years .
polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said schröder 's speech had " great meaning for poland . "
it was more than a political declaration , cimoszewicz told polish broadcasting .
schröder 's rejection of restitution claims could be " very important " to fend off claims to the european court or the human rights tribunal , he said .
although schröder was warmly received throughout his visit to poland , he did encounter sporadic jeers .
at the warsaw uprising cemetery , he was met with a sign that read : " heil schröder , do n't come to the place where our countrymen are honoured who were murdered by your countrymen - without compensation even today . "
u.s. secretary of state colin powell and britain 's deputy prime minister , john prescott were also among those marking the anniversary with the laying of wreaths and a commemorative concert , as well as the opening of new , interactive museum about the uprising .
russia did not send a representative to the ceremonies .
rebellion was timed for maximum effect the partisan uprising broke out at 5 o 'clock on august 1 , 1944 , following the broadcast of the code signal " tempest . "
the first the german army knew of the battle to liberate warsaw - the first european capital they had taken nearly five years before - was a wave of explosions followed by rifle fire throughout the city .
the timing of the uprising was chosen for maximum effect as the germans appeared to be about to withdraw from warsaw after being forced to retreat over the previous few months in the face of a sustained attack from the red army , which had forced the wehrmacht out of the baltic states , belorussia and western poland .
an estimated 40,000 troops , including 4,000 women , made up the polish home army , or armia krajowa , under the command of general tadeusz ' bor ' komorowski , who estimated they could hold out for about five days without help .
in fact , the insurgents held out for much longer than that , battling the vastly superior german army for 63 days .
komorowski rallied his troops at the start of battle with a rousing call to arms : " today i have issued the order you have been waiting for , the order to begin open battle against poland 's age-old enemy , the german invader . "
" after nearly five years of uninterrupted and heavy fighting underground , today you will carry your arms in the open in order to free your country again and to render exemplary punishment to the german criminals for the terror and crimes committed on polish soil . "
soviets , allies left poles to their fate although barely armed , the plan was to hold out for the rapidly advancing soviet army , which had just reached the outskirts of warsaw at the time of the uprising .
there were also hopes that britain and the united states , would come to their aid in time .
in reality , little assistance was offered , and the red army halted its advance and observed the battle from the other side of warsaw 's vistula river , watching as the ss commanders carried out hitler 's orders to level the city and kill or deport its inhabitants .
more than 200,000 civilians were killed and warsaw was left in ruins .
months later , the soviet army took over a city of rubble and stalin installed a puppet government which occupied poland for more than four decades . dw staff -lrb- nda / ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german leader rejects restitution claims speaking at an event in warsaw to commemorate the 1944 uprising against the nazis , chancellor gerhard schröder made clear that his government did not endorse german claims for the return of ancestral property in poland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.08.2004 opinion : an impotent international community großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gunmen have been slaughtering people in darfur for 16 months the un security council on friday gave sudan 30 days to stop the genocide in darfur without threatening the government with sanctions for non-compliance .
the international community could have acted earlier . the un security council finally agreed on a resolution on sudan .
in view of the members ' closely intertwined interests , only politicians ' dreams could have anticipated sharper or even military actions .
the resolution 's key passage gives the sudanese government 30 days ' time to guarantee the safety of the people in darfur .
after this time limit , the security council will decide what further measures are necessary .
thus , the security council reckons with uncertain activities in the future , where actions are already overdue .
the region 's future remains in question , and what hope can the oppressed refugees gain from the practically cynical wrestling over the word " sanctions , " which was finally watered down to " measures ? "
the case of darfur again raises the question of how the international community - whether individual countries or international organizations - can promote peace to resolve conflicts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.08.2004 opinion : an impotent international community großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gunmen have been slaughtering people in darfur for 16 months the un security council on friday gave sudan 30 days to stop the genocide in darfur without threatening the government with sanctions for non-compliance .
the international community could have acted earlier . the un security council finally agreed on a resolution on sudan .
in view of the members ' closely intertwined interests , only politicians ' dreams could have anticipated sharper or even military actions .
the resolution 's key passage gives the sudanese government 30 days ' time to guarantee the safety of the people in darfur .
after this time limit , the security council will decide what further measures are necessary .
thus , the security council reckons with uncertain activities in the future , where actions are already overdue .
the region 's future remains in question , and what hope can the oppressed refugees gain from the practically cynical wrestling over the word " sanctions , " which was finally watered down to " measures ? "
the case of darfur again raises the question of how the international community - whether individual countries or international organizations - can promote peace to resolve conflicts .
the example of sudan does n't provide an answer - at least not an encouraging one .
instead , darfur has tragically revealed the international community 's impotence .
consistently turning a blind eye , underestimating , playing down and ignoring the actual situation , combined with pursuing individual interests provided the catastrophe in darfur with a devastating backdrop .
strategic maneuvering prevails where decisiveness and quick action were overdue , strategic maneuvers and divergences prevailed .
beyond desperately needed humanitarian aid , the international community , sharply contrasted by an immense media campaign , lacks a concept for long-term solutions that could make a sustainable peace in the region possible .
the escalating situation in darfur in past months and the killing it caused as well as the streams of refugees suggest that strategic maneuvering and demagogy prevail over african and international diplomatic mediation attempts .
another lesson shows that the international community can only intervene energetically in crises such as in darfur when it is n't weighed down by internal rivalries .
the tragedy in darfur was also substantially influenced not by international ignorance , but by opposing political , economic and cultural interests .
a neglected continent furthermore , like other african regions , sudan was for too long a neglected urgent case - with devastating consequences .
certainly , the african union has so far failed to prove that it can resolve african conflicts itself .
however , action rarely reflects african concepts .
the inception , execution and completion of international missions are usually determined by interests outside of africa .
what remains again is a united nations whose credibility has been shaken , a rather reserved international willingness to take action and the continuing discussion not only about early recognition of crisis situations but also about rapid reaction .
the hesitancy , the tactical preconditions , the political ulterior motives in the case of darfur result in the question of whether the international community gages conflicts with a double standard .
in a self-critical condemnation of the rwandan genocide , former u.s. president bill clinton said : " we did n't act quickly enough after the killing began .
we did not immediately call these crimes by their rightful name . "
and un secretary general kofi annan said upon presentation of an action plan for conflict prevention in april : " only so can we honor the victims whom we remember today .
only so can we save those who might be victims tomorrow . "
in view of the suffering in darfur , the pressing question remains : have the dreadful lessons such as in rwanda and congo achieved nothing at all internationally ? reinhold meyer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sudan agrees with un as french troops arrive in chad sudan has backtracked on its rejection of a un resolution calling for a halt to atrocities by arab militia in western darfur as french troops gather on the border with chad to help with the flood of refugees .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.08.2004 germany celebrates 20 years of e-mail großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy 20th , e-mail !
when a group of computer scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent germany 's first e-mail 20 years ago , they had no idea they were heralding in the digital age . even though it has only been a part of our collective consciousness for the last decade , for most people life without e-mail would be unimaginable .
in both the business and private spheres , e-mail has long become part of our daily fabric .
but what is an obvious part of daily life today was practically unthinkable 20 years ago when information scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent the first german e-mail .
at that time , understated internet pioneer werner zorn described the event as a " very exciting , " development .
on august 2 , 1984 , zorn and a colleague sent the first-ever german e-mail .
it was his response to the official welcoming e-mail from csnet , a united states-developed electronic communication platform for scientists .
clicking into history it was a mouse click of historical importance .
if the senders of the electronic mail had had any clue how important the event was , they probably would have opened a bottle of champagne .
" we first learned the importance of august 2 later on , " zorn told the german news agency ddp .
back then , zorn 's e-mail address was simple to remember : zorn @ germany .
" what was new technologically at the time was that this was part of an open computer network , " he recalled .
the standardized interface made it possible for more and more people to get connected , and ultimately the technology would usurp the outmoded idea of centrally administered networks .
at the time , karlsruhe became the main mode for e-mails being sent to and from germany after it signed a contract with csnet .
with the opening of the node , germany became the fourth country to become part of the network , following canada , sweden and israel .
in germany , the network eased the work of scientists who needed to communicate with one another .
the country 's prestigious fraunhofer and max planck institutes were the first customers , followed quickly by major industrial companies like siemens and basf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has given germans an instant connection with the rest of the world .
with the working title of " interconnection through networks , " the computer scientists began their work on bringing the internet to germany in 1982 as part of a federal project to build a research network .
zorn and the professors and students around him were given the responsibility not only of connecting germany to international networks but also for making it available to individual scientists who needed access to the collective knowledge of others around the world .
after two years of work , the first successful test came on august 2 , 1984 .
trouble in paradise - for a minute zorn 's success also ran into some unexpected resistance - mainly from institutions that saw the work being done in karlsruhe as unwanted competition .
one consequence was that the university stopped receiving financial assistance for the project .
but it did n't matter much - the development was so widely accepted and adopted that the university made enough money installing mail connections for other organizations that it could ensure the project 's survival .
the full shift to the internet came in 1989 , bringing the first direct internet connections between germany and the us .
today the main internet servers in germany are still hosted in karlsruhe at the firm schlund and partner , where more the 3 million internet domains are managed - more domains than in any other european country .
life before wormy spam the internet certainly changed life for many in germany , but it also brought real problems with it , like spam , which would become such a huge pest 20 years later that it would cause billions of euros in damages for european companies and threaten the utility of e-mail for many .
mass spams are also often used to spread worms and other viruses across the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few germans are familiar with the unique taste of this american pork product .
but they all know its electronic doppelgänger .
anti-virus software-maker mcafee said firms are forced to spend up to € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- a year to prevent and eliminate virus and junk e-mail attacks .
the german government - which found itself under attack in may , logging 510,000 unwanted e-mails in just one week - allocates about € 7 million of its € 32 billion annual it budget for security .
under a european union directive , all member states are required to pass stringent privacy laws that make spam a crime .
but in may , the european commission criticized germany for not doing enough , legally , to stop its spread .
the country 's strict data protection laws have so far made it difficult for politicians to tackle the problem of e-mail .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government proposed a bill earlier this year designed to punish spam abusers , but the bill is still awaiting a vote in parliament .
back when the first e-mails were exchanged in germany 20 years ago , an obscure canned american pork by product could n't have been further from people 's minds .
zorn and his people had one thought : csnet and its welcome message .
" this is your official welcome to csnet !
we are glad to have you aboard . "

when a group of computer scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent germany 's first e-mail 20 years ago , they had no idea they were heralding in the digital age . even though it has only been a part of our collective consciousness for the last decade , for most people life without e-mail would be unimaginable .
in both the business and private spheres , e-mail has long become part of our daily fabric .
but what is an obvious part of daily life today was practically unthinkable 20 years ago when information scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent the first german e-mail .
at that time , understated internet pioneer werner zorn described the event as a " very exciting , " development .
on august 2 , 1984 , zorn and a colleague sent the first-ever german e-mail .
it was his response to the official welcoming e-mail from csnet , a united states-developed electronic communication platform for scientists .
clicking into history it was a mouse click of historical importance .
if the senders of the electronic mail had had any clue how important the event was , they probably would have opened a bottle of champagne .
" we first learned the importance of august 2 later on , " zorn told the german news agency ddp .
back then , zorn 's e-mail address was simple to remember : zorn @ germany .
" what was new technologically at the time was that this was part of an open computer network , " he recalled .
the standardized interface made it possible for more and more people to get connected , and ultimately the technology would usurp the outmoded idea of centrally administered networks .
at the time , karlsruhe became the main mode for e-mails being sent to and from germany after it signed a contract with csnet .
with the opening of the node , germany became the fourth country to become part of the network , following canada , sweden and israel .
in germany , the network eased the work of scientists who needed to communicate with one another .
the country 's prestigious fraunhofer and max planck institutes were the first customers , followed quickly by major industrial companies like siemens and basf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has given germans an instant connection with the rest of the world .
with the working title of " interconnection through networks , " the computer scientists began their work on bringing the internet to germany in 1982 as part of a federal project to build a research network .
zorn and the professors and students around him were given the responsibility not only of connecting germany to international networks but also for making it available to individual scientists who needed access to the collective knowledge of others around the world .
after two years of work , the first successful test came on august 2 , 1984 .
trouble in paradise - for a minute zorn 's success also ran into some unexpected resistance - mainly from institutions that saw the work being done in karlsruhe as unwanted competition .
one consequence was that the university stopped receiving financial assistance for the project .
but it did n't matter much - the development was so widely accepted and adopted that the university made enough money installing mail connections for other organizations that it could ensure the project 's survival .
the full shift to the internet came in 1989 , bringing the first direct internet connections between germany and the us .
today the main internet servers in germany are still hosted in karlsruhe at the firm schlund and partner , where more the 3 million internet domains are managed - more domains than in any other european country .
life before wormy spam the internet certainly changed life for many in germany , but it also brought real problems with it , like spam , which would become such a huge pest 20 years later that it would cause billions of euros in damages for european companies and threaten the utility of e-mail for many .
mass spams are also often used to spread worms and other viruses across the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few germans are familiar with the unique taste of this american pork product .
but they all know its electronic doppelgänger .
anti-virus software-maker mcafee said firms are forced to spend up to € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- a year to prevent and eliminate virus and junk e-mail attacks .
the german government - which found itself under attack in may , logging 510,000 unwanted e-mails in just one week - allocates about € 7 million of its € 32 billion annual it budget for security .
under a european union directive , all member states are required to pass stringent privacy laws that make spam a crime .
but in may , the european commission criticized germany for not doing enough , legally , to stop its spread .
the country 's strict data protection laws have so far made it difficult for politicians to tackle the problem of e-mail .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government proposed a bill earlier this year designed to punish spam abusers , but the bill is still awaiting a vote in parliament .
back when the first e-mails were exchanged in germany 20 years ago , an obscure canned american pork by product could n't have been further from people 's minds .

when a group of computer scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent germany 's first e-mail 20 years ago , they had no idea they were heralding in the digital age . even though it has only been a part of our collective consciousness for the last decade , for most people life without e-mail would be unimaginable .
in both the business and private spheres , e-mail has long become part of our daily fabric .
but what is an obvious part of daily life today was practically unthinkable 20 years ago when information scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent the first german e-mail .
at that time , understated internet pioneer werner zorn described the event as a " very exciting , " development .
on august 2 , 1984 , zorn and a colleague sent the first-ever german e-mail .
it was his response to the official welcoming e-mail from csnet , a united states-developed electronic communication platform for scientists .
clicking into history it was a mouse click of historical importance .
if the senders of the electronic mail had had any clue how important the event was , they probably would have opened a bottle of champagne .
" we first learned the importance of august 2 later on , " zorn told the german news agency ddp .
back then , zorn 's e-mail address was simple to remember : zorn @ germany .
" what was new technologically at the time was that this was part of an open computer network , " he recalled .
the standardized interface made it possible for more and more people to get connected , and ultimately the technology would usurp the outmoded idea of centrally administered networks .
at the time , karlsruhe became the main mode for e-mails being sent to and from germany after it signed a contract with csnet .
with the opening of the node , germany became the fourth country to become part of the network , following canada , sweden and israel .
in germany , the network eased the work of scientists who needed to communicate with one another .
the country 's prestigious fraunhofer and max planck institutes were the first customers , followed quickly by major industrial companies like siemens and basf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has given germans an instant connection with the rest of the world .
with the working title of " interconnection through networks , " the computer scientists began their work on bringing the internet to germany in 1982 as part of a federal project to build a research network .
zorn and the professors and students around him were given the responsibility not only of connecting germany to international networks but also for making it available to individual scientists who needed access to the collective knowledge of others around the world .
after two years of work , the first successful test came on august 2 , 1984 .
trouble in paradise - for a minute zorn 's success also ran into some unexpected resistance - mainly from institutions that saw the work being done in karlsruhe as unwanted competition .
one consequence was that the university stopped receiving financial assistance for the project .
but it did n't matter much - the development was so widely accepted and adopted that the university made enough money installing mail connections for other organizations that it could ensure the project 's survival .
the full shift to the internet came in 1989 , bringing the first direct internet connections between germany and the us .
today the main internet servers in germany are still hosted in karlsruhe at the firm schlund and partner , where more the 3 million internet domains are managed - more domains than in any other european country .
life before wormy spam the internet certainly changed life for many in germany , but it also brought real problems with it , like spam , which would become such a huge pest 20 years later that it would cause billions of euros in damages for european companies and threaten the utility of e-mail for many .
mass spams are also often used to spread worms and other viruses across the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few germans are familiar with the unique taste of this american pork product .
but they all know its electronic doppelgänger .
anti-virus software-maker mcafee said firms are forced to spend up to € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- a year to prevent and eliminate virus and junk e-mail attacks .
the german government - which found itself under attack in may , logging 510,000 unwanted e-mails in just one week - allocates about € 7 million of its € 32 billion annual it budget for security .
under a european union directive , all member states are required to pass stringent privacy laws that make spam a crime .
but in may , the european commission criticized germany for not doing enough , legally , to stop its spread .
the country 's strict data protection laws have so far made it difficult for politicians to tackle the problem of e-mail .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government proposed a bill earlier this year designed to punish spam abusers , but the bill is still awaiting a vote in parliament .
back when the first e-mails were exchanged in germany 20 years ago , an obscure canned american pork by product could n't have been further from people 's minds .
zorn and his people had one thought : csnet and its welcome message .

the eu 's new commission president has offered the next german commissioner , günter verheugen , the industry portfolio - a position short of what berlin had hoped for . according to german news magazine focus , newly named eu commission president josé manuel durão barroso has suggested that günter verheugen , who is currently responsible for enlargement , be moved to industry starting in november .
this falls short of the influential economic post that german chancellor gerhard schröder had been pushing for .
in the last few weeks the german leader had made no secret of his expectations of seeing a fellow countrymen head up a powerful commission and had run amiss with barroso , who said he did not appoint commissioners at the behest of any one country .
instead , the big posts , such as competition and internal markets , are expected to go the new french and british commissioners .
the announcement met with disappointment not only within schröder 's government , but among the german opposition as well .
" that is a lightweight commissioner and falls well below our expectations , " said christian social union 's economics expert hans michelbach about the industry portfolio .
24 vacancies to fill but nothing has been set in stone .
barroso has said that he will present his team of 24 commissioners towards the end of august , leaving several denominators up in the air .
the president has already made clear that he does not want any first and second class commissioners on his team - a reference to germany 's demands for a high profile " super commissioner " - and has called for at least eight women to head up the various eu executive offices .

he felt as if a huge slippery ball was floating on the water in front of him , a ball he was struggling to submerge so that no one else could see his shame .
losing control over his life because of his sexual fantasies involving children , the man sought help from christoph joseph ahlers , who works as a clinical psychologist and sexual therapist at the institute for sexology and sexual medicine at berlin 's charite hospital .
at the time , ahlers informed him that specialized treatments exist .
unfortunately , however , the institute did n't have enough funds nor the manpower to offer therapy , he regretted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : little help has been available so far for those seeking it " we can tell people what they have , we can tell them what can be done , but we can not do anything , " ahlers told dw-world .
" we have to send people back on the street without treatment . "
preventing new victims that 's bound to change now that the institute has secured private funding for a unique project to treat pedophiles before they end up in a courtroom , and before they are caught molesting a child .
starting in january , ahlers and his colleagues hope to sign up 120 people for the three-year program .
it 's a significant step , because by and large potential perpetrators - people who sense they have sexual fantasies involving children - have been off the radar screen .
therapy money primarily flows into victim 's groups and the treatment of imprisoned sex offenders .
although a german government initiative has set aside money for a 2005 project that will work with teenage offenders , it resembles previous programs in that most of the participants have already come to attention as child abusers .
" we 're just starting to be aware of the problem and are still lacking adequate perpetrator prevention programs , " said kai sachs , the executive director of the german society against child abuse and neglect , which advises professionals who deal with cases of child abuse .
according to him , the berlin project could provide data that might help jump-start similar programs elsewhere .
ahlers is already convinced that early intervention could help prevent the suffering of the 550 german children , who are sexually abused each day , according to the federal criminal police office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the program prevent the abuse of more children ?
" in the end it 's about victims and the prevention of new victims , " ahlers stressed , adding that few therapists are qualified or interested in taking on people with sexual fantasies about children .
" we 're doing this to protect children and help the patients , " he maintained .
" we want to prove that they are patients , that they can be treated and that the treatment helps , " he said .
will people sign up ?
while welcoming the new project , others questioned whether enough people would sign up for the treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely that convicted child abuser and murderer marc dutroux would have sought treatment " the question is : ' how do you reach them , " ' michael osterheider , the director of the department of forensic psychiatry and psychotherapy at the university of regensburg , told dw-world .
he noted that some pedophiles are convinced that they are doing nothing wrong and would like to see sex between adults and children legalized .
ahlers countered that he was not worried about finding participants , because the project targets pedophiles who suffer from their sexual desire and are looking for help .
" they are waiting for treatment , " he said .
" we 're trying to offer something where there was no help before . "
the berlin institute plans to launch a publicity campaign with newspaper ads in the fall to alert people to the program .
" we hope to appeal to all those who have realized that children play a role in their sexual fantasies , " ahlers said .
promoting responsibility during the project , participants will be split in three groups : in addition to a control group , which will not receive treatment right away , one section will receive group therapy and those people in another will engage in one-on-one therapy .
the sessions are geared to helping people identify their own sexuality and begin accepting the way they are , ahlers said , describing the treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whispering children " they have to learn that they bear no guilt for their feelings , but that they are responsible for their actions , " he said , explaining that patients had to learn to stop mistaking children 's behavior as sexual overtures .
during the therapy , patients are required to talk about their sexual desires and can receive medication that lowers their sex drive .
all participants must also sign an agreement , promising not to have sexual contact with children .
helping , not protecting that 's a promise that 's hard to police , argued georg kohaupt , a member of the executive committee of the federation of child protection centers in germany , which also offers some help for sex offenders .
" there can be no absolute protection of confidence as far as i 'm concerned , " kohaupt told dw-world , adding that he 's seen cases were people continue to have sexual contact with children during treatment .
" if it were that simple for them to stop , they would not need therapy , " kohaupt said .
but ahlers said that a certain level of trust between patient and therapist was necessary to start treatment in the first place .
participants who do n't comply with the abstinence rule would be asked to leave the program , he said .
he noted that while german therapists are prohibited by law from reporting patients to the police for crimes they reveal during therapy , participants in the program would be no more protected than anyone else .
" they still face the same prosecution by law enforcement authorities as before , " he said , adding that the only realistic therapeutic goal is to help people regain control over their sexual desires at all times .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.08.2004 preventing new perpetrators großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each year , about 20,000 german children are sexually abused while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focussed on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators . standing in a swimming-pool and surrounded by children , he could sense the others eyeing him suspiciously .
he felt as if a huge slippery ball was floating on the water in front of him , a ball he was struggling to submerge so that no one else could see his shame .
losing control over his life because of his sexual fantasies involving children , the man sought help from christoph joseph ahlers , who works as a clinical psychologist and sexual therapist at the institute for sexology and sexual medicine at berlin 's charite hospital .
at the time , ahlers informed him that specialized treatments exist .
unfortunately , however , the institute did n't have enough funds nor the manpower to offer therapy , he regretted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : little help has been available so far for those seeking it " we can tell people what they have , we can tell them what can be done , but we can not do anything , " ahlers told dw-world .
" we have to send people back on the street without treatment . "
preventing new victims that 's bound to change now that the institute has secured private funding for a unique project to treat pedophiles before they end up in a courtroom , and before they are caught molesting a child .
starting in january , ahlers and his colleagues hope to sign up 120 people for the three-year program .
it 's a significant step , because by and large potential perpetrators - people who sense they have sexual fantasies involving children - have been off the radar screen .
therapy money primarily flows into victim 's groups and the treatment of imprisoned sex offenders .
although a german government initiative has set aside money for a 2005 project that will work with teenage offenders , it resembles previous programs in that most of the participants have already come to attention as child abusers .
" we 're just starting to be aware of the problem and are still lacking adequate perpetrator prevention programs , " said kai sachs , the executive director of the german society against child abuse and neglect , which advises professionals who deal with cases of child abuse .
according to him , the berlin project could provide data that might help jump-start similar programs elsewhere .
ahlers is already convinced that early intervention could help prevent the suffering of the 550 german children , who are sexually abused each day , according to the federal criminal police office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the program prevent the abuse of more children ?
" in the end it 's about victims and the prevention of new victims , " ahlers stressed , adding that few therapists are qualified or interested in taking on people with sexual fantasies about children .
" we 're doing this to protect children and help the patients , " he maintained .
" we want to prove that they are patients , that they can be treated and that the treatment helps , " he said .
will people sign up ?
while welcoming the new project , others questioned whether enough people would sign up for the treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely that convicted child abuser and murderer marc dutroux would have sought treatment " the question is : ' how do you reach them , " ' michael osterheider , the director of the department of forensic psychiatry and psychotherapy at the university of regensburg , told dw-world .
he noted that some pedophiles are convinced that they are doing nothing wrong and would like to see sex between adults and children legalized .
ahlers countered that he was not worried about finding participants , because the project targets pedophiles who suffer from their sexual desire and are looking for help .
" they are waiting for treatment , " he said .
" we 're trying to offer something where there was no help before . "
the berlin institute plans to launch a publicity campaign with newspaper ads in the fall to alert people to the program .
" we hope to appeal to all those who have realized that children play a role in their sexual fantasies , " ahlers said .
promoting responsibility during the project , participants will be split in three groups : in addition to a control group , which will not receive treatment right away , one section will receive group therapy and those people in another will engage in one-on-one therapy .
the sessions are geared to helping people identify their own sexuality and begin accepting the way they are , ahlers said , describing the treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whispering children " they have to learn that they bear no guilt for their feelings , but that they are responsible for their actions , " he said , explaining that patients had to learn to stop mistaking children 's behavior as sexual overtures .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.08.2004 germany slighted by eu commission president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first step enlargement , next step industry .
the eu 's new commission president has offered the next german commissioner , günter verheugen , the industry portfolio - a position short of what berlin had hoped for . according to german news magazine focus , newly named eu commission president josé manuel durão barroso has suggested that günter verheugen , who is currently responsible for enlargement , be moved to industry starting in november .
this falls short of the influential economic post that german chancellor gerhard schröder had been pushing for .
in the last few weeks the german leader had made no secret of his expectations of seeing a fellow countrymen head up a powerful commission and had run amiss with barroso , who said he did not appoint commissioners at the behest of any one country .
instead , the big posts , such as competition and internal markets , are expected to go the new french and british commissioners .
the announcement met with disappointment not only within schröder 's government , but among the german opposition as well .
" that is a lightweight commissioner and falls well below our expectations , " said christian social union 's economics expert hans michelbach about the industry portfolio .

the eu 's new commission president has offered the next german commissioner , günter verheugen , the industry portfolio - a position short of what berlin had hoped for . according to german news magazine focus , newly named eu commission president josé manuel durão barroso has suggested that günter verheugen , who is currently responsible for enlargement , be moved to industry starting in november .
this falls short of the influential economic post that german chancellor gerhard schröder had been pushing for .
in the last few weeks the german leader had made no secret of his expectations of seeing a fellow countrymen head up a powerful commission and had run amiss with barroso , who said he did not appoint commissioners at the behest of any one country .
instead , the big posts , such as competition and internal markets , are expected to go the new french and british commissioners .
the announcement met with disappointment not only within schröder 's government , but among the german opposition as well .

sixty years to the day , german chancellor gerhard schröder led a list of dignitaries commemorating the uprising . three days of commemorations came to a climax on sunday when veterans laid wreaths and sang patriotic songs as world leaders and survivors joined together in warsaw to mark the 60th anniversary of the uprising by polish partisans against nazi occupiers towards the end of world war ii .
among the dignitaries attending were gerhard schröder , the first german chancellor to take part in the annual ceremonies .
" today we bow in shame in the face of the nazi troops ' crimes , " schröder said at the ceremony sunday .
" at this place of polish pride and german shame , we hope for reconciliation and peace . "
schröder 's words were followed by applause .
later he garnered even more of his hosts ' approval by assuring that germany would not support restitution claims to return ancestral property to germans who fled or were expelled from eastern europe after the nazis ' defeat .
the issue has dogged polish-german relations for years .
polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said schröder 's speech had " great meaning for poland . "
it was more than a political declaration , cimoszewicz told polish broadcasting .
schröder 's rejection of restitution claims could be " very important " to fend off claims to the european court or the human rights tribunal , he said .
although schröder was warmly received throughout his visit to poland , he did encounter sporadic jeers .
at the warsaw uprising cemetery , he was met with a sign that read : " heil schröder , do n't come to the place where our countrymen are honoured who were murdered by your countrymen - without compensation even today . "
u.s. secretary of state colin powell and britain 's deputy prime minister , john prescott were also among those marking the anniversary with the laying of wreaths and a commemorative concert , as well as the opening of new , interactive museum about the uprising .
russia did not send a representative to the ceremonies .
rebellion was timed for maximum effect the partisan uprising broke out at 5 o 'clock on august 1 , 1944 , following the broadcast of the code signal " tempest . "
the first the german army knew of the battle to liberate warsaw - the first european capital they had taken nearly five years before - was a wave of explosions followed by rifle fire throughout the city .
the timing of the uprising was chosen for maximum effect as the germans appeared to be about to withdraw from warsaw after being forced to retreat over the previous few months in the face of a sustained attack from the red army , which had forced the wehrmacht out of the baltic states , belorussia and western poland .
an estimated 40,000 troops , including 4,000 women , made up the polish home army , or armia krajowa , under the command of general tadeusz ' bor ' komorowski , who estimated they could hold out for about five days without help .
in fact , the insurgents held out for much longer than that , battling the vastly superior german army for 63 days .
komorowski rallied his troops at the start of battle with a rousing call to arms : " today i have issued the order you have been waiting for , the order to begin open battle against poland 's age-old enemy , the german invader . "
" after nearly five years of uninterrupted and heavy fighting underground , today you will carry your arms in the open in order to free your country again and to render exemplary punishment to the german criminals for the terror and crimes committed on polish soil . "
soviets , allies left poles to their fate although barely armed , the plan was to hold out for the rapidly advancing soviet army , which had just reached the outskirts of warsaw at the time of the uprising .
there were also hopes that britain and the united states , would come to their aid in time .
in reality , little assistance was offered , and the red army halted its advance and observed the battle from the other side of warsaw 's vistula river , watching as the ss commanders carried out hitler 's orders to level the city and kill or deport its inhabitants .
more than 200,000 civilians were killed and warsaw was left in ruins .
months later , the soviet army took over a city of rubble and stalin installed a puppet government which occupied poland for more than four decades . dw staff -lrb- nda / ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german leader rejects restitution claims speaking at an event in warsaw to commemorate the 1944 uprising against the nazis , chancellor gerhard schröder made clear that his government did not endorse german claims for the return of ancestral property in poland .

sixty years to the day , german chancellor gerhard schröder led a list of dignitaries commemorating the uprising . three days of commemorations came to a climax on sunday when veterans laid wreaths and sang patriotic songs as world leaders and survivors joined together in warsaw to mark the 60th anniversary of the uprising by polish partisans against nazi occupiers towards the end of world war ii .
among the dignitaries attending were gerhard schröder , the first german chancellor to take part in the annual ceremonies .
" today we bow in shame in the face of the nazi troops ' crimes , " schröder said at the ceremony sunday .
" at this place of polish pride and german shame , we hope for reconciliation and peace . "
schröder 's words were followed by applause .
later he garnered even more of his hosts ' approval by assuring that germany would not support restitution claims to return ancestral property to germans who fled or were expelled from eastern europe after the nazis ' defeat .
the issue has dogged polish-german relations for years .
polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said schröder 's speech had " great meaning for poland . "
it was more than a political declaration , cimoszewicz told polish broadcasting .
schröder 's rejection of restitution claims could be " very important " to fend off claims to the european court or the human rights tribunal , he said .
although schröder was warmly received throughout his visit to poland , he did encounter sporadic jeers .
at the warsaw uprising cemetery , he was met with a sign that read : " heil schröder , do n't come to the place where our countrymen are honoured who were murdered by your countrymen - without compensation even today . "
u.s. secretary of state colin powell and britain 's deputy prime minister , john prescott were also among those marking the anniversary with the laying of wreaths and a commemorative concert , as well as the opening of new , interactive museum about the uprising .
russia did not send a representative to the ceremonies .
rebellion was timed for maximum effect the partisan uprising broke out at 5 o 'clock on august 1 , 1944 , following the broadcast of the code signal " tempest . "
the first the german army knew of the battle to liberate warsaw - the first european capital they had taken nearly five years before - was a wave of explosions followed by rifle fire throughout the city .
the timing of the uprising was chosen for maximum effect as the germans appeared to be about to withdraw from warsaw after being forced to retreat over the previous few months in the face of a sustained attack from the red army , which had forced the wehrmacht out of the baltic states , belorussia and western poland .
an estimated 40,000 troops , including 4,000 women , made up the polish home army , or armia krajowa , under the command of general tadeusz ' bor ' komorowski , who estimated they could hold out for about five days without help .
in fact , the insurgents held out for much longer than that , battling the vastly superior german army for 63 days .
komorowski rallied his troops at the start of battle with a rousing call to arms : " today i have issued the order you have been waiting for , the order to begin open battle against poland 's age-old enemy , the german invader . "
" after nearly five years of uninterrupted and heavy fighting underground , today you will carry your arms in the open in order to free your country again and to render exemplary punishment to the german criminals for the terror and crimes committed on polish soil . "
soviets , allies left poles to their fate although barely armed , the plan was to hold out for the rapidly advancing soviet army , which had just reached the outskirts of warsaw at the time of the uprising .
there were also hopes that britain and the united states , would come to their aid in time .
in reality , little assistance was offered , and the red army halted its advance and observed the battle from the other side of warsaw 's vistula river , watching as the ss commanders carried out hitler 's orders to level the city and kill or deport its inhabitants .
more than 200,000 civilians were killed and warsaw was left in ruins .
months later , the soviet army took over a city of rubble and stalin installed a puppet government which occupied poland for more than four decades . dw staff -lrb- nda / ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german leader rejects restitution claims speaking at an event in warsaw to commemorate the 1944 uprising against the nazis , chancellor gerhard schröder made clear that his government did not endorse german claims for the return of ancestral property in poland .

sixty years to the day , german chancellor gerhard schröder led a list of dignitaries commemorating the uprising . three days of commemorations came to a climax on sunday when veterans laid wreaths and sang patriotic songs as world leaders and survivors joined together in warsaw to mark the 60th anniversary of the uprising by polish partisans against nazi occupiers towards the end of world war ii .
among the dignitaries attending were gerhard schröder , the first german chancellor to take part in the annual ceremonies .
" today we bow in shame in the face of the nazi troops ' crimes , " schröder said at the ceremony sunday .
" at this place of polish pride and german shame , we hope for reconciliation and peace . "
schröder 's words were followed by applause .
later he garnered even more of his hosts ' approval by assuring that germany would not support restitution claims to return ancestral property to germans who fled or were expelled from eastern europe after the nazis ' defeat .
the issue has dogged polish-german relations for years .
polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said schröder 's speech had " great meaning for poland . "
it was more than a political declaration , cimoszewicz told polish broadcasting .
schröder 's rejection of restitution claims could be " very important " to fend off claims to the european court or the human rights tribunal , he said .
although schröder was warmly received throughout his visit to poland , he did encounter sporadic jeers .
at the warsaw uprising cemetery , he was met with a sign that read : " heil schröder , do n't come to the place where our countrymen are honoured who were murdered by your countrymen - without compensation even today . "
u.s. secretary of state colin powell and britain 's deputy prime minister , john prescott were also among those marking the anniversary with the laying of wreaths and a commemorative concert , as well as the opening of new , interactive museum about the uprising .
russia did not send a representative to the ceremonies .
rebellion was timed for maximum effect the partisan uprising broke out at 5 o 'clock on august 1 , 1944 , following the broadcast of the code signal " tempest . "
the first the german army knew of the battle to liberate warsaw - the first european capital they had taken nearly five years before - was a wave of explosions followed by rifle fire throughout the city .
the timing of the uprising was chosen for maximum effect as the germans appeared to be about to withdraw from warsaw after being forced to retreat over the previous few months in the face of a sustained attack from the red army , which had forced the wehrmacht out of the baltic states , belorussia and western poland .
an estimated 40,000 troops , including 4,000 women , made up the polish home army , or armia krajowa , under the command of general tadeusz ' bor ' komorowski , who estimated they could hold out for about five days without help .
in fact , the insurgents held out for much longer than that , battling the vastly superior german army for 63 days .
komorowski rallied his troops at the start of battle with a rousing call to arms : " today i have issued the order you have been waiting for , the order to begin open battle against poland 's age-old enemy , the german invader . "
" after nearly five years of uninterrupted and heavy fighting underground , today you will carry your arms in the open in order to free your country again and to render exemplary punishment to the german criminals for the terror and crimes committed on polish soil . "
soviets , allies left poles to their fate although barely armed , the plan was to hold out for the rapidly advancing soviet army , which had just reached the outskirts of warsaw at the time of the uprising .
there were also hopes that britain and the united states , would come to their aid in time .
in reality , little assistance was offered , and the red army halted its advance and observed the battle from the other side of warsaw 's vistula river , watching as the ss commanders carried out hitler 's orders to level the city and kill or deport its inhabitants .
more than 200,000 civilians were killed and warsaw was left in ruins .
months later , the soviet army took over a city of rubble and stalin installed a puppet government which occupied poland for more than four decades . dw staff -lrb- nda / ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german leader rejects restitution claims speaking at an event in warsaw to commemorate the 1944 uprising against the nazis , chancellor gerhard schröder made clear that his government did not endorse german claims for the return of ancestral property in poland .

" after four years of mulling over claims by the families of jewish slave laborers who worked in nazi death camps before and during world war ii , and 59 years after the camps were liberated by advancing allied troops , the german government has agreed to pay € 6,800 -lrb- $ 8172 -rrb- each in compensation .
the sum has caused outrage among relatives , survivors and campaigners as it is much less than the € 7,669.38 german law had set for individual payment .
millions of people , many of them jewish , were ordered by the nazis to work in labor camps .
ever since the end of wwii , jewish groups have been campaigning for compensation for survivors of these work camps , which have become synonymous with the atrocities of the nazis .
the compensation was agreed in principle by the german government in 2000 but subsequent bureaucratic stalling and bundles of red tape has meant that it has taken since then to finalize the amount to be paid to each survivor .
the total sum earmarked for the use of compensation was € 4.9 billion which would come from " the foundation : remembrance , responsibility and future , " the organization funded by the german government and german businesses that profited from slave labor .
running out of time the number of surviving former slave laborers eligible for compensation under the government scheme totaled half a million in 1999 .
those who have died since , have passed the eligibility to their surviving relatives .
the foundation stated in june this year that it wanted to complete the final compensation payments by mid-2005 as more survivors reached the end of their days .
" many victims are now in their seventies and eighties , " said board of trustees chairman dieter kastrup at the time .
so far , some € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- have been distributed to victims by partner organizations such as the jewish claims conference -lrb- jcc -rrb- and the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .

" after four years of mulling over claims by the families of jewish slave laborers who worked in nazi death camps before and during world war ii , and 59 years after the camps were liberated by advancing allied troops , the german government has agreed to pay € 6,800 -lrb- $ 8172 -rrb- each in compensation .
the sum has caused outrage among relatives , survivors and campaigners as it is much less than the € 7,669.38 german law had set for individual payment .
millions of people , many of them jewish , were ordered by the nazis to work in labor camps .
ever since the end of wwii , jewish groups have been campaigning for compensation for survivors of these work camps , which have become synonymous with the atrocities of the nazis .
the compensation was agreed in principle by the german government in 2000 but subsequent bureaucratic stalling and bundles of red tape has meant that it has taken since then to finalize the amount to be paid to each survivor .
the total sum earmarked for the use of compensation was € 4.9 billion which would come from " the foundation : remembrance , responsibility and future , " the organization funded by the german government and german businesses that profited from slave labor .
running out of time the number of surviving former slave laborers eligible for compensation under the government scheme totaled half a million in 1999 .
those who have died since , have passed the eligibility to their surviving relatives .
the foundation stated in june this year that it wanted to complete the final compensation payments by mid-2005 as more survivors reached the end of their days .
" many victims are now in their seventies and eighties , " said board of trustees chairman dieter kastrup at the time .
so far , some € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- have been distributed to victims by partner organizations such as the jewish claims conference -lrb- jcc -rrb- and the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .

" we still expect progress in reducing agricultural subsidies ... and hope that it will be achieved in the subsequent negotiations on the details . " economics minister wolfgang clement said that " substantial progress " had been made at the marathon talks in geneva and sent " a positive signal for the world economy .

" the wto has overcome the serious crisis that began at the last meeting in cancun , " said the director of the german federation of industry , ludolf von wartenburg , referring to the collapse of a similar negotiating round at a ministerial conference in cancun , mexico last september . he added , however , that the revival of negotiations was no guarantee an ultimate pact would be reached . the german press had reservations on the accord . the handelsblatt business daily spoke of a " historic compromise , " declaring that the " wto negotiations cycle have taken off again .
the german export economy could be one of the beneficiaries . " vague guidelines but the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said the deal " was of course characterized by some as historic but that is an exaggeration .

polish leaders had expected the german chancellor to take a clear stance on such restitution claims , and amid the odd whistle and boo from the crowd he lived up to anticipations : " we germans know full well who started the war and who were its first victims , " schröder said acknowledging the nazi atrocities in poland and added that because of german 's blame there was no longer room left for discussing restitution claims which " turn history on its head . "
" property issues related to world war ii are no longer a subject of controversy between our two governments .
neither the german government nor any other serious political force supports any restitution claims still being voiced .
this is our position , and we won ’ t hesitate to make this position clear before international courts , if need be , " he stressed .
even with schröder 's assurances , polish foreign minister woldzimierz cimoszewicz warned that the issue may not be closed .
" one could imagine theoretically that german expellees file claims with european tribunals even if their cases are rejected by the polish and german courts , " he said .
while praising schröder for emphasizing the pride and patriotism of the polish people , erika steinbach , president of the federation of expellees , blamed the chancellor for leaving expellees in legal limbo by not changing german legislation .
time to move on jerzy stabinsky , a polish author who was in warsaw during the 1944 uprising against the nazi occupiers , said it ’ s high time the two nations left their war-related debates behind to look forward to a future as members of and partners in the european union .
" a lot of time has passed since the events in 1944 , " he said and stressed that it is time to move on .
" the scars of war should have healed , and there are now more important tasks for our two nations to tackle jointly . "

chancellor schroeder said governments could only do so much to promote a better understanding between the two nations .
he called on ordinary people to intensify their contacts and learn each other ’ s language : " we must not let up in our efforts to promote closer cultural ties between our societies , " he said and pointed to exchange efforts between young poles and germans which will help shape the common future .
" by doing so , we ’ ll act in the spirit of those who lost their lives in the warsaw uprising , " the chancellor vowed .
schröder also used the occasion to reject a private german group ’ s idea to build a memorial center in berlin commemorating german expellees .
he dismissed the plan as " unacceptable " because it would unilaterally spotlight german suffering and play down its origin in nazi aggression . dw staff -lrb- hg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland commemorates 1944 partisan uprising on august 1 , 1944 , polish partisans began a battle to retake warsaw from its nazi occupiers .

polish leaders had expected the german chancellor to take a clear stance on such restitution claims , and amid the odd whistle and boo from the crowd he lived up to anticipations : " we germans know full well who started the war and who were its first victims , " schröder said acknowledging the nazi atrocities in poland and added that because of german 's blame there was no longer room left for discussing restitution claims which " turn history on its head . "
" property issues related to world war ii are no longer a subject of controversy between our two governments .
neither the german government nor any other serious political force supports any restitution claims still being voiced .
this is our position , and we won ’ t hesitate to make this position clear before international courts , if need be , " he stressed .
even with schröder 's assurances , polish foreign minister woldzimierz cimoszewicz warned that the issue may not be closed .
" one could imagine theoretically that german expellees file claims with european tribunals even if their cases are rejected by the polish and german courts , " he said .

the codex , however , requires companies to do so . companies are not required by law to adhere to the document , but that might change soon , german justice minister brigitte zypries said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 02.08.2004 poland commemorates 1944 partisan uprising großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder paid tribute to polish suffering under the nazis on august 1 , 1944 , polish partisans began a battle to retake warsaw from its nazi occupiers .
sixty years to the day , german chancellor gerhard schröder led a list of dignitaries commemorating the uprising . three days of commemorations came to a climax on sunday when veterans laid wreaths and sang patriotic songs as world leaders and survivors joined together in warsaw to mark the 60th anniversary of the uprising by polish partisans against nazi occupiers towards the end of world war ii .
among the dignitaries attending were gerhard schröder , the first german chancellor to take part in the annual ceremonies .
" today we bow in shame in the face of the nazi troops ' crimes , " schröder said at the ceremony sunday .
" at this place of polish pride and german shame , we hope for reconciliation and peace . "
schröder 's words were followed by applause .
later he garnered even more of his hosts ' approval by assuring that germany would not support restitution claims to return ancestral property to germans who fled or were expelled from eastern europe after the nazis ' defeat .
the issue has dogged polish-german relations for years .
polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said schröder 's speech had " great meaning for poland . "
it was more than a political declaration , cimoszewicz told polish broadcasting .
schröder 's rejection of restitution claims could be " very important " to fend off claims to the european court or the human rights tribunal , he said .
although schröder was warmly received throughout his visit to poland , he did encounter sporadic jeers .
at the warsaw uprising cemetery , he was met with a sign that read : " heil schröder , do n't come to the place where our countrymen are honoured who were murdered by your countrymen - without compensation even today . "
u.s. secretary of state colin powell and britain 's deputy prime minister , john prescott were also among those marking the anniversary with the laying of wreaths and a commemorative concert , as well as the opening of new , interactive museum about the uprising .
russia did not send a representative to the ceremonies .
rebellion was timed for maximum effect the partisan uprising broke out at 5 o 'clock on august 1 , 1944 , following the broadcast of the code signal " tempest . "
the first the german army knew of the battle to liberate warsaw - the first european capital they had taken nearly five years before - was a wave of explosions followed by rifle fire throughout the city .
the timing of the uprising was chosen for maximum effect as the germans appeared to be about to withdraw from warsaw after being forced to retreat over the previous few months in the face of a sustained attack from the red army , which had forced the wehrmacht out of the baltic states , belorussia and western poland .
an estimated 40,000 troops , including 4,000 women , made up the polish home army , or armia krajowa , under the command of general tadeusz ' bor ' komorowski , who estimated they could hold out for about five days without help .
in fact , the insurgents held out for much longer than that , battling the vastly superior german army for 63 days .
komorowski rallied his troops at the start of battle with a rousing call to arms : " today i have issued the order you have been waiting for , the order to begin open battle against poland 's age-old enemy , the german invader . "
" after nearly five years of uninterrupted and heavy fighting underground , today you will carry your arms in the open in order to free your country again and to render exemplary punishment to the german criminals for the terror and crimes committed on polish soil . "
soviets , allies left poles to their fate although barely armed , the plan was to hold out for the rapidly advancing soviet army , which had just reached the outskirts of warsaw at the time of the uprising .
there were also hopes that britain and the united states , would come to their aid in time .
in reality , little assistance was offered , and the red army halted its advance and observed the battle from the other side of warsaw 's vistula river , watching as the ss commanders carried out hitler 's orders to level the city and kill or deport its inhabitants .
more than 200,000 civilians were killed and warsaw was left in ruins .
months later , the soviet army took over a city of rubble and stalin installed a puppet government which occupied poland for more than four decades . dw staff -lrb- nda / ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german leader rejects restitution claims speaking at an event in warsaw to commemorate the 1944 uprising against the nazis , chancellor gerhard schröder made clear that his government did not endorse german claims for the return of ancestral property in poland .

the timing of the uprising was chosen for maximum effect as the germans appeared to be about to withdraw from warsaw after being forced to retreat over the previous few months in the face of a sustained attack from the red army , which had forced the wehrmacht out of the baltic states , belorussia and western poland .
an estimated 40,000 troops , including 4,000 women , made up the polish home army , or armia krajowa , under the command of general tadeusz ' bor ' komorowski , who estimated they could hold out for about five days without help .
in fact , the insurgents held out for much longer than that , battling the vastly superior german army for 63 days .
komorowski rallied his troops at the start of battle with a rousing call to arms : " today i have issued the order you have been waiting for , the order to begin open battle against poland 's age-old enemy , the german invader . "
" after nearly five years of uninterrupted and heavy fighting underground , today you will carry your arms in the open in order to free your country again and to render exemplary punishment to the german criminals for the terror and crimes committed on polish soil . "
soviets , allies left poles to their fate although barely armed , the plan was to hold out for the rapidly advancing soviet army , which had just reached the outskirts of warsaw at the time of the uprising .
there were also hopes that britain and the united states , would come to their aid in time .
in reality , little assistance was offered , and the red army halted its advance and observed the battle from the other side of warsaw 's vistula river , watching as the ss commanders carried out hitler 's orders to level the city and kill or deport its inhabitants .
more than 200,000 civilians were killed and warsaw was left in ruins .
months later , the soviet army took over a city of rubble and stalin installed a puppet government which occupied poland for more than four decades . dw staff -lrb- nda / ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german leader rejects restitution claims speaking at an event in warsaw to commemorate the 1944 uprising against the nazis , chancellor gerhard schröder made clear that his government did not endorse german claims for the return of ancestral property in poland .

soviets , allies left poles to their fate although barely armed , the plan was to hold out for the rapidly advancing soviet army , which had just reached the outskirts of warsaw at the time of the uprising .
there were also hopes that britain and the united states , would come to their aid in time .
in reality , little assistance was offered , and the red army halted its advance and observed the battle from the other side of warsaw 's vistula river , watching as the ss commanders carried out hitler 's orders to level the city and kill or deport its inhabitants .
more than 200,000 civilians were killed and warsaw was left in ruins .
months later , the soviet army took over a city of rubble and stalin installed a puppet government which occupied poland for more than four decades . dw staff -lrb- nda / ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german leader rejects restitution claims speaking at an event in warsaw to commemorate the 1944 uprising against the nazis , chancellor gerhard schröder made clear that his government did not endorse german claims for the return of ancestral property in poland .

when a group of computer scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent germany 's first e-mail 20 years ago , they had no idea they were heralding in the digital age . even though it has only been a part of our collective consciousness for the last decade , for most people life without e-mail would be unimaginable .
in both the business and private spheres , e-mail has long become part of our daily fabric .
but what is an obvious part of daily life today was practically unthinkable 20 years ago when information scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent the first german e-mail .
at that time , understated internet pioneer werner zorn described the event as a " very exciting , " development .
on august 2 , 1984 , zorn and a colleague sent the first-ever german e-mail .
it was his response to the official welcoming e-mail from csnet , a united states-developed electronic communication platform for scientists .
clicking into history it was a mouse click of historical importance .
if the senders of the electronic mail had had any clue how important the event was , they probably would have opened a bottle of champagne .
" we first learned the importance of august 2 later on , " zorn told the german news agency ddp .
back then , zorn 's e-mail address was simple to remember : zorn @ germany .
" what was new technologically at the time was that this was part of an open computer network , " he recalled .
the standardized interface made it possible for more and more people to get connected , and ultimately the technology would usurp the outmoded idea of centrally administered networks .
at the time , karlsruhe became the main mode for e-mails being sent to and from germany after it signed a contract with csnet .
with the opening of the node , germany became the fourth country to become part of the network , following canada , sweden and israel .
in germany , the network eased the work of scientists who needed to communicate with one another .
the country 's prestigious fraunhofer and max planck institutes were the first customers , followed quickly by major industrial companies like siemens and basf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has given germans an instant connection with the rest of the world .
with the working title of " interconnection through networks , " the computer scientists began their work on bringing the internet to germany in 1982 as part of a federal project to build a research network .
zorn and the professors and students around him were given the responsibility not only of connecting germany to international networks but also for making it available to individual scientists who needed access to the collective knowledge of others around the world .
after two years of work , the first successful test came on august 2 , 1984 .
trouble in paradise - for a minute zorn 's success also ran into some unexpected resistance - mainly from institutions that saw the work being done in karlsruhe as unwanted competition .
one consequence was that the university stopped receiving financial assistance for the project .
but it did n't matter much - the development was so widely accepted and adopted that the university made enough money installing mail connections for other organizations that it could ensure the project 's survival .
the full shift to the internet came in 1989 , bringing the first direct internet connections between germany and the us .
today the main internet servers in germany are still hosted in karlsruhe at the firm schlund and partner , where more the 3 million internet domains are managed - more domains than in any other european country .
life before wormy spam the internet certainly changed life for many in germany , but it also brought real problems with it , like spam , which would become such a huge pest 20 years later that it would cause billions of euros in damages for european companies and threaten the utility of e-mail for many .
mass spams are also often used to spread worms and other viruses across the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few germans are familiar with the unique taste of this american pork product .
but they all know its electronic doppelgänger .
anti-virus software-maker mcafee said firms are forced to spend up to € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- a year to prevent and eliminate virus and junk e-mail attacks .
the german government - which found itself under attack in may , logging 510,000 unwanted e-mails in just one week - allocates about € 7 million of its € 32 billion annual it budget for security .
under a european union directive , all member states are required to pass stringent privacy laws that make spam a crime .
but in may , the european commission criticized germany for not doing enough , legally , to stop its spread .
the country 's strict data protection laws have so far made it difficult for politicians to tackle the problem of e-mail .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government proposed a bill earlier this year designed to punish spam abusers , but the bill is still awaiting a vote in parliament .
back when the first e-mails were exchanged in germany 20 years ago , an obscure canned american pork by product could n't have been further from people 's minds .
zorn and his people had one thought : csnet and its welcome message .

when a group of computer scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent germany 's first e-mail 20 years ago , they had no idea they were heralding in the digital age . even though it has only been a part of our collective consciousness for the last decade , for most people life without e-mail would be unimaginable .
in both the business and private spheres , e-mail has long become part of our daily fabric .
but what is an obvious part of daily life today was practically unthinkable 20 years ago when information scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent the first german e-mail .
at that time , understated internet pioneer werner zorn described the event as a " very exciting , " development .
on august 2 , 1984 , zorn and a colleague sent the first-ever german e-mail .
it was his response to the official welcoming e-mail from csnet , a united states-developed electronic communication platform for scientists .
clicking into history it was a mouse click of historical importance .
if the senders of the electronic mail had had any clue how important the event was , they probably would have opened a bottle of champagne .
" we first learned the importance of august 2 later on , " zorn told the german news agency ddp .
back then , zorn 's e-mail address was simple to remember : zorn @ germany .
" what was new technologically at the time was that this was part of an open computer network , " he recalled .
the standardized interface made it possible for more and more people to get connected , and ultimately the technology would usurp the outmoded idea of centrally administered networks .
at the time , karlsruhe became the main mode for e-mails being sent to and from germany after it signed a contract with csnet .
with the opening of the node , germany became the fourth country to become part of the network , following canada , sweden and israel .
in germany , the network eased the work of scientists who needed to communicate with one another .
the country 's prestigious fraunhofer and max planck institutes were the first customers , followed quickly by major industrial companies like siemens and basf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has given germans an instant connection with the rest of the world .
with the working title of " interconnection through networks , " the computer scientists began their work on bringing the internet to germany in 1982 as part of a federal project to build a research network .
zorn and the professors and students around him were given the responsibility not only of connecting germany to international networks but also for making it available to individual scientists who needed access to the collective knowledge of others around the world .
after two years of work , the first successful test came on august 2 , 1984 .
trouble in paradise - for a minute zorn 's success also ran into some unexpected resistance - mainly from institutions that saw the work being done in karlsruhe as unwanted competition .
one consequence was that the university stopped receiving financial assistance for the project .
but it did n't matter much - the development was so widely accepted and adopted that the university made enough money installing mail connections for other organizations that it could ensure the project 's survival .
the full shift to the internet came in 1989 , bringing the first direct internet connections between germany and the us .
today the main internet servers in germany are still hosted in karlsruhe at the firm schlund and partner , where more the 3 million internet domains are managed - more domains than in any other european country .
life before wormy spam the internet certainly changed life for many in germany , but it also brought real problems with it , like spam , which would become such a huge pest 20 years later that it would cause billions of euros in damages for european companies and threaten the utility of e-mail for many .
mass spams are also often used to spread worms and other viruses across the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few germans are familiar with the unique taste of this american pork product .
but they all know its electronic doppelgänger .
anti-virus software-maker mcafee said firms are forced to spend up to € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- a year to prevent and eliminate virus and junk e-mail attacks .
the german government - which found itself under attack in may , logging 510,000 unwanted e-mails in just one week - allocates about € 7 million of its € 32 billion annual it budget for security .
under a european union directive , all member states are required to pass stringent privacy laws that make spam a crime .
but in may , the european commission criticized germany for not doing enough , legally , to stop its spread .
the country 's strict data protection laws have so far made it difficult for politicians to tackle the problem of e-mail .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government proposed a bill earlier this year designed to punish spam abusers , but the bill is still awaiting a vote in parliament .
back when the first e-mails were exchanged in germany 20 years ago , an obscure canned american pork by product could n't have been further from people 's minds .

when a group of computer scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent germany 's first e-mail 20 years ago , they had no idea they were heralding in the digital age . even though it has only been a part of our collective consciousness for the last decade , for most people life without e-mail would be unimaginable .
in both the business and private spheres , e-mail has long become part of our daily fabric .
but what is an obvious part of daily life today was practically unthinkable 20 years ago when information scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent the first german e-mail .
at that time , understated internet pioneer werner zorn described the event as a " very exciting , " development .
on august 2 , 1984 , zorn and a colleague sent the first-ever german e-mail .
it was his response to the official welcoming e-mail from csnet , a united states-developed electronic communication platform for scientists .
clicking into history it was a mouse click of historical importance .
if the senders of the electronic mail had had any clue how important the event was , they probably would have opened a bottle of champagne .
" we first learned the importance of august 2 later on , " zorn told the german news agency ddp .
back then , zorn 's e-mail address was simple to remember : zorn @ germany .
" what was new technologically at the time was that this was part of an open computer network , " he recalled .
the standardized interface made it possible for more and more people to get connected , and ultimately the technology would usurp the outmoded idea of centrally administered networks .
at the time , karlsruhe became the main mode for e-mails being sent to and from germany after it signed a contract with csnet .
with the opening of the node , germany became the fourth country to become part of the network , following canada , sweden and israel .
in germany , the network eased the work of scientists who needed to communicate with one another .
the country 's prestigious fraunhofer and max planck institutes were the first customers , followed quickly by major industrial companies like siemens and basf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has given germans an instant connection with the rest of the world .
with the working title of " interconnection through networks , " the computer scientists began their work on bringing the internet to germany in 1982 as part of a federal project to build a research network .
zorn and the professors and students around him were given the responsibility not only of connecting germany to international networks but also for making it available to individual scientists who needed access to the collective knowledge of others around the world .
after two years of work , the first successful test came on august 2 , 1984 .
trouble in paradise - for a minute zorn 's success also ran into some unexpected resistance - mainly from institutions that saw the work being done in karlsruhe as unwanted competition .
one consequence was that the university stopped receiving financial assistance for the project .
but it did n't matter much - the development was so widely accepted and adopted that the university made enough money installing mail connections for other organizations that it could ensure the project 's survival .
the full shift to the internet came in 1989 , bringing the first direct internet connections between germany and the us .
today the main internet servers in germany are still hosted in karlsruhe at the firm schlund and partner , where more the 3 million internet domains are managed - more domains than in any other european country .
life before wormy spam the internet certainly changed life for many in germany , but it also brought real problems with it , like spam , which would become such a huge pest 20 years later that it would cause billions of euros in damages for european companies and threaten the utility of e-mail for many .
mass spams are also often used to spread worms and other viruses across the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few germans are familiar with the unique taste of this american pork product .
but they all know its electronic doppelgänger .
anti-virus software-maker mcafee said firms are forced to spend up to € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- a year to prevent and eliminate virus and junk e-mail attacks .
the german government - which found itself under attack in may , logging 510,000 unwanted e-mails in just one week - allocates about € 7 million of its € 32 billion annual it budget for security .
under a european union directive , all member states are required to pass stringent privacy laws that make spam a crime .
but in may , the european commission criticized germany for not doing enough , legally , to stop its spread .
the country 's strict data protection laws have so far made it difficult for politicians to tackle the problem of e-mail .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government proposed a bill earlier this year designed to punish spam abusers , but the bill is still awaiting a vote in parliament .
back when the first e-mails were exchanged in germany 20 years ago , an obscure canned american pork by product could n't have been further from people 's minds .
zorn and his people had one thought : csnet and its welcome message .
" this is your official welcome to csnet !
we are glad to have you aboard . "

" after four years of mulling over claims by the families of jewish slave laborers who worked in nazi death camps before and during world war ii , and 59 years after the camps were liberated by advancing allied troops , the german government has agreed to pay € 6,800 -lrb- $ 8172 -rrb- each in compensation .
the sum has caused outrage among relatives , survivors and campaigners as it is much less than the € 7,669.38 german law had set for individual payment .
millions of people , many of them jewish , were ordered by the nazis to work in labor camps .
ever since the end of wwii , jewish groups have been campaigning for compensation for survivors of these work camps , which have become synonymous with the atrocities of the nazis .
the compensation was agreed in principle by the german government in 2000 but subsequent bureaucratic stalling and bundles of red tape has meant that it has taken since then to finalize the amount to be paid to each survivor .
the total sum earmarked for the use of compensation was € 4.9 billion which would come from " the foundation : remembrance , responsibility and future , " the organization funded by the german government and german businesses that profited from slave labor .
running out of time the number of surviving former slave laborers eligible for compensation under the government scheme totaled half a million in 1999 .
those who have died since , have passed the eligibility to their surviving relatives .
the foundation stated in june this year that it wanted to complete the final compensation payments by mid-2005 as more survivors reached the end of their days .
" many victims are now in their seventies and eighties , " said board of trustees chairman dieter kastrup at the time .
so far , some € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- have been distributed to victims by partner organizations such as the jewish claims conference -lrb- jcc -rrb- and the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .

" after four years of mulling over claims by the families of jewish slave laborers who worked in nazi death camps before and during world war ii , and 59 years after the camps were liberated by advancing allied troops , the german government has agreed to pay € 6,800 -lrb- $ 8172 -rrb- each in compensation .
the sum has caused outrage among relatives , survivors and campaigners as it is much less than the € 7,669.38 german law had set for individual payment .
millions of people , many of them jewish , were ordered by the nazis to work in labor camps .
ever since the end of wwii , jewish groups have been campaigning for compensation for survivors of these work camps , which have become synonymous with the atrocities of the nazis .
the compensation was agreed in principle by the german government in 2000 but subsequent bureaucratic stalling and bundles of red tape has meant that it has taken since then to finalize the amount to be paid to each survivor .
the total sum earmarked for the use of compensation was € 4.9 billion which would come from " the foundation : remembrance , responsibility and future , " the organization funded by the german government and german businesses that profited from slave labor .
running out of time the number of surviving former slave laborers eligible for compensation under the government scheme totaled half a million in 1999 .
those who have died since , have passed the eligibility to their surviving relatives .
the foundation stated in june this year that it wanted to complete the final compensation payments by mid-2005 as more survivors reached the end of their days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.08.2004 opinion : an impotent international community großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gunmen have been slaughtering people in darfur for 16 months the un security council on friday gave sudan 30 days to stop the genocide in darfur without threatening the government with sanctions for non-compliance .
the international community could have acted earlier . the un security council finally agreed on a resolution on sudan .
in view of the members ' closely intertwined interests , only politicians ' dreams could have anticipated sharper or even military actions .
the resolution 's key passage gives the sudanese government 30 days ' time to guarantee the safety of the people in darfur .
after this time limit , the security council will decide what further measures are necessary .
thus , the security council reckons with uncertain activities in the future , where actions are already overdue .
the region 's future remains in question , and what hope can the oppressed refugees gain from the practically cynical wrestling over the word " sanctions , " which was finally watered down to " measures ? "
the case of darfur again raises the question of how the international community - whether individual countries or international organizations - can promote peace to resolve conflicts .
the example of sudan does n't provide an answer - at least not an encouraging one .
instead , darfur has tragically revealed the international community 's impotence .
consistently turning a blind eye , underestimating , playing down and ignoring the actual situation , combined with pursuing individual interests provided the catastrophe in darfur with a devastating backdrop .
strategic maneuvering prevails where decisiveness and quick action were overdue , strategic maneuvers and divergences prevailed .
beyond desperately needed humanitarian aid , the international community , sharply contrasted by an immense media campaign , lacks a concept for long-term solutions that could make a sustainable peace in the region possible .
the escalating situation in darfur in past months and the killing it caused as well as the streams of refugees suggest that strategic maneuvering and demagogy prevail over african and international diplomatic mediation attempts .
another lesson shows that the international community can only intervene energetically in crises such as in darfur when it is n't weighed down by internal rivalries .
the tragedy in darfur was also substantially influenced not by international ignorance , but by opposing political , economic and cultural interests .
a neglected continent furthermore , like other african regions , sudan was for too long a neglected urgent case - with devastating consequences .
certainly , the african union has so far failed to prove that it can resolve african conflicts itself .
however , action rarely reflects african concepts .
the inception , execution and completion of international missions are usually determined by interests outside of africa .
what remains again is a united nations whose credibility has been shaken , a rather reserved international willingness to take action and the continuing discussion not only about early recognition of crisis situations but also about rapid reaction .
the hesitancy , the tactical preconditions , the political ulterior motives in the case of darfur result in the question of whether the international community gages conflicts with a double standard .
in a self-critical condemnation of the rwandan genocide , former u.s. president bill clinton said : " we did n't act quickly enough after the killing began .
we did not immediately call these crimes by their rightful name . "
and un secretary general kofi annan said upon presentation of an action plan for conflict prevention in april : " only so can we honor the victims whom we remember today .
only so can we save those who might be victims tomorrow . "
in view of the suffering in darfur , the pressing question remains : have the dreadful lessons such as in rwanda and congo achieved nothing at all internationally ? reinhold meyer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sudan agrees with un as french troops arrive in chad sudan has backtracked on its rejection of a un resolution calling for a halt to atrocities by arab militia in western darfur as french troops gather on the border with chad to help with the flood of refugees .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.08.2004 opinion : an impotent international community großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gunmen have been slaughtering people in darfur for 16 months the un security council on friday gave sudan 30 days to stop the genocide in darfur without threatening the government with sanctions for non-compliance .
the international community could have acted earlier . the un security council finally agreed on a resolution on sudan .
in view of the members ' closely intertwined interests , only politicians ' dreams could have anticipated sharper or even military actions .
the resolution 's key passage gives the sudanese government 30 days ' time to guarantee the safety of the people in darfur .
after this time limit , the security council will decide what further measures are necessary .
thus , the security council reckons with uncertain activities in the future , where actions are already overdue .
the region 's future remains in question , and what hope can the oppressed refugees gain from the practically cynical wrestling over the word " sanctions , " which was finally watered down to " measures ? "
the case of darfur again raises the question of how the international community - whether individual countries or international organizations - can promote peace to resolve conflicts .
the example of sudan does n't provide an answer - at least not an encouraging one .
instead , darfur has tragically revealed the international community 's impotence .
consistently turning a blind eye , underestimating , playing down and ignoring the actual situation , combined with pursuing individual interests provided the catastrophe in darfur with a devastating backdrop .
strategic maneuvering prevails where decisiveness and quick action were overdue , strategic maneuvers and divergences prevailed .
beyond desperately needed humanitarian aid , the international community , sharply contrasted by an immense media campaign , lacks a concept for long-term solutions that could make a sustainable peace in the region possible .
the escalating situation in darfur in past months and the killing it caused as well as the streams of refugees suggest that strategic maneuvering and demagogy prevail over african and international diplomatic mediation attempts .
another lesson shows that the international community can only intervene energetically in crises such as in darfur when it is n't weighed down by internal rivalries .
the tragedy in darfur was also substantially influenced not by international ignorance , but by opposing political , economic and cultural interests .
a neglected continent furthermore , like other african regions , sudan was for too long a neglected urgent case - with devastating consequences .
certainly , the african union has so far failed to prove that it can resolve african conflicts itself .
however , action rarely reflects african concepts .
the inception , execution and completion of international missions are usually determined by interests outside of africa .
what remains again is a united nations whose credibility has been shaken , a rather reserved international willingness to take action and the continuing discussion not only about early recognition of crisis situations but also about rapid reaction .
the hesitancy , the tactical preconditions , the political ulterior motives in the case of darfur result in the question of whether the international community gages conflicts with a double standard .
in a self-critical condemnation of the rwandan genocide , former u.s. president bill clinton said : " we did n't act quickly enough after the killing began .
we did not immediately call these crimes by their rightful name . "
and un secretary general kofi annan said upon presentation of an action plan for conflict prevention in april : " only so can we honor the victims whom we remember today .
only so can we save those who might be victims tomorrow . "
in view of the suffering in darfur , the pressing question remains : have the dreadful lessons such as in rwanda and congo achieved nothing at all internationally ? reinhold meyer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sudan agrees with un as french troops arrive in chad sudan has backtracked on its rejection of a un resolution calling for a halt to atrocities by arab militia in western darfur as french troops gather on the border with chad to help with the flood of refugees .
-lrb- august 1 , 2004 -rrb- feedback should the united nations threaten sudan with economic sanctions to ensure the government does take action to stop the killing in darfur ?

the eu 's new commission president has offered the next german commissioner , günter verheugen , the industry portfolio - a position short of what berlin had hoped for . according to german news magazine focus , newly named eu commission president josé manuel durão barroso has suggested that günter verheugen , who is currently responsible for enlargement , be moved to industry starting in november .
this falls short of the influential economic post that german chancellor gerhard schröder had been pushing for .
in the last few weeks the german leader had made no secret of his expectations of seeing a fellow countrymen head up a powerful commission and had run amiss with barroso , who said he did not appoint commissioners at the behest of any one country .
instead , the big posts , such as competition and internal markets , are expected to go the new french and british commissioners .
the announcement met with disappointment not only within schröder 's government , but among the german opposition as well .
" that is a lightweight commissioner and falls well below our expectations , " said christian social union 's economics expert hans michelbach about the industry portfolio .
24 vacancies to fill but nothing has been set in stone .
barroso has said that he will present his team of 24 commissioners towards the end of august , leaving several denominators up in the air .
the president has already made clear that he does not want any first and second class commissioners on his team - a reference to germany 's demands for a high profile " super commissioner " - and has called for at least eight women to head up the various eu executive offices .

this falls short of the influential economic post that german chancellor gerhard schröder had been pushing for .
in the last few weeks the german leader had made no secret of his expectations of seeing a fellow countrymen head up a powerful commission and had run amiss with barroso , who said he did not appoint commissioners at the behest of any one country .
instead , the big posts , such as competition and internal markets , are expected to go the new french and british commissioners .
the announcement met with disappointment not only within schröder 's government , but among the german opposition as well .
" that is a lightweight commissioner and falls well below our expectations , " said christian social union 's economics expert hans michelbach about the industry portfolio .
24 vacancies to fill but nothing has been set in stone .
barroso has said that he will present his team of 24 commissioners towards the end of august , leaving several denominators up in the air .
the president has already made clear that he does not want any first and second class commissioners on his team - a reference to germany 's demands for a high profile " super commissioner " - and has called for at least eight women to head up the various eu executive offices .

polish leaders had expected the german chancellor to take a clear stance on such restitution claims , and amid the odd whistle and boo from the crowd he lived up to anticipations : " we germans know full well who started the war and who were its first victims , " schröder said acknowledging the nazi atrocities in poland and added that because of german 's blame there was no longer room left for discussing restitution claims which " turn history on its head .

" property issues related to world war ii are no longer a subject of controversy between our two governments .
neither the german government nor any other serious political force supports any restitution claims still being voiced .
this is our position , and we won ’ t hesitate to make this position clear before international courts , if need be , " he stressed .

polish leaders had expected the german chancellor to take a clear stance on such restitution claims , and amid the odd whistle and boo from the crowd he lived up to anticipations : " we germans know full well who started the war and who were its first victims , " schröder said acknowledging the nazi atrocities in poland and added that because of german 's blame there was no longer room left for discussing restitution claims which " turn history on its head .

" property issues related to world war ii are no longer a subject of controversy between our two governments .
neither the german government nor any other serious political force supports any restitution claims still being voiced .
this is our position , and we won ’ t hesitate to make this position clear before international courts , if need be , " he stressed .

those results beat analysts ' expectations , and the company says full year operating profit will rise this year .
the ceo of continental , manfred wennemer , has only one ingredient in his recipe for success - - a relentless cost-cutting program .
it 's the rationale behind the german tire-maker 's mass relocation of production into countries like russia , where labor costs are much lower .
production facilities in western europe were shut down , despite heavy resistance from the workforce and politicians .
the money saved was reinvested , in more lucrative businesses , such as manufacturing automobile brake systems .
continental hopes the diversification strategy will ease its dependence on the tire business . dw-world.de return of the 40-hour week following the lead of carmaker daimlerchrysler , several large german companies are investigating allowing highly skilled employers to work longer than the standard 35-hour week .

" after four years of mulling over claims by the families of jewish slave laborers who worked in nazi death camps before and during world war ii , and 59 years after the camps were liberated by advancing allied troops , the german government has agreed to pay € 6,800 -lrb- $ 8172 -rrb- each in compensation .
the sum has caused outrage among relatives , survivors and campaigners as it is much less than the € 7,669.38 german law had set for individual payment .
millions of people , many of them jewish , were ordered by the nazis to work in labor camps .
ever since the end of wwii , jewish groups have been campaigning for compensation for survivors of these work camps , which have become synonymous with the atrocities of the nazis .
the compensation was agreed in principle by the german government in 2000 but subsequent bureaucratic stalling and bundles of red tape has meant that it has taken since then to finalize the amount to be paid to each survivor .
the total sum earmarked for the use of compensation was € 4.9 billion which would come from " the foundation : remembrance , responsibility and future , " the organization funded by the german government and german businesses that profited from slave labor .
running out of time the number of surviving former slave laborers eligible for compensation under the government scheme totaled half a million in 1999 .
those who have died since , have passed the eligibility to their surviving relatives .
the foundation stated in june this year that it wanted to complete the final compensation payments by mid-2005 as more survivors reached the end of their days .
" many victims are now in their seventies and eighties , " said board of trustees chairman dieter kastrup at the time .
so far , some € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- have been distributed to victims by partner organizations such as the jewish claims conference -lrb- jcc -rrb- and the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .
most of the 1.6 million recipients concerned live in belarus , poland , russia , ukraine and the czech republic . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : race against time to compensate nazi-era slave laborers financial compensation to former holocaust-era forced laborers will be completed ahead of the 60th anniversary of the defeat of nazi germany next may .

the study showed farmers in cumbria who offered tourist facilities made more money than through farming .
the trend is expected to spread to other areas of the uk as farmers find new ways to subsidise their income .
the cumbria tourist board and the cumbria rural enterprise agency study showed farm tourism was strong despite the effects of foot-and-mouth in 2001 .
the report says money-spinning projects include hiring out land , selling specialist foods and offering activities like bird-watching .
it said an average farmer yielded between £ 300 and £ 400 a year from each 10 acres of land , but revenue from tourism could generate the same profit in just a few days .
almost half of the 600 farmers questioned in the north west said they were already operating a tourism venture alongside their core agricultural business .
luxury picnics a further 19 % said they planned to set one up by the end of the year .
on average , a farmer earns around £ 15,000 a year , but the study said those farmers who offered tourist activities or accommodation made an annual gross profit of £ 20,853 .
chris collier , chief executive of cumbria tourist board said : " more and more farms are diversifying into the sector .
" however , this is moving far beyond the traditional concept of bed and breakfast farmhouses or self-catering accommodation .
" an increasing number of farmers , especially among the younger generation in the industry , are looking to provide activities and adventures to attract visitors in the 21st century and maximise potential revenues by providing a greater variety of products and a higher quality of both accommodation and attractions .
" these range from luxury picnics and hot air balloon rides to specialist horse-riding and fishing breaks . "
bob clark , executive director of cumbria rural enterprise agency , added : " we anticipate this pattern to develop nationwide , as rural economies across the uk look for new areas of growth which will provide their sustainability for the future . "

the study showed farmers in cumbria who offered tourist facilities made more money than through farming .
the trend is expected to spread to other areas of the uk as farmers find new ways to subsidise their income .
the cumbria tourist board and the cumbria rural enterprise agency study showed farm tourism was strong despite the effects of foot-and-mouth in 2001 .
the report says money-spinning projects include hiring out land , selling specialist foods and offering activities like bird-watching .
it said an average farmer yielded between £ 300 and £ 400 a year from each 10 acres of land , but revenue from tourism could generate the same profit in just a few days .
almost half of the 600 farmers questioned in the north west said they were already operating a tourism venture alongside their core agricultural business .
luxury picnics a further 19 % said they planned to set one up by the end of the year .
on average , a farmer earns around £ 15,000 a year , but the study said those farmers who offered tourist activities or accommodation made an annual gross profit of £ 20,853 .
chris collier , chief executive of cumbria tourist board said : " more and more farms are diversifying into the sector .
" however , this is moving far beyond the traditional concept of bed and breakfast farmhouses or self-catering accommodation .
" an increasing number of farmers , especially among the younger generation in the industry , are looking to provide activities and adventures to attract visitors in the 21st century and maximise potential revenues by providing a greater variety of products and a higher quality of both accommodation and attractions .
" these range from luxury picnics and hot air balloon rides to specialist horse-riding and fishing breaks . "
bob clark , executive director of cumbria rural enterprise agency , added : " we anticipate this pattern to develop nationwide , as rural economies across the uk look for new areas of growth which will provide their sustainability for the future . "
