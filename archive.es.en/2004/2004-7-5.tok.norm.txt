despite the remarkable final result , the game itself was hardly an end indicative of a tournament that had produced some magical moments and one which will go down in soccer history as one of the most successful - and unbelievable - european championships ever .

despite the remarkable final result , the game itself was hardly an end indicative of a tournament that had produced some magical moments and one which will go down in soccer history as one of the most successful - and unbelievable - european championships ever .
regardless of the manner in which it was played , the result of the match was , beyond any doubt , an absolutely historical one .
when theodoros zagorakis held the henri delauney trophy aloft in the balmy lisbon night air , it heralded an amazing closing act to three weeks of drama , agony and ecstasy which had seen the order of european soccer nations turned upside down .
it was a surprising final , given the two teams contesting it and the teams watching it from home , but one that bore all the hallmarks of every greece game seen at these championships : grinding defense offset with a killer blow .
a more magical final on paper one could not imagine .
the hosts against the most unfancied team .
portugal had been carried on their way to the final on a wave of national pride and expectation as their performances grew in stature .
the greeks had upset the soccer hierarchy on their way to the final , dispatching previous holders france and the much favored czech republic .
the scene was set for a potentially glorious spectacle : the home side versus the underdogs .
the match started as if not just the trophy but the lives of all those on the pitch depended on the outcome .
portugal began with a feverish pace but chose to build attacks rather than push to the very heart of the greek defense .
the hosts tested both flanks to no avail in the first ten minutes as they probed the opposition for weaknesses .
greece were man-marking pauleta and deco as the striker and playmaker were shadowed across the pitch in every offensive move .
the greeks , however , were having more trouble dealing with ronaldo and figo who were swapping flanks at will and driving down the bylines when the opportunity arose .
chances are few and far between ronaldo had the first attempt on goal in the 13th minute but nikopolidis was equal to his low punt from just inside the area .
maniche was next , taking the ball out of his feet on the edge of the penalty box and whipping a low shot which the greek keeper did well to touch round the post .
while wave upon wave of portuguese attack broke on the rocks of greece 's defense , the greek attackers began to push their own case for the opening goal .
some great running from setaridis broke open portugal 's midfield stranglehold and his smart ball to charisteas released the gangly striker on goal .
unfortunately for greece , the ball drifted away and was easily cleared by ricardo .
greece begin to turn the screw as the first half approached the 30 minute mark , the python tactic of greece 's defense seemed to go into overdrive as the game struggled to raise itself and the pulse of anyone in the stadium of light .
with two lines of solid white keeping the increasingly frustrated red shirts at bay , there was a rash of unnecessary fouls and free kicks .
miguel , who had been one of portugal 's brightest stars of the opening exchanges with driving runs down the right flank , sustained a blow to the chest around the 38th minute and , although he came back on , the right-back was soon off the pitch again .
his replacement , paulo ferreira joined the ranks of portuguese players being suffocated by the greek tactics .
while shutting up shop at one end , the greeks launched hopeful scud-like balls into ricardo 's area at the other with no attacker in sight as the game ground to a close for the hal-time break .
portugal chasing the game the second half began with very little hope of the explosive element of the portuguese side being allowed to spew forth .
the hosts looked to start the second period with more waves of attacks but found that the greeks were even more resolute than before the break .
deco began showing his fast feet but when his industry came to nothing , he took to the ground looking for a penalty .
the first time looked like a bookable offence , the second looked like a genuine claim but each time , the german referee waved play on .
charisteas heads greece in front then on 57 minutes , greece struck .
after suffocating their opponents , the snake turned and took a huge bite .
after seitaridis , who had tormented portugal down the right , did brilliantly to win greece 's first corner of the final .
charisteas rose above the portugal defence to head past ricardo , who failed to deal with basinas ' cross .
the hosts were rocked and never really recovered .
in the immediate aftermath of the goal , ronaldo could have put them on an equal footing but his vicious shot on the turn was pummeled away by nikopolidis .
as the clock ticked away , portugal became increasingly frustrated by the deep defending .
the forward line pressed further and further upfield leaving acres of space ahead of ricardo in the portugal goal .
the tactic almost paid off .
with one minute remaining , figo found himself in space and twisted free to place a shot just centimeters away from being an equalizer .
but with the chance , so went the hopes of the host nation .
new champions claim their prize greece played out the last minutes of added time , taking the ball into dead ends and forcing the portuguese to snap at the heels of the champions-in-waiting .
when the final whistle went , the faces of the teams told totally different stories .
there in tears were the hosts .
for the likes of figo and rui costa , the " golden generation " had yielded nothing .
for the new faces , there would be other chances but that was hardly any comfort at all .
in contrast , disbelief mixed with ecstatic celebration as greece found themselves higher than mount olympus .

judges trying former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic on war crimes charges said monday that the trial in the hague should be reviewed after delaying hearings again because of his failing health . " the time has come for a radical review of the trial process ... in light of the health of the accused , " presiding judge patrick robinson said before adjourning the hearing on the day milosevic had been due to launch his defense . a feisty milosevic , clad in his trademark blue suit , accused judges of putting his health at risk by calling him into court monday " not based on legal reasons " but for the sake of " politics and the media " surrounding the trial .
" my health situation has deteriorated as a direct result of your refusal to enable me to get my health back , " he said . the mammoth trial has already dragged on for over two years .
the former president had been due monday to launch his defense to more than 60 charges of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide arising out of the bloody balkans conflicts in the 1990s . but a doctor 's report read by robinson said the former serbian strongman , 62 , was at risk because he suffered from " extremely high blood pressure " .
court-appointed doctors say that milosevic is at risk of a heart attack , especially during periods of stress .
" it is absolutely essential that milosevic rests , " the judge said , quoting from the report . finished by 2005 ? seen as the most important war crimes trial in europe since world war ii , the trial is not normally expected to finish until at least mid-2005 . milosevic , who refuses to acknowledge the legality of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , has been acting as his own lawyer .
he had been working long hours to prepare his defense , putting a strain on his already fragile health . according to the judges , the trial proceedings and even its continuation would now have to be examined .
robinson said the court would publish a written decision on these issues on monday or tuesday . milosevic 's opening statement , which had been expected to be an attempt to boost his waning popularity in serbia , was also postponed indefinitely until the judges decide how and if the trial can continue . " the date for my opening statement should not be fixed earlier than a month from now , " milosevic said .
the trial has already been interrupted over a dozen times because milosevic has felt ill . the charges relate to his alleged central role in the wars in croatia in 1991-95 , bosnia in 1992-95 and kosovo in 1998-99 .
for the bloody conflict in bosnia which left 200,000 people dead , he faces separate charges of genocide , the gravest of war crimes .
if convicted he could be sentenced to life imprisonment . court-appointed counsel the prosecution on monday suggested that the court either impose counsel on milosevic or set up a video link so milosevic can follow the trial from the detention unit .
both suggestions were categorically rejected by the former president . " it is a stalemate : either milosevic gets so ill that the trial can not continue or there will be long interruptions making it impossible to manage the case , or the judges will impose counsel and milosevic will refuse to cooperate , " legal expert and tribunal watcher heikelina verrijn stuart told the afp news agency . she said she expected the judges would not stop the trial but were likely to impose a lawyer even if milosevic objected . milosevic has said he will call world leaders like british prime minister tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schroeder and former us president bill clinton to take the stand , but it is unlikely they will come to the hague without an official summons . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic prosecution closes arguments this week prosecutors at the international war crimes tribunal will wrap up their case against slobodan milosevic in the next few days .
the former serb leader plans a defense strategy that could extend the trial until 2006 .

judges trying former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic on war crimes charges said monday that the trial in the hague should be reviewed after delaying hearings again because of his failing health . " the time has come for a radical review of the trial process ... in light of the health of the accused , " presiding judge patrick robinson said before adjourning the hearing on the day milosevic had been due to launch his defense . a feisty milosevic , clad in his trademark blue suit , accused judges of putting his health at risk by calling him into court monday " not based on legal reasons " but for the sake of " politics and the media " surrounding the trial .
" my health situation has deteriorated as a direct result of your refusal to enable me to get my health back , " he said . the mammoth trial has already dragged on for over two years .
the former president had been due monday to launch his defense to more than 60 charges of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide arising out of the bloody balkans conflicts in the 1990s . but a doctor 's report read by robinson said the former serbian strongman , 62 , was at risk because he suffered from " extremely high blood pressure " .
court-appointed doctors say that milosevic is at risk of a heart attack , especially during periods of stress .
" it is absolutely essential that milosevic rests , " the judge said , quoting from the report . finished by 2005 ? seen as the most important war crimes trial in europe since world war ii , the trial is not normally expected to finish until at least mid-2005 . milosevic , who refuses to acknowledge the legality of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , has been acting as his own lawyer .

despite the remarkable final result , the game itself was hardly an end indicative of a tournament that had produced some magical moments and one which will go down in soccer history as one of the most successful - and unbelievable - european championships ever .
regardless of the manner in which it was played , the result of the match was , beyond any doubt , an absolutely historical one .
when theodoros zagorakis held the henri delauney trophy aloft in the balmy lisbon night air , it heralded an amazing closing act to three weeks of drama , agony and ecstasy which had seen the order of european soccer nations turned upside down .
it was a surprising final , given the two teams contesting it and the teams watching it from home , but one that bore all the hallmarks of every greece game seen at these championships : grinding defense offset with a killer blow .
a more magical final on paper one could not imagine .
the hosts against the most unfancied team .
portugal had been carried on their way to the final on a wave of national pride and expectation as their performances grew in stature .
the greeks had upset the soccer hierarchy on their way to the final , dispatching previous holders france and the much favored czech republic .
the scene was set for a potentially glorious spectacle : the home side versus the underdogs .
the match started as if not just the trophy but the lives of all those on the pitch depended on the outcome .
portugal began with a feverish pace but chose to build attacks rather than push to the very heart of the greek defense .
the hosts tested both flanks to no avail in the first ten minutes as they probed the opposition for weaknesses .
greece were man-marking pauleta and deco as the striker and playmaker were shadowed across the pitch in every offensive move .
the greeks , however , were having more trouble dealing with ronaldo and figo who were swapping flanks at will and driving down the bylines when the opportunity arose .
chances are few and far between ronaldo had the first attempt on goal in the 13th minute but nikopolidis was equal to his low punt from just inside the area .
maniche was next , taking the ball out of his feet on the edge of the penalty box and whipping a low shot which the greek keeper did well to touch round the post .
while wave upon wave of portuguese attack broke on the rocks of greece 's defense , the greek attackers began to push their own case for the opening goal .
some great running from setaridis broke open portugal 's midfield stranglehold and his smart ball to charisteas released the gangly striker on goal .
unfortunately for greece , the ball drifted away and was easily cleared by ricardo .
greece begin to turn the screw as the first half approached the 30 minute mark , the python tactic of greece 's defense seemed to go into overdrive as the game struggled to raise itself and the pulse of anyone in the stadium of light .
with two lines of solid white keeping the increasingly frustrated red shirts at bay , there was a rash of unnecessary fouls and free kicks .
miguel , who had been one of portugal 's brightest stars of the opening exchanges with driving runs down the right flank , sustained a blow to the chest around the 38th minute and , although he came back on , the right-back was soon off the pitch again .
his replacement , paulo ferreira joined the ranks of portuguese players being suffocated by the greek tactics .
while shutting up shop at one end , the greeks launched hopeful scud-like balls into ricardo 's area at the other with no attacker in sight as the game ground to a close for the hal-time break .
portugal chasing the game the second half began with very little hope of the explosive element of the portuguese side being allowed to spew forth .
the hosts looked to start the second period with more waves of attacks but found that the greeks were even more resolute than before the break .
deco began showing his fast feet but when his industry came to nothing , he took to the ground looking for a penalty .
the first time looked like a bookable offence , the second looked like a genuine claim but each time , the german referee waved play on .
charisteas heads greece in front then on 57 minutes , greece struck .
after suffocating their opponents , the snake turned and took a huge bite .
after seitaridis , who had tormented portugal down the right , did brilliantly to win greece 's first corner of the final .
charisteas rose above the portugal defence to head past ricardo , who failed to deal with basinas ' cross .
the hosts were rocked and never really recovered .
in the immediate aftermath of the goal , ronaldo could have put them on an equal footing but his vicious shot on the turn was pummeled away by nikopolidis .
as the clock ticked away , portugal became increasingly frustrated by the deep defending .
the forward line pressed further and further upfield leaving acres of space ahead of ricardo in the portugal goal .
the tactic almost paid off .
with one minute remaining , figo found himself in space and twisted free to place a shot just centimeters away from being an equalizer .
but with the chance , so went the hopes of the host nation .
new champions claim their prize greece played out the last minutes of added time , taking the ball into dead ends and forcing the portuguese to snap at the heels of the champions-in-waiting .
when the final whistle went , the faces of the teams told totally different stories .
there in tears were the hosts .
for the likes of figo and rui costa , the " golden generation " had yielded nothing .
for the new faces , there would be other chances but that was hardly any comfort at all .
in contrast , disbelief mixed with ecstatic celebration as greece found themselves higher than mount olympus .

the commission estimates that italy 's budget deficit will hit 3.2 percent in 2004 . " berlusconi personally gave his word on it , " german finance minister hans eichel said , referring to rome 's plans to take deficit-cutting measures totaling € 7.5 billion this year .
around € 5.5 billion of that will be spending cuts and tax hikes . led by eichel and his french counterpart at the time , eu finance ministers last november opted to suspend the eu disciplinary process against germany and france for flouting the budget deficit rules of the pact which was designed to underpin the euro .
both germany and france , the two largest euro zone economies , are set to breach the deficit limit for a third consecutive year in 2004 . following tremonti 's resignation , berlusconi has temporarily taken over the finance portfolio .
tremonti stepped down after causing upset with his budget policies in some parts of the center-right coalition .
the finance ministers ' decision will give the italian leader some breathing space to implement deficit-cutting measures without the threat of eu sanctions . " we should not treat italy any worse than others , " said austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , who opposed letting germany and france off the hook last year . but the latest decision will do nothing for the credibility of the stability pact , which has been effectively suspended since november .

despite the remarkable final result , the game itself was hardly an end indicative of a tournament that had produced some magical moments and one which will go down in soccer history as one of the most successful - and unbelievable - european championships ever .
regardless of the manner in which it was played , the result of the match was , beyond any doubt , an absolutely historical one .
when theodoros zagorakis held the henri delauney trophy aloft in the balmy lisbon night air , it heralded an amazing closing act to three weeks of drama , agony and ecstasy which had seen the order of european soccer nations turned upside down .
it was a surprising final , given the two teams contesting it and the teams watching it from home , but one that bore all the hallmarks of every greece game seen at these championships : grinding defense offset with a killer blow .
a more magical final on paper one could not imagine .
the hosts against the most unfancied team .
portugal had been carried on their way to the final on a wave of national pride and expectation as their performances grew in stature .
the greeks had upset the soccer hierarchy on their way to the final , dispatching previous holders france and the much favored czech republic .
the scene was set for a potentially glorious spectacle : the home side versus the underdogs .
the match started as if not just the trophy but the lives of all those on the pitch depended on the outcome .
portugal began with a feverish pace but chose to build attacks rather than push to the very heart of the greek defense .
the hosts tested both flanks to no avail in the first ten minutes as they probed the opposition for weaknesses .
greece were man-marking pauleta and deco as the striker and playmaker were shadowed across the pitch in every offensive move .
the greeks , however , were having more trouble dealing with ronaldo and figo who were swapping flanks at will and driving down the bylines when the opportunity arose .
chances are few and far between ronaldo had the first attempt on goal in the 13th minute but nikopolidis was equal to his low punt from just inside the area .
maniche was next , taking the ball out of his feet on the edge of the penalty box and whipping a low shot which the greek keeper did well to touch round the post .
while wave upon wave of portuguese attack broke on the rocks of greece 's defense , the greek attackers began to push their own case for the opening goal .
some great running from setaridis broke open portugal 's midfield stranglehold and his smart ball to charisteas released the gangly striker on goal .
unfortunately for greece , the ball drifted away and was easily cleared by ricardo .
greece begin to turn the screw as the first half approached the 30 minute mark , the python tactic of greece 's defense seemed to go into overdrive as the game struggled to raise itself and the pulse of anyone in the stadium of light .
with two lines of solid white keeping the increasingly frustrated red shirts at bay , there was a rash of unnecessary fouls and free kicks .
miguel , who had been one of portugal 's brightest stars of the opening exchanges with driving runs down the right flank , sustained a blow to the chest around the 38th minute and , although he came back on , the right-back was soon off the pitch again .
his replacement , paulo ferreira joined the ranks of portuguese players being suffocated by the greek tactics .
while shutting up shop at one end , the greeks launched hopeful scud-like balls into ricardo 's area at the other with no attacker in sight as the game ground to a close for the hal-time break .
portugal chasing the game the second half began with very little hope of the explosive element of the portuguese side being allowed to spew forth .
the hosts looked to start the second period with more waves of attacks but found that the greeks were even more resolute than before the break .
deco began showing his fast feet but when his industry came to nothing , he took to the ground looking for a penalty .
the first time looked like a bookable offence , the second looked like a genuine claim but each time , the german referee waved play on .
charisteas heads greece in front then on 57 minutes , greece struck .
after suffocating their opponents , the snake turned and took a huge bite .
after seitaridis , who had tormented portugal down the right , did brilliantly to win greece 's first corner of the final .
charisteas rose above the portugal defence to head past ricardo , who failed to deal with basinas ' cross .
the hosts were rocked and never really recovered .
in the immediate aftermath of the goal , ronaldo could have put them on an equal footing but his vicious shot on the turn was pummeled away by nikopolidis .
as the clock ticked away , portugal became increasingly frustrated by the deep defending .
the forward line pressed further and further upfield leaving acres of space ahead of ricardo in the portugal goal .
the tactic almost paid off .
with one minute remaining , figo found himself in space and twisted free to place a shot just centimeters away from being an equalizer .
but with the chance , so went the hopes of the host nation .
new champions claim their prize greece played out the last minutes of added time , taking the ball into dead ends and forcing the portuguese to snap at the heels of the champions-in-waiting .

despite the remarkable final result , the game itself was hardly an end indicative of a tournament that had produced some magical moments and one which will go down in soccer history as one of the most successful - and unbelievable - european championships ever .
regardless of the manner in which it was played , the result of the match was , beyond any doubt , an absolutely historical one .
when theodoros zagorakis held the henri delauney trophy aloft in the balmy lisbon night air , it heralded an amazing closing act to three weeks of drama , agony and ecstasy which had seen the order of european soccer nations turned upside down .
it was a surprising final , given the two teams contesting it and the teams watching it from home , but one that bore all the hallmarks of every greece game seen at these championships : grinding defense offset with a killer blow .
a more magical final on paper one could not imagine .
the hosts against the most unfancied team .
portugal had been carried on their way to the final on a wave of national pride and expectation as their performances grew in stature .
the greeks had upset the soccer hierarchy on their way to the final , dispatching previous holders france and the much favored czech republic .
the scene was set for a potentially glorious spectacle : the home side versus the underdogs .
the match started as if not just the trophy but the lives of all those on the pitch depended on the outcome .
portugal began with a feverish pace but chose to build attacks rather than push to the very heart of the greek defense .
the hosts tested both flanks to no avail in the first ten minutes as they probed the opposition for weaknesses .
greece were man-marking pauleta and deco as the striker and playmaker were shadowed across the pitch in every offensive move .
the greeks , however , were having more trouble dealing with ronaldo and figo who were swapping flanks at will and driving down the bylines when the opportunity arose .
chances are few and far between ronaldo had the first attempt on goal in the 13th minute but nikopolidis was equal to his low punt from just inside the area .
maniche was next , taking the ball out of his feet on the edge of the penalty box and whipping a low shot which the greek keeper did well to touch round the post .
while wave upon wave of portuguese attack broke on the rocks of greece 's defense , the greek attackers began to push their own case for the opening goal .
some great running from setaridis broke open portugal 's midfield stranglehold and his smart ball to charisteas released the gangly striker on goal .
unfortunately for greece , the ball drifted away and was easily cleared by ricardo .
greece begin to turn the screw as the first half approached the 30 minute mark , the python tactic of greece 's defense seemed to go into overdrive as the game struggled to raise itself and the pulse of anyone in the stadium of light .
with two lines of solid white keeping the increasingly frustrated red shirts at bay , there was a rash of unnecessary fouls and free kicks .
miguel , who had been one of portugal 's brightest stars of the opening exchanges with driving runs down the right flank , sustained a blow to the chest around the 38th minute and , although he came back on , the right-back was soon off the pitch again .
his replacement , paulo ferreira joined the ranks of portuguese players being suffocated by the greek tactics .
while shutting up shop at one end , the greeks launched hopeful scud-like balls into ricardo 's area at the other with no attacker in sight as the game ground to a close for the hal-time break .
portugal chasing the game the second half began with very little hope of the explosive element of the portuguese side being allowed to spew forth .
the hosts looked to start the second period with more waves of attacks but found that the greeks were even more resolute than before the break .
deco began showing his fast feet but when his industry came to nothing , he took to the ground looking for a penalty .
the first time looked like a bookable offence , the second looked like a genuine claim but each time , the german referee waved play on .
charisteas heads greece in front then on 57 minutes , greece struck .
after suffocating their opponents , the snake turned and took a huge bite .
after seitaridis , who had tormented portugal down the right , did brilliantly to win greece 's first corner of the final .
charisteas rose above the portugal defence to head past ricardo , who failed to deal with basinas ' cross .
the hosts were rocked and never really recovered .
in the immediate aftermath of the goal , ronaldo could have put them on an equal footing but his vicious shot on the turn was pummeled away by nikopolidis .

the commission estimates that italy 's budget deficit will hit 3.2 percent in 2004 . " berlusconi personally gave his word on it , " german finance minister hans eichel said , referring to rome 's plans to take deficit-cutting measures totaling € 7.5 billion this year .
around € 5.5 billion of that will be spending cuts and tax hikes . led by eichel and his french counterpart at the time , eu finance ministers last november opted to suspend the eu disciplinary process against germany and france for flouting the budget deficit rules of the pact which was designed to underpin the euro .
both germany and france , the two largest euro zone economies , are set to breach the deficit limit for a third consecutive year in 2004 . following tremonti 's resignation , berlusconi has temporarily taken over the finance portfolio .
tremonti stepped down after causing upset with his budget policies in some parts of the center-right coalition .
the finance ministers ' decision will give the italian leader some breathing space to implement deficit-cutting measures without the threat of eu sanctions . " we should not treat italy any worse than others , " said austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , who opposed letting germany and france off the hook last year . but the latest decision will do nothing for the credibility of the stability pact , which has been effectively suspended since november .

judges trying former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic on war crimes charges said monday that the trial in the hague should be reviewed after delaying hearings again because of his failing health . " the time has come for a radical review of the trial process ... in light of the health of the accused , " presiding judge patrick robinson said before adjourning the hearing on the day milosevic had been due to launch his defense . a feisty milosevic , clad in his trademark blue suit , accused judges of putting his health at risk by calling him into court monday " not based on legal reasons " but for the sake of " politics and the media " surrounding the trial .
" my health situation has deteriorated as a direct result of your refusal to enable me to get my health back , " he said . the mammoth trial has already dragged on for over two years .
the former president had been due monday to launch his defense to more than 60 charges of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide arising out of the bloody balkans conflicts in the 1990s . but a doctor 's report read by robinson said the former serbian strongman , 62 , was at risk because he suffered from " extremely high blood pressure " .
court-appointed doctors say that milosevic is at risk of a heart attack , especially during periods of stress .
" it is absolutely essential that milosevic rests , " the judge said , quoting from the report . finished by 2005 ? seen as the most important war crimes trial in europe since world war ii , the trial is not normally expected to finish until at least mid-2005 . milosevic , who refuses to acknowledge the legality of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , has been acting as his own lawyer .
he had been working long hours to prepare his defense , putting a strain on his already fragile health . according to the judges , the trial proceedings and even its continuation would now have to be examined .
robinson said the court would publish a written decision on these issues on monday or tuesday . milosevic 's opening statement , which had been expected to be an attempt to boost his waning popularity in serbia , was also postponed indefinitely until the judges decide how and if the trial can continue . " the date for my opening statement should not be fixed earlier than a month from now , " milosevic said .
the trial has already been interrupted over a dozen times because milosevic has felt ill . the charges relate to his alleged central role in the wars in croatia in 1991-95 , bosnia in 1992-95 and kosovo in 1998-99 .
for the bloody conflict in bosnia which left 200,000 people dead , he faces separate charges of genocide , the gravest of war crimes .
if convicted he could be sentenced to life imprisonment . court-appointed counsel the prosecution on monday suggested that the court either impose counsel on milosevic or set up a video link so milosevic can follow the trial from the detention unit .
both suggestions were categorically rejected by the former president . " it is a stalemate : either milosevic gets so ill that the trial can not continue or there will be long interruptions making it impossible to manage the case , or the judges will impose counsel and milosevic will refuse to cooperate , " legal expert and tribunal watcher heikelina verrijn stuart told the afp news agency . she said she expected the judges would not stop the trial but were likely to impose a lawyer even if milosevic objected . milosevic has said he will call world leaders like british prime minister tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schroeder and former us president bill clinton to take the stand , but it is unlikely they will come to the hague without an official summons . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic prosecution closes arguments this week prosecutors at the international war crimes tribunal will wrap up their case against slobodan milosevic in the next few days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.07.2004 milosevic trial delayed on health concerns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobo has a bad heart .
judges trying former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic on war crimes charges said monday that the trial in the hague should be reviewed after delaying hearings again because of his failing health . " the time has come for a radical review of the trial process ... in light of the health of the accused , " presiding judge patrick robinson said before adjourning the hearing on the day milosevic had been due to launch his defense . a feisty milosevic , clad in his trademark blue suit , accused judges of putting his health at risk by calling him into court monday " not based on legal reasons " but for the sake of " politics and the media " surrounding the trial .
" my health situation has deteriorated as a direct result of your refusal to enable me to get my health back , " he said . the mammoth trial has already dragged on for over two years .
the former president had been due monday to launch his defense to more than 60 charges of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide arising out of the bloody balkans conflicts in the 1990s . but a doctor 's report read by robinson said the former serbian strongman , 62 , was at risk because he suffered from " extremely high blood pressure " .
court-appointed doctors say that milosevic is at risk of a heart attack , especially during periods of stress .
" it is absolutely essential that milosevic rests , " the judge said , quoting from the report . finished by 2005 ? seen as the most important war crimes trial in europe since world war ii , the trial is not normally expected to finish until at least mid-2005 . milosevic , who refuses to acknowledge the legality of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , has been acting as his own lawyer .
he had been working long hours to prepare his defense , putting a strain on his already fragile health . according to the judges , the trial proceedings and even its continuation would now have to be examined .
robinson said the court would publish a written decision on these issues on monday or tuesday . milosevic 's opening statement , which had been expected to be an attempt to boost his waning popularity in serbia , was also postponed indefinitely until the judges decide how and if the trial can continue . " the date for my opening statement should not be fixed earlier than a month from now , " milosevic said .
the trial has already been interrupted over a dozen times because milosevic has felt ill . the charges relate to his alleged central role in the wars in croatia in 1991-95 , bosnia in 1992-95 and kosovo in 1998-99 .
for the bloody conflict in bosnia which left 200,000 people dead , he faces separate charges of genocide , the gravest of war crimes .
if convicted he could be sentenced to life imprisonment . court-appointed counsel the prosecution on monday suggested that the court either impose counsel on milosevic or set up a video link so milosevic can follow the trial from the detention unit .
both suggestions were categorically rejected by the former president . " it is a stalemate : either milosevic gets so ill that the trial can not continue or there will be long interruptions making it impossible to manage the case , or the judges will impose counsel and milosevic will refuse to cooperate , " legal expert and tribunal watcher heikelina verrijn stuart told the afp news agency . she said she expected the judges would not stop the trial but were likely to impose a lawyer even if milosevic objected . milosevic has said he will call world leaders like british prime minister tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schroeder and former us president bill clinton to take the stand , but it is unlikely they will come to the hague without an official summons . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic prosecution closes arguments this week prosecutors at the international war crimes tribunal will wrap up their case against slobodan milosevic in the next few days .
the former serb leader plans a defense strategy that could extend the trial until 2006 .

the commission estimates that italy 's budget deficit will hit 3.2 percent in 2004 . " berlusconi personally gave his word on it , " german finance minister hans eichel said , referring to rome 's plans to take deficit-cutting measures totaling € 7.5 billion this year .
around € 5.5 billion of that will be spending cuts and tax hikes . led by eichel and his french counterpart at the time , eu finance ministers last november opted to suspend the eu disciplinary process against germany and france for flouting the budget deficit rules of the pact which was designed to underpin the euro .
both germany and france , the two largest euro zone economies , are set to breach the deficit limit for a third consecutive year in 2004 . following tremonti 's resignation , berlusconi has temporarily taken over the finance portfolio .
tremonti stepped down after causing upset with his budget policies in some parts of the center-right coalition .
the finance ministers ' decision will give the italian leader some breathing space to implement deficit-cutting measures without the threat of eu sanctions . " we should not treat italy any worse than others , " said austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , who opposed letting germany and france off the hook last year . but the latest decision will do nothing for the credibility of the stability pact , which has been effectively suspended since november .
the european court of justice rules on july 13 whether a request by the commission to have the ministers ' decision declared illegal can be granted under eu law . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu proposes easing of euro stability pact it 's been a constant source of bickering between france , germany and the european commission .
now in times of slow economic growth , the eu executive is calling for a looser interpretation of the stability pact .

despite the remarkable final result , the game itself was hardly an end indicative of a tournament that had produced some magical moments and one which will go down in soccer history as one of the most successful - and unbelievable - european championships ever .
regardless of the manner in which it was played , the result of the match was , beyond any doubt , an absolutely historical one .
when theodoros zagorakis held the henri delauney trophy aloft in the balmy lisbon night air , it heralded an amazing closing act to three weeks of drama , agony and ecstasy which had seen the order of european soccer nations turned upside down .
it was a surprising final , given the two teams contesting it and the teams watching it from home , but one that bore all the hallmarks of every greece game seen at these championships : grinding defense offset with a killer blow .
a more magical final on paper one could not imagine .
the hosts against the most unfancied team .
portugal had been carried on their way to the final on a wave of national pride and expectation as their performances grew in stature .
the greeks had upset the soccer hierarchy on their way to the final , dispatching previous holders france and the much favored czech republic .
the scene was set for a potentially glorious spectacle : the home side versus the underdogs .
the match started as if not just the trophy but the lives of all those on the pitch depended on the outcome .
portugal began with a feverish pace but chose to build attacks rather than push to the very heart of the greek defense .
the hosts tested both flanks to no avail in the first ten minutes as they probed the opposition for weaknesses .
greece were man-marking pauleta and deco as the striker and playmaker were shadowed across the pitch in every offensive move .
the greeks , however , were having more trouble dealing with ronaldo and figo who were swapping flanks at will and driving down the bylines when the opportunity arose .
chances are few and far between ronaldo had the first attempt on goal in the 13th minute but nikopolidis was equal to his low punt from just inside the area .
maniche was next , taking the ball out of his feet on the edge of the penalty box and whipping a low shot which the greek keeper did well to touch round the post .
while wave upon wave of portuguese attack broke on the rocks of greece 's defense , the greek attackers began to push their own case for the opening goal .
some great running from setaridis broke open portugal 's midfield stranglehold and his smart ball to charisteas released the gangly striker on goal .
unfortunately for greece , the ball drifted away and was easily cleared by ricardo .
greece begin to turn the screw as the first half approached the 30 minute mark , the python tactic of greece 's defense seemed to go into overdrive as the game struggled to raise itself and the pulse of anyone in the stadium of light .
with two lines of solid white keeping the increasingly frustrated red shirts at bay , there was a rash of unnecessary fouls and free kicks .
miguel , who had been one of portugal 's brightest stars of the opening exchanges with driving runs down the right flank , sustained a blow to the chest around the 38th minute and , although he came back on , the right-back was soon off the pitch again .
his replacement , paulo ferreira joined the ranks of portuguese players being suffocated by the greek tactics .
while shutting up shop at one end , the greeks launched hopeful scud-like balls into ricardo 's area at the other with no attacker in sight as the game ground to a close for the hal-time break .
portugal chasing the game the second half began with very little hope of the explosive element of the portuguese side being allowed to spew forth .
the hosts looked to start the second period with more waves of attacks but found that the greeks were even more resolute than before the break .
deco began showing his fast feet but when his industry came to nothing , he took to the ground looking for a penalty .
the first time looked like a bookable offence , the second looked like a genuine claim but each time , the german referee waved play on .
charisteas heads greece in front then on 57 minutes , greece struck .
after suffocating their opponents , the snake turned and took a huge bite .
after seitaridis , who had tormented portugal down the right , did brilliantly to win greece 's first corner of the final .
charisteas rose above the portugal defence to head past ricardo , who failed to deal with basinas ' cross .
the hosts were rocked and never really recovered .
in the immediate aftermath of the goal , ronaldo could have put them on an equal footing but his vicious shot on the turn was pummeled away by nikopolidis .
as the clock ticked away , portugal became increasingly frustrated by the deep defending .
the forward line pressed further and further upfield leaving acres of space ahead of ricardo in the portugal goal .
the tactic almost paid off .
with one minute remaining , figo found himself in space and twisted free to place a shot just centimeters away from being an equalizer .
but with the chance , so went the hopes of the host nation .

the greeks had upset the soccer hierarchy on their way to the final , dispatching previous holders france and the much favored czech republic .
the scene was set for a potentially glorious spectacle : the home side versus the underdogs .
the match started as if not just the trophy but the lives of all those on the pitch depended on the outcome .
portugal began with a feverish pace but chose to build attacks rather than push to the very heart of the greek defense .
the hosts tested both flanks to no avail in the first ten minutes as they probed the opposition for weaknesses .
greece were man-marking pauleta and deco as the striker and playmaker were shadowed across the pitch in every offensive move .
the greeks , however , were having more trouble dealing with ronaldo and figo who were swapping flanks at will and driving down the bylines when the opportunity arose .
chances are few and far between ronaldo had the first attempt on goal in the 13th minute but nikopolidis was equal to his low punt from just inside the area .
maniche was next , taking the ball out of his feet on the edge of the penalty box and whipping a low shot which the greek keeper did well to touch round the post .
while wave upon wave of portuguese attack broke on the rocks of greece 's defense , the greek attackers began to push their own case for the opening goal .
some great running from setaridis broke open portugal 's midfield stranglehold and his smart ball to charisteas released the gangly striker on goal .
unfortunately for greece , the ball drifted away and was easily cleared by ricardo .
greece begin to turn the screw as the first half approached the 30 minute mark , the python tactic of greece 's defense seemed to go into overdrive as the game struggled to raise itself and the pulse of anyone in the stadium of light .
with two lines of solid white keeping the increasingly frustrated red shirts at bay , there was a rash of unnecessary fouls and free kicks .
miguel , who had been one of portugal 's brightest stars of the opening exchanges with driving runs down the right flank , sustained a blow to the chest around the 38th minute and , although he came back on , the right-back was soon off the pitch again .
his replacement , paulo ferreira joined the ranks of portuguese players being suffocated by the greek tactics .
while shutting up shop at one end , the greeks launched hopeful scud-like balls into ricardo 's area at the other with no attacker in sight as the game ground to a close for the hal-time break .
portugal chasing the game the second half began with very little hope of the explosive element of the portuguese side being allowed to spew forth .
the hosts looked to start the second period with more waves of attacks but found that the greeks were even more resolute than before the break .
deco began showing his fast feet but when his industry came to nothing , he took to the ground looking for a penalty .
the first time looked like a bookable offence , the second looked like a genuine claim but each time , the german referee waved play on .
charisteas heads greece in front then on 57 minutes , greece struck .
after suffocating their opponents , the snake turned and took a huge bite .
after seitaridis , who had tormented portugal down the right , did brilliantly to win greece 's first corner of the final .
charisteas rose above the portugal defence to head past ricardo , who failed to deal with basinas ' cross .
the hosts were rocked and never really recovered .
in the immediate aftermath of the goal , ronaldo could have put them on an equal footing but his vicious shot on the turn was pummeled away by nikopolidis .
as the clock ticked away , portugal became increasingly frustrated by the deep defending .
the forward line pressed further and further upfield leaving acres of space ahead of ricardo in the portugal goal .
the tactic almost paid off .
with one minute remaining , figo found himself in space and twisted free to place a shot just centimeters away from being an equalizer .
but with the chance , so went the hopes of the host nation .
new champions claim their prize greece played out the last minutes of added time , taking the ball into dead ends and forcing the portuguese to snap at the heels of the champions-in-waiting .
when the final whistle went , the faces of the teams told totally different stories .
there in tears were the hosts .
for the likes of figo and rui costa , the " golden generation " had yielded nothing .
for the new faces , there would be other chances but that was hardly any comfort at all .
in contrast , disbelief mixed with ecstatic celebration as greece found themselves higher than mount olympus .

the commission estimates that italy 's budget deficit will hit 3.2 percent in 2004 . " berlusconi personally gave his word on it , " german finance minister hans eichel said , referring to rome 's plans to take deficit-cutting measures totaling € 7.5 billion this year .

both germany and france , the two largest euro zone economies , are set to breach the deficit limit for a third consecutive year in 2004 . following tremonti 's resignation , berlusconi has temporarily taken over the finance portfolio .
tremonti stepped down after causing upset with his budget policies in some parts of the center-right coalition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.07.2004 milosevic trial delayed on health concerns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobo has a bad heart .
judges trying former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic on war crimes charges said monday that the trial in the hague should be reviewed after delaying hearings again because of his failing health . " the time has come for a radical review of the trial process ... in light of the health of the accused , " presiding judge patrick robinson said before adjourning the hearing on the day milosevic had been due to launch his defense . a feisty milosevic , clad in his trademark blue suit , accused judges of putting his health at risk by calling him into court monday " not based on legal reasons " but for the sake of " politics and the media " surrounding the trial .
" my health situation has deteriorated as a direct result of your refusal to enable me to get my health back , " he said . the mammoth trial has already dragged on for over two years .
the former president had been due monday to launch his defense to more than 60 charges of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide arising out of the bloody balkans conflicts in the 1990s . but a doctor 's report read by robinson said the former serbian strongman , 62 , was at risk because he suffered from " extremely high blood pressure " .
court-appointed doctors say that milosevic is at risk of a heart attack , especially during periods of stress .
" it is absolutely essential that milosevic rests , " the judge said , quoting from the report . finished by 2005 ? seen as the most important war crimes trial in europe since world war ii , the trial is not normally expected to finish until at least mid-2005 . milosevic , who refuses to acknowledge the legality of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , has been acting as his own lawyer .
he had been working long hours to prepare his defense , putting a strain on his already fragile health . according to the judges , the trial proceedings and even its continuation would now have to be examined .
robinson said the court would publish a written decision on these issues on monday or tuesday . milosevic 's opening statement , which had been expected to be an attempt to boost his waning popularity in serbia , was also postponed indefinitely until the judges decide how and if the trial can continue . " the date for my opening statement should not be fixed earlier than a month from now , " milosevic said .
the trial has already been interrupted over a dozen times because milosevic has felt ill . the charges relate to his alleged central role in the wars in croatia in 1991-95 , bosnia in 1992-95 and kosovo in 1998-99 .
for the bloody conflict in bosnia which left 200,000 people dead , he faces separate charges of genocide , the gravest of war crimes .
if convicted he could be sentenced to life imprisonment . court-appointed counsel the prosecution on monday suggested that the court either impose counsel on milosevic or set up a video link so milosevic can follow the trial from the detention unit .
both suggestions were categorically rejected by the former president . " it is a stalemate : either milosevic gets so ill that the trial can not continue or there will be long interruptions making it impossible to manage the case , or the judges will impose counsel and milosevic will refuse to cooperate , " legal expert and tribunal watcher heikelina verrijn stuart told the afp news agency . she said she expected the judges would not stop the trial but were likely to impose a lawyer even if milosevic objected . milosevic has said he will call world leaders like british prime minister tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schroeder and former us president bill clinton to take the stand , but it is unlikely they will come to the hague without an official summons . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic prosecution closes arguments this week prosecutors at the international war crimes tribunal will wrap up their case against slobodan milosevic in the next few days .
the former serb leader plans a defense strategy that could extend the trial until 2006 .

judges trying former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic on war crimes charges said monday that the trial in the hague should be reviewed after delaying hearings again because of his failing health . " the time has come for a radical review of the trial process ... in light of the health of the accused , " presiding judge patrick robinson said before adjourning the hearing on the day milosevic had been due to launch his defense . a feisty milosevic , clad in his trademark blue suit , accused judges of putting his health at risk by calling him into court monday " not based on legal reasons " but for the sake of " politics and the media " surrounding the trial .
" my health situation has deteriorated as a direct result of your refusal to enable me to get my health back , " he said . the mammoth trial has already dragged on for over two years .
the former president had been due monday to launch his defense to more than 60 charges of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide arising out of the bloody balkans conflicts in the 1990s . but a doctor 's report read by robinson said the former serbian strongman , 62 , was at risk because he suffered from " extremely high blood pressure " .
court-appointed doctors say that milosevic is at risk of a heart attack , especially during periods of stress .
" it is absolutely essential that milosevic rests , " the judge said , quoting from the report . finished by 2005 ? seen as the most important war crimes trial in europe since world war ii , the trial is not normally expected to finish until at least mid-2005 . milosevic , who refuses to acknowledge the legality of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , has been acting as his own lawyer .
he had been working long hours to prepare his defense , putting a strain on his already fragile health . according to the judges , the trial proceedings and even its continuation would now have to be examined .
robinson said the court would publish a written decision on these issues on monday or tuesday . milosevic 's opening statement , which had been expected to be an attempt to boost his waning popularity in serbia , was also postponed indefinitely until the judges decide how and if the trial can continue . " the date for my opening statement should not be fixed earlier than a month from now , " milosevic said .
the trial has already been interrupted over a dozen times because milosevic has felt ill . the charges relate to his alleged central role in the wars in croatia in 1991-95 , bosnia in 1992-95 and kosovo in 1998-99 .
for the bloody conflict in bosnia which left 200,000 people dead , he faces separate charges of genocide , the gravest of war crimes .
if convicted he could be sentenced to life imprisonment . court-appointed counsel the prosecution on monday suggested that the court either impose counsel on milosevic or set up a video link so milosevic can follow the trial from the detention unit .
both suggestions were categorically rejected by the former president . " it is a stalemate : either milosevic gets so ill that the trial can not continue or there will be long interruptions making it impossible to manage the case , or the judges will impose counsel and milosevic will refuse to cooperate , " legal expert and tribunal watcher heikelina verrijn stuart told the afp news agency . she said she expected the judges would not stop the trial but were likely to impose a lawyer even if milosevic objected . milosevic has said he will call world leaders like british prime minister tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schroeder and former us president bill clinton to take the stand , but it is unlikely they will come to the hague without an official summons . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic prosecution closes arguments this week prosecutors at the international war crimes tribunal will wrap up their case against slobodan milosevic in the next few days .

despite the remarkable final result , the game itself was hardly an end indicative of a tournament that had produced some magical moments and one which will go down in soccer history as one of the most successful - and unbelievable - european championships ever .
regardless of the manner in which it was played , the result of the match was , beyond any doubt , an absolutely historical one .
when theodoros zagorakis held the henri delauney trophy aloft in the balmy lisbon night air , it heralded an amazing closing act to three weeks of drama , agony and ecstasy which had seen the order of european soccer nations turned upside down .
it was a surprising final , given the two teams contesting it and the teams watching it from home , but one that bore all the hallmarks of every greece game seen at these championships : grinding defense offset with a killer blow .
a more magical final on paper one could not imagine .
the hosts against the most unfancied team .
portugal had been carried on their way to the final on a wave of national pride and expectation as their performances grew in stature .
the greeks had upset the soccer hierarchy on their way to the final , dispatching previous holders france and the much favored czech republic .
the scene was set for a potentially glorious spectacle : the home side versus the underdogs .
the match started as if not just the trophy but the lives of all those on the pitch depended on the outcome .
portugal began with a feverish pace but chose to build attacks rather than push to the very heart of the greek defense .
the hosts tested both flanks to no avail in the first ten minutes as they probed the opposition for weaknesses .
greece were man-marking pauleta and deco as the striker and playmaker were shadowed across the pitch in every offensive move .
the greeks , however , were having more trouble dealing with ronaldo and figo who were swapping flanks at will and driving down the bylines when the opportunity arose .
chances are few and far between ronaldo had the first attempt on goal in the 13th minute but nikopolidis was equal to his low punt from just inside the area .
maniche was next , taking the ball out of his feet on the edge of the penalty box and whipping a low shot which the greek keeper did well to touch round the post .
while wave upon wave of portuguese attack broke on the rocks of greece 's defense , the greek attackers began to push their own case for the opening goal .
some great running from setaridis broke open portugal 's midfield stranglehold and his smart ball to charisteas released the gangly striker on goal .
unfortunately for greece , the ball drifted away and was easily cleared by ricardo .
greece begin to turn the screw as the first half approached the 30 minute mark , the python tactic of greece 's defense seemed to go into overdrive as the game struggled to raise itself and the pulse of anyone in the stadium of light .
with two lines of solid white keeping the increasingly frustrated red shirts at bay , there was a rash of unnecessary fouls and free kicks .
miguel , who had been one of portugal 's brightest stars of the opening exchanges with driving runs down the right flank , sustained a blow to the chest around the 38th minute and , although he came back on , the right-back was soon off the pitch again .
his replacement , paulo ferreira joined the ranks of portuguese players being suffocated by the greek tactics .
while shutting up shop at one end , the greeks launched hopeful scud-like balls into ricardo 's area at the other with no attacker in sight as the game ground to a close for the hal-time break .
portugal chasing the game the second half began with very little hope of the explosive element of the portuguese side being allowed to spew forth .
the hosts looked to start the second period with more waves of attacks but found that the greeks were even more resolute than before the break .
deco began showing his fast feet but when his industry came to nothing , he took to the ground looking for a penalty .
the first time looked like a bookable offence , the second looked like a genuine claim but each time , the german referee waved play on .
charisteas heads greece in front then on 57 minutes , greece struck .
after suffocating their opponents , the snake turned and took a huge bite .
after seitaridis , who had tormented portugal down the right , did brilliantly to win greece 's first corner of the final .
charisteas rose above the portugal defence to head past ricardo , who failed to deal with basinas ' cross .
the hosts were rocked and never really recovered .
in the immediate aftermath of the goal , ronaldo could have put them on an equal footing but his vicious shot on the turn was pummeled away by nikopolidis .
as the clock ticked away , portugal became increasingly frustrated by the deep defending .
the forward line pressed further and further upfield leaving acres of space ahead of ricardo in the portugal goal .
the tactic almost paid off .
with one minute remaining , figo found himself in space and twisted free to place a shot just centimeters away from being an equalizer .
but with the chance , so went the hopes of the host nation .
new champions claim their prize greece played out the last minutes of added time , taking the ball into dead ends and forcing the portuguese to snap at the heels of the champions-in-waiting .
when the final whistle went , the faces of the teams told totally different stories .
there in tears were the hosts .
for the likes of figo and rui costa , the " golden generation " had yielded nothing .
for the new faces , there would be other chances but that was hardly any comfort at all .
in contrast , disbelief mixed with ecstatic celebration as greece found themselves higher than mount olympus .
greece were european champions . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de king otto rules greece once again greece , the sensation of the european soccer championships , has one man to thank for their success .

despite the remarkable final result , the game itself was hardly an end indicative of a tournament that had produced some magical moments and one which will go down in soccer history as one of the most successful - and unbelievable - european championships ever .
regardless of the manner in which it was played , the result of the match was , beyond any doubt , an absolutely historical one .
when theodoros zagorakis held the henri delauney trophy aloft in the balmy lisbon night air , it heralded an amazing closing act to three weeks of drama , agony and ecstasy which had seen the order of european soccer nations turned upside down .
it was a surprising final , given the two teams contesting it and the teams watching it from home , but one that bore all the hallmarks of every greece game seen at these championships : grinding defense offset with a killer blow .

the match started as if not just the trophy but the lives of all those on the pitch depended on the outcome .
portugal began with a feverish pace but chose to build attacks rather than push to the very heart of the greek defense .
the hosts tested both flanks to no avail in the first ten minutes as they probed the opposition for weaknesses .
greece were man-marking pauleta and deco as the striker and playmaker were shadowed across the pitch in every offensive move .
the greeks , however , were having more trouble dealing with ronaldo and figo who were swapping flanks at will and driving down the bylines when the opportunity arose .
chances are few and far between ronaldo had the first attempt on goal in the 13th minute but nikopolidis was equal to his low punt from just inside the area .
maniche was next , taking the ball out of his feet on the edge of the penalty box and whipping a low shot which the greek keeper did well to touch round the post .
while wave upon wave of portuguese attack broke on the rocks of greece 's defense , the greek attackers began to push their own case for the opening goal .
some great running from setaridis broke open portugal 's midfield stranglehold and his smart ball to charisteas released the gangly striker on goal .
unfortunately for greece , the ball drifted away and was easily cleared by ricardo .
greece begin to turn the screw as the first half approached the 30 minute mark , the python tactic of greece 's defense seemed to go into overdrive as the game struggled to raise itself and the pulse of anyone in the stadium of light .

miguel , who had been one of portugal 's brightest stars of the opening exchanges with driving runs down the right flank , sustained a blow to the chest around the 38th minute and , although he came back on , the right-back was soon off the pitch again .
his replacement , paulo ferreira joined the ranks of portuguese players being suffocated by the greek tactics .
while shutting up shop at one end , the greeks launched hopeful scud-like balls into ricardo 's area at the other with no attacker in sight as the game ground to a close for the hal-time break .
portugal chasing the game the second half began with very little hope of the explosive element of the portuguese side being allowed to spew forth .

portugal chasing the game the second half began with very little hope of the explosive element of the portuguese side being allowed to spew forth .
the hosts looked to start the second period with more waves of attacks but found that the greeks were even more resolute than before the break .
deco began showing his fast feet but when his industry came to nothing , he took to the ground looking for a penalty .
the first time looked like a bookable offence , the second looked like a genuine claim but each time , the german referee waved play on .
charisteas heads greece in front then on 57 minutes , greece struck .
after suffocating their opponents , the snake turned and took a huge bite .
after seitaridis , who had tormented portugal down the right , did brilliantly to win greece 's first corner of the final .
charisteas rose above the portugal defence to head past ricardo , who failed to deal with basinas ' cross .
the hosts were rocked and never really recovered .
in the immediate aftermath of the goal , ronaldo could have put them on an equal footing but his vicious shot on the turn was pummeled away by nikopolidis .
as the clock ticked away , portugal became increasingly frustrated by the deep defending .
the forward line pressed further and further upfield leaving acres of space ahead of ricardo in the portugal goal .
the tactic almost paid off .
with one minute remaining , figo found himself in space and twisted free to place a shot just centimeters away from being an equalizer .
but with the chance , so went the hopes of the host nation .
new champions claim their prize greece played out the last minutes of added time , taking the ball into dead ends and forcing the portuguese to snap at the heels of the champions-in-waiting .
when the final whistle went , the faces of the teams told totally different stories .
there in tears were the hosts .
for the likes of figo and rui costa , the " golden generation " had yielded nothing .
for the new faces , there would be other chances but that was hardly any comfort at all .
in contrast , disbelief mixed with ecstatic celebration as greece found themselves higher than mount olympus .

the commission estimates that italy 's budget deficit will hit 3.2 percent in 2004 . " berlusconi personally gave his word on it , " german finance minister hans eichel said , referring to rome 's plans to take deficit-cutting measures totaling € 7.5 billion this year .
around € 5.5 billion of that will be spending cuts and tax hikes . led by eichel and his french counterpart at the time , eu finance ministers last november opted to suspend the eu disciplinary process against germany and france for flouting the budget deficit rules of the pact which was designed to underpin the euro .
both germany and france , the two largest euro zone economies , are set to breach the deficit limit for a third consecutive year in 2004 . following tremonti 's resignation , berlusconi has temporarily taken over the finance portfolio .
tremonti stepped down after causing upset with his budget policies in some parts of the center-right coalition .
the finance ministers ' decision will give the italian leader some breathing space to implement deficit-cutting measures without the threat of eu sanctions . " we should not treat italy any worse than others , " said austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , who opposed letting germany and france off the hook last year . but the latest decision will do nothing for the credibility of the stability pact , which has been effectively suspended since november .

the commission estimates that italy 's budget deficit will hit 3.2 percent in 2004 . " berlusconi personally gave his word on it , " german finance minister hans eichel said , referring to rome 's plans to take deficit-cutting measures totaling € 7.5 billion this year .
around € 5.5 billion of that will be spending cuts and tax hikes . led by eichel and his french counterpart at the time , eu finance ministers last november opted to suspend the eu disciplinary process against germany and france for flouting the budget deficit rules of the pact which was designed to underpin the euro .
both germany and france , the two largest euro zone economies , are set to breach the deficit limit for a third consecutive year in 2004 . following tremonti 's resignation , berlusconi has temporarily taken over the finance portfolio .
tremonti stepped down after causing upset with his budget policies in some parts of the center-right coalition .
the finance ministers ' decision will give the italian leader some breathing space to implement deficit-cutting measures without the threat of eu sanctions . " we should not treat italy any worse than others , " said austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , who opposed letting germany and france off the hook last year . but the latest decision will do nothing for the credibility of the stability pact , which has been effectively suspended since november .
the european court of justice rules on july 13 whether a request by the commission to have the ministers ' decision declared illegal can be granted under eu law . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu proposes easing of euro stability pact it 's been a constant source of bickering between france , germany and the european commission .
now in times of slow economic growth , the eu executive is calling for a looser interpretation of the stability pact .

judges trying former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic on war crimes charges said monday that the trial in the hague should be reviewed after delaying hearings again because of his failing health . " the time has come for a radical review of the trial process ... in light of the health of the accused , " presiding judge patrick robinson said before adjourning the hearing on the day milosevic had been due to launch his defense . a feisty milosevic , clad in his trademark blue suit , accused judges of putting his health at risk by calling him into court monday " not based on legal reasons " but for the sake of " politics and the media " surrounding the trial .
" my health situation has deteriorated as a direct result of your refusal to enable me to get my health back , " he said . the mammoth trial has already dragged on for over two years .
the former president had been due monday to launch his defense to more than 60 charges of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide arising out of the bloody balkans conflicts in the 1990s . but a doctor 's report read by robinson said the former serbian strongman , 62 , was at risk because he suffered from " extremely high blood pressure " .
court-appointed doctors say that milosevic is at risk of a heart attack , especially during periods of stress .
" it is absolutely essential that milosevic rests , " the judge said , quoting from the report . finished by 2005 ? seen as the most important war crimes trial in europe since world war ii , the trial is not normally expected to finish until at least mid-2005 . milosevic , who refuses to acknowledge the legality of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , has been acting as his own lawyer .
he had been working long hours to prepare his defense , putting a strain on his already fragile health . according to the judges , the trial proceedings and even its continuation would now have to be examined .
robinson said the court would publish a written decision on these issues on monday or tuesday . milosevic 's opening statement , which had been expected to be an attempt to boost his waning popularity in serbia , was also postponed indefinitely until the judges decide how and if the trial can continue . " the date for my opening statement should not be fixed earlier than a month from now , " milosevic said .
the trial has already been interrupted over a dozen times because milosevic has felt ill . the charges relate to his alleged central role in the wars in croatia in 1991-95 , bosnia in 1992-95 and kosovo in 1998-99 .
for the bloody conflict in bosnia which left 200,000 people dead , he faces separate charges of genocide , the gravest of war crimes .
if convicted he could be sentenced to life imprisonment . court-appointed counsel the prosecution on monday suggested that the court either impose counsel on milosevic or set up a video link so milosevic can follow the trial from the detention unit .
both suggestions were categorically rejected by the former president . " it is a stalemate : either milosevic gets so ill that the trial can not continue or there will be long interruptions making it impossible to manage the case , or the judges will impose counsel and milosevic will refuse to cooperate , " legal expert and tribunal watcher heikelina verrijn stuart told the afp news agency . she said she expected the judges would not stop the trial but were likely to impose a lawyer even if milosevic objected . milosevic has said he will call world leaders like british prime minister tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schroeder and former us president bill clinton to take the stand , but it is unlikely they will come to the hague without an official summons . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic prosecution closes arguments this week prosecutors at the international war crimes tribunal will wrap up their case against slobodan milosevic in the next few days .
the former serb leader plans a defense strategy that could extend the trial until 2006 .

judges trying former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic on war crimes charges said monday that the trial in the hague should be reviewed after delaying hearings again because of his failing health . " the time has come for a radical review of the trial process ... in light of the health of the accused , " presiding judge patrick robinson said before adjourning the hearing on the day milosevic had been due to launch his defense . a feisty milosevic , clad in his trademark blue suit , accused judges of putting his health at risk by calling him into court monday " not based on legal reasons " but for the sake of " politics and the media " surrounding the trial .
" my health situation has deteriorated as a direct result of your refusal to enable me to get my health back , " he said . the mammoth trial has already dragged on for over two years .
the former president had been due monday to launch his defense to more than 60 charges of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide arising out of the bloody balkans conflicts in the 1990s . but a doctor 's report read by robinson said the former serbian strongman , 62 , was at risk because he suffered from " extremely high blood pressure " .
court-appointed doctors say that milosevic is at risk of a heart attack , especially during periods of stress .
" it is absolutely essential that milosevic rests , " the judge said , quoting from the report . finished by 2005 ? seen as the most important war crimes trial in europe since world war ii , the trial is not normally expected to finish until at least mid-2005 . milosevic , who refuses to acknowledge the legality of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , has been acting as his own lawyer .
he had been working long hours to prepare his defense , putting a strain on his already fragile health . according to the judges , the trial proceedings and even its continuation would now have to be examined .
robinson said the court would publish a written decision on these issues on monday or tuesday . milosevic 's opening statement , which had been expected to be an attempt to boost his waning popularity in serbia , was also postponed indefinitely until the judges decide how and if the trial can continue . " the date for my opening statement should not be fixed earlier than a month from now , " milosevic said .
the trial has already been interrupted over a dozen times because milosevic has felt ill . the charges relate to his alleged central role in the wars in croatia in 1991-95 , bosnia in 1992-95 and kosovo in 1998-99 .
for the bloody conflict in bosnia which left 200,000 people dead , he faces separate charges of genocide , the gravest of war crimes .
if convicted he could be sentenced to life imprisonment . court-appointed counsel the prosecution on monday suggested that the court either impose counsel on milosevic or set up a video link so milosevic can follow the trial from the detention unit .
both suggestions were categorically rejected by the former president . " it is a stalemate : either milosevic gets so ill that the trial can not continue or there will be long interruptions making it impossible to manage the case , or the judges will impose counsel and milosevic will refuse to cooperate , " legal expert and tribunal watcher heikelina verrijn stuart told the afp news agency . she said she expected the judges would not stop the trial but were likely to impose a lawyer even if milosevic objected . milosevic has said he will call world leaders like british prime minister tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schroeder and former us president bill clinton to take the stand , but it is unlikely they will come to the hague without an official summons . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic prosecution closes arguments this week prosecutors at the international war crimes tribunal will wrap up their case against slobodan milosevic in the next few days .
the former serb leader plans a defense strategy that could extend the trial until 2006 .

despite the remarkable final result , the game itself was hardly an end indicative of a tournament that had produced some magical moments and one which will go down in soccer history as one of the most successful - and unbelievable - european championships ever .
regardless of the manner in which it was played , the result of the match was , beyond any doubt , an absolutely historical one .
when theodoros zagorakis held the henri delauney trophy aloft in the balmy lisbon night air , it heralded an amazing closing act to three weeks of drama , agony and ecstasy which had seen the order of european soccer nations turned upside down .
it was a surprising final , given the two teams contesting it and the teams watching it from home , but one that bore all the hallmarks of every greece game seen at these championships : grinding defense offset with a killer blow .
a more magical final on paper one could not imagine .
the hosts against the most unfancied team .
portugal had been carried on their way to the final on a wave of national pride and expectation as their performances grew in stature .
the greeks had upset the soccer hierarchy on their way to the final , dispatching previous holders france and the much favored czech republic .
the scene was set for a potentially glorious spectacle : the home side versus the underdogs .
the match started as if not just the trophy but the lives of all those on the pitch depended on the outcome .
portugal began with a feverish pace but chose to build attacks rather than push to the very heart of the greek defense .
the hosts tested both flanks to no avail in the first ten minutes as they probed the opposition for weaknesses .
greece were man-marking pauleta and deco as the striker and playmaker were shadowed across the pitch in every offensive move .
the greeks , however , were having more trouble dealing with ronaldo and figo who were swapping flanks at will and driving down the bylines when the opportunity arose .
chances are few and far between ronaldo had the first attempt on goal in the 13th minute but nikopolidis was equal to his low punt from just inside the area .
maniche was next , taking the ball out of his feet on the edge of the penalty box and whipping a low shot which the greek keeper did well to touch round the post .
while wave upon wave of portuguese attack broke on the rocks of greece 's defense , the greek attackers began to push their own case for the opening goal .
some great running from setaridis broke open portugal 's midfield stranglehold and his smart ball to charisteas released the gangly striker on goal .
unfortunately for greece , the ball drifted away and was easily cleared by ricardo .
greece begin to turn the screw as the first half approached the 30 minute mark , the python tactic of greece 's defense seemed to go into overdrive as the game struggled to raise itself and the pulse of anyone in the stadium of light .
with two lines of solid white keeping the increasingly frustrated red shirts at bay , there was a rash of unnecessary fouls and free kicks .
miguel , who had been one of portugal 's brightest stars of the opening exchanges with driving runs down the right flank , sustained a blow to the chest around the 38th minute and , although he came back on , the right-back was soon off the pitch again .
his replacement , paulo ferreira joined the ranks of portuguese players being suffocated by the greek tactics .
while shutting up shop at one end , the greeks launched hopeful scud-like balls into ricardo 's area at the other with no attacker in sight as the game ground to a close for the hal-time break .
portugal chasing the game the second half began with very little hope of the explosive element of the portuguese side being allowed to spew forth .
the hosts looked to start the second period with more waves of attacks but found that the greeks were even more resolute than before the break .
deco began showing his fast feet but when his industry came to nothing , he took to the ground looking for a penalty .
the first time looked like a bookable offence , the second looked like a genuine claim but each time , the german referee waved play on .
charisteas heads greece in front then on 57 minutes , greece struck .
after suffocating their opponents , the snake turned and took a huge bite .
after seitaridis , who had tormented portugal down the right , did brilliantly to win greece 's first corner of the final .
charisteas rose above the portugal defence to head past ricardo , who failed to deal with basinas ' cross .
the hosts were rocked and never really recovered .
in the immediate aftermath of the goal , ronaldo could have put them on an equal footing but his vicious shot on the turn was pummeled away by nikopolidis .
as the clock ticked away , portugal became increasingly frustrated by the deep defending .
the forward line pressed further and further upfield leaving acres of space ahead of ricardo in the portugal goal .
the tactic almost paid off .
with one minute remaining , figo found himself in space and twisted free to place a shot just centimeters away from being an equalizer .
but with the chance , so went the hopes of the host nation .
new champions claim their prize greece played out the last minutes of added time , taking the ball into dead ends and forcing the portuguese to snap at the heels of the champions-in-waiting .

the scene was set for a potentially glorious spectacle : the home side versus the underdogs .
the match started as if not just the trophy but the lives of all those on the pitch depended on the outcome .
portugal began with a feverish pace but chose to build attacks rather than push to the very heart of the greek defense .
the hosts tested both flanks to no avail in the first ten minutes as they probed the opposition for weaknesses .
greece were man-marking pauleta and deco as the striker and playmaker were shadowed across the pitch in every offensive move .
the greeks , however , were having more trouble dealing with ronaldo and figo who were swapping flanks at will and driving down the bylines when the opportunity arose .
chances are few and far between ronaldo had the first attempt on goal in the 13th minute but nikopolidis was equal to his low punt from just inside the area .
maniche was next , taking the ball out of his feet on the edge of the penalty box and whipping a low shot which the greek keeper did well to touch round the post .
while wave upon wave of portuguese attack broke on the rocks of greece 's defense , the greek attackers began to push their own case for the opening goal .
some great running from setaridis broke open portugal 's midfield stranglehold and his smart ball to charisteas released the gangly striker on goal .
unfortunately for greece , the ball drifted away and was easily cleared by ricardo .
greece begin to turn the screw as the first half approached the 30 minute mark , the python tactic of greece 's defense seemed to go into overdrive as the game struggled to raise itself and the pulse of anyone in the stadium of light .
with two lines of solid white keeping the increasingly frustrated red shirts at bay , there was a rash of unnecessary fouls and free kicks .
miguel , who had been one of portugal 's brightest stars of the opening exchanges with driving runs down the right flank , sustained a blow to the chest around the 38th minute and , although he came back on , the right-back was soon off the pitch again .
his replacement , paulo ferreira joined the ranks of portuguese players being suffocated by the greek tactics .
while shutting up shop at one end , the greeks launched hopeful scud-like balls into ricardo 's area at the other with no attacker in sight as the game ground to a close for the hal-time break .

despite the remarkable final result , the game itself was hardly an end indicative of a tournament that had produced some magical moments and one which will go down in soccer history as one of the most successful - and unbelievable - european championships ever .
regardless of the manner in which it was played , the result of the match was , beyond any doubt , an absolutely historical one .
when theodoros zagorakis held the henri delauney trophy aloft in the balmy lisbon night air , it heralded an amazing closing act to three weeks of drama , agony and ecstasy which had seen the order of european soccer nations turned upside down .
it was a surprising final , given the two teams contesting it and the teams watching it from home , but one that bore all the hallmarks of every greece game seen at these championships : grinding defense offset with a killer blow .
a more magical final on paper one could not imagine .
the hosts against the most unfancied team .
portugal had been carried on their way to the final on a wave of national pride and expectation as their performances grew in stature .
the greeks had upset the soccer hierarchy on their way to the final , dispatching previous holders france and the much favored czech republic .
the scene was set for a potentially glorious spectacle : the home side versus the underdogs .
the match started as if not just the trophy but the lives of all those on the pitch depended on the outcome .
portugal began with a feverish pace but chose to build attacks rather than push to the very heart of the greek defense .
the hosts tested both flanks to no avail in the first ten minutes as they probed the opposition for weaknesses .
greece were man-marking pauleta and deco as the striker and playmaker were shadowed across the pitch in every offensive move .
the greeks , however , were having more trouble dealing with ronaldo and figo who were swapping flanks at will and driving down the bylines when the opportunity arose .
chances are few and far between ronaldo had the first attempt on goal in the 13th minute but nikopolidis was equal to his low punt from just inside the area .
maniche was next , taking the ball out of his feet on the edge of the penalty box and whipping a low shot which the greek keeper did well to touch round the post .
while wave upon wave of portuguese attack broke on the rocks of greece 's defense , the greek attackers began to push their own case for the opening goal .
some great running from setaridis broke open portugal 's midfield stranglehold and his smart ball to charisteas released the gangly striker on goal .
unfortunately for greece , the ball drifted away and was easily cleared by ricardo .
greece begin to turn the screw as the first half approached the 30 minute mark , the python tactic of greece 's defense seemed to go into overdrive as the game struggled to raise itself and the pulse of anyone in the stadium of light .
with two lines of solid white keeping the increasingly frustrated red shirts at bay , there was a rash of unnecessary fouls and free kicks .
miguel , who had been one of portugal 's brightest stars of the opening exchanges with driving runs down the right flank , sustained a blow to the chest around the 38th minute and , although he came back on , the right-back was soon off the pitch again .
his replacement , paulo ferreira joined the ranks of portuguese players being suffocated by the greek tactics .
while shutting up shop at one end , the greeks launched hopeful scud-like balls into ricardo 's area at the other with no attacker in sight as the game ground to a close for the hal-time break .
portugal chasing the game the second half began with very little hope of the explosive element of the portuguese side being allowed to spew forth .
the hosts looked to start the second period with more waves of attacks but found that the greeks were even more resolute than before the break .
deco began showing his fast feet but when his industry came to nothing , he took to the ground looking for a penalty .
the first time looked like a bookable offence , the second looked like a genuine claim but each time , the german referee waved play on .
charisteas heads greece in front then on 57 minutes , greece struck .
after suffocating their opponents , the snake turned and took a huge bite .
after seitaridis , who had tormented portugal down the right , did brilliantly to win greece 's first corner of the final .
charisteas rose above the portugal defence to head past ricardo , who failed to deal with basinas ' cross .
the hosts were rocked and never really recovered .
in the immediate aftermath of the goal , ronaldo could have put them on an equal footing but his vicious shot on the turn was pummeled away by nikopolidis .
as the clock ticked away , portugal became increasingly frustrated by the deep defending .
the forward line pressed further and further upfield leaving acres of space ahead of ricardo in the portugal goal .
the tactic almost paid off .
with one minute remaining , figo found himself in space and twisted free to place a shot just centimeters away from being an equalizer .
but with the chance , so went the hopes of the host nation .

miguel , who had been one of portugal 's brightest stars of the opening exchanges with driving runs down the right flank , sustained a blow to the chest around the 38th minute and , although he came back on , the right-back was soon off the pitch again .
his replacement , paulo ferreira joined the ranks of portuguese players being suffocated by the greek tactics .
while shutting up shop at one end , the greeks launched hopeful scud-like balls into ricardo 's area at the other with no attacker in sight as the game ground to a close for the hal-time break .
portugal chasing the game the second half began with very little hope of the explosive element of the portuguese side being allowed to spew forth .
the hosts looked to start the second period with more waves of attacks but found that the greeks were even more resolute than before the break .
deco began showing his fast feet but when his industry came to nothing , he took to the ground looking for a penalty .
the first time looked like a bookable offence , the second looked like a genuine claim but each time , the german referee waved play on .
charisteas heads greece in front then on 57 minutes , greece struck .
after suffocating their opponents , the snake turned and took a huge bite .
after seitaridis , who had tormented portugal down the right , did brilliantly to win greece 's first corner of the final .
charisteas rose above the portugal defence to head past ricardo , who failed to deal with basinas ' cross .
the hosts were rocked and never really recovered .
in the immediate aftermath of the goal , ronaldo could have put them on an equal footing but his vicious shot on the turn was pummeled away by nikopolidis .
as the clock ticked away , portugal became increasingly frustrated by the deep defending .
the forward line pressed further and further upfield leaving acres of space ahead of ricardo in the portugal goal .
the tactic almost paid off .
with one minute remaining , figo found himself in space and twisted free to place a shot just centimeters away from being an equalizer .
but with the chance , so went the hopes of the host nation .
new champions claim their prize greece played out the last minutes of added time , taking the ball into dead ends and forcing the portuguese to snap at the heels of the champions-in-waiting .
when the final whistle went , the faces of the teams told totally different stories .
there in tears were the hosts .
for the likes of figo and rui costa , the " golden generation " had yielded nothing .
for the new faces , there would be other chances but that was hardly any comfort at all .
in contrast , disbelief mixed with ecstatic celebration as greece found themselves higher than mount olympus .

industries ranging from tourism to banking to software grew at a slower pace in june than in the previous month as unemployment deterred consumers from increasing spending , the survey of 2,000 purchasing managers compiled for reuters showed .
an industry growth index fell to 55.3 from 55.8 in may .

" it is more important to make working times more flexible , " he said in an interview with the german newsweekly der spiegel .
" i think it is wrong to conduct a general debate over whether the working week should be 35 or 42 hours long , " he said in the story , publiished on monday .
according to schröder , a blanket change would not suit the needs of every industry , while a more flexible approach would .
in responding to the question , schröder gave his view on an issue that has dominated the german headlines for months .
at the end of june , siemens , germany 's largest electronics company , won an important concession from the powerful ig metal union : by threatening to relocate jobs to hungary , the siemens executives got union members to agree to work an additional five hours per week - bumping their total number of hours up to 40 - for no extra pay .
the agreement has prompted concern that other german companies would employ similar tough negotiation strategies and spark a trend towards longer hours .
there are already indications that executives at some german auto makers are planning to follow suit . more briefs 05.07.2004 -pipe- karstadtquelle to cut more jobs 05.07.2004 -pipe- service industry sees growth slowdown 02.07.2004 -pipe- germany sells russian debt bonds 02.07.2004 -pipe- study : german women shop more than men 02.07.2004 -pipe- tui threatens to leave hanover if easyjet comes 02.07.2004 -pipe- court ruling poses problems for airbus jumbo 02.07.2004 -pipe- starbucks in germany stuck in the red 01.07.2004 -pipe- european central bank to leave interest rates unchanged radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.07.2004 -pipe- 15:00 utc no respite for germany 's jobless the unemployment market in germany is showing no signs of a turnaround .
taking seasonal adjustments into consideration , the number of jobless has dropped by 70,000 to 4.22 million .
analysts say that is only 40,000 less than the same time last year , and that economic growth is still not strong enough to have any real impact on the state of the employment market .
the official figures will be released by the federal employment agency in nuremberg on tuesday .

the commission estimates that italy 's budget deficit will hit 3.2 percent in 2004 . " berlusconi personally gave his word on it , " german finance minister hans eichel said , referring to rome 's plans to take deficit-cutting measures totaling € 7.5 billion this year .
around € 5.5 billion of that will be spending cuts and tax hikes . led by eichel and his french counterpart at the time , eu finance ministers last november opted to suspend the eu disciplinary process against germany and france for flouting the budget deficit rules of the pact which was designed to underpin the euro .
both germany and france , the two largest euro zone economies , are set to breach the deficit limit for a third consecutive year in 2004 . following tremonti 's resignation , berlusconi has temporarily taken over the finance portfolio .
tremonti stepped down after causing upset with his budget policies in some parts of the center-right coalition .
the finance ministers ' decision will give the italian leader some breathing space to implement deficit-cutting measures without the threat of eu sanctions . " we should not treat italy any worse than others , " said austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , who opposed letting germany and france off the hook last year . but the latest decision will do nothing for the credibility of the stability pact , which has been effectively suspended since november .

the commission estimates that italy 's budget deficit will hit 3.2 percent in 2004 . " berlusconi personally gave his word on it , " german finance minister hans eichel said , referring to rome 's plans to take deficit-cutting measures totaling € 7.5 billion this year .
around € 5.5 billion of that will be spending cuts and tax hikes . led by eichel and his french counterpart at the time , eu finance ministers last november opted to suspend the eu disciplinary process against germany and france for flouting the budget deficit rules of the pact which was designed to underpin the euro .
both germany and france , the two largest euro zone economies , are set to breach the deficit limit for a third consecutive year in 2004 . following tremonti 's resignation , berlusconi has temporarily taken over the finance portfolio .
tremonti stepped down after causing upset with his budget policies in some parts of the center-right coalition .
the finance ministers ' decision will give the italian leader some breathing space to implement deficit-cutting measures without the threat of eu sanctions . " we should not treat italy any worse than others , " said austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , who opposed letting germany and france off the hook last year . but the latest decision will do nothing for the credibility of the stability pact , which has been effectively suspended since november .

commissioner almunia told the belgian newspaper l 'echo over the weekend that he favours a minimum tax for companies accross the eu .
when asked whether an eu-wide minimum rate would be a possibility , almunia replied , " from my point of view , that could be a solution . "
almunia 's comment follows a heated debate over corporate tax levels in the eu .
the 10 new member states that entered the union on may 1 generally have very low levels of corporate tax in order to make their economies more attractive for company investment .
estonia has a zero percent rate for reinvested earnings while latvia , lithuania and cyprus charge 15 percent and poland 19 percent .
france , germany and sweden - countries with corporate tax rates ranging from 35 to 40 percent - fear that companies will shift their investments away from their economies to the east .
so they are keen to see minimal corporate tax levels in the eu .
but commissioner almunia acknowledged to l 'echo that many eu countries still oppose such an idea .

judges trying former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic on war crimes charges said monday that the trial in the hague should be reviewed after delaying hearings again because of his failing health . " the time has come for a radical review of the trial process ... in light of the health of the accused , " presiding judge patrick robinson said before adjourning the hearing on the day milosevic had been due to launch his defense . a feisty milosevic , clad in his trademark blue suit , accused judges of putting his health at risk by calling him into court monday " not based on legal reasons " but for the sake of " politics and the media " surrounding the trial .
" my health situation has deteriorated as a direct result of your refusal to enable me to get my health back , " he said . the mammoth trial has already dragged on for over two years .
the former president had been due monday to launch his defense to more than 60 charges of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide arising out of the bloody balkans conflicts in the 1990s . but a doctor 's report read by robinson said the former serbian strongman , 62 , was at risk because he suffered from " extremely high blood pressure " .
court-appointed doctors say that milosevic is at risk of a heart attack , especially during periods of stress .
" it is absolutely essential that milosevic rests , " the judge said , quoting from the report . finished by 2005 ? seen as the most important war crimes trial in europe since world war ii , the trial is not normally expected to finish until at least mid-2005 . milosevic , who refuses to acknowledge the legality of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , has been acting as his own lawyer .
he had been working long hours to prepare his defense , putting a strain on his already fragile health . according to the judges , the trial proceedings and even its continuation would now have to be examined .
robinson said the court would publish a written decision on these issues on monday or tuesday . milosevic 's opening statement , which had been expected to be an attempt to boost his waning popularity in serbia , was also postponed indefinitely until the judges decide how and if the trial can continue . " the date for my opening statement should not be fixed earlier than a month from now , " milosevic said .
the trial has already been interrupted over a dozen times because milosevic has felt ill . the charges relate to his alleged central role in the wars in croatia in 1991-95 , bosnia in 1992-95 and kosovo in 1998-99 .
for the bloody conflict in bosnia which left 200,000 people dead , he faces separate charges of genocide , the gravest of war crimes .
if convicted he could be sentenced to life imprisonment . court-appointed counsel the prosecution on monday suggested that the court either impose counsel on milosevic or set up a video link so milosevic can follow the trial from the detention unit .
both suggestions were categorically rejected by the former president . " it is a stalemate : either milosevic gets so ill that the trial can not continue or there will be long interruptions making it impossible to manage the case , or the judges will impose counsel and milosevic will refuse to cooperate , " legal expert and tribunal watcher heikelina verrijn stuart told the afp news agency . she said she expected the judges would not stop the trial but were likely to impose a lawyer even if milosevic objected . milosevic has said he will call world leaders like british prime minister tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schroeder and former us president bill clinton to take the stand , but it is unlikely they will come to the hague without an official summons . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic prosecution closes arguments this week prosecutors at the international war crimes tribunal will wrap up their case against slobodan milosevic in the next few days .
the former serb leader plans a defense strategy that could extend the trial until 2006 .

judges trying former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic on war crimes charges said monday that the trial in the hague should be reviewed after delaying hearings again because of his failing health . " the time has come for a radical review of the trial process ... in light of the health of the accused , " presiding judge patrick robinson said before adjourning the hearing on the day milosevic had been due to launch his defense . a feisty milosevic , clad in his trademark blue suit , accused judges of putting his health at risk by calling him into court monday " not based on legal reasons " but for the sake of " politics and the media " surrounding the trial .
" my health situation has deteriorated as a direct result of your refusal to enable me to get my health back , " he said . the mammoth trial has already dragged on for over two years .
the former president had been due monday to launch his defense to more than 60 charges of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide arising out of the bloody balkans conflicts in the 1990s . but a doctor 's report read by robinson said the former serbian strongman , 62 , was at risk because he suffered from " extremely high blood pressure " .

judges trying former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic on war crimes charges said monday that the trial in the hague should be reviewed after delaying hearings again because of his failing health . " the time has come for a radical review of the trial process ... in light of the health of the accused , " presiding judge patrick robinson said before adjourning the hearing on the day milosevic had been due to launch his defense . a feisty milosevic , clad in his trademark blue suit , accused judges of putting his health at risk by calling him into court monday " not based on legal reasons " but for the sake of " politics and the media " surrounding the trial .
" my health situation has deteriorated as a direct result of your refusal to enable me to get my health back , " he said . the mammoth trial has already dragged on for over two years .
the former president had been due monday to launch his defense to more than 60 charges of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide arising out of the bloody balkans conflicts in the 1990s . but a doctor 's report read by robinson said the former serbian strongman , 62 , was at risk because he suffered from " extremely high blood pressure " .
court-appointed doctors say that milosevic is at risk of a heart attack , especially during periods of stress .
" it is absolutely essential that milosevic rests , " the judge said , quoting from the report . finished by 2005 ? seen as the most important war crimes trial in europe since world war ii , the trial is not normally expected to finish until at least mid-2005 . milosevic , who refuses to acknowledge the legality of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , has been acting as his own lawyer .
he had been working long hours to prepare his defense , putting a strain on his already fragile health . according to the judges , the trial proceedings and even its continuation would now have to be examined .
robinson said the court would publish a written decision on these issues on monday or tuesday . milosevic 's opening statement , which had been expected to be an attempt to boost his waning popularity in serbia , was also postponed indefinitely until the judges decide how and if the trial can continue . " the date for my opening statement should not be fixed earlier than a month from now , " milosevic said .

commissioner almunia told the belgian newspaper l 'echo over the weekend that he favours a minimum tax for companies accross the eu .

estonia has a zero percent rate for reinvested earnings while latvia , lithuania and cyprus charge 15 percent and poland 19 percent .

commissioner almunia told the belgian newspaper l 'echo over the weekend that he favours a minimum tax for companies accross the eu .
when asked whether an eu-wide minimum rate would be a possibility , almunia replied , " from my point of view , that could be a solution . "
almunia 's comment follows a heated debate over corporate tax levels in the eu .
the 10 new member states that entered the union on may 1 generally have very low levels of corporate tax in order to make their economies more attractive for company investment .
estonia has a zero percent rate for reinvested earnings while latvia , lithuania and cyprus charge 15 percent and poland 19 percent .
france , germany and sweden - countries with corporate tax rates ranging from 35 to 40 percent - fear that companies will shift their investments away from their economies to the east .
so they are keen to see minimal corporate tax levels in the eu .
but commissioner almunia acknowledged to l 'echo that many eu countries still oppose such an idea .

despite the remarkable final result , the game itself was hardly an end indicative of a tournament that had produced some magical moments and one which will go down in soccer history as one of the most successful - and unbelievable - european championships ever .
regardless of the manner in which it was played , the result of the match was , beyond any doubt , an absolutely historical one .
when theodoros zagorakis held the henri delauney trophy aloft in the balmy lisbon night air , it heralded an amazing closing act to three weeks of drama , agony and ecstasy which had seen the order of european soccer nations turned upside down .
it was a surprising final , given the two teams contesting it and the teams watching it from home , but one that bore all the hallmarks of every greece game seen at these championships : grinding defense offset with a killer blow .
a more magical final on paper one could not imagine .
the hosts against the most unfancied team .
portugal had been carried on their way to the final on a wave of national pride and expectation as their performances grew in stature .
the greeks had upset the soccer hierarchy on their way to the final , dispatching previous holders france and the much favored czech republic .
the scene was set for a potentially glorious spectacle : the home side versus the underdogs .
the match started as if not just the trophy but the lives of all those on the pitch depended on the outcome .
portugal began with a feverish pace but chose to build attacks rather than push to the very heart of the greek defense .
the hosts tested both flanks to no avail in the first ten minutes as they probed the opposition for weaknesses .
greece were man-marking pauleta and deco as the striker and playmaker were shadowed across the pitch in every offensive move .
the greeks , however , were having more trouble dealing with ronaldo and figo who were swapping flanks at will and driving down the bylines when the opportunity arose .
chances are few and far between ronaldo had the first attempt on goal in the 13th minute but nikopolidis was equal to his low punt from just inside the area .
maniche was next , taking the ball out of his feet on the edge of the penalty box and whipping a low shot which the greek keeper did well to touch round the post .
while wave upon wave of portuguese attack broke on the rocks of greece 's defense , the greek attackers began to push their own case for the opening goal .
some great running from setaridis broke open portugal 's midfield stranglehold and his smart ball to charisteas released the gangly striker on goal .
unfortunately for greece , the ball drifted away and was easily cleared by ricardo .
greece begin to turn the screw as the first half approached the 30 minute mark , the python tactic of greece 's defense seemed to go into overdrive as the game struggled to raise itself and the pulse of anyone in the stadium of light .
with two lines of solid white keeping the increasingly frustrated red shirts at bay , there was a rash of unnecessary fouls and free kicks .
miguel , who had been one of portugal 's brightest stars of the opening exchanges with driving runs down the right flank , sustained a blow to the chest around the 38th minute and , although he came back on , the right-back was soon off the pitch again .
his replacement , paulo ferreira joined the ranks of portuguese players being suffocated by the greek tactics .
while shutting up shop at one end , the greeks launched hopeful scud-like balls into ricardo 's area at the other with no attacker in sight as the game ground to a close for the hal-time break .
portugal chasing the game the second half began with very little hope of the explosive element of the portuguese side being allowed to spew forth .
the hosts looked to start the second period with more waves of attacks but found that the greeks were even more resolute than before the break .
deco began showing his fast feet but when his industry came to nothing , he took to the ground looking for a penalty .
the first time looked like a bookable offence , the second looked like a genuine claim but each time , the german referee waved play on .
charisteas heads greece in front then on 57 minutes , greece struck .
after suffocating their opponents , the snake turned and took a huge bite .
after seitaridis , who had tormented portugal down the right , did brilliantly to win greece 's first corner of the final .
charisteas rose above the portugal defence to head past ricardo , who failed to deal with basinas ' cross .
the hosts were rocked and never really recovered .
in the immediate aftermath of the goal , ronaldo could have put them on an equal footing but his vicious shot on the turn was pummeled away by nikopolidis .
as the clock ticked away , portugal became increasingly frustrated by the deep defending .
the forward line pressed further and further upfield leaving acres of space ahead of ricardo in the portugal goal .
the tactic almost paid off .
with one minute remaining , figo found himself in space and twisted free to place a shot just centimeters away from being an equalizer .
but with the chance , so went the hopes of the host nation .
new champions claim their prize greece played out the last minutes of added time , taking the ball into dead ends and forcing the portuguese to snap at the heels of the champions-in-waiting .

despite the remarkable final result , the game itself was hardly an end indicative of a tournament that had produced some magical moments and one which will go down in soccer history as one of the most successful - and unbelievable - european championships ever .
regardless of the manner in which it was played , the result of the match was , beyond any doubt , an absolutely historical one .
when theodoros zagorakis held the henri delauney trophy aloft in the balmy lisbon night air , it heralded an amazing closing act to three weeks of drama , agony and ecstasy which had seen the order of european soccer nations turned upside down .
it was a surprising final , given the two teams contesting it and the teams watching it from home , but one that bore all the hallmarks of every greece game seen at these championships : grinding defense offset with a killer blow .
a more magical final on paper one could not imagine .
the hosts against the most unfancied team .
portugal had been carried on their way to the final on a wave of national pride and expectation as their performances grew in stature .
the greeks had upset the soccer hierarchy on their way to the final , dispatching previous holders france and the much favored czech republic .
the scene was set for a potentially glorious spectacle : the home side versus the underdogs .
the match started as if not just the trophy but the lives of all those on the pitch depended on the outcome .
portugal began with a feverish pace but chose to build attacks rather than push to the very heart of the greek defense .
the hosts tested both flanks to no avail in the first ten minutes as they probed the opposition for weaknesses .
greece were man-marking pauleta and deco as the striker and playmaker were shadowed across the pitch in every offensive move .
the greeks , however , were having more trouble dealing with ronaldo and figo who were swapping flanks at will and driving down the bylines when the opportunity arose .
chances are few and far between ronaldo had the first attempt on goal in the 13th minute but nikopolidis was equal to his low punt from just inside the area .
maniche was next , taking the ball out of his feet on the edge of the penalty box and whipping a low shot which the greek keeper did well to touch round the post .
while wave upon wave of portuguese attack broke on the rocks of greece 's defense , the greek attackers began to push their own case for the opening goal .
some great running from setaridis broke open portugal 's midfield stranglehold and his smart ball to charisteas released the gangly striker on goal .
unfortunately for greece , the ball drifted away and was easily cleared by ricardo .
greece begin to turn the screw as the first half approached the 30 minute mark , the python tactic of greece 's defense seemed to go into overdrive as the game struggled to raise itself and the pulse of anyone in the stadium of light .
with two lines of solid white keeping the increasingly frustrated red shirts at bay , there was a rash of unnecessary fouls and free kicks .
miguel , who had been one of portugal 's brightest stars of the opening exchanges with driving runs down the right flank , sustained a blow to the chest around the 38th minute and , although he came back on , the right-back was soon off the pitch again .
his replacement , paulo ferreira joined the ranks of portuguese players being suffocated by the greek tactics .
while shutting up shop at one end , the greeks launched hopeful scud-like balls into ricardo 's area at the other with no attacker in sight as the game ground to a close for the hal-time break .
portugal chasing the game the second half began with very little hope of the explosive element of the portuguese side being allowed to spew forth .
the hosts looked to start the second period with more waves of attacks but found that the greeks were even more resolute than before the break .
deco began showing his fast feet but when his industry came to nothing , he took to the ground looking for a penalty .
the first time looked like a bookable offence , the second looked like a genuine claim but each time , the german referee waved play on .
charisteas heads greece in front then on 57 minutes , greece struck .
after suffocating their opponents , the snake turned and took a huge bite .
after seitaridis , who had tormented portugal down the right , did brilliantly to win greece 's first corner of the final .
charisteas rose above the portugal defence to head past ricardo , who failed to deal with basinas ' cross .
the hosts were rocked and never really recovered .
in the immediate aftermath of the goal , ronaldo could have put them on an equal footing but his vicious shot on the turn was pummeled away by nikopolidis .
as the clock ticked away , portugal became increasingly frustrated by the deep defending .
the forward line pressed further and further upfield leaving acres of space ahead of ricardo in the portugal goal .
the tactic almost paid off .
with one minute remaining , figo found himself in space and twisted free to place a shot just centimeters away from being an equalizer .
but with the chance , so went the hopes of the host nation .
new champions claim their prize greece played out the last minutes of added time , taking the ball into dead ends and forcing the portuguese to snap at the heels of the champions-in-waiting .
when the final whistle went , the faces of the teams told totally different stories .
there in tears were the hosts .
for the likes of figo and rui costa , the " golden generation " had yielded nothing .
for the new faces , there would be other chances but that was hardly any comfort at all .

judges trying former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic on war crimes charges said monday that the trial in the hague should be reviewed after delaying hearings again because of his failing health . " the time has come for a radical review of the trial process ... in light of the health of the accused , " presiding judge patrick robinson said before adjourning the hearing on the day milosevic had been due to launch his defense . a feisty milosevic , clad in his trademark blue suit , accused judges of putting his health at risk by calling him into court monday " not based on legal reasons " but for the sake of " politics and the media " surrounding the trial .
" my health situation has deteriorated as a direct result of your refusal to enable me to get my health back , " he said . the mammoth trial has already dragged on for over two years .
the former president had been due monday to launch his defense to more than 60 charges of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide arising out of the bloody balkans conflicts in the 1990s . but a doctor 's report read by robinson said the former serbian strongman , 62 , was at risk because he suffered from " extremely high blood pressure " .
court-appointed doctors say that milosevic is at risk of a heart attack , especially during periods of stress .
" it is absolutely essential that milosevic rests , " the judge said , quoting from the report . finished by 2005 ? seen as the most important war crimes trial in europe since world war ii , the trial is not normally expected to finish until at least mid-2005 . milosevic , who refuses to acknowledge the legality of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , has been acting as his own lawyer .
he had been working long hours to prepare his defense , putting a strain on his already fragile health . according to the judges , the trial proceedings and even its continuation would now have to be examined .
robinson said the court would publish a written decision on these issues on monday or tuesday . milosevic 's opening statement , which had been expected to be an attempt to boost his waning popularity in serbia , was also postponed indefinitely until the judges decide how and if the trial can continue . " the date for my opening statement should not be fixed earlier than a month from now , " milosevic said .
the trial has already been interrupted over a dozen times because milosevic has felt ill . the charges relate to his alleged central role in the wars in croatia in 1991-95 , bosnia in 1992-95 and kosovo in 1998-99 .
for the bloody conflict in bosnia which left 200,000 people dead , he faces separate charges of genocide , the gravest of war crimes .
if convicted he could be sentenced to life imprisonment . court-appointed counsel the prosecution on monday suggested that the court either impose counsel on milosevic or set up a video link so milosevic can follow the trial from the detention unit .
both suggestions were categorically rejected by the former president . " it is a stalemate : either milosevic gets so ill that the trial can not continue or there will be long interruptions making it impossible to manage the case , or the judges will impose counsel and milosevic will refuse to cooperate , " legal expert and tribunal watcher heikelina verrijn stuart told the afp news agency . she said she expected the judges would not stop the trial but were likely to impose a lawyer even if milosevic objected . milosevic has said he will call world leaders like british prime minister tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schroeder and former us president bill clinton to take the stand , but it is unlikely they will come to the hague without an official summons . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic prosecution closes arguments this week prosecutors at the international war crimes tribunal will wrap up their case against slobodan milosevic in the next few days .
the former serb leader plans a defense strategy that could extend the trial until 2006 .

the commission estimates that italy 's budget deficit will hit 3.2 percent in 2004 . " berlusconi personally gave his word on it , " german finance minister hans eichel said , referring to rome 's plans to take deficit-cutting measures totaling € 7.5 billion this year .

both germany and france , the two largest euro zone economies , are set to breach the deficit limit for a third consecutive year in 2004 . following tremonti 's resignation , berlusconi has temporarily taken over the finance portfolio .

the commission estimates that italy 's budget deficit will hit 3.2 percent in 2004 . " berlusconi personally gave his word on it , " german finance minister hans eichel said , referring to rome 's plans to take deficit-cutting measures totaling € 7.5 billion this year .
around € 5.5 billion of that will be spending cuts and tax hikes . led by eichel and his french counterpart at the time , eu finance ministers last november opted to suspend the eu disciplinary process against germany and france for flouting the budget deficit rules of the pact which was designed to underpin the euro .
both germany and france , the two largest euro zone economies , are set to breach the deficit limit for a third consecutive year in 2004 . following tremonti 's resignation , berlusconi has temporarily taken over the finance portfolio .
tremonti stepped down after causing upset with his budget policies in some parts of the center-right coalition .
the finance ministers ' decision will give the italian leader some breathing space to implement deficit-cutting measures without the threat of eu sanctions . " we should not treat italy any worse than others , " said austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , who opposed letting germany and france off the hook last year . but the latest decision will do nothing for the credibility of the stability pact , which has been effectively suspended since november .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.07.2004 milosevic trial delayed on health concerns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobo has a bad heart .
judges trying former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic on war crimes charges said monday that the trial in the hague should be reviewed after delaying hearings again because of his failing health . " the time has come for a radical review of the trial process ... in light of the health of the accused , " presiding judge patrick robinson said before adjourning the hearing on the day milosevic had been due to launch his defense . a feisty milosevic , clad in his trademark blue suit , accused judges of putting his health at risk by calling him into court monday " not based on legal reasons " but for the sake of " politics and the media " surrounding the trial .
" my health situation has deteriorated as a direct result of your refusal to enable me to get my health back , " he said . the mammoth trial has already dragged on for over two years .
the former president had been due monday to launch his defense to more than 60 charges of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide arising out of the bloody balkans conflicts in the 1990s . but a doctor 's report read by robinson said the former serbian strongman , 62 , was at risk because he suffered from " extremely high blood pressure " .
court-appointed doctors say that milosevic is at risk of a heart attack , especially during periods of stress .
" it is absolutely essential that milosevic rests , " the judge said , quoting from the report . finished by 2005 ? seen as the most important war crimes trial in europe since world war ii , the trial is not normally expected to finish until at least mid-2005 . milosevic , who refuses to acknowledge the legality of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , has been acting as his own lawyer .
he had been working long hours to prepare his defense , putting a strain on his already fragile health . according to the judges , the trial proceedings and even its continuation would now have to be examined .
robinson said the court would publish a written decision on these issues on monday or tuesday . milosevic 's opening statement , which had been expected to be an attempt to boost his waning popularity in serbia , was also postponed indefinitely until the judges decide how and if the trial can continue . " the date for my opening statement should not be fixed earlier than a month from now , " milosevic said .
the trial has already been interrupted over a dozen times because milosevic has felt ill . the charges relate to his alleged central role in the wars in croatia in 1991-95 , bosnia in 1992-95 and kosovo in 1998-99 .
for the bloody conflict in bosnia which left 200,000 people dead , he faces separate charges of genocide , the gravest of war crimes .
if convicted he could be sentenced to life imprisonment . court-appointed counsel the prosecution on monday suggested that the court either impose counsel on milosevic or set up a video link so milosevic can follow the trial from the detention unit .
both suggestions were categorically rejected by the former president . " it is a stalemate : either milosevic gets so ill that the trial can not continue or there will be long interruptions making it impossible to manage the case , or the judges will impose counsel and milosevic will refuse to cooperate , " legal expert and tribunal watcher heikelina verrijn stuart told the afp news agency . she said she expected the judges would not stop the trial but were likely to impose a lawyer even if milosevic objected . milosevic has said he will call world leaders like british prime minister tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schroeder and former us president bill clinton to take the stand , but it is unlikely they will come to the hague without an official summons . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic prosecution closes arguments this week prosecutors at the international war crimes tribunal will wrap up their case against slobodan milosevic in the next few days .

the commission estimates that italy 's budget deficit will hit 3.2 percent in 2004 . " berlusconi personally gave his word on it , " german finance minister hans eichel said , referring to rome 's plans to take deficit-cutting measures totaling € 7.5 billion this year .
around € 5.5 billion of that will be spending cuts and tax hikes . led by eichel and his french counterpart at the time , eu finance ministers last november opted to suspend the eu disciplinary process against germany and france for flouting the budget deficit rules of the pact which was designed to underpin the euro .
both germany and france , the two largest euro zone economies , are set to breach the deficit limit for a third consecutive year in 2004 . following tremonti 's resignation , berlusconi has temporarily taken over the finance portfolio .
tremonti stepped down after causing upset with his budget policies in some parts of the center-right coalition .
the finance ministers ' decision will give the italian leader some breathing space to implement deficit-cutting measures without the threat of eu sanctions . " we should not treat italy any worse than others , " said austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , who opposed letting germany and france off the hook last year . but the latest decision will do nothing for the credibility of the stability pact , which has been effectively suspended since november .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.07.2004 milosevic trial delayed on health concerns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobo has a bad heart .
judges trying former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic on war crimes charges said monday that the trial in the hague should be reviewed after delaying hearings again because of his failing health . " the time has come for a radical review of the trial process ... in light of the health of the accused , " presiding judge patrick robinson said before adjourning the hearing on the day milosevic had been due to launch his defense . a feisty milosevic , clad in his trademark blue suit , accused judges of putting his health at risk by calling him into court monday " not based on legal reasons " but for the sake of " politics and the media " surrounding the trial .
" my health situation has deteriorated as a direct result of your refusal to enable me to get my health back , " he said . the mammoth trial has already dragged on for over two years .
the former president had been due monday to launch his defense to more than 60 charges of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide arising out of the bloody balkans conflicts in the 1990s . but a doctor 's report read by robinson said the former serbian strongman , 62 , was at risk because he suffered from " extremely high blood pressure " .
court-appointed doctors say that milosevic is at risk of a heart attack , especially during periods of stress .
" it is absolutely essential that milosevic rests , " the judge said , quoting from the report . finished by 2005 ? seen as the most important war crimes trial in europe since world war ii , the trial is not normally expected to finish until at least mid-2005 . milosevic , who refuses to acknowledge the legality of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , has been acting as his own lawyer .
he had been working long hours to prepare his defense , putting a strain on his already fragile health . according to the judges , the trial proceedings and even its continuation would now have to be examined .
robinson said the court would publish a written decision on these issues on monday or tuesday . milosevic 's opening statement , which had been expected to be an attempt to boost his waning popularity in serbia , was also postponed indefinitely until the judges decide how and if the trial can continue . " the date for my opening statement should not be fixed earlier than a month from now , " milosevic said .
the trial has already been interrupted over a dozen times because milosevic has felt ill . the charges relate to his alleged central role in the wars in croatia in 1991-95 , bosnia in 1992-95 and kosovo in 1998-99 .
for the bloody conflict in bosnia which left 200,000 people dead , he faces separate charges of genocide , the gravest of war crimes .
if convicted he could be sentenced to life imprisonment . court-appointed counsel the prosecution on monday suggested that the court either impose counsel on milosevic or set up a video link so milosevic can follow the trial from the detention unit .
both suggestions were categorically rejected by the former president . " it is a stalemate : either milosevic gets so ill that the trial can not continue or there will be long interruptions making it impossible to manage the case , or the judges will impose counsel and milosevic will refuse to cooperate , " legal expert and tribunal watcher heikelina verrijn stuart told the afp news agency . she said she expected the judges would not stop the trial but were likely to impose a lawyer even if milosevic objected . milosevic has said he will call world leaders like british prime minister tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schroeder and former us president bill clinton to take the stand , but it is unlikely they will come to the hague without an official summons . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic prosecution closes arguments this week prosecutors at the international war crimes tribunal will wrap up their case against slobodan milosevic in the next few days .

robinson said the court would publish a written decision on these issues on monday or tuesday . milosevic 's opening statement , which had been expected to be an attempt to boost his waning popularity in serbia , was also postponed indefinitely until the judges decide how and if the trial can continue . " the date for my opening statement should not be fixed earlier than a month from now , " milosevic said .
the trial has already been interrupted over a dozen times because milosevic has felt ill . the charges relate to his alleged central role in the wars in croatia in 1991-95 , bosnia in 1992-95 and kosovo in 1998-99 .
for the bloody conflict in bosnia which left 200,000 people dead , he faces separate charges of genocide , the gravest of war crimes .
if convicted he could be sentenced to life imprisonment . court-appointed counsel the prosecution on monday suggested that the court either impose counsel on milosevic or set up a video link so milosevic can follow the trial from the detention unit .
both suggestions were categorically rejected by the former president . " it is a stalemate : either milosevic gets so ill that the trial can not continue or there will be long interruptions making it impossible to manage the case , or the judges will impose counsel and milosevic will refuse to cooperate , " legal expert and tribunal watcher heikelina verrijn stuart told the afp news agency . she said she expected the judges would not stop the trial but were likely to impose a lawyer even if milosevic objected . milosevic has said he will call world leaders like british prime minister tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schroeder and former us president bill clinton to take the stand , but it is unlikely they will come to the hague without an official summons . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic prosecution closes arguments this week prosecutors at the international war crimes tribunal will wrap up their case against slobodan milosevic in the next few days .
the former serb leader plans a defense strategy that could extend the trial until 2006 .

' sum derisory ' hepatitis c is a life-threatening condition which can lead to liver cancer .
support groups for victims have spent many years calling for a public inquiry and compensation .
last year the scottish executive led the uk in agreeing to make compassionate payments of up to £ 40,000 .
but patients have described the sum on offer as derisory and say their fight for answers through an open inquiry will continue .
in may it was revealed that bereaved families of hepatitis c victims were taking action against the scottish executive .
the families want judges to rule that scottish health minister malcolm chisholm is breaking human rights law by refusing to hold a public inquiry .

stress is the second most common reason given for being off work amongst non-manual workers .
a report from the chartered institute of personnel and development shows sickness levels are up on last year .
in wales workers are off work for an average 10.7 days , with more time lost in the public than the private sector .
organisational counsellor ava fine says there are particular factors which could affect public sector workers ' sickness rates .
" they are dealing with the public , the resources are fairly limited , and the systems are bureaucratic and hierarchical " .
bosses are obviously not doing enough to protect workers from the dangers of over-work brendan barber , tuc " people often do n't feel in control of the work they are doing , and that will contribute to sickness factors , " said ms fine .
london has the lowest absenteeism rates of 6.9 days per employee .
nearly two-thirds of all sick leave is for fewer than five days - with the biggest cause being illnesses such as colds and the flu .
but stress is a growing problem .
heavy workloads , pressure to meet targets , and management style were said to be the main causes .
stress-related absence half the 1,100 employers polled said that they had introduced staff surveys and were employing occupational health professionals to tackle stress .
ben willmott , the report 's author , said : " although it is worrying to see stress-related absence on the increase it is encouraging that employers are taking action to address this . "
the survey also revealed concerns about the sick note system , with most employers believing that doctors issued them too easily .
in the uk , the cost of sickness absence has increased from £ 67 per worker to £ 88 during the last year .
the highest absence levels were among workers in the food , drink , tobacco , and transport industries -lrb- 12 days a year -rrb- , health -lrb- 11.6 days -rrb- and central government -lrb- 11.6 days -rrb- .
the lowest absence levels were in consultancy -lrb- 5.5 days -rrb- , media , and publishing -lrb- six days -rrb- and telecommunications -lrb- seven days -rrb- .
felicity williams , general secretary of the wales tuc , said the higher sickness levels in wales could be as a result of both the higher reliance on public sector work and the higher level of chronic ill health here .
however , she said this did not square with the fact that inward investors into wales say their decisions were often led by the workforce 's high skill base and drive .

bbc news online talked to two charity officers who hold opposite views on smacking .
iain bainbridge , christian institute development officer discipline is part of love .
the current law only allows moderate and reasonable chastisement , therefore parents who use unreasonable or immoderate physical punishment can already - and should be - prosecuted .
also , other sanctions that parents may use instead of smacking , like resorting to sarcasm or withdrawal of affection , can be more damaging .
the other argument that people use is that smacking is violent , and violence is wrong .
but of course there are many circumstances where some kind of physical impact is permitted and seen as acceptable .
for example , if a surgeon operates on somebody , the motivation is to help the patient , and again , with physical punishment the parents ' motivation is to discipline and train a child .
another argument is that in the last couple of decades we have outlawed physical punishment in schools .
and what have we seen ?
more civility , less bullying ?
no , we 've seen exactly the opposite .
and now an increasing number of teachers are leaving the profession because of the total lack of discipline , and even teachers being assaulted .
so we would say that it 's wrong to criminalise loving parents for using moderate physical punishment .
what moderate means , is for the courts to decide in the coming law .
we think that 's the best case .
it 's wrong to criminalise loving parents for using moderate physical punishment .
what moderate means , is for the courts to decide in the coming law .
iain bainbridge with regard to what is being proposed , i have seen that there is an amendment being put down to the children 's bill - it 's extremely restrictive .
the vast majority of parents use their own common sense , but the way to go forward is not to further restrict the freedom of parents and to plunge the vast majority of them into legal confusion and the possibility of prosecution for using reasonable and loving discipline .
the ironic thing about all this is that the government 's own office of national statistics survey found that 89 % of people think it 's sometimes necessary to smack a child .
groups like the nspcc , who are part of the children are unbeatable campaign , are actually seeking to criminalise their own supporters because the vast majority will at least at some point in the past have used physical discipline on children .
finally , if smacking is made criminal , that means social workers and police will have to investigate all sorts of trivial cases , and that will prevent them from being able to concentrate on cases where children are actually physically abused .
lucy thorpe , nspcc policy advisor what we are actually talking about here is children having the same protection as adults under the law on assault .
that would send a clear message to parents and everybody else that hitting children is as unacceptable as hitting anybody else in the society .
what we have at the moment is a situation where children actually have less protection under the law on assault rather than the same as adults .
the poll that children are unbeatable have released shows seven in 10 people would want a change in the law to give children adequate protection .
we do know from our own research that attitudes are shifting .
a majority of people believe that it 's wrong to hit babies and toddlers .
we do know from our own research that attitudes are shifting .
a majority of people believe that it 's wrong to hit babies and toddlers .
lucy thorpe the fact remains that there is a department of health research that shows many babies have been hit by the time they are one .
the difficulty is , we have a law that dates back to 1860 which is failing to protect children .
on the one hand we have professionals who are trying to protect children and send out messages in terms of positive and non-violent parenting , and on the other we have a law that says that children can be hit by their parents .
this is clearly an anomaly and it hampers effective child protection and family support .
we at the nspcc do n't just want a change in the law - we want much more widespread support and education for parents on the benefits of positive non-violent discipline .
i know that the discussion is often based on ' what harm does a light smack do ' .
it may do no physical harm , but there are several things attached : we know that physical punishment can in some cases escalate and turn into abuse .
also , it sends a clear message to children : that might is right , that if you do n't like what someone is doing to you should resort to physical force .
now , in terms of domestic violence between adults we would not accept for a wife or husband to give their partner a tap or smack , and it should be the same for children .
in terms of promoting good family relationships we do n't want undisciplined children more than anybody else does , but we do want children to be brought up in a loving and supporting household where positive , non-violent discipline is used , which actually helps children learn about their behaviour and develop self-discipline .
if you rely on physical punishment you are teaching a child to be afraid of you , and you are potentially storing up a lot of problems : children can feel hurt , angry and resentful .

bbc news online talked to two charity officers who hold opposite views on smacking .
iain bainbridge , christian institute development officer discipline is part of love .
the current law only allows moderate and reasonable chastisement , therefore parents who use unreasonable or immoderate physical punishment can already - and should be - prosecuted .
also , other sanctions that parents may use instead of smacking , like resorting to sarcasm or withdrawal of affection , can be more damaging .
the other argument that people use is that smacking is violent , and violence is wrong .
but of course there are many circumstances where some kind of physical impact is permitted and seen as acceptable .
for example , if a surgeon operates on somebody , the motivation is to help the patient , and again , with physical punishment the parents ' motivation is to discipline and train a child .
another argument is that in the last couple of decades we have outlawed physical punishment in schools .
and what have we seen ?
more civility , less bullying ?
no , we 've seen exactly the opposite .
and now an increasing number of teachers are leaving the profession because of the total lack of discipline , and even teachers being assaulted .
so we would say that it 's wrong to criminalise loving parents for using moderate physical punishment .
what moderate means , is for the courts to decide in the coming law .
we think that 's the best case .
it 's wrong to criminalise loving parents for using moderate physical punishment .
what moderate means , is for the courts to decide in the coming law .
iain bainbridge with regard to what is being proposed , i have seen that there is an amendment being put down to the children 's bill - it 's extremely restrictive .
the vast majority of parents use their own common sense , but the way to go forward is not to further restrict the freedom of parents and to plunge the vast majority of them into legal confusion and the possibility of prosecution for using reasonable and loving discipline .
the ironic thing about all this is that the government 's own office of national statistics survey found that 89 % of people think it 's sometimes necessary to smack a child .
groups like the nspcc , who are part of the children are unbeatable campaign , are actually seeking to criminalise their own supporters because the vast majority will at least at some point in the past have used physical discipline on children .
finally , if smacking is made criminal , that means social workers and police will have to investigate all sorts of trivial cases , and that will prevent them from being able to concentrate on cases where children are actually physically abused .
lucy thorpe , nspcc policy advisor what we are actually talking about here is children having the same protection as adults under the law on assault .
that would send a clear message to parents and everybody else that hitting children is as unacceptable as hitting anybody else in the society .
what we have at the moment is a situation where children actually have less protection under the law on assault rather than the same as adults .
the poll that children are unbeatable have released shows seven in 10 people would want a change in the law to give children adequate protection .
we do know from our own research that attitudes are shifting .
a majority of people believe that it 's wrong to hit babies and toddlers .
we do know from our own research that attitudes are shifting .
a majority of people believe that it 's wrong to hit babies and toddlers .
lucy thorpe the fact remains that there is a department of health research that shows many babies have been hit by the time they are one .
the difficulty is , we have a law that dates back to 1860 which is failing to protect children .
on the one hand we have professionals who are trying to protect children and send out messages in terms of positive and non-violent parenting , and on the other we have a law that says that children can be hit by their parents .
this is clearly an anomaly and it hampers effective child protection and family support .
we at the nspcc do n't just want a change in the law - we want much more widespread support and education for parents on the benefits of positive non-violent discipline .
i know that the discussion is often based on ' what harm does a light smack do ' .
it may do no physical harm , but there are several things attached : we know that physical punishment can in some cases escalate and turn into abuse .
also , it sends a clear message to children : that might is right , that if you do n't like what someone is doing to you should resort to physical force .
now , in terms of domestic violence between adults we would not accept for a wife or husband to give their partner a tap or smack , and it should be the same for children .
in terms of promoting good family relationships we do n't want undisciplined children more than anybody else does , but we do want children to be brought up in a loving and supporting household where positive , non-violent discipline is used , which actually helps children learn about their behaviour and develop self-discipline .
if you rely on physical punishment you are teaching a child to be afraid of you , and you are potentially storing up a lot of problems : children can feel hurt , angry and resentful .

the vast majority of parents use their own common sense , but the way to go forward is not to further restrict the freedom of parents and to plunge the vast majority of them into legal confusion and the possibility of prosecution for using reasonable and loving discipline .
the ironic thing about all this is that the government 's own office of national statistics survey found that 89 % of people think it 's sometimes necessary to smack a child .
groups like the nspcc , who are part of the children are unbeatable campaign , are actually seeking to criminalise their own supporters because the vast majority will at least at some point in the past have used physical discipline on children .

lucy thorpe , nspcc policy advisor what we are actually talking about here is children having the same protection as adults under the law on assault .
that would send a clear message to parents and everybody else that hitting children is as unacceptable as hitting anybody else in the society .
what we have at the moment is a situation where children actually have less protection under the law on assault rather than the same as adults .

on the one hand we have professionals who are trying to protect children and send out messages in terms of positive and non-violent parenting , and on the other we have a law that says that children can be hit by their parents .
this is clearly an anomaly and it hampers effective child protection and family support .
we at the nspcc do n't just want a change in the law - we want much more widespread support and education for parents on the benefits of positive non-violent discipline .
i know that the discussion is often based on ' what harm does a light smack do ' .
it may do no physical harm , but there are several things attached : we know that physical punishment can in some cases escalate and turn into abuse .
also , it sends a clear message to children : that might is right , that if you do n't like what someone is doing to you should resort to physical force .
now , in terms of domestic violence between adults we would not accept for a wife or husband to give their partner a tap or smack , and it should be the same for children .
in terms of promoting good family relationships we do n't want undisciplined children more than anybody else does , but we do want children to be brought up in a loving and supporting household where positive , non-violent discipline is used , which actually helps children learn about their behaviour and develop self-discipline .
if you rely on physical punishment you are teaching a child to be afraid of you , and you are potentially storing up a lot of problems : children can feel hurt , angry and resentful .

bbc news online talked to two charity officers who hold opposite views on smacking .
iain bainbridge , christian institute development officer discipline is part of love .
the current law only allows moderate and reasonable chastisement , therefore parents who use unreasonable or immoderate physical punishment can already - and should be - prosecuted .
also , other sanctions that parents may use instead of smacking , like resorting to sarcasm or withdrawal of affection , can be more damaging .
the other argument that people use is that smacking is violent , and violence is wrong .
but of course there are many circumstances where some kind of physical impact is permitted and seen as acceptable .
for example , if a surgeon operates on somebody , the motivation is to help the patient , and again , with physical punishment the parents ' motivation is to discipline and train a child .
another argument is that in the last couple of decades we have outlawed physical punishment in schools .
and what have we seen ?

should smoking be banned in enclosed public spaces like pubs and restaurants ?
speaking on breakfast last month , tony blair revealed that he is considering the idea .
well , we 've carried out our own survey on whether a ban would get public backing .
in our poll , around two thirds of all the people questioned supported a ban - with 65 per cent in favour .
among smokers , just under one half supported a ban - with 42 per cent in favour .
among non-smokers the figure was 76 per cent .
the poll also found that 70 per cent of people are worried about the risk to their health from breathing other people 's smoke .
but only around half of those questioned supported the notion of discouraging smoking by increasing taxation on cigarettes .
on breakfast , this morning : we talked to our political correspondent daisy sampson : blair is thought not to have been in favour of this ban as he is said to be worried about adding fuel to " nanny state " criticism .
lib dems are in support , they believe nhs care should be preventative .
government often waits to see what other countries do before going in ...
we spoke to the british medical association 's dr peter maguire , who organised today 's lobbying at downing street : click here to watch dr peter maguire smoking is an addiction , it is harder to quit as you grow older .
the way ahead is to make it harder , it is the right time to introduce a ban .
we heard from peter adams , a conservative councillor in poole who is trying to get a ban in his area : click here to watch peter adams we are making a broad consultation .
if public in poole are in favour we will prepare a bye law , majority of people are law abiding and will follow this if it goes ahead .
we talked to chris owens of the smoke free liverpool campaign : click here to watch chris owens it is workers ' safety which is at stake .
it is about people who are exposed to second hand smoke .
1,000 people are killed from second hand smoking .
