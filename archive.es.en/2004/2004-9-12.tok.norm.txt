you , as a prominent muslim leader , have claimed that islam is a religion of peace .
does that mean that islam has two faces ?
prince karim aga khan iv : no , i do n't think so .
for one thing , you have to think about the fact that this is just represents a very , very small minority of the world 's muslim population .
also , these people are primarily driven by political and not religious motives .
it would be wrong to consider them representative of islam .
the western world has to take a close look to see which forces are in play in order to differentiate between belief and things that have nothing to do with belief .
we as muslims could also ask the same things : like what 's happening in northern ireland .
if i as a muslim came to you and were to say : what 's happening in northern ireland reflects catholic and protestant beliefs , then you would say : you 're uneducated .
in many western countries , including germany , more and more people have the opinion that islam and democracy are irreconcilable .
if that 's true , then a mutual understanding and effective cooperation between muslims and the western world would be practically impossible .
that 's true , but i do n't see a conflict between islam and democracy .
there 's absolutely no conflict if you look at the original form of the muslim community .
tolerance and pluralism are at the top of your agenda for improving conditions for all humans .
is that because your own followers , the minority ismaili muslims , are discriminated against ?
at times , other muslims have even gone so far as to describe you as a heretic .
in every religion there are differences of opinion about the interpretation of the religion .
but i do n't think the ismailis are still discriminated against today .
to the contrary , we 're building bridges to the representatives of other directions of islam .
because the idea of pluralism is tightly anchored in islam .
of course there are many different interpretations .
but the differences in interpretation is not a problem in islam .
i would even go so far as to say that islam is a very broad religion .
there 's a very famous line by allah in the quran : " i have created you from one soul . "
with that line , he meant all of humanity .
since the end of 2001 , the west has been seeking a dialogue with the muslim world .
but more and more people are frustrated because no real answer is coming from the muslim side .
they 're waiting for the voices of moderate muslims who will vocally and clearly speak out against terrorism in the name of islam .
why are n't we hearing these voices ?
i think you can hear these voices more often now .
we have to consider that there are forces inside the islamic world that do not promote freedom of opinion - especially in regards to religion .
is there hope that we can someday stop terrorism ?
firstly , i 'd say this : let 's remedy the causes of terrorism .
generally that 's political frustration and not a question of religion .
the situation in the middle east was not created by islamic beliefs .
the situation in kashmir was not created by islamic belief .
the situation in afghanistan was not created by islamic beliefs .
so we have to identify the core of the problem , and that is political in nature .
and when we know the real causes of what drives people to desperation , then we can get a grasp on it . interview conducted by günter knabe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de analysis : the phantom of osama bin laden three years after the sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.09.2004 ' there 's no conflict between islam and democracy ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince karim aga khan iv in berlin in an interview with deutsche welle , prince karim aga khan iv , the hereditary imam of shiite ismaili muslims , argues that today 's middle eastern terrorists are fueled by political motivations and not religion . your majesty , the world is shocked by terrorist attacks that are carried out by people who claim to be fighting for islam .
you , as a prominent muslim leader , have claimed that islam is a religion of peace .
does that mean that islam has two faces ?
prince karim aga khan iv : no , i do n't think so .
for one thing , you have to think about the fact that this is just represents a very , very small minority of the world 's muslim population .
also , these people are primarily driven by political and not religious motives .
it would be wrong to consider them representative of islam .
the western world has to take a close look to see which forces are in play in order to differentiate between belief and things that have nothing to do with belief .
we as muslims could also ask the same things : like what 's happening in northern ireland .
if i as a muslim came to you and were to say : what 's happening in northern ireland reflects catholic and protestant beliefs , then you would say : you 're uneducated .
in many western countries , including germany , more and more people have the opinion that islam and democracy are irreconcilable .
if that 's true , then a mutual understanding and effective cooperation between muslims and the western world would be practically impossible .
that 's true , but i do n't see a conflict between islam and democracy .
there 's absolutely no conflict if you look at the original form of the muslim community .
tolerance and pluralism are at the top of your agenda for improving conditions for all humans .
is that because your own followers , the minority ismaili muslims , are discriminated against ?
at times , other muslims have even gone so far as to describe you as a heretic .
in every religion there are differences of opinion about the interpretation of the religion .
but i do n't think the ismailis are still discriminated against today .
to the contrary , we 're building bridges to the representatives of other directions of islam .
because the idea of pluralism is tightly anchored in islam .
of course there are many different interpretations .
but the differences in interpretation is not a problem in islam .
i would even go so far as to say that islam is a very broad religion .
there 's a very famous line by allah in the quran : " i have created you from one soul . "
with that line , he meant all of humanity .
since the end of 2001 , the west has been seeking a dialogue with the muslim world .
but more and more people are frustrated because no real answer is coming from the muslim side .
they 're waiting for the voices of moderate muslims who will vocally and clearly speak out against terrorism in the name of islam .
why are n't we hearing these voices ?
i think you can hear these voices more often now .
we have to consider that there are forces inside the islamic world that do not promote freedom of opinion - especially in regards to religion .
is there hope that we can someday stop terrorism ?
firstly , i 'd say this : let 's remedy the causes of terrorism .
generally that 's political frustration and not a question of religion .
the situation in the middle east was not created by islamic beliefs .
the situation in kashmir was not created by islamic belief .
the situation in afghanistan was not created by islamic beliefs .
so we have to identify the core of the problem , and that is political in nature .
and when we know the real causes of what drives people to desperation , then we can get a grasp on it . interview conducted by günter knabe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de analysis : the phantom of osama bin laden three years after the sept .

three years after the sept .
11 , the terrorism map has spread and the threat has become transparent and harder to ferret out .
nor have we tackled the roots of the problem : poverty and oppression in many muslim countries . if you include iraq and afghanistan in this count , for some time now , not a single day has gone by in which a terrorist attack has been carried out somewhere in the world against innocent victims : passersby , tourists , hotel guests , airline passengers , train passengers , the pious or children on their first day of school . the world map of terrorism has grown and the targets have scattered even further over the continents , but the phenomenon is the same : political demands are executed through violence against innocents who have nothing to do with politics .
governments are extorted , citizens are frightened and terrorized . the myth of al qaeda taking stock of the war against terror three years after sept .
11 and its terror attacks can be an equally sobering and depressing exercise .
under the leadership of the united states , an international alliance has formed that includes western democracies as well as countries that formerly sponsored at least some forms of terrorism .
but a victory over terrorism is still far from sight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osama bin laden : the world 's most elusive cave-dweller in some respects , it could even be farther from sight than it was three years ago .
at least back then we knew the enemy 's address .
at least the most important enemy : osama bin laden and the leaders of his al qaeda terror network mostly lived in taliban-ruled afghanistan - and even if they were n't captured , they were at least real characters .
whereas after the fall of the taliban leadership , the terrorists fled underground , transforming themselves into phantoms .
but such phantoms live longer and appear to be more effective than real and detectable people .
after all , osama bin laden is still considered by wide circles in the islamic world to be a hero because he 's the only person who has stood up against the world 's only superpower and he has dictated the negotiating terms . indeed , al qaeda has already found a replacement for the regimes that once supported it , and it 's an extremely reliable substitute : bin laden 's organization has the support of close to 20,000 alumni who received training in terrorist camps operated by al qaeda in afghanistan .
long ago , these international terror trainees returned to their homelands , where many are operating as sleepers who could be activated at any time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men carry young hostages who managed to escape from the school building after special forces entered the school in beslan , north ossetia , on sept .
3 .
the growing opacity is also making al qaeda more enigmatic : wherever a terror attack is carried out now , the name al qaeda is quickly raised and it is almost always asserted that bin laden has played a role in it .
but that 's almost certainly not always the case .
but what is often true is that the attackers follow the example of al qaeda .
and that holds true in indonesia , turkey , morocco and ossetia .
the list of terrorist targets are growing and all too often they include world regions where disaffected and the frustrated allow themselves to become fanatics and consign themselves to violence . in that sense , it would be wrong to consider al qaeda a sort of tightly organized " terrorism incorporated . "
the " network of terror , " and even this term may go a bit too far , already relies heavily on the existence of oppression and poverty in the world for its own survival .
those seeking to counteract the effects of poverty and oppression often use terms like “ freedom , ” “ democracy ” and “ human rights . ”
but people in the islamic world often accuse the west of double morals because of their strong feeling that muslim countries are economically and politically disadvantaged in comparison to the west .
many interpret this as a kind of religious discrimination against muslims . fighting the roots of terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a guard with an automatic rifle protects the capitol building in washington , d.c. at the same time , the west – especially the usa – does too little to address these disillusioned people .
instead it is moving mostly to protect itself through greater vigilance and an increasing number of civil rights violations .
by doing so , the west is failing to recognize that those moves may also be strengthening terrorists ’ arguments against the west .
additionally , further violence is not going to eradicate terrorism . the conclusion in the end is that terrorism must be fought at its roots – and not just the symptoms .
nor can there just be one method of treatment – otherwise every attempt will be futile .
and there have been many efforts .
of course , a good number of participants in the coalition against terror or not democratic countries .
but they have at least disavowed themselves of their previous support for terrorist groups .
that ’ s a first success .
but now we must work on getting these states , like pakistan and libya , to make the complete transition to freedom and democracy .
only then can we increase the chances the terrorism will be diminished over the long-term . peter philipp -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : mixing up words and deeds in post-9/11 politics to understand why the world has become a more dangerous place since 9/11 , the u.s. should look inward , commentator miodrag soric says .

three years after the sept .
11 , the terrorism map has spread and the threat has become transparent and harder to ferret out .
nor have we tackled the roots of the problem : poverty and oppression in many muslim countries . if you include iraq and afghanistan in this count , for some time now , not a single day has gone by in which a terrorist attack has been carried out somewhere in the world against innocent victims : passersby , tourists , hotel guests , airline passengers , train passengers , the pious or children on their first day of school . the world map of terrorism has grown and the targets have scattered even further over the continents , but the phenomenon is the same : political demands are executed through violence against innocents who have nothing to do with politics .
governments are extorted , citizens are frightened and terrorized . the myth of al qaeda taking stock of the war against terror three years after sept .
11 and its terror attacks can be an equally sobering and depressing exercise .
under the leadership of the united states , an international alliance has formed that includes western democracies as well as countries that formerly sponsored at least some forms of terrorism .
but a victory over terrorism is still far from sight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osama bin laden : the world 's most elusive cave-dweller in some respects , it could even be farther from sight than it was three years ago .
at least back then we knew the enemy 's address .
at least the most important enemy : osama bin laden and the leaders of his al qaeda terror network mostly lived in taliban-ruled afghanistan - and even if they were n't captured , they were at least real characters .
whereas after the fall of the taliban leadership , the terrorists fled underground , transforming themselves into phantoms .
but such phantoms live longer and appear to be more effective than real and detectable people .
after all , osama bin laden is still considered by wide circles in the islamic world to be a hero because he 's the only person who has stood up against the world 's only superpower and he has dictated the negotiating terms . indeed , al qaeda has already found a replacement for the regimes that once supported it , and it 's an extremely reliable substitute : bin laden 's organization has the support of close to 20,000 alumni who received training in terrorist camps operated by al qaeda in afghanistan .

"
the expellees ' lobby group , led by rudi pawelka , is currently planning a string of international lawsuits aimed at returning property and assets to ethnic germans who were forced to flee poland in the millions after world war ii .
" mr. pawelka and his consorts started this debate , he 's unleashed dramatic fear among poles , " byrt told a german newspaper over the weekend .
despite the parliament 's decision , byrt said he did not believe the polish government would actually make any official reparations demands of germany .
" the polish government considers the question of reparations to be finished , " said byrt .
old fears arise anew the polish parliament unanimously called on the government to estimate the total damages germany caused poland in world war ii and to begin talks with berlin .
the text of the resolution stated : " parliament declares that poland has not yet received war reparations payments and damages the for the enormous extent of destruction and material and non-material costs brought on by german aggression , occupation and genocide . "
additionally , the parliament rejected all claims for compensation or restoration of property from german expellees .
in recent weeks , lobby groups for the expellees , like the prussian claims society , have issued demands that have sparked tremendous resentment in poland .
many of the country 's citizens see the lawsuit threats as an effort to put german expellees on the same footing as the polish victims of german war crimes .
the issue is emotionally charged in poland , where old fears , painful historical experiences and the late consequences of a propaganda program that stoked fear of germans in the population for decades .
it 's a bitter realization for anyone who has worked on behalf of the decades-long reconciliation process that has resulted recently in the closest cooperative relationship ever seen between germany and poland .
and the consequences of any lawsuits could be enormous .
in addition to the financial effects , poles fear germans would return to the eastern european countries they once occupied - an uncomfortable notion for historically aware poles , who have a clear idea of who was the culprit and who was the victim in world war ii .
slowing progress the legal position is clear .
a treaty between germany and poland officially recognizes the oder and neisse rivers as poland 's western-most border .
germany is poland 's most important trading partner , and both countries are members of nato and the european union , and germany was also championed poland 's political needs when it negotiated its eu membership .
additionally , poland dropped all of its demands for reparations payments from the germans during the 1950s .
in berlin , politicians have been astounded by the polish parliament 's demand , and the polish government has called for a diplomatic solution between berlin and warsaw .
in a newspaper interview , the german social democrats foreign affairs spokesman , markus meckel , said he was greatly disappointed by the vote .
and the press department at the chancellery in berlin repeated previous statements from chancellor gerhard schröder that both countries consider the question of reparations settled .
debate in parliament the resolution agreed to by the polish parliament is a political resolution and it has no legally binding effect for prime minister marek belka or his government .
" were trying to create a dialogue with the governments of poland to find a solution that finalizes all concerns about damages , also in the legal sense , " belka said .
ironically , the text approved on friday was milder than earlier drafts .

"
the expellees ' lobby group , led by rudi pawelka , is currently planning a string of international lawsuits aimed at returning property and assets to ethnic germans who were forced to flee poland in the millions after world war ii .
" mr. pawelka and his consorts started this debate , he 's unleashed dramatic fear among poles , " byrt told a german newspaper over the weekend .
despite the parliament 's decision , byrt said he did not believe the polish government would actually make any official reparations demands of germany .
" the polish government considers the question of reparations to be finished , " said byrt .
old fears arise anew the polish parliament unanimously called on the government to estimate the total damages germany caused poland in world war ii and to begin talks with berlin .
the text of the resolution stated : " parliament declares that poland has not yet received war reparations payments and damages the for the enormous extent of destruction and material and non-material costs brought on by german aggression , occupation and genocide . "
additionally , the parliament rejected all claims for compensation or restoration of property from german expellees .
in recent weeks , lobby groups for the expellees , like the prussian claims society , have issued demands that have sparked tremendous resentment in poland .
many of the country 's citizens see the lawsuit threats as an effort to put german expellees on the same footing as the polish victims of german war crimes .
the issue is emotionally charged in poland , where old fears , painful historical experiences and the late consequences of a propaganda program that stoked fear of germans in the population for decades .
it 's a bitter realization for anyone who has worked on behalf of the decades-long reconciliation process that has resulted recently in the closest cooperative relationship ever seen between germany and poland .
and the consequences of any lawsuits could be enormous .
in addition to the financial effects , poles fear germans would return to the eastern european countries they once occupied - an uncomfortable notion for historically aware poles , who have a clear idea of who was the culprit and who was the victim in world war ii .
slowing progress the legal position is clear .
a treaty between germany and poland officially recognizes the oder and neisse rivers as poland 's western-most border .
germany is poland 's most important trading partner , and both countries are members of nato and the european union , and germany was also championed poland 's political needs when it negotiated its eu membership .
additionally , poland dropped all of its demands for reparations payments from the germans during the 1950s .
in berlin , politicians have been astounded by the polish parliament 's demand , and the polish government has called for a diplomatic solution between berlin and warsaw .
in a newspaper interview , the german social democrats foreign affairs spokesman , markus meckel , said he was greatly disappointed by the vote .
and the press department at the chancellery in berlin repeated previous statements from chancellor gerhard schröder that both countries consider the question of reparations settled .
debate in parliament the resolution agreed to by the polish parliament is a political resolution and it has no legally binding effect for prime minister marek belka or his government .

ironically , the text approved on friday was milder than earlier drafts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.09.2004 berlin shocked by polish reparations vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national borders do n't always match those of claims the decision of the polish parliament on friday to demand reparations from germany for world war ii draws dismay from german lawmakers . poland 's ambassador to germany , andrzej byrt , said the decision was " a reaction to the actions of the prussian claims society . "
the expellees ' lobby group , led by rudi pawelka , is currently planning a string of international lawsuits aimed at returning property and assets to ethnic germans who were forced to flee poland in the millions after world war ii .
" mr. pawelka and his consorts started this debate , he 's unleashed dramatic fear among poles , " byrt told a german newspaper over the weekend .
despite the parliament 's decision , byrt said he did not believe the polish government would actually make any official reparations demands of germany .
" the polish government considers the question of reparations to be finished , " said byrt .
old fears arise anew the polish parliament unanimously called on the government to estimate the total damages germany caused poland in world war ii and to begin talks with berlin .
the text of the resolution stated : " parliament declares that poland has not yet received war reparations payments and damages the for the enormous extent of destruction and material and non-material costs brought on by german aggression , occupation and genocide . "
additionally , the parliament rejected all claims for compensation or restoration of property from german expellees .
in recent weeks , lobby groups for the expellees , like the prussian claims society , have issued demands that have sparked tremendous resentment in poland .
many of the country 's citizens see the lawsuit threats as an effort to put german expellees on the same footing as the polish victims of german war crimes .
the issue is emotionally charged in poland , where old fears , painful historical experiences and the late consequences of a propaganda program that stoked fear of germans in the population for decades .
it 's a bitter realization for anyone who has worked on behalf of the decades-long reconciliation process that has resulted recently in the closest cooperative relationship ever seen between germany and poland .
and the consequences of any lawsuits could be enormous .
in addition to the financial effects , poles fear germans would return to the eastern european countries they once occupied - an uncomfortable notion for historically aware poles , who have a clear idea of who was the culprit and who was the victim in world war ii .
slowing progress the legal position is clear .
a treaty between germany and poland officially recognizes the oder and neisse rivers as poland 's western-most border .
germany is poland 's most important trading partner , and both countries are members of nato and the european union , and germany was also championed poland 's political needs when it negotiated its eu membership .
additionally , poland dropped all of its demands for reparations payments from the germans during the 1950s .
in berlin , politicians have been astounded by the polish parliament 's demand , and the polish government has called for a diplomatic solution between berlin and warsaw .
in a newspaper interview , the german social democrats foreign affairs spokesman , markus meckel , said he was greatly disappointed by the vote .
and the press department at the chancellery in berlin repeated previous statements from chancellor gerhard schröder that both countries consider the question of reparations settled .
debate in parliament the resolution agreed to by the polish parliament is a political resolution and it has no legally binding effect for prime minister marek belka or his government .
" were trying to create a dialogue with the governments of poland to find a solution that finalizes all concerns about damages , also in the legal sense , " belka said .
ironically , the text approved on friday was milder than earlier drafts .
conservative and nationalist parties originally penned a tougher resolution , but the country 's leftist parties said they would not accept any explicit demand for reparations .
the final outcome was a vaguely formulated demand that the government " take appropriate measures to address the concerns .

but only 90 years ago , handball was a womens sport . handball is no new invention .
different variations of the game were already known in antiquity .
but today 's definition of handball can be traced back to the womens ' committee of berlin-turnrath , named for the berlin neighborhood where the game was invented by max heiser in 1917 .
beginning on oct .
29 of that year , the game became a harmless alternative to the rough male sport known as soccer .
of course , the new rules were written for the special needs of women .
the women were n't allowed to fight for the ball and the large ball size -lrb- 71 centimeters -rrb- ensured that a good number of women actually got their hands on it .
by comparison , today 's players use balls that are about 15 centimeters smaller .
new rules for men in 1919 , berlin gymnastics teacher carl schelenz completed the rules and introduced a larger playing field to the game .
around that time , men began to take an interest in the sport , and in february 1920 , the first hall and field handball games took place in the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a picture from the past : field handball as played in 1955 in duisburg in contrast to the indoor games , the field games have lost much of their popularity .
" for a long time , germany was a clear favorite in field handball , " said uwe stemberg , games director for germany 's professional handball league .
" but you have to realize that the teams had to play on a field of about 120 or 130 meters .
you could really only see the exciting plays as they got to the goals .
for spectators sitting midfield , the game was n't very exciting .
fortunately , that 's different with the indoor version . "
fritz fischer , an archivist for the german handball association , believes germany 's often rainy and cold climate led to the shift indoors .
" other countries just ignored us back then as field handball players , " he said .
" the nordic countries , especially , saw no reason to play the sport outdoors given their cold weather .
early on , they preferred the indoor version of the game . "
during the past several decades , handball has developed into a recognized and serious competitive sport that is also part of the olympics .
the teams adapted to the new conditions long ago .
whereas the game was something people just did for fun in the old days , handball is played more aggressively on the field today .
indeed , modern handball bears little resemblance to the sport designed for dainty women .
" the moves have also gotten a lot faster and good technique is essential for success , " said stemberg .
" if you take a look at a 10-year-old handball video and watch the game , it sometimes looks like a bunch of old men playing the game . "
a dangerous sport ?
rüdiger schmidt-wiethoff , an orthopedic doctor at the college of sports in cologne , describes handball as a sport whose players are " enormously prone to injury . "
professional handball players are often injured from falls or direct contact with other players .
the sport can also lead to chronic injuries and is more dangerous than other repetitious sports .
" with tennis , for example , chronic injuries are also common , but in contrast to handball , acute injuries are a rarity in tennis , " the sports doctor said .
despite such dangers , handball is a popular sport around the world with many fans , especially in nordic countries like sweden or denmark .
" in iceland , handball is more popular than soccer , " said stemberg of the german professional league .
but such popularity is still a dream for german handball players .
" we ca n't compare our sport with or measure it against soccer .
there 's no way this sport will ever be as popular as soccer .
nevertheless , handball is already the second-most popular ball-oriented sport in the country .

but only 90 years ago , handball was a womens sport . handball is no new invention .
different variations of the game were already known in antiquity .
but today 's definition of handball can be traced back to the womens ' committee of berlin-turnrath , named for the berlin neighborhood where the game was invented by max heiser in 1917 .
beginning on oct .
29 of that year , the game became a harmless alternative to the rough male sport known as soccer .
of course , the new rules were written for the special needs of women .
the women were n't allowed to fight for the ball and the large ball size -lrb- 71 centimeters -rrb- ensured that a good number of women actually got their hands on it .
by comparison , today 's players use balls that are about 15 centimeters smaller .
new rules for men in 1919 , berlin gymnastics teacher carl schelenz completed the rules and introduced a larger playing field to the game .
around that time , men began to take an interest in the sport , and in february 1920 , the first hall and field handball games took place in the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a picture from the past : field handball as played in 1955 in duisburg in contrast to the indoor games , the field games have lost much of their popularity .
" for a long time , germany was a clear favorite in field handball , " said uwe stemberg , games director for germany 's professional handball league .
" but you have to realize that the teams had to play on a field of about 120 or 130 meters .
you could really only see the exciting plays as they got to the goals .
for spectators sitting midfield , the game was n't very exciting .
fortunately , that 's different with the indoor version . "
fritz fischer , an archivist for the german handball association , believes germany 's often rainy and cold climate led to the shift indoors .
" other countries just ignored us back then as field handball players , " he said .
" the nordic countries , especially , saw no reason to play the sport outdoors given their cold weather .
early on , they preferred the indoor version of the game . "
during the past several decades , handball has developed into a recognized and serious competitive sport that is also part of the olympics .
the teams adapted to the new conditions long ago .
whereas the game was something people just did for fun in the old days , handball is played more aggressively on the field today .
indeed , modern handball bears little resemblance to the sport designed for dainty women .
" the moves have also gotten a lot faster and good technique is essential for success , " said stemberg .
" if you take a look at a 10-year-old handball video and watch the game , it sometimes looks like a bunch of old men playing the game . "
a dangerous sport ?
rüdiger schmidt-wiethoff , an orthopedic doctor at the college of sports in cologne , describes handball as a sport whose players are " enormously prone to injury . "
professional handball players are often injured from falls or direct contact with other players .
the sport can also lead to chronic injuries and is more dangerous than other repetitious sports .
" with tennis , for example , chronic injuries are also common , but in contrast to handball , acute injuries are a rarity in tennis , " the sports doctor said .
despite such dangers , handball is a popular sport around the world with many fans , especially in nordic countries like sweden or denmark .
" in iceland , handball is more popular than soccer , " said stemberg of the german professional league .
but such popularity is still a dream for german handball players .
" we ca n't compare our sport with or measure it against soccer .
there 's no way this sport will ever be as popular as soccer .
nevertheless , handball is already the second-most popular ball-oriented sport in the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.09.2004 german handball : a short history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pierced stefan kretzschmar is germany 's dennis rodman at the start of germany 's professional handball season on sunday , more than 30,000 fans gathered in the schalke arena in gelsenkirchen , setting a world record .
but only 90 years ago , handball was a womens sport . handball is no new invention .
different variations of the game were already known in antiquity .
but today 's definition of handball can be traced back to the womens ' committee of berlin-turnrath , named for the berlin neighborhood where the game was invented by max heiser in 1917 .
beginning on oct .
29 of that year , the game became a harmless alternative to the rough male sport known as soccer .
of course , the new rules were written for the special needs of women .
the women were n't allowed to fight for the ball and the large ball size -lrb- 71 centimeters -rrb- ensured that a good number of women actually got their hands on it .
by comparison , today 's players use balls that are about 15 centimeters smaller .
new rules for men in 1919 , berlin gymnastics teacher carl schelenz completed the rules and introduced a larger playing field to the game .
around that time , men began to take an interest in the sport , and in february 1920 , the first hall and field handball games took place in the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a picture from the past : field handball as played in 1955 in duisburg in contrast to the indoor games , the field games have lost much of their popularity .
" for a long time , germany was a clear favorite in field handball , " said uwe stemberg , games director for germany 's professional handball league .
" but you have to realize that the teams had to play on a field of about 120 or 130 meters .
you could really only see the exciting plays as they got to the goals .
for spectators sitting midfield , the game was n't very exciting .
fortunately , that 's different with the indoor version . "
fritz fischer , an archivist for the german handball association , believes germany 's often rainy and cold climate led to the shift indoors .
" other countries just ignored us back then as field handball players , " he said .
" the nordic countries , especially , saw no reason to play the sport outdoors given their cold weather .
early on , they preferred the indoor version of the game . "
during the past several decades , handball has developed into a recognized and serious competitive sport that is also part of the olympics .
the teams adapted to the new conditions long ago .
whereas the game was something people just did for fun in the old days , handball is played more aggressively on the field today .
indeed , modern handball bears little resemblance to the sport designed for dainty women .
" the moves have also gotten a lot faster and good technique is essential for success , " said stemberg .
" if you take a look at a 10-year-old handball video and watch the game , it sometimes looks like a bunch of old men playing the game . "
a dangerous sport ?
rüdiger schmidt-wiethoff , an orthopedic doctor at the college of sports in cologne , describes handball as a sport whose players are " enormously prone to injury . "
professional handball players are often injured from falls or direct contact with other players .
the sport can also lead to chronic injuries and is more dangerous than other repetitious sports .
" with tennis , for example , chronic injuries are also common , but in contrast to handball , acute injuries are a rarity in tennis , " the sports doctor said .
despite such dangers , handball is a popular sport around the world with many fans , especially in nordic countries like sweden or denmark .
" in iceland , handball is more popular than soccer , " said stemberg of the german professional league .
but such popularity is still a dream for german handball players .
" we ca n't compare our sport with or measure it against soccer .
there 's no way this sport will ever be as popular as soccer .
nevertheless , handball is already the second-most popular ball-oriented sport in the country .

you , as a prominent muslim leader , have claimed that islam is a religion of peace .
does that mean that islam has two faces ?
prince karim aga khan iv : no , i do n't think so .
for one thing , you have to think about the fact that this is just represents a very , very small minority of the world 's muslim population .
also , these people are primarily driven by political and not religious motives .
it would be wrong to consider them representative of islam .
the western world has to take a close look to see which forces are in play in order to differentiate between belief and things that have nothing to do with belief .
we as muslims could also ask the same things : like what 's happening in northern ireland .
if i as a muslim came to you and were to say : what 's happening in northern ireland reflects catholic and protestant beliefs , then you would say : you 're uneducated .
in many western countries , including germany , more and more people have the opinion that islam and democracy are irreconcilable .
if that 's true , then a mutual understanding and effective cooperation between muslims and the western world would be practically impossible .
that 's true , but i do n't see a conflict between islam and democracy .
there 's absolutely no conflict if you look at the original form of the muslim community .
tolerance and pluralism are at the top of your agenda for improving conditions for all humans .
is that because your own followers , the minority ismaili muslims , are discriminated against ?
at times , other muslims have even gone so far as to describe you as a heretic .
in every religion there are differences of opinion about the interpretation of the religion .
but i do n't think the ismailis are still discriminated against today .
to the contrary , we 're building bridges to the representatives of other directions of islam .
because the idea of pluralism is tightly anchored in islam .
of course there are many different interpretations .
but the differences in interpretation is not a problem in islam .
i would even go so far as to say that islam is a very broad religion .
there 's a very famous line by allah in the quran : " i have created you from one soul . "
with that line , he meant all of humanity .
since the end of 2001 , the west has been seeking a dialogue with the muslim world .
but more and more people are frustrated because no real answer is coming from the muslim side .
they 're waiting for the voices of moderate muslims who will vocally and clearly speak out against terrorism in the name of islam .
why are n't we hearing these voices ?
i think you can hear these voices more often now .
we have to consider that there are forces inside the islamic world that do not promote freedom of opinion - especially in regards to religion .
is there hope that we can someday stop terrorism ?
firstly , i 'd say this : let 's remedy the causes of terrorism .
generally that 's political frustration and not a question of religion .
the situation in the middle east was not created by islamic beliefs .
the situation in kashmir was not created by islamic belief .
the situation in afghanistan was not created by islamic beliefs .
so we have to identify the core of the problem , and that is political in nature .

three years after the sept .
11 , the terrorism map has spread and the threat has become transparent and harder to ferret out .
nor have we tackled the roots of the problem : poverty and oppression in many muslim countries . if you include iraq and afghanistan in this count , for some time now , not a single day has gone by in which a terrorist attack has been carried out somewhere in the world against innocent victims : passersby , tourists , hotel guests , airline passengers , train passengers , the pious or children on their first day of school . the world map of terrorism has grown and the targets have scattered even further over the continents , but the phenomenon is the same : political demands are executed through violence against innocents who have nothing to do with politics .
governments are extorted , citizens are frightened and terrorized . the myth of al qaeda taking stock of the war against terror three years after sept .
11 and its terror attacks can be an equally sobering and depressing exercise .
under the leadership of the united states , an international alliance has formed that includes western democracies as well as countries that formerly sponsored at least some forms of terrorism .
but a victory over terrorism is still far from sight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osama bin laden : the world 's most elusive cave-dweller in some respects , it could even be farther from sight than it was three years ago .
at least back then we knew the enemy 's address .
at least the most important enemy : osama bin laden and the leaders of his al qaeda terror network mostly lived in taliban-ruled afghanistan - and even if they were n't captured , they were at least real characters .
whereas after the fall of the taliban leadership , the terrorists fled underground , transforming themselves into phantoms .
but such phantoms live longer and appear to be more effective than real and detectable people .
after all , osama bin laden is still considered by wide circles in the islamic world to be a hero because he 's the only person who has stood up against the world 's only superpower and he has dictated the negotiating terms . indeed , al qaeda has already found a replacement for the regimes that once supported it , and it 's an extremely reliable substitute : bin laden 's organization has the support of close to 20,000 alumni who received training in terrorist camps operated by al qaeda in afghanistan .
long ago , these international terror trainees returned to their homelands , where many are operating as sleepers who could be activated at any time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men carry young hostages who managed to escape from the school building after special forces entered the school in beslan , north ossetia , on sept .
3 .
the growing opacity is also making al qaeda more enigmatic : wherever a terror attack is carried out now , the name al qaeda is quickly raised and it is almost always asserted that bin laden has played a role in it .
but that 's almost certainly not always the case .

three years after the sept .
11 , the terrorism map has spread and the threat has become transparent and harder to ferret out .
nor have we tackled the roots of the problem : poverty and oppression in many muslim countries . if you include iraq and afghanistan in this count , for some time now , not a single day has gone by in which a terrorist attack has been carried out somewhere in the world against innocent victims : passersby , tourists , hotel guests , airline passengers , train passengers , the pious or children on their first day of school . the world map of terrorism has grown and the targets have scattered even further over the continents , but the phenomenon is the same : political demands are executed through violence against innocents who have nothing to do with politics .
governments are extorted , citizens are frightened and terrorized . the myth of al qaeda taking stock of the war against terror three years after sept .
11 and its terror attacks can be an equally sobering and depressing exercise .
under the leadership of the united states , an international alliance has formed that includes western democracies as well as countries that formerly sponsored at least some forms of terrorism .
but a victory over terrorism is still far from sight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osama bin laden : the world 's most elusive cave-dweller in some respects , it could even be farther from sight than it was three years ago .
at least back then we knew the enemy 's address .
at least the most important enemy : osama bin laden and the leaders of his al qaeda terror network mostly lived in taliban-ruled afghanistan - and even if they were n't captured , they were at least real characters .
whereas after the fall of the taliban leadership , the terrorists fled underground , transforming themselves into phantoms .
but such phantoms live longer and appear to be more effective than real and detectable people .
after all , osama bin laden is still considered by wide circles in the islamic world to be a hero because he 's the only person who has stood up against the world 's only superpower and he has dictated the negotiating terms . indeed , al qaeda has already found a replacement for the regimes that once supported it , and it 's an extremely reliable substitute : bin laden 's organization has the support of close to 20,000 alumni who received training in terrorist camps operated by al qaeda in afghanistan .
long ago , these international terror trainees returned to their homelands , where many are operating as sleepers who could be activated at any time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men carry young hostages who managed to escape from the school building after special forces entered the school in beslan , north ossetia , on sept .
3 .
the growing opacity is also making al qaeda more enigmatic : wherever a terror attack is carried out now , the name al qaeda is quickly raised and it is almost always asserted that bin laden has played a role in it .
but that 's almost certainly not always the case .
but what is often true is that the attackers follow the example of al qaeda .
and that holds true in indonesia , turkey , morocco and ossetia .
the list of terrorist targets are growing and all too often they include world regions where disaffected and the frustrated allow themselves to become fanatics and consign themselves to violence . in that sense , it would be wrong to consider al qaeda a sort of tightly organized " terrorism incorporated .

the " network of terror , " and even this term may go a bit too far , already relies heavily on the existence of oppression and poverty in the world for its own survival .

"
the expellees ' lobby group , led by rudi pawelka , is currently planning a string of international lawsuits aimed at returning property and assets to ethnic germans who were forced to flee poland in the millions after world war ii .
" mr. pawelka and his consorts started this debate , he 's unleashed dramatic fear among poles , " byrt told a german newspaper over the weekend .
despite the parliament 's decision , byrt said he did not believe the polish government would actually make any official reparations demands of germany .
" the polish government considers the question of reparations to be finished , " said byrt .
old fears arise anew the polish parliament unanimously called on the government to estimate the total damages germany caused poland in world war ii and to begin talks with berlin .
the text of the resolution stated : " parliament declares that poland has not yet received war reparations payments and damages the for the enormous extent of destruction and material and non-material costs brought on by german aggression , occupation and genocide . "
additionally , the parliament rejected all claims for compensation or restoration of property from german expellees .
in recent weeks , lobby groups for the expellees , like the prussian claims society , have issued demands that have sparked tremendous resentment in poland .
many of the country 's citizens see the lawsuit threats as an effort to put german expellees on the same footing as the polish victims of german war crimes .
the issue is emotionally charged in poland , where old fears , painful historical experiences and the late consequences of a propaganda program that stoked fear of germans in the population for decades .
it 's a bitter realization for anyone who has worked on behalf of the decades-long reconciliation process that has resulted recently in the closest cooperative relationship ever seen between germany and poland .
and the consequences of any lawsuits could be enormous .
in addition to the financial effects , poles fear germans would return to the eastern european countries they once occupied - an uncomfortable notion for historically aware poles , who have a clear idea of who was the culprit and who was the victim in world war ii .
slowing progress the legal position is clear .
a treaty between germany and poland officially recognizes the oder and neisse rivers as poland 's western-most border .
germany is poland 's most important trading partner , and both countries are members of nato and the european union , and germany was also championed poland 's political needs when it negotiated its eu membership .
additionally , poland dropped all of its demands for reparations payments from the germans during the 1950s .
in berlin , politicians have been astounded by the polish parliament 's demand , and the polish government has called for a diplomatic solution between berlin and warsaw .
in a newspaper interview , the german social democrats foreign affairs spokesman , markus meckel , said he was greatly disappointed by the vote .
and the press department at the chancellery in berlin repeated previous statements from chancellor gerhard schröder that both countries consider the question of reparations settled .
debate in parliament the resolution agreed to by the polish parliament is a political resolution and it has no legally binding effect for prime minister marek belka or his government .
" were trying to create a dialogue with the governments of poland to find a solution that finalizes all concerns about damages , also in the legal sense , " belka said .
ironically , the text approved on friday was milder than earlier drafts .

" mr. pawelka and his consorts started this debate , he 's unleashed dramatic fear among poles , " byrt told a german newspaper over the weekend .
despite the parliament 's decision , byrt said he did not believe the polish government would actually make any official reparations demands of germany .
" the polish government considers the question of reparations to be finished , " said byrt .
old fears arise anew the polish parliament unanimously called on the government to estimate the total damages germany caused poland in world war ii and to begin talks with berlin .
the text of the resolution stated : " parliament declares that poland has not yet received war reparations payments and damages the for the enormous extent of destruction and material and non-material costs brought on by german aggression , occupation and genocide . "
additionally , the parliament rejected all claims for compensation or restoration of property from german expellees .
in recent weeks , lobby groups for the expellees , like the prussian claims society , have issued demands that have sparked tremendous resentment in poland .
many of the country 's citizens see the lawsuit threats as an effort to put german expellees on the same footing as the polish victims of german war crimes .
the issue is emotionally charged in poland , where old fears , painful historical experiences and the late consequences of a propaganda program that stoked fear of germans in the population for decades .
it 's a bitter realization for anyone who has worked on behalf of the decades-long reconciliation process that has resulted recently in the closest cooperative relationship ever seen between germany and poland .
and the consequences of any lawsuits could be enormous .
in addition to the financial effects , poles fear germans would return to the eastern european countries they once occupied - an uncomfortable notion for historically aware poles , who have a clear idea of who was the culprit and who was the victim in world war ii .
slowing progress the legal position is clear .
a treaty between germany and poland officially recognizes the oder and neisse rivers as poland 's western-most border .
germany is poland 's most important trading partner , and both countries are members of nato and the european union , and germany was also championed poland 's political needs when it negotiated its eu membership .
additionally , poland dropped all of its demands for reparations payments from the germans during the 1950s .
in berlin , politicians have been astounded by the polish parliament 's demand , and the polish government has called for a diplomatic solution between berlin and warsaw .
in a newspaper interview , the german social democrats foreign affairs spokesman , markus meckel , said he was greatly disappointed by the vote .
and the press department at the chancellery in berlin repeated previous statements from chancellor gerhard schröder that both countries consider the question of reparations settled .
debate in parliament the resolution agreed to by the polish parliament is a political resolution and it has no legally binding effect for prime minister marek belka or his government .
" were trying to create a dialogue with the governments of poland to find a solution that finalizes all concerns about damages , also in the legal sense , " belka said .
ironically , the text approved on friday was milder than earlier drafts .
conservative and nationalist parties originally penned a tougher resolution , but the country 's leftist parties said they would not accept any explicit demand for reparations .
the final outcome was a vaguely formulated demand that the government " take appropriate measures to address the concerns .

"
the expellees ' lobby group , led by rudi pawelka , is currently planning a string of international lawsuits aimed at returning property and assets to ethnic germans who were forced to flee poland in the millions after world war ii .
" mr. pawelka and his consorts started this debate , he 's unleashed dramatic fear among poles , " byrt told a german newspaper over the weekend .
despite the parliament 's decision , byrt said he did not believe the polish government would actually make any official reparations demands of germany .
" the polish government considers the question of reparations to be finished , " said byrt .
old fears arise anew the polish parliament unanimously called on the government to estimate the total damages germany caused poland in world war ii and to begin talks with berlin .
the text of the resolution stated : " parliament declares that poland has not yet received war reparations payments and damages the for the enormous extent of destruction and material and non-material costs brought on by german aggression , occupation and genocide . "
additionally , the parliament rejected all claims for compensation or restoration of property from german expellees .
in recent weeks , lobby groups for the expellees , like the prussian claims society , have issued demands that have sparked tremendous resentment in poland .
many of the country 's citizens see the lawsuit threats as an effort to put german expellees on the same footing as the polish victims of german war crimes .
the issue is emotionally charged in poland , where old fears , painful historical experiences and the late consequences of a propaganda program that stoked fear of germans in the population for decades .
it 's a bitter realization for anyone who has worked on behalf of the decades-long reconciliation process that has resulted recently in the closest cooperative relationship ever seen between germany and poland .
and the consequences of any lawsuits could be enormous .
in addition to the financial effects , poles fear germans would return to the eastern european countries they once occupied - an uncomfortable notion for historically aware poles , who have a clear idea of who was the culprit and who was the victim in world war ii .
slowing progress the legal position is clear .
a treaty between germany and poland officially recognizes the oder and neisse rivers as poland 's western-most border .
germany is poland 's most important trading partner , and both countries are members of nato and the european union , and germany was also championed poland 's political needs when it negotiated its eu membership .
additionally , poland dropped all of its demands for reparations payments from the germans during the 1950s .
in berlin , politicians have been astounded by the polish parliament 's demand , and the polish government has called for a diplomatic solution between berlin and warsaw .
in a newspaper interview , the german social democrats foreign affairs spokesman , markus meckel , said he was greatly disappointed by the vote .

three years after the sept .
11 , the terrorism map has spread and the threat has become transparent and harder to ferret out .
nor have we tackled the roots of the problem : poverty and oppression in many muslim countries . if you include iraq and afghanistan in this count , for some time now , not a single day has gone by in which a terrorist attack has been carried out somewhere in the world against innocent victims : passersby , tourists , hotel guests , airline passengers , train passengers , the pious or children on their first day of school . the world map of terrorism has grown and the targets have scattered even further over the continents , but the phenomenon is the same : political demands are executed through violence against innocents who have nothing to do with politics .
governments are extorted , citizens are frightened and terrorized . the myth of al qaeda taking stock of the war against terror three years after sept .
11 and its terror attacks can be an equally sobering and depressing exercise .
under the leadership of the united states , an international alliance has formed that includes western democracies as well as countries that formerly sponsored at least some forms of terrorism .
but a victory over terrorism is still far from sight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osama bin laden : the world 's most elusive cave-dweller in some respects , it could even be farther from sight than it was three years ago .
at least back then we knew the enemy 's address .
at least the most important enemy : osama bin laden and the leaders of his al qaeda terror network mostly lived in taliban-ruled afghanistan - and even if they were n't captured , they were at least real characters .
whereas after the fall of the taliban leadership , the terrorists fled underground , transforming themselves into phantoms .
but such phantoms live longer and appear to be more effective than real and detectable people .
after all , osama bin laden is still considered by wide circles in the islamic world to be a hero because he 's the only person who has stood up against the world 's only superpower and he has dictated the negotiating terms . indeed , al qaeda has already found a replacement for the regimes that once supported it , and it 's an extremely reliable substitute : bin laden 's organization has the support of close to 20,000 alumni who received training in terrorist camps operated by al qaeda in afghanistan .
long ago , these international terror trainees returned to their homelands , where many are operating as sleepers who could be activated at any time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men carry young hostages who managed to escape from the school building after special forces entered the school in beslan , north ossetia , on sept .
3 .
the growing opacity is also making al qaeda more enigmatic : wherever a terror attack is carried out now , the name al qaeda is quickly raised and it is almost always asserted that bin laden has played a role in it .
but that 's almost certainly not always the case .
but what is often true is that the attackers follow the example of al qaeda .
and that holds true in indonesia , turkey , morocco and ossetia .
the list of terrorist targets are growing and all too often they include world regions where disaffected and the frustrated allow themselves to become fanatics and consign themselves to violence . in that sense , it would be wrong to consider al qaeda a sort of tightly organized " terrorism incorporated . "
the " network of terror , " and even this term may go a bit too far , already relies heavily on the existence of oppression and poverty in the world for its own survival .
those seeking to counteract the effects of poverty and oppression often use terms like “ freedom , ” “ democracy ” and “ human rights . ”
but people in the islamic world often accuse the west of double morals because of their strong feeling that muslim countries are economically and politically disadvantaged in comparison to the west .
many interpret this as a kind of religious discrimination against muslims . fighting the roots of terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a guard with an automatic rifle protects the capitol building in washington , d.c. at the same time , the west – especially the usa – does too little to address these disillusioned people .
instead it is moving mostly to protect itself through greater vigilance and an increasing number of civil rights violations .
by doing so , the west is failing to recognize that those moves may also be strengthening terrorists ’ arguments against the west .
additionally , further violence is not going to eradicate terrorism . the conclusion in the end is that terrorism must be fought at its roots – and not just the symptoms .
nor can there just be one method of treatment – otherwise every attempt will be futile .
and there have been many efforts .
of course , a good number of participants in the coalition against terror or not democratic countries .
but they have at least disavowed themselves of their previous support for terrorist groups .
that ’ s a first success .
but now we must work on getting these states , like pakistan and libya , to make the complete transition to freedom and democracy .
only then can we increase the chances the terrorism will be diminished over the long-term . peter philipp -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : mixing up words and deeds in post-9/11 politics to understand why the world has become a more dangerous place since 9/11 , the u.s. should look inward , commentator miodrag soric says .

"
the expellees ' lobby group , led by rudi pawelka , is currently planning a string of international lawsuits aimed at returning property and assets to ethnic germans who were forced to flee poland in the millions after world war ii .
" mr. pawelka and his consorts started this debate , he 's unleashed dramatic fear among poles , " byrt told a german newspaper over the weekend .
despite the parliament 's decision , byrt said he did not believe the polish government would actually make any official reparations demands of germany .
" the polish government considers the question of reparations to be finished , " said byrt .
old fears arise anew the polish parliament unanimously called on the government to estimate the total damages germany caused poland in world war ii and to begin talks with berlin .
the text of the resolution stated : " parliament declares that poland has not yet received war reparations payments and damages the for the enormous extent of destruction and material and non-material costs brought on by german aggression , occupation and genocide . "
additionally , the parliament rejected all claims for compensation or restoration of property from german expellees .
in recent weeks , lobby groups for the expellees , like the prussian claims society , have issued demands that have sparked tremendous resentment in poland .
many of the country 's citizens see the lawsuit threats as an effort to put german expellees on the same footing as the polish victims of german war crimes .
the issue is emotionally charged in poland , where old fears , painful historical experiences and the late consequences of a propaganda program that stoked fear of germans in the population for decades .
it 's a bitter realization for anyone who has worked on behalf of the decades-long reconciliation process that has resulted recently in the closest cooperative relationship ever seen between germany and poland .
and the consequences of any lawsuits could be enormous .
in addition to the financial effects , poles fear germans would return to the eastern european countries they once occupied - an uncomfortable notion for historically aware poles , who have a clear idea of who was the culprit and who was the victim in world war ii .

additionally , poland dropped all of its demands for reparations payments from the germans during the 1950s .

" the polish government considers the question of reparations to be finished , " said byrt .
old fears arise anew the polish parliament unanimously called on the government to estimate the total damages germany caused poland in world war ii and to begin talks with berlin .
the text of the resolution stated : " parliament declares that poland has not yet received war reparations payments and damages the for the enormous extent of destruction and material and non-material costs brought on by german aggression , occupation and genocide . "
additionally , the parliament rejected all claims for compensation or restoration of property from german expellees .
in recent weeks , lobby groups for the expellees , like the prussian claims society , have issued demands that have sparked tremendous resentment in poland .
many of the country 's citizens see the lawsuit threats as an effort to put german expellees on the same footing as the polish victims of german war crimes .
the issue is emotionally charged in poland , where old fears , painful historical experiences and the late consequences of a propaganda program that stoked fear of germans in the population for decades .

but such phantoms live longer and appear to be more effective than real and detectable people .
after all , osama bin laden is still considered by wide circles in the islamic world to be a hero because he 's the only person who has stood up against the world 's only superpower and he has dictated the negotiating terms . indeed , al qaeda has already found a replacement for the regimes that once supported it , and it 's an extremely reliable substitute : bin laden 's organization has the support of close to 20,000 alumni who received training in terrorist camps operated by al qaeda in afghanistan .

three years after the sept .
11 , the terrorism map has spread and the threat has become transparent and harder to ferret out .
nor have we tackled the roots of the problem : poverty and oppression in many muslim countries . if you include iraq and afghanistan in this count , for some time now , not a single day has gone by in which a terrorist attack has been carried out somewhere in the world against innocent victims : passersby , tourists , hotel guests , airline passengers , train passengers , the pious or children on their first day of school . the world map of terrorism has grown and the targets have scattered even further over the continents , but the phenomenon is the same : political demands are executed through violence against innocents who have nothing to do with politics .
governments are extorted , citizens are frightened and terrorized . the myth of al qaeda taking stock of the war against terror three years after sept .
11 and its terror attacks can be an equally sobering and depressing exercise .
under the leadership of the united states , an international alliance has formed that includes western democracies as well as countries that formerly sponsored at least some forms of terrorism .
but a victory over terrorism is still far from sight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osama bin laden : the world 's most elusive cave-dweller in some respects , it could even be farther from sight than it was three years ago .
at least back then we knew the enemy 's address .
at least the most important enemy : osama bin laden and the leaders of his al qaeda terror network mostly lived in taliban-ruled afghanistan - and even if they were n't captured , they were at least real characters .
whereas after the fall of the taliban leadership , the terrorists fled underground , transforming themselves into phantoms .
but such phantoms live longer and appear to be more effective than real and detectable people .
after all , osama bin laden is still considered by wide circles in the islamic world to be a hero because he 's the only person who has stood up against the world 's only superpower and he has dictated the negotiating terms . indeed , al qaeda has already found a replacement for the regimes that once supported it , and it 's an extremely reliable substitute : bin laden 's organization has the support of close to 20,000 alumni who received training in terrorist camps operated by al qaeda in afghanistan .
long ago , these international terror trainees returned to their homelands , where many are operating as sleepers who could be activated at any time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men carry young hostages who managed to escape from the school building after special forces entered the school in beslan , north ossetia , on sept .
3 .
the growing opacity is also making al qaeda more enigmatic : wherever a terror attack is carried out now , the name al qaeda is quickly raised and it is almost always asserted that bin laden has played a role in it .
but that 's almost certainly not always the case .
but what is often true is that the attackers follow the example of al qaeda .
and that holds true in indonesia , turkey , morocco and ossetia .
the list of terrorist targets are growing and all too often they include world regions where disaffected and the frustrated allow themselves to become fanatics and consign themselves to violence . in that sense , it would be wrong to consider al qaeda a sort of tightly organized " terrorism incorporated . "
the " network of terror , " and even this term may go a bit too far , already relies heavily on the existence of oppression and poverty in the world for its own survival .
those seeking to counteract the effects of poverty and oppression often use terms like “ freedom , ” “ democracy ” and “ human rights . ”
but people in the islamic world often accuse the west of double morals because of their strong feeling that muslim countries are economically and politically disadvantaged in comparison to the west .
many interpret this as a kind of religious discrimination against muslims . fighting the roots of terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a guard with an automatic rifle protects the capitol building in washington , d.c. at the same time , the west – especially the usa – does too little to address these disillusioned people .
instead it is moving mostly to protect itself through greater vigilance and an increasing number of civil rights violations .
by doing so , the west is failing to recognize that those moves may also be strengthening terrorists ’ arguments against the west .
additionally , further violence is not going to eradicate terrorism . the conclusion in the end is that terrorism must be fought at its roots – and not just the symptoms .
nor can there just be one method of treatment – otherwise every attempt will be futile .
and there have been many efforts .
of course , a good number of participants in the coalition against terror or not democratic countries .
but they have at least disavowed themselves of their previous support for terrorist groups .
that ’ s a first success .
but now we must work on getting these states , like pakistan and libya , to make the complete transition to freedom and democracy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.09.2004 berlin shocked by polish reparations vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national borders do n't always match those of claims the decision of the polish parliament on friday to demand reparations from germany for world war ii draws dismay from german lawmakers . poland 's ambassador to germany , andrzej byrt , said the decision was " a reaction to the actions of the prussian claims society . "
the expellees ' lobby group , led by rudi pawelka , is currently planning a string of international lawsuits aimed at returning property and assets to ethnic germans who were forced to flee poland in the millions after world war ii .
" mr. pawelka and his consorts started this debate , he 's unleashed dramatic fear among poles , " byrt told a german newspaper over the weekend .
despite the parliament 's decision , byrt said he did not believe the polish government would actually make any official reparations demands of germany .
" the polish government considers the question of reparations to be finished , " said byrt .
old fears arise anew the polish parliament unanimously called on the government to estimate the total damages germany caused poland in world war ii and to begin talks with berlin .
the text of the resolution stated : " parliament declares that poland has not yet received war reparations payments and damages the for the enormous extent of destruction and material and non-material costs brought on by german aggression , occupation and genocide . "
additionally , the parliament rejected all claims for compensation or restoration of property from german expellees .
in recent weeks , lobby groups for the expellees , like the prussian claims society , have issued demands that have sparked tremendous resentment in poland .
many of the country 's citizens see the lawsuit threats as an effort to put german expellees on the same footing as the polish victims of german war crimes .
the issue is emotionally charged in poland , where old fears , painful historical experiences and the late consequences of a propaganda program that stoked fear of germans in the population for decades .
it 's a bitter realization for anyone who has worked on behalf of the decades-long reconciliation process that has resulted recently in the closest cooperative relationship ever seen between germany and poland .
and the consequences of any lawsuits could be enormous .
in addition to the financial effects , poles fear germans would return to the eastern european countries they once occupied - an uncomfortable notion for historically aware poles , who have a clear idea of who was the culprit and who was the victim in world war ii .
slowing progress the legal position is clear .
a treaty between germany and poland officially recognizes the oder and neisse rivers as poland 's western-most border .
germany is poland 's most important trading partner , and both countries are members of nato and the european union , and germany was also championed poland 's political needs when it negotiated its eu membership .
additionally , poland dropped all of its demands for reparations payments from the germans during the 1950s .
in berlin , politicians have been astounded by the polish parliament 's demand , and the polish government has called for a diplomatic solution between berlin and warsaw .
in a newspaper interview , the german social democrats foreign affairs spokesman , markus meckel , said he was greatly disappointed by the vote .
and the press department at the chancellery in berlin repeated previous statements from chancellor gerhard schröder that both countries consider the question of reparations settled .
debate in parliament the resolution agreed to by the polish parliament is a political resolution and it has no legally binding effect for prime minister marek belka or his government .
" were trying to create a dialogue with the governments of poland to find a solution that finalizes all concerns about damages , also in the legal sense , " belka said .
ironically , the text approved on friday was milder than earlier drafts .
conservative and nationalist parties originally penned a tougher resolution , but the country 's leftist parties said they would not accept any explicit demand for reparations .
the final outcome was a vaguely formulated demand that the government " take appropriate measures to address the concerns .

but a victory over terrorism is still far from sight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osama bin laden : the world 's most elusive cave-dweller in some respects , it could even be farther from sight than it was three years ago .
at least back then we knew the enemy 's address .
at least the most important enemy : osama bin laden and the leaders of his al qaeda terror network mostly lived in taliban-ruled afghanistan - and even if they were n't captured , they were at least real characters .
whereas after the fall of the taliban leadership , the terrorists fled underground , transforming themselves into phantoms .
but such phantoms live longer and appear to be more effective than real and detectable people .
after all , osama bin laden is still considered by wide circles in the islamic world to be a hero because he 's the only person who has stood up against the world 's only superpower and he has dictated the negotiating terms . indeed , al qaeda has already found a replacement for the regimes that once supported it , and it 's an extremely reliable substitute : bin laden 's organization has the support of close to 20,000 alumni who received training in terrorist camps operated by al qaeda in afghanistan .
long ago , these international terror trainees returned to their homelands , where many are operating as sleepers who could be activated at any time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men carry young hostages who managed to escape from the school building after special forces entered the school in beslan , north ossetia , on sept .
3 .
the growing opacity is also making al qaeda more enigmatic : wherever a terror attack is carried out now , the name al qaeda is quickly raised and it is almost always asserted that bin laden has played a role in it .
but that 's almost certainly not always the case .
but what is often true is that the attackers follow the example of al qaeda .
and that holds true in indonesia , turkey , morocco and ossetia .
the list of terrorist targets are growing and all too often they include world regions where disaffected and the frustrated allow themselves to become fanatics and consign themselves to violence . in that sense , it would be wrong to consider al qaeda a sort of tightly organized " terrorism incorporated . "
the " network of terror , " and even this term may go a bit too far , already relies heavily on the existence of oppression and poverty in the world for its own survival .
those seeking to counteract the effects of poverty and oppression often use terms like “ freedom , ” “ democracy ” and “ human rights . ”
but people in the islamic world often accuse the west of double morals because of their strong feeling that muslim countries are economically and politically disadvantaged in comparison to the west .
many interpret this as a kind of religious discrimination against muslims . fighting the roots of terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a guard with an automatic rifle protects the capitol building in washington , d.c. at the same time , the west – especially the usa – does too little to address these disillusioned people .
instead it is moving mostly to protect itself through greater vigilance and an increasing number of civil rights violations .
by doing so , the west is failing to recognize that those moves may also be strengthening terrorists ’ arguments against the west .
additionally , further violence is not going to eradicate terrorism . the conclusion in the end is that terrorism must be fought at its roots – and not just the symptoms .
nor can there just be one method of treatment – otherwise every attempt will be futile .
and there have been many efforts .
of course , a good number of participants in the coalition against terror or not democratic countries .
but they have at least disavowed themselves of their previous support for terrorist groups .
that ’ s a first success .
but now we must work on getting these states , like pakistan and libya , to make the complete transition to freedom and democracy .
only then can we increase the chances the terrorism will be diminished over the long-term . peter philipp -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : mixing up words and deeds in post-9/11 politics to understand why the world has become a more dangerous place since 9/11 , the u.s. should look inward , commentator miodrag soric says .

"
the expellees ' lobby group , led by rudi pawelka , is currently planning a string of international lawsuits aimed at returning property and assets to ethnic germans who were forced to flee poland in the millions after world war ii .
" mr. pawelka and his consorts started this debate , he 's unleashed dramatic fear among poles , " byrt told a german newspaper over the weekend .
despite the parliament 's decision , byrt said he did not believe the polish government would actually make any official reparations demands of germany .
" the polish government considers the question of reparations to be finished , " said byrt .
old fears arise anew the polish parliament unanimously called on the government to estimate the total damages germany caused poland in world war ii and to begin talks with berlin .
the text of the resolution stated : " parliament declares that poland has not yet received war reparations payments and damages the for the enormous extent of destruction and material and non-material costs brought on by german aggression , occupation and genocide . "
additionally , the parliament rejected all claims for compensation or restoration of property from german expellees .
in recent weeks , lobby groups for the expellees , like the prussian claims society , have issued demands that have sparked tremendous resentment in poland .
many of the country 's citizens see the lawsuit threats as an effort to put german expellees on the same footing as the polish victims of german war crimes .
the issue is emotionally charged in poland , where old fears , painful historical experiences and the late consequences of a propaganda program that stoked fear of germans in the population for decades .
it 's a bitter realization for anyone who has worked on behalf of the decades-long reconciliation process that has resulted recently in the closest cooperative relationship ever seen between germany and poland .
and the consequences of any lawsuits could be enormous .

the expellees ' lobby group , led by rudi pawelka , is currently planning a string of international lawsuits aimed at returning property and assets to ethnic germans who were forced to flee poland in the millions after world war ii .
" mr. pawelka and his consorts started this debate , he 's unleashed dramatic fear among poles , " byrt told a german newspaper over the weekend .
despite the parliament 's decision , byrt said he did not believe the polish government would actually make any official reparations demands of germany .
" the polish government considers the question of reparations to be finished , " said byrt .
old fears arise anew the polish parliament unanimously called on the government to estimate the total damages germany caused poland in world war ii and to begin talks with berlin .
the text of the resolution stated : " parliament declares that poland has not yet received war reparations payments and damages the for the enormous extent of destruction and material and non-material costs brought on by german aggression , occupation and genocide . "
additionally , the parliament rejected all claims for compensation or restoration of property from german expellees .
in recent weeks , lobby groups for the expellees , like the prussian claims society , have issued demands that have sparked tremendous resentment in poland .
many of the country 's citizens see the lawsuit threats as an effort to put german expellees on the same footing as the polish victims of german war crimes .
the issue is emotionally charged in poland , where old fears , painful historical experiences and the late consequences of a propaganda program that stoked fear of germans in the population for decades .
it 's a bitter realization for anyone who has worked on behalf of the decades-long reconciliation process that has resulted recently in the closest cooperative relationship ever seen between germany and poland .
and the consequences of any lawsuits could be enormous .
in addition to the financial effects , poles fear germans would return to the eastern european countries they once occupied - an uncomfortable notion for historically aware poles , who have a clear idea of who was the culprit and who was the victim in world war ii .

a treaty between germany and poland officially recognizes the oder and neisse rivers as poland 's western-most border .
germany is poland 's most important trading partner , and both countries are members of nato and the european union , and germany was also championed poland 's political needs when it negotiated its eu membership .
additionally , poland dropped all of its demands for reparations payments from the germans during the 1950s .
in berlin , politicians have been astounded by the polish parliament 's demand , and the polish government has called for a diplomatic solution between berlin and warsaw .
in a newspaper interview , the german social democrats foreign affairs spokesman , markus meckel , said he was greatly disappointed by the vote .
and the press department at the chancellery in berlin repeated previous statements from chancellor gerhard schröder that both countries consider the question of reparations settled .

three years after the sept .
11 , the terrorism map has spread and the threat has become transparent and harder to ferret out .
nor have we tackled the roots of the problem : poverty and oppression in many muslim countries . if you include iraq and afghanistan in this count , for some time now , not a single day has gone by in which a terrorist attack has been carried out somewhere in the world against innocent victims : passersby , tourists , hotel guests , airline passengers , train passengers , the pious or children on their first day of school . the world map of terrorism has grown and the targets have scattered even further over the continents , but the phenomenon is the same : political demands are executed through violence against innocents who have nothing to do with politics .
governments are extorted , citizens are frightened and terrorized . the myth of al qaeda taking stock of the war against terror three years after sept .
11 and its terror attacks can be an equally sobering and depressing exercise .
under the leadership of the united states , an international alliance has formed that includes western democracies as well as countries that formerly sponsored at least some forms of terrorism .
but a victory over terrorism is still far from sight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osama bin laden : the world 's most elusive cave-dweller in some respects , it could even be farther from sight than it was three years ago .
at least back then we knew the enemy 's address .
at least the most important enemy : osama bin laden and the leaders of his al qaeda terror network mostly lived in taliban-ruled afghanistan - and even if they were n't captured , they were at least real characters .
whereas after the fall of the taliban leadership , the terrorists fled underground , transforming themselves into phantoms .
but such phantoms live longer and appear to be more effective than real and detectable people .
after all , osama bin laden is still considered by wide circles in the islamic world to be a hero because he 's the only person who has stood up against the world 's only superpower and he has dictated the negotiating terms . indeed , al qaeda has already found a replacement for the regimes that once supported it , and it 's an extremely reliable substitute : bin laden 's organization has the support of close to 20,000 alumni who received training in terrorist camps operated by al qaeda in afghanistan .
long ago , these international terror trainees returned to their homelands , where many are operating as sleepers who could be activated at any time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men carry young hostages who managed to escape from the school building after special forces entered the school in beslan , north ossetia , on sept .
3 .
the growing opacity is also making al qaeda more enigmatic : wherever a terror attack is carried out now , the name al qaeda is quickly raised and it is almost always asserted that bin laden has played a role in it .
but that 's almost certainly not always the case .
but what is often true is that the attackers follow the example of al qaeda .
and that holds true in indonesia , turkey , morocco and ossetia .
the list of terrorist targets are growing and all too often they include world regions where disaffected and the frustrated allow themselves to become fanatics and consign themselves to violence . in that sense , it would be wrong to consider al qaeda a sort of tightly organized " terrorism incorporated . "
the " network of terror , " and even this term may go a bit too far , already relies heavily on the existence of oppression and poverty in the world for its own survival .
those seeking to counteract the effects of poverty and oppression often use terms like “ freedom , ” “ democracy ” and “ human rights . ”
but people in the islamic world often accuse the west of double morals because of their strong feeling that muslim countries are economically and politically disadvantaged in comparison to the west .
many interpret this as a kind of religious discrimination against muslims . fighting the roots of terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a guard with an automatic rifle protects the capitol building in washington , d.c. at the same time , the west – especially the usa – does too little to address these disillusioned people .
instead it is moving mostly to protect itself through greater vigilance and an increasing number of civil rights violations .
by doing so , the west is failing to recognize that those moves may also be strengthening terrorists ’ arguments against the west .
additionally , further violence is not going to eradicate terrorism . the conclusion in the end is that terrorism must be fought at its roots – and not just the symptoms .
nor can there just be one method of treatment – otherwise every attempt will be futile .
and there have been many efforts .
of course , a good number of participants in the coalition against terror or not democratic countries .
but they have at least disavowed themselves of their previous support for terrorist groups .
that ’ s a first success .
but now we must work on getting these states , like pakistan and libya , to make the complete transition to freedom and democracy .
only then can we increase the chances the terrorism will be diminished over the long-term . peter philipp -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : mixing up words and deeds in post-9/11 politics to understand why the world has become a more dangerous place since 9/11 , the u.s. should look inward , commentator miodrag soric says .

but such phantoms live longer and appear to be more effective than real and detectable people .
after all , osama bin laden is still considered by wide circles in the islamic world to be a hero because he 's the only person who has stood up against the world 's only superpower and he has dictated the negotiating terms . indeed , al qaeda has already found a replacement for the regimes that once supported it , and it 's an extremely reliable substitute : bin laden 's organization has the support of close to 20,000 alumni who received training in terrorist camps operated by al qaeda in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.09.2004 berlin shocked by polish reparations vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national borders do n't always match those of claims the decision of the polish parliament on friday to demand reparations from germany for world war ii draws dismay from german lawmakers . poland 's ambassador to germany , andrzej byrt , said the decision was " a reaction to the actions of the prussian claims society . "
the expellees ' lobby group , led by rudi pawelka , is currently planning a string of international lawsuits aimed at returning property and assets to ethnic germans who were forced to flee poland in the millions after world war ii .
" mr. pawelka and his consorts started this debate , he 's unleashed dramatic fear among poles , " byrt told a german newspaper over the weekend .
despite the parliament 's decision , byrt said he did not believe the polish government would actually make any official reparations demands of germany .
" the polish government considers the question of reparations to be finished , " said byrt .
old fears arise anew the polish parliament unanimously called on the government to estimate the total damages germany caused poland in world war ii and to begin talks with berlin .
the text of the resolution stated : " parliament declares that poland has not yet received war reparations payments and damages the for the enormous extent of destruction and material and non-material costs brought on by german aggression , occupation and genocide . "
additionally , the parliament rejected all claims for compensation or restoration of property from german expellees .
in recent weeks , lobby groups for the expellees , like the prussian claims society , have issued demands that have sparked tremendous resentment in poland .
many of the country 's citizens see the lawsuit threats as an effort to put german expellees on the same footing as the polish victims of german war crimes .
the issue is emotionally charged in poland , where old fears , painful historical experiences and the late consequences of a propaganda program that stoked fear of germans in the population for decades .
it 's a bitter realization for anyone who has worked on behalf of the decades-long reconciliation process that has resulted recently in the closest cooperative relationship ever seen between germany and poland .
and the consequences of any lawsuits could be enormous .
in addition to the financial effects , poles fear germans would return to the eastern european countries they once occupied - an uncomfortable notion for historically aware poles , who have a clear idea of who was the culprit and who was the victim in world war ii .
slowing progress the legal position is clear .
a treaty between germany and poland officially recognizes the oder and neisse rivers as poland 's western-most border .
germany is poland 's most important trading partner , and both countries are members of nato and the european union , and germany was also championed poland 's political needs when it negotiated its eu membership .
additionally , poland dropped all of its demands for reparations payments from the germans during the 1950s .
in berlin , politicians have been astounded by the polish parliament 's demand , and the polish government has called for a diplomatic solution between berlin and warsaw .
in a newspaper interview , the german social democrats foreign affairs spokesman , markus meckel , said he was greatly disappointed by the vote .
and the press department at the chancellery in berlin repeated previous statements from chancellor gerhard schröder that both countries consider the question of reparations settled .
debate in parliament the resolution agreed to by the polish parliament is a political resolution and it has no legally binding effect for prime minister marek belka or his government .
" were trying to create a dialogue with the governments of poland to find a solution that finalizes all concerns about damages , also in the legal sense , " belka said .
ironically , the text approved on friday was milder than earlier drafts .
conservative and nationalist parties originally penned a tougher resolution , but the country 's leftist parties said they would not accept any explicit demand for reparations .
the final outcome was a vaguely formulated demand that the government " take appropriate measures to address the concerns .

despite the parliament 's decision , byrt said he did not believe the polish government would actually make any official reparations demands of germany .
" the polish government considers the question of reparations to be finished , " said byrt .
old fears arise anew the polish parliament unanimously called on the government to estimate the total damages germany caused poland in world war ii and to begin talks with berlin .
the text of the resolution stated : " parliament declares that poland has not yet received war reparations payments and damages the for the enormous extent of destruction and material and non-material costs brought on by german aggression , occupation and genocide . "
additionally , the parliament rejected all claims for compensation or restoration of property from german expellees .
in recent weeks , lobby groups for the expellees , like the prussian claims society , have issued demands that have sparked tremendous resentment in poland .
many of the country 's citizens see the lawsuit threats as an effort to put german expellees on the same footing as the polish victims of german war crimes .
the issue is emotionally charged in poland , where old fears , painful historical experiences and the late consequences of a propaganda program that stoked fear of germans in the population for decades .
it 's a bitter realization for anyone who has worked on behalf of the decades-long reconciliation process that has resulted recently in the closest cooperative relationship ever seen between germany and poland .
and the consequences of any lawsuits could be enormous .
in addition to the financial effects , poles fear germans would return to the eastern european countries they once occupied - an uncomfortable notion for historically aware poles , who have a clear idea of who was the culprit and who was the victim in world war ii .
slowing progress the legal position is clear .
a treaty between germany and poland officially recognizes the oder and neisse rivers as poland 's western-most border .
germany is poland 's most important trading partner , and both countries are members of nato and the european union , and germany was also championed poland 's political needs when it negotiated its eu membership .
additionally , poland dropped all of its demands for reparations payments from the germans during the 1950s .
in berlin , politicians have been astounded by the polish parliament 's demand , and the polish government has called for a diplomatic solution between berlin and warsaw .
in a newspaper interview , the german social democrats foreign affairs spokesman , markus meckel , said he was greatly disappointed by the vote .
and the press department at the chancellery in berlin repeated previous statements from chancellor gerhard schröder that both countries consider the question of reparations settled .
debate in parliament the resolution agreed to by the polish parliament is a political resolution and it has no legally binding effect for prime minister marek belka or his government .
" were trying to create a dialogue with the governments of poland to find a solution that finalizes all concerns about damages , also in the legal sense , " belka said .
ironically , the text approved on friday was milder than earlier drafts .
conservative and nationalist parties originally penned a tougher resolution , but the country 's leftist parties said they would not accept any explicit demand for reparations .
the final outcome was a vaguely formulated demand that the government " take appropriate measures to address the concerns .

whereas after the fall of the taliban leadership , the terrorists fled underground , transforming themselves into phantoms .
but such phantoms live longer and appear to be more effective than real and detectable people .
after all , osama bin laden is still considered by wide circles in the islamic world to be a hero because he 's the only person who has stood up against the world 's only superpower and he has dictated the negotiating terms . indeed , al qaeda has already found a replacement for the regimes that once supported it , and it 's an extremely reliable substitute : bin laden 's organization has the support of close to 20,000 alumni who received training in terrorist camps operated by al qaeda in afghanistan .

those seeking to counteract the effects of poverty and oppression often use terms like “ freedom , ” “ democracy ” and “ human rights . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.09.2004 berlin shocked by polish reparations vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national borders do n't always match those of claims the decision of the polish parliament on friday to demand reparations from germany for world war ii draws dismay from german lawmakers . poland 's ambassador to germany , andrzej byrt , said the decision was " a reaction to the actions of the prussian claims society . "
the expellees ' lobby group , led by rudi pawelka , is currently planning a string of international lawsuits aimed at returning property and assets to ethnic germans who were forced to flee poland in the millions after world war ii .
" mr. pawelka and his consorts started this debate , he 's unleashed dramatic fear among poles , " byrt told a german newspaper over the weekend .
despite the parliament 's decision , byrt said he did not believe the polish government would actually make any official reparations demands of germany .
" the polish government considers the question of reparations to be finished , " said byrt .
old fears arise anew the polish parliament unanimously called on the government to estimate the total damages germany caused poland in world war ii and to begin talks with berlin .
the text of the resolution stated : " parliament declares that poland has not yet received war reparations payments and damages the for the enormous extent of destruction and material and non-material costs brought on by german aggression , occupation and genocide . "
additionally , the parliament rejected all claims for compensation or restoration of property from german expellees .
in recent weeks , lobby groups for the expellees , like the prussian claims society , have issued demands that have sparked tremendous resentment in poland .
many of the country 's citizens see the lawsuit threats as an effort to put german expellees on the same footing as the polish victims of german war crimes .
the issue is emotionally charged in poland , where old fears , painful historical experiences and the late consequences of a propaganda program that stoked fear of germans in the population for decades .
it 's a bitter realization for anyone who has worked on behalf of the decades-long reconciliation process that has resulted recently in the closest cooperative relationship ever seen between germany and poland .
and the consequences of any lawsuits could be enormous .
in addition to the financial effects , poles fear germans would return to the eastern european countries they once occupied - an uncomfortable notion for historically aware poles , who have a clear idea of who was the culprit and who was the victim in world war ii .
slowing progress the legal position is clear .
a treaty between germany and poland officially recognizes the oder and neisse rivers as poland 's western-most border .
germany is poland 's most important trading partner , and both countries are members of nato and the european union , and germany was also championed poland 's political needs when it negotiated its eu membership .
additionally , poland dropped all of its demands for reparations payments from the germans during the 1950s .
in berlin , politicians have been astounded by the polish parliament 's demand , and the polish government has called for a diplomatic solution between berlin and warsaw .
in a newspaper interview , the german social democrats foreign affairs spokesman , markus meckel , said he was greatly disappointed by the vote .

"
the expellees ' lobby group , led by rudi pawelka , is currently planning a string of international lawsuits aimed at returning property and assets to ethnic germans who were forced to flee poland in the millions after world war ii .
" mr. pawelka and his consorts started this debate , he 's unleashed dramatic fear among poles , " byrt told a german newspaper over the weekend .
despite the parliament 's decision , byrt said he did not believe the polish government would actually make any official reparations demands of germany .
" the polish government considers the question of reparations to be finished , " said byrt .
old fears arise anew the polish parliament unanimously called on the government to estimate the total damages germany caused poland in world war ii and to begin talks with berlin .
the text of the resolution stated : " parliament declares that poland has not yet received war reparations payments and damages the for the enormous extent of destruction and material and non-material costs brought on by german aggression , occupation and genocide . "
additionally , the parliament rejected all claims for compensation or restoration of property from german expellees .
in recent weeks , lobby groups for the expellees , like the prussian claims society , have issued demands that have sparked tremendous resentment in poland .
many of the country 's citizens see the lawsuit threats as an effort to put german expellees on the same footing as the polish victims of german war crimes .
the issue is emotionally charged in poland , where old fears , painful historical experiences and the late consequences of a propaganda program that stoked fear of germans in the population for decades .

three years after the sept .
11 , the terrorism map has spread and the threat has become transparent and harder to ferret out .
nor have we tackled the roots of the problem : poverty and oppression in many muslim countries . if you include iraq and afghanistan in this count , for some time now , not a single day has gone by in which a terrorist attack has been carried out somewhere in the world against innocent victims : passersby , tourists , hotel guests , airline passengers , train passengers , the pious or children on their first day of school . the world map of terrorism has grown and the targets have scattered even further over the continents , but the phenomenon is the same : political demands are executed through violence against innocents who have nothing to do with politics .
governments are extorted , citizens are frightened and terrorized . the myth of al qaeda taking stock of the war against terror three years after sept .
11 and its terror attacks can be an equally sobering and depressing exercise .
under the leadership of the united states , an international alliance has formed that includes western democracies as well as countries that formerly sponsored at least some forms of terrorism .
but a victory over terrorism is still far from sight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osama bin laden : the world 's most elusive cave-dweller in some respects , it could even be farther from sight than it was three years ago .
at least back then we knew the enemy 's address .
at least the most important enemy : osama bin laden and the leaders of his al qaeda terror network mostly lived in taliban-ruled afghanistan - and even if they were n't captured , they were at least real characters .
whereas after the fall of the taliban leadership , the terrorists fled underground , transforming themselves into phantoms .
but such phantoms live longer and appear to be more effective than real and detectable people .
after all , osama bin laden is still considered by wide circles in the islamic world to be a hero because he 's the only person who has stood up against the world 's only superpower and he has dictated the negotiating terms . indeed , al qaeda has already found a replacement for the regimes that once supported it , and it 's an extremely reliable substitute : bin laden 's organization has the support of close to 20,000 alumni who received training in terrorist camps operated by al qaeda in afghanistan .
long ago , these international terror trainees returned to their homelands , where many are operating as sleepers who could be activated at any time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men carry young hostages who managed to escape from the school building after special forces entered the school in beslan , north ossetia , on sept .
3 .
the growing opacity is also making al qaeda more enigmatic : wherever a terror attack is carried out now , the name al qaeda is quickly raised and it is almost always asserted that bin laden has played a role in it .
but that 's almost certainly not always the case .
but what is often true is that the attackers follow the example of al qaeda .
and that holds true in indonesia , turkey , morocco and ossetia .
the list of terrorist targets are growing and all too often they include world regions where disaffected and the frustrated allow themselves to become fanatics and consign themselves to violence . in that sense , it would be wrong to consider al qaeda a sort of tightly organized " terrorism incorporated . "
the " network of terror , " and even this term may go a bit too far , already relies heavily on the existence of oppression and poverty in the world for its own survival .
those seeking to counteract the effects of poverty and oppression often use terms like “ freedom , ” “ democracy ” and “ human rights . ”
but people in the islamic world often accuse the west of double morals because of their strong feeling that muslim countries are economically and politically disadvantaged in comparison to the west .
many interpret this as a kind of religious discrimination against muslims . fighting the roots of terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a guard with an automatic rifle protects the capitol building in washington , d.c. at the same time , the west – especially the usa – does too little to address these disillusioned people .
instead it is moving mostly to protect itself through greater vigilance and an increasing number of civil rights violations .
by doing so , the west is failing to recognize that those moves may also be strengthening terrorists ’ arguments against the west .
additionally , further violence is not going to eradicate terrorism . the conclusion in the end is that terrorism must be fought at its roots – and not just the symptoms .
nor can there just be one method of treatment – otherwise every attempt will be futile .
and there have been many efforts .
of course , a good number of participants in the coalition against terror or not democratic countries .
but they have at least disavowed themselves of their previous support for terrorist groups .
that ’ s a first success .
but now we must work on getting these states , like pakistan and libya , to make the complete transition to freedom and democracy .
only then can we increase the chances the terrorism will be diminished over the long-term . peter philipp -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : mixing up words and deeds in post-9/11 politics to understand why the world has become a more dangerous place since 9/11 , the u.s. should look inward , commentator miodrag soric says .

"
the expellees ' lobby group , led by rudi pawelka , is currently planning a string of international lawsuits aimed at returning property and assets to ethnic germans who were forced to flee poland in the millions after world war ii .
" mr. pawelka and his consorts started this debate , he 's unleashed dramatic fear among poles , " byrt told a german newspaper over the weekend .
despite the parliament 's decision , byrt said he did not believe the polish government would actually make any official reparations demands of germany .
" the polish government considers the question of reparations to be finished , " said byrt .
old fears arise anew the polish parliament unanimously called on the government to estimate the total damages germany caused poland in world war ii and to begin talks with berlin .
the text of the resolution stated : " parliament declares that poland has not yet received war reparations payments and damages the for the enormous extent of destruction and material and non-material costs brought on by german aggression , occupation and genocide . "
additionally , the parliament rejected all claims for compensation or restoration of property from german expellees .
in recent weeks , lobby groups for the expellees , like the prussian claims society , have issued demands that have sparked tremendous resentment in poland .
many of the country 's citizens see the lawsuit threats as an effort to put german expellees on the same footing as the polish victims of german war crimes .
the issue is emotionally charged in poland , where old fears , painful historical experiences and the late consequences of a propaganda program that stoked fear of germans in the population for decades .
it 's a bitter realization for anyone who has worked on behalf of the decades-long reconciliation process that has resulted recently in the closest cooperative relationship ever seen between germany and poland .
and the consequences of any lawsuits could be enormous .
in addition to the financial effects , poles fear germans would return to the eastern european countries they once occupied - an uncomfortable notion for historically aware poles , who have a clear idea of who was the culprit and who was the victim in world war ii .
slowing progress the legal position is clear .
a treaty between germany and poland officially recognizes the oder and neisse rivers as poland 's western-most border .
germany is poland 's most important trading partner , and both countries are members of nato and the european union , and germany was also championed poland 's political needs when it negotiated its eu membership .
additionally , poland dropped all of its demands for reparations payments from the germans during the 1950s .
in berlin , politicians have been astounded by the polish parliament 's demand , and the polish government has called for a diplomatic solution between berlin and warsaw .
in a newspaper interview , the german social democrats foreign affairs spokesman , markus meckel , said he was greatly disappointed by the vote .
and the press department at the chancellery in berlin repeated previous statements from chancellor gerhard schröder that both countries consider the question of reparations settled .
debate in parliament the resolution agreed to by the polish parliament is a political resolution and it has no legally binding effect for prime minister marek belka or his government .
" were trying to create a dialogue with the governments of poland to find a solution that finalizes all concerns about damages , also in the legal sense , " belka said .
ironically , the text approved on friday was milder than earlier drafts .

"
the expellees ' lobby group , led by rudi pawelka , is currently planning a string of international lawsuits aimed at returning property and assets to ethnic germans who were forced to flee poland in the millions after world war ii .
" mr. pawelka and his consorts started this debate , he 's unleashed dramatic fear among poles , " byrt told a german newspaper over the weekend .
despite the parliament 's decision , byrt said he did not believe the polish government would actually make any official reparations demands of germany .
" the polish government considers the question of reparations to be finished , " said byrt .
old fears arise anew the polish parliament unanimously called on the government to estimate the total damages germany caused poland in world war ii and to begin talks with berlin .
the text of the resolution stated : " parliament declares that poland has not yet received war reparations payments and damages the for the enormous extent of destruction and material and non-material costs brought on by german aggression , occupation and genocide . "
additionally , the parliament rejected all claims for compensation or restoration of property from german expellees .
in recent weeks , lobby groups for the expellees , like the prussian claims society , have issued demands that have sparked tremendous resentment in poland .
many of the country 's citizens see the lawsuit threats as an effort to put german expellees on the same footing as the polish victims of german war crimes .
the issue is emotionally charged in poland , where old fears , painful historical experiences and the late consequences of a propaganda program that stoked fear of germans in the population for decades .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.09.2004 analysis : the phantom of osama bin laden großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where are they now : 20,000 trained in al qaeda camps .
three years after the sept .
11 , the terrorism map has spread and the threat has become transparent and harder to ferret out .
nor have we tackled the roots of the problem : poverty and oppression in many muslim countries . if you include iraq and afghanistan in this count , for some time now , not a single day has gone by in which a terrorist attack has been carried out somewhere in the world against innocent victims : passersby , tourists , hotel guests , airline passengers , train passengers , the pious or children on their first day of school . the world map of terrorism has grown and the targets have scattered even further over the continents , but the phenomenon is the same : political demands are executed through violence against innocents who have nothing to do with politics .
governments are extorted , citizens are frightened and terrorized . the myth of al qaeda taking stock of the war against terror three years after sept .
11 and its terror attacks can be an equally sobering and depressing exercise .
under the leadership of the united states , an international alliance has formed that includes western democracies as well as countries that formerly sponsored at least some forms of terrorism .
but a victory over terrorism is still far from sight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osama bin laden : the world 's most elusive cave-dweller in some respects , it could even be farther from sight than it was three years ago .
at least back then we knew the enemy 's address .
at least the most important enemy : osama bin laden and the leaders of his al qaeda terror network mostly lived in taliban-ruled afghanistan - and even if they were n't captured , they were at least real characters .
whereas after the fall of the taliban leadership , the terrorists fled underground , transforming themselves into phantoms .
but such phantoms live longer and appear to be more effective than real and detectable people .
after all , osama bin laden is still considered by wide circles in the islamic world to be a hero because he 's the only person who has stood up against the world 's only superpower and he has dictated the negotiating terms . indeed , al qaeda has already found a replacement for the regimes that once supported it , and it 's an extremely reliable substitute : bin laden 's organization has the support of close to 20,000 alumni who received training in terrorist camps operated by al qaeda in afghanistan .
long ago , these international terror trainees returned to their homelands , where many are operating as sleepers who could be activated at any time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men carry young hostages who managed to escape from the school building after special forces entered the school in beslan , north ossetia , on sept .
3 .
the growing opacity is also making al qaeda more enigmatic : wherever a terror attack is carried out now , the name al qaeda is quickly raised and it is almost always asserted that bin laden has played a role in it .
but that 's almost certainly not always the case .
but what is often true is that the attackers follow the example of al qaeda .
and that holds true in indonesia , turkey , morocco and ossetia .
the list of terrorist targets are growing and all too often they include world regions where disaffected and the frustrated allow themselves to become fanatics and consign themselves to violence . in that sense , it would be wrong to consider al qaeda a sort of tightly organized " terrorism incorporated . "
the " network of terror , " and even this term may go a bit too far , already relies heavily on the existence of oppression and poverty in the world for its own survival .
those seeking to counteract the effects of poverty and oppression often use terms like “ freedom , ” “ democracy ” and “ human rights . ”
but people in the islamic world often accuse the west of double morals because of their strong feeling that muslim countries are economically and politically disadvantaged in comparison to the west .
many interpret this as a kind of religious discrimination against muslims . fighting the roots of terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a guard with an automatic rifle protects the capitol building in washington , d.c. at the same time , the west – especially the usa – does too little to address these disillusioned people .
instead it is moving mostly to protect itself through greater vigilance and an increasing number of civil rights violations .
by doing so , the west is failing to recognize that those moves may also be strengthening terrorists ’ arguments against the west .
additionally , further violence is not going to eradicate terrorism . the conclusion in the end is that terrorism must be fought at its roots – and not just the symptoms .
nor can there just be one method of treatment – otherwise every attempt will be futile .
and there have been many efforts .
of course , a good number of participants in the coalition against terror or not democratic countries .
but they have at least disavowed themselves of their previous support for terrorist groups .
that ’ s a first success .
but now we must work on getting these states , like pakistan and libya , to make the complete transition to freedom and democracy .

three years after the sept .
11 , the terrorism map has spread and the threat has become transparent and harder to ferret out .
nor have we tackled the roots of the problem : poverty and oppression in many muslim countries . if you include iraq and afghanistan in this count , for some time now , not a single day has gone by in which a terrorist attack has been carried out somewhere in the world against innocent victims : passersby , tourists , hotel guests , airline passengers , train passengers , the pious or children on their first day of school . the world map of terrorism has grown and the targets have scattered even further over the continents , but the phenomenon is the same : political demands are executed through violence against innocents who have nothing to do with politics .
governments are extorted , citizens are frightened and terrorized . the myth of al qaeda taking stock of the war against terror three years after sept .
11 and its terror attacks can be an equally sobering and depressing exercise .
under the leadership of the united states , an international alliance has formed that includes western democracies as well as countries that formerly sponsored at least some forms of terrorism .
but a victory over terrorism is still far from sight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osama bin laden : the world 's most elusive cave-dweller in some respects , it could even be farther from sight than it was three years ago .
at least back then we knew the enemy 's address .
at least the most important enemy : osama bin laden and the leaders of his al qaeda terror network mostly lived in taliban-ruled afghanistan - and even if they were n't captured , they were at least real characters .
whereas after the fall of the taliban leadership , the terrorists fled underground , transforming themselves into phantoms .
but such phantoms live longer and appear to be more effective than real and detectable people .
after all , osama bin laden is still considered by wide circles in the islamic world to be a hero because he 's the only person who has stood up against the world 's only superpower and he has dictated the negotiating terms . indeed , al qaeda has already found a replacement for the regimes that once supported it , and it 's an extremely reliable substitute : bin laden 's organization has the support of close to 20,000 alumni who received training in terrorist camps operated by al qaeda in afghanistan .
long ago , these international terror trainees returned to their homelands , where many are operating as sleepers who could be activated at any time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men carry young hostages who managed to escape from the school building after special forces entered the school in beslan , north ossetia , on sept .
3 .
the growing opacity is also making al qaeda more enigmatic : wherever a terror attack is carried out now , the name al qaeda is quickly raised and it is almost always asserted that bin laden has played a role in it .
but that 's almost certainly not always the case .
but what is often true is that the attackers follow the example of al qaeda .
and that holds true in indonesia , turkey , morocco and ossetia .
the list of terrorist targets are growing and all too often they include world regions where disaffected and the frustrated allow themselves to become fanatics and consign themselves to violence . in that sense , it would be wrong to consider al qaeda a sort of tightly organized " terrorism incorporated . "
the " network of terror , " and even this term may go a bit too far , already relies heavily on the existence of oppression and poverty in the world for its own survival .
those seeking to counteract the effects of poverty and oppression often use terms like “ freedom , ” “ democracy ” and “ human rights . ”
but people in the islamic world often accuse the west of double morals because of their strong feeling that muslim countries are economically and politically disadvantaged in comparison to the west .
many interpret this as a kind of religious discrimination against muslims . fighting the roots of terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a guard with an automatic rifle protects the capitol building in washington , d.c. at the same time , the west – especially the usa – does too little to address these disillusioned people .
instead it is moving mostly to protect itself through greater vigilance and an increasing number of civil rights violations .
by doing so , the west is failing to recognize that those moves may also be strengthening terrorists ’ arguments against the west .
additionally , further violence is not going to eradicate terrorism . the conclusion in the end is that terrorism must be fought at its roots – and not just the symptoms .
nor can there just be one method of treatment – otherwise every attempt will be futile .
and there have been many efforts .
of course , a good number of participants in the coalition against terror or not democratic countries .
but they have at least disavowed themselves of their previous support for terrorist groups .
that ’ s a first success .
but now we must work on getting these states , like pakistan and libya , to make the complete transition to freedom and democracy .
only then can we increase the chances the terrorism will be diminished over the long-term . peter philipp -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : mixing up words and deeds in post-9/11 politics to understand why the world has become a more dangerous place since 9/11 , the u.s. should look inward , commentator miodrag soric says .

" people are outraged that so much that they hold dear could be sacrificed in the name of profit , especially since baa has yet to prove a commercial case for a second runway - or spell out how it is going to pay for it given that the no frills carriers such as ryanair are already making such a fuss about the cost burden that expansion would impose .

however , she was optimistic for the long-term , saying that " increasingly " people were questioning the need for expansion , particularly the impact on the current heritage and environment , as well as the " legacy we leave for our children " .
ms barbone said that just as there was no such thing as a free lunch , " there is no such thing as a cheap flight " .
" there is a cost - and that cost is the break-up of entire communities , the impact on the urbanisation of the broader community and the impact on the global environment . "
three circular walks of 5 , 7 and 10 miles will start and finish at molehill green , which would be " obliterated " by the development of a second runway , ms barbone said .
