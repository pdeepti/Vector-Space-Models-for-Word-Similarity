an accomplice was jailed for 25 years and a fourth defendant for five . " marc dutroux , you have been condemned to the maximum sentence , " presiding judge stephane goux said , at the close of nearly four months of hearings dubbed belgium 's " trial of the century " . " i think that you are still facing a better fate than most of your victims , who are no longer in the world of the living , " goux said . sabine dardenne , one of two girls who were rescued from a cellar where dutroux submitted his victims to unimaginable sexual abuse , was said to be " delighted " . " a good piece of justice has finally been done , " said her lawyer , celine parisse . the 47-year-old dutroux had once again protested his innocence in a last session of pleading before the sentences were pronounced , but was slapped down by goux . " marc dutroux , the verdict is clear , " the judge , visibly agitated , said after a 10-minute intervention by dutroux , who nevertheless vowed to battle to the " end of his days " to prove his innocence . goux handed down the sentences in an emotionless voice to a hushed courtroom , at the end of a lengthy summation of a series of crimes that traumatised belgium and shocked the world . for dutroux , dubbed by the press " belgium 's most hated man , " life will most likely mean life without prospect of parole . but for his ex-wife michelle martin , 44 , and his 33-year-old " faithful companion " michel lelievre , their respective terms of 30 and 25 years could in theory be cut short with good behavior . the fourth defendant , michel nihoul , 63 , was jailed for five years for drug-dealing and fraud .
but he was acquitted last week of all charges of complicity in the abductions . dutroux argued all along that he was the fall-guy for a paedophile gang led by nihoul - a view shared by most belgians , surveys suggest . for jean-denis lejeune , whose daughter julie was one of two eight-year-old girls who starved to death while imprisoned by dutroux , the sentences brought little solace . noting that he could meet martin and lelievre in the streets if they are released early , he said : " these people , even so , kidnapped children , tortured them and left them to starve . " it leaves me with a bad taste in the mouth , " lejeune told reporters . the acquittal of nihoul on the charge of complicity in the kidnappings fuelled questions of whether the trial uncovered the full truth behind whether dutroux - as he claimed - was merely the courier for a paedophile gang . it did , however , revive memories of police and judicial bungling that in late 1996 saw more than 300,000 people take to the streets of brussels in silent protest . during the morning 's pre-sentencing hearing , martin reiterated her " profound regrets and profound remorse " . lelievre had said : " whatever the sentence , i will accept it . "
nihoul had appealed for the " greatest clemency " from the court . dutroux was found guilty last thursday of murdering two teenaged girls and an accomplice , as well as of abducting and raping the six girls . but in one of the most harrowing aspects of the case , the prosecution said it was unable to determine precisely when julie lejeune and her friend melissa russo died an agonising death in the darkness of dutroux 's dungeon . dutroux claimed that his ex-wife failed to feed them but no one was ever charged with the murder of the eight-year-olds . " we are at the end of one stage .
unfortunately , nothing has been resolved , " jean-denis lejeune said . " having to live with all these uncertainties and these grey areas means that life will remain disturbed as long as we do n't know what really happened , " he said . - afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jury convicts ' beast of belgium ' a belgian court finds marc dutroux guilty of a series of abductions and murders of teenage girls that rocked belgium for the greater part of the last decade and set the stage for the country 's trial of the century .

the u.s. says the ban goes too far . for thousands of childless couples in western europe and north america , the dream of adopting a romanian child is over .
for the estimated 50,000 children still languishing in romania 's orphanages , their chances of finding a family have shrunk considerably . but the european union said the new law banning foreign adoptions is meant to better protect romania 's orphans , as many of the children supposedly destined for adoption were instead being trafficked into prostitution or the illegal organ trade . romania was also warned by the eu that its chances of joining the bloc in 2007 were in jeopardy if it did n't improve its record on children 's rights . romania 's new law bans all foreign adoptions , except by the child 's grandparents , and only then after all efforts have been made to place the child with a romanian family .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a study done in 2001 was recently brought to light by greenpeace , which claims the test showed that particles of genetically altered feed had made its way into cows ' milk .
a case of contamination ?
scientists from a munich-based research group who carried out the tests said there were indeed genetically altered particles in the milk - but said the results were scientifically irrelevant , because the test samples were most likely contaminated .
professor heinrich meyer of the weihenstephan center for the study of milk and food products at munich 's technical university , explained that in the 2001 study , samples taken from the association of milk and milk products in hessen were sent to the weihenstephan research institute , and " showed surprising indications of traces " of genetically altered materials .
but the testing samples had been sent by a private party and bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were n't part of a scientific study , meyer explained .
thus , the quality of the samples was unclear , making the study irrelevant , he said .
the result did prompt the weihenstephan institute to set up its own follow-up studies in 2003 , which failed to repeat the initial findings .
careful about samples " the results of the first study results have no basis , because there was no decent control group , " weihenstephan 's meyer told dw-world .
and the results had never been published because the conditions on the farm where the milk had been taken from were unknown .
" it is always a problem to work with samples from third parties .
you ca n't publish material like that , " she said .
greenpeace agrees that the particles found in 2001 could have gotten into the milk via feed-dust in the milking barn .
but greenpeace 's genetic-technology expert henning strodthoff told news agencies that they also could have traveled through the intestinal wall of the cow , and via the blood into the milk .
" that would be one possibility , but in the end , we really do n't know , " he said .

the u.s. says the ban goes too far . for thousands of childless couples in western europe and north america , the dream of adopting a romanian child is over .
for the estimated 50,000 children still languishing in romania 's orphanages , their chances of finding a family have shrunk considerably . but the european union said the new law banning foreign adoptions is meant to better protect romania 's orphans , as many of the children supposedly destined for adoption were instead being trafficked into prostitution or the illegal organ trade . romania was also warned by the eu that its chances of joining the bloc in 2007 were in jeopardy if it did n't improve its record on children 's rights . romania 's new law bans all foreign adoptions , except by the child 's grandparents , and only then after all efforts have been made to place the child with a romanian family .
critics of the new law say it 's highly unlikely that the government will find enough romanian families with which to place the orphans . freeze on adoptions in progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian president ion iliescu in addition , the law is likely to end hundreds of foreign adoptions that are already in progress .
representatives of the hundreds of american families caught up in the lengthy adoption procedures are hoping to persuade romanian president ion iliescu -lrb- photo -rrb- to allow adoptions already underway to proceed . " it 's not up to us to tell romania how to write their laws , " said elaine macewen , executive director of nobody 's children , a north carolina-based group that helps children living in romanian orphanages .
" we 're asking them just to honor their commitments to assigned families . " the u.s. ambassador to bucharest described the law as a " tragedy " which punishes thousands of childless couples who have a legitimate wish to provide one of romania 's 50,000 orphans with a home and a higher standard of living in the u.s. but romanian officials are keen to end the perception that romania is a country that profits from the export of its own children .
" this law shows that our children are not for sale , that they are better off in romania , " florin iordache , a member of parliament for the ruling social democrat party , told reuters news agency . ceaucescu 's legacy international adoptions in romania boomed in 1989 after communist dictator nicolae ceaucescu was ousted from government and television pictures of children living in squalid conditions in orphanages were beamed around the world .
under ceaucescu 's iron-fisted rule , an estimated 100,000 children were confined to orphanages that looked more like prisons .
they were the products of his ban on contraception and abortion . the adoption system quickly became awash in corruption .
private adoption agencies were free to charge their own fees for arranging adoptions , usually ranging between € 7,500 -lrb- $ 9,000 -rrb- and € 25,000 -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- . earlier this month , baroness emma nicholson , the european parliament 's special envoy for romania , criticized the country for " persistent abandonment of children , child abuse and neglect , international adoption and child trafficking .

but according to an investigation carried out by kvb , an association representing doctors who have patients with public insurance , online prescriptions are just as expensive as traditional ones picked up in the corner bricks-and-mortar pharmacy .
" the results were clear : -lrb- internet -rrb- merchants are orienting themselves to the penny to already existing price guidelines for medications , " dr. leonhard hansen , a deputy director at kvb , told reporters at a news conference on monday .
those guidelines are used by traditional pharmacies to set their prices .
patients save by buying online , according to kvb , only when it comes to over-the-counter medications .
" then the savings are from ten to 30 percent , " said hansen .
the government had hoped that opening up the market for medications would create a competitive environment that would bring the cost of prescription drugs down .
" a price war that we had hoped for following the health reforms has failed to appear , " said hansen .
fewer doctor 's visits but another of the controversial health care reforms that went into effect this year seems to be having the intended effect , according to kvb .
starting january 1 , patients are required to pay a € 10 fee per quarter for doctor 's office visits .
in the first quarter of the year , studies have shown that 10 percent fewer people went to the doctor .
the trend has continued into the second quarter , according to a surveys of various doctors ' practices around the country .
" people are n't going to the doctor for just any little trifle anymore , " klaus vater , a spokesman for the health ministry , told reporters .
despite the fall in trips to the doctor , hansen said he did not see any of the " horror scenarios " critics of the reforms had painted in the lead-up to the changes .
" we have n't noticed any cuts in the level of basic care , " he said .
he warned , however , that because of the new fees , poor people were seeking a doctor 's help less than they should , thereby putting off treatment and potentially suffering more serious health problems over the long term .
such developments , he said , would have to be watched over the long run .
meeting savings goals ?
although the health ministry has pointed to successes , the hoped-for overall savings will likely not materialize , according to kvb .
when the reforms were passed , health minister ulla schmidt estimated savings of up to € 3 billion on medications alone in 2004 .
but hansen said a more realistic forecast would be somewhere in the neighborhood of € 1.4 billion and € 1.8 billion for this year .
the health ministry has rejected the lower estimate and is sticking by its forecast . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a mouse-click to medicine until now , germany has banned the sale of medicines by mail order .

an accomplice was jailed for 25 years and a fourth defendant for five . " marc dutroux , you have been condemned to the maximum sentence , " presiding judge stephane goux said , at the close of nearly four months of hearings dubbed belgium 's " trial of the century " . " i think that you are still facing a better fate than most of your victims , who are no longer in the world of the living , " goux said . sabine dardenne , one of two girls who were rescued from a cellar where dutroux submitted his victims to unimaginable sexual abuse , was said to be " delighted " . " a good piece of justice has finally been done , " said her lawyer , celine parisse . the 47-year-old dutroux had once again protested his innocence in a last session of pleading before the sentences were pronounced , but was slapped down by goux . " marc dutroux , the verdict is clear , " the judge , visibly agitated , said after a 10-minute intervention by dutroux , who nevertheless vowed to battle to the " end of his days " to prove his innocence . goux handed down the sentences in an emotionless voice to a hushed courtroom , at the end of a lengthy summation of a series of crimes that traumatised belgium and shocked the world . for dutroux , dubbed by the press " belgium 's most hated man , " life will most likely mean life without prospect of parole . but for his ex-wife michelle martin , 44 , and his 33-year-old " faithful companion " michel lelievre , their respective terms of 30 and 25 years could in theory be cut short with good behavior . the fourth defendant , michel nihoul , 63 , was jailed for five years for drug-dealing and fraud .
but he was acquitted last week of all charges of complicity in the abductions . dutroux argued all along that he was the fall-guy for a paedophile gang led by nihoul - a view shared by most belgians , surveys suggest . for jean-denis lejeune , whose daughter julie was one of two eight-year-old girls who starved to death while imprisoned by dutroux , the sentences brought little solace . noting that he could meet martin and lelievre in the streets if they are released early , he said : " these people , even so , kidnapped children , tortured them and left them to starve . " it leaves me with a bad taste in the mouth , " lejeune told reporters . the acquittal of nihoul on the charge of complicity in the kidnappings fuelled questions of whether the trial uncovered the full truth behind whether dutroux - as he claimed - was merely the courier for a paedophile gang . it did , however , revive memories of police and judicial bungling that in late 1996 saw more than 300,000 people take to the streets of brussels in silent protest . during the morning 's pre-sentencing hearing , martin reiterated her " profound regrets and profound remorse " . lelievre had said : " whatever the sentence , i will accept it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.06.2004 romania bans foreign adoptions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a romanian family will do the romanian government has passed a law banning foreign adoptions of its orphans after pressure from the eu to curb abuses of the system by child traffickers .
the u.s. says the ban goes too far . for thousands of childless couples in western europe and north america , the dream of adopting a romanian child is over .
for the estimated 50,000 children still languishing in romania 's orphanages , their chances of finding a family have shrunk considerably . but the european union said the new law banning foreign adoptions is meant to better protect romania 's orphans , as many of the children supposedly destined for adoption were instead being trafficked into prostitution or the illegal organ trade . romania was also warned by the eu that its chances of joining the bloc in 2007 were in jeopardy if it did n't improve its record on children 's rights . romania 's new law bans all foreign adoptions , except by the child 's grandparents , and only then after all efforts have been made to place the child with a romanian family .
critics of the new law say it 's highly unlikely that the government will find enough romanian families with which to place the orphans . freeze on adoptions in progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian president ion iliescu in addition , the law is likely to end hundreds of foreign adoptions that are already in progress .
representatives of the hundreds of american families caught up in the lengthy adoption procedures are hoping to persuade romanian president ion iliescu -lrb- photo -rrb- to allow adoptions already underway to proceed . " it 's not up to us to tell romania how to write their laws , " said elaine macewen , executive director of nobody 's children , a north carolina-based group that helps children living in romanian orphanages .
" we 're asking them just to honor their commitments to assigned families . " the u.s. ambassador to bucharest described the law as a " tragedy " which punishes thousands of childless couples who have a legitimate wish to provide one of romania 's 50,000 orphans with a home and a higher standard of living in the u.s. but romanian officials are keen to end the perception that romania is a country that profits from the export of its own children .
" this law shows that our children are not for sale , that they are better off in romania , " florin iordache , a member of parliament for the ruling social democrat party , told reuters news agency . ceaucescu 's legacy international adoptions in romania boomed in 1989 after communist dictator nicolae ceaucescu was ousted from government and television pictures of children living in squalid conditions in orphanages were beamed around the world .
under ceaucescu 's iron-fisted rule , an estimated 100,000 children were confined to orphanages that looked more like prisons .
they were the products of his ban on contraception and abortion . the adoption system quickly became awash in corruption .
private adoption agencies were free to charge their own fees for arranging adoptions , usually ranging between € 7,500 -lrb- $ 9,000 -rrb- and € 25,000 -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- . earlier this month , baroness emma nicholson , the european parliament 's special envoy for romania , criticized the country for " persistent abandonment of children , child abuse and neglect , international adoption and child trafficking . " her report , meant to assess romania 's readiness to join the eu , said that the country 's " extreme poverty can not be addressed by the sale of … children . " nicholson was said to be " delighted " at the romanian government 's decision to ban foreign adoptions . the ban , which will take effect at the beginning of next year , replaces a moratorium on foreign adoptions imposed three years ago , but which was widely ignored . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stolen youth : child prostitution plagues german-czech border the united nations children 's agency says child prostitution is rising across the german border in the czech republic .

german scientists have refuted a study made public by greenpeace , which claims genetically altered feed particles can make their way into milk . a german agricultural research institute took pains to explain to a worried public that components from genetically altered livestock feed are not carried over into a cow 's milk , but environmentalists at the activist group greenpeace are nonetheless saying more studies should be carried out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a study done in 2001 was recently brought to light by greenpeace , which claims the test showed that particles of genetically altered feed had made its way into cows ' milk .
a case of contamination ?
scientists from a munich-based research group who carried out the tests said there were indeed genetically altered particles in the milk - but said the results were scientifically irrelevant , because the test samples were most likely contaminated .
professor heinrich meyer of the weihenstephan center for the study of milk and food products at munich 's technical university , explained that in the 2001 study , samples taken from the association of milk and milk products in hessen were sent to the weihenstephan research institute , and " showed surprising indications of traces " of genetically altered materials .
but the testing samples had been sent by a private party and bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were n't part of a scientific study , meyer explained .
thus , the quality of the samples was unclear , making the study irrelevant , he said .
the result did prompt the weihenstephan institute to set up its own follow-up studies in 2003 , which failed to repeat the initial findings .
careful about samples " the results of the first study results have no basis , because there was no decent control group , " weihenstephan 's meyer told dw-world .
and the results had never been published because the conditions on the farm where the milk had been taken from were unknown .
" it is always a problem to work with samples from third parties .
you ca n't publish material like that , " she said .
greenpeace agrees that the particles found in 2001 could have gotten into the milk via feed-dust in the milking barn .
but greenpeace 's genetic-technology expert henning strodthoff told news agencies that they also could have traveled through the intestinal wall of the cow , and via the blood into the milk .
" that would be one possibility , but in the end , we really do n't know , " he said .

german scientists have refuted a study made public by greenpeace , which claims genetically altered feed particles can make their way into milk . a german agricultural research institute took pains to explain to a worried public that components from genetically altered livestock feed are not carried over into a cow 's milk , but environmentalists at the activist group greenpeace are nonetheless saying more studies should be carried out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a study done in 2001 was recently brought to light by greenpeace , which claims the test showed that particles of genetically altered feed had made its way into cows ' milk .
a case of contamination ?
scientists from a munich-based research group who carried out the tests said there were indeed genetically altered particles in the milk - but said the results were scientifically irrelevant , because the test samples were most likely contaminated .
professor heinrich meyer of the weihenstephan center for the study of milk and food products at munich 's technical university , explained that in the 2001 study , samples taken from the association of milk and milk products in hessen were sent to the weihenstephan research institute , and " showed surprising indications of traces " of genetically altered materials .
but the testing samples had been sent by a private party and bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were n't part of a scientific study , meyer explained .
thus , the quality of the samples was unclear , making the study irrelevant , he said .
the result did prompt the weihenstephan institute to set up its own follow-up studies in 2003 , which failed to repeat the initial findings .
careful about samples " the results of the first study results have no basis , because there was no decent control group , " weihenstephan 's meyer told dw-world .
and the results had never been published because the conditions on the farm where the milk had been taken from were unknown .
" it is always a problem to work with samples from third parties .
you ca n't publish material like that , " she said .
greenpeace agrees that the particles found in 2001 could have gotten into the milk via feed-dust in the milking barn .
but greenpeace 's genetic-technology expert henning strodthoff told news agencies that they also could have traveled through the intestinal wall of the cow , and via the blood into the milk .
" that would be one possibility , but in the end , we really do n't know , " he said .
germany has a popular brand of milk products called weihenstephan , but the company has no connection to the research organization or this study . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament approves gene-food law the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations .

an accomplice was jailed for 25 years and a fourth defendant for five . " marc dutroux , you have been condemned to the maximum sentence , " presiding judge stephane goux said , at the close of nearly four months of hearings dubbed belgium 's " trial of the century " . " i think that you are still facing a better fate than most of your victims , who are no longer in the world of the living , " goux said . sabine dardenne , one of two girls who were rescued from a cellar where dutroux submitted his victims to unimaginable sexual abuse , was said to be " delighted " . " a good piece of justice has finally been done , " said her lawyer , celine parisse . the 47-year-old dutroux had once again protested his innocence in a last session of pleading before the sentences were pronounced , but was slapped down by goux . " marc dutroux , the verdict is clear , " the judge , visibly agitated , said after a 10-minute intervention by dutroux , who nevertheless vowed to battle to the " end of his days " to prove his innocence . goux handed down the sentences in an emotionless voice to a hushed courtroom , at the end of a lengthy summation of a series of crimes that traumatised belgium and shocked the world . for dutroux , dubbed by the press " belgium 's most hated man , " life will most likely mean life without prospect of parole . but for his ex-wife michelle martin , 44 , and his 33-year-old " faithful companion " michel lelievre , their respective terms of 30 and 25 years could in theory be cut short with good behavior . the fourth defendant , michel nihoul , 63 , was jailed for five years for drug-dealing and fraud .
but he was acquitted last week of all charges of complicity in the abductions . dutroux argued all along that he was the fall-guy for a paedophile gang led by nihoul - a view shared by most belgians , surveys suggest . for jean-denis lejeune , whose daughter julie was one of two eight-year-old girls who starved to death while imprisoned by dutroux , the sentences brought little solace . noting that he could meet martin and lelievre in the streets if they are released early , he said : " these people , even so , kidnapped children , tortured them and left them to starve . " it leaves me with a bad taste in the mouth , " lejeune told reporters . the acquittal of nihoul on the charge of complicity in the kidnappings fuelled questions of whether the trial uncovered the full truth behind whether dutroux - as he claimed - was merely the courier for a paedophile gang . it did , however , revive memories of police and judicial bungling that in late 1996 saw more than 300,000 people take to the streets of brussels in silent protest . during the morning 's pre-sentencing hearing , martin reiterated her " profound regrets and profound remorse " . lelievre had said : " whatever the sentence , i will accept it . "
nihoul had appealed for the " greatest clemency " from the court . dutroux was found guilty last thursday of murdering two teenaged girls and an accomplice , as well as of abducting and raping the six girls . but in one of the most harrowing aspects of the case , the prosecution said it was unable to determine precisely when julie lejeune and her friend melissa russo died an agonising death in the darkness of dutroux 's dungeon . dutroux claimed that his ex-wife failed to feed them but no one was ever charged with the murder of the eight-year-olds . " we are at the end of one stage .

german scientists have refuted a study made public by greenpeace , which claims genetically altered feed particles can make their way into milk . a german agricultural research institute took pains to explain to a worried public that components from genetically altered livestock feed are not carried over into a cow 's milk , but environmentalists at the activist group greenpeace are nonetheless saying more studies should be carried out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a study done in 2001 was recently brought to light by greenpeace , which claims the test showed that particles of genetically altered feed had made its way into cows ' milk .
a case of contamination ?
scientists from a munich-based research group who carried out the tests said there were indeed genetically altered particles in the milk - but said the results were scientifically irrelevant , because the test samples were most likely contaminated .
professor heinrich meyer of the weihenstephan center for the study of milk and food products at munich 's technical university , explained that in the 2001 study , samples taken from the association of milk and milk products in hessen were sent to the weihenstephan research institute , and " showed surprising indications of traces " of genetically altered materials .
but the testing samples had been sent by a private party and bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were n't part of a scientific study , meyer explained .
thus , the quality of the samples was unclear , making the study irrelevant , he said .
the result did prompt the weihenstephan institute to set up its own follow-up studies in 2003 , which failed to repeat the initial findings .
careful about samples " the results of the first study results have no basis , because there was no decent control group , " weihenstephan 's meyer told dw-world .
and the results had never been published because the conditions on the farm where the milk had been taken from were unknown .
" it is always a problem to work with samples from third parties .
you ca n't publish material like that , " she said .
greenpeace agrees that the particles found in 2001 could have gotten into the milk via feed-dust in the milking barn .
but greenpeace 's genetic-technology expert henning strodthoff told news agencies that they also could have traveled through the intestinal wall of the cow , and via the blood into the milk .
" that would be one possibility , but in the end , we really do n't know , " he said .

an accomplice was jailed for 25 years and a fourth defendant for five . " marc dutroux , you have been condemned to the maximum sentence , " presiding judge stephane goux said , at the close of nearly four months of hearings dubbed belgium 's " trial of the century " .

" it leaves me with a bad taste in the mouth , " lejeune told reporters . the acquittal of nihoul on the charge of complicity in the kidnappings fuelled questions of whether the trial uncovered the full truth behind whether dutroux - as he claimed - was merely the courier for a paedophile gang . it did , however , revive memories of police and judicial bungling that in late 1996 saw more than 300,000 people take to the streets of brussels in silent protest . during the morning 's pre-sentencing hearing , martin reiterated her " profound regrets and profound remorse " . lelievre had said : " whatever the sentence , i will accept it . "
nihoul had appealed for the " greatest clemency " from the court . dutroux was found guilty last thursday of murdering two teenaged girls and an accomplice , as well as of abducting and raping the six girls . but in one of the most harrowing aspects of the case , the prosecution said it was unable to determine precisely when julie lejeune and her friend melissa russo died an agonising death in the darkness of dutroux 's dungeon . dutroux claimed that his ex-wife failed to feed them but no one was ever charged with the murder of the eight-year-olds . " we are at the end of one stage .
unfortunately , nothing has been resolved , " jean-denis lejeune said . " having to live with all these uncertainties and these grey areas means that life will remain disturbed as long as we do n't know what really happened , " he said . - afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jury convicts ' beast of belgium ' a belgian court finds marc dutroux guilty of a series of abductions and murders of teenage girls that rocked belgium for the greater part of the last decade and set the stage for the country 's trial of the century .

german scientists have refuted a study made public by greenpeace , which claims genetically altered feed particles can make their way into milk . a german agricultural research institute took pains to explain to a worried public that components from genetically altered livestock feed are not carried over into a cow 's milk , but environmentalists at the activist group greenpeace are nonetheless saying more studies should be carried out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a study done in 2001 was recently brought to light by greenpeace , which claims the test showed that particles of genetically altered feed had made its way into cows ' milk .
a case of contamination ?
scientists from a munich-based research group who carried out the tests said there were indeed genetically altered particles in the milk - but said the results were scientifically irrelevant , because the test samples were most likely contaminated .
professor heinrich meyer of the weihenstephan center for the study of milk and food products at munich 's technical university , explained that in the 2001 study , samples taken from the association of milk and milk products in hessen were sent to the weihenstephan research institute , and " showed surprising indications of traces " of genetically altered materials .
but the testing samples had been sent by a private party and bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were n't part of a scientific study , meyer explained .
thus , the quality of the samples was unclear , making the study irrelevant , he said .
the result did prompt the weihenstephan institute to set up its own follow-up studies in 2003 , which failed to repeat the initial findings .
careful about samples " the results of the first study results have no basis , because there was no decent control group , " weihenstephan 's meyer told dw-world .
and the results had never been published because the conditions on the farm where the milk had been taken from were unknown .
" it is always a problem to work with samples from third parties .
you ca n't publish material like that , " she said .
greenpeace agrees that the particles found in 2001 could have gotten into the milk via feed-dust in the milking barn .
but greenpeace 's genetic-technology expert henning strodthoff told news agencies that they also could have traveled through the intestinal wall of the cow , and via the blood into the milk .
" that would be one possibility , but in the end , we really do n't know , " he said .

german scientists have refuted a study made public by greenpeace , which claims genetically altered feed particles can make their way into milk . a german agricultural research institute took pains to explain to a worried public that components from genetically altered livestock feed are not carried over into a cow 's milk , but environmentalists at the activist group greenpeace are nonetheless saying more studies should be carried out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a study done in 2001 was recently brought to light by greenpeace , which claims the test showed that particles of genetically altered feed had made its way into cows ' milk .
a case of contamination ?
scientists from a munich-based research group who carried out the tests said there were indeed genetically altered particles in the milk - but said the results were scientifically irrelevant , because the test samples were most likely contaminated .
professor heinrich meyer of the weihenstephan center for the study of milk and food products at munich 's technical university , explained that in the 2001 study , samples taken from the association of milk and milk products in hessen were sent to the weihenstephan research institute , and " showed surprising indications of traces " of genetically altered materials .
but the testing samples had been sent by a private party and bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were n't part of a scientific study , meyer explained .
thus , the quality of the samples was unclear , making the study irrelevant , he said .
the result did prompt the weihenstephan institute to set up its own follow-up studies in 2003 , which failed to repeat the initial findings .
careful about samples " the results of the first study results have no basis , because there was no decent control group , " weihenstephan 's meyer told dw-world .
and the results had never been published because the conditions on the farm where the milk had been taken from were unknown .
" it is always a problem to work with samples from third parties .
you ca n't publish material like that , " she said .
greenpeace agrees that the particles found in 2001 could have gotten into the milk via feed-dust in the milking barn .
but greenpeace 's genetic-technology expert henning strodthoff told news agencies that they also could have traveled through the intestinal wall of the cow , and via the blood into the milk .
" that would be one possibility , but in the end , we really do n't know , " he said .
germany has a popular brand of milk products called weihenstephan , but the company has no connection to the research organization or this study . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament approves gene-food law the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations .

but according to an investigation carried out by kvb , an association representing doctors who have patients with public insurance , online prescriptions are just as expensive as traditional ones picked up in the corner bricks-and-mortar pharmacy .
" the results were clear : -lrb- internet -rrb- merchants are orienting themselves to the penny to already existing price guidelines for medications , " dr. leonhard hansen , a deputy director at kvb , told reporters at a news conference on monday .
those guidelines are used by traditional pharmacies to set their prices .

the trend has continued into the second quarter , according to a surveys of various doctors ' practices around the country .
" people are n't going to the doctor for just any little trifle anymore , " klaus vater , a spokesman for the health ministry , told reporters .
despite the fall in trips to the doctor , hansen said he did not see any of the " horror scenarios " critics of the reforms had painted in the lead-up to the changes .
" we have n't noticed any cuts in the level of basic care , " he said .
he warned , however , that because of the new fees , poor people were seeking a doctor 's help less than they should , thereby putting off treatment and potentially suffering more serious health problems over the long term .
such developments , he said , would have to be watched over the long run .
meeting savings goals ?
although the health ministry has pointed to successes , the hoped-for overall savings will likely not materialize , according to kvb .
when the reforms were passed , health minister ulla schmidt estimated savings of up to € 3 billion on medications alone in 2004 .
but hansen said a more realistic forecast would be somewhere in the neighborhood of € 1.4 billion and € 1.8 billion for this year .

but according to an investigation carried out by kvb , an association representing doctors who have patients with public insurance , online prescriptions are just as expensive as traditional ones picked up in the corner bricks-and-mortar pharmacy .
" the results were clear : -lrb- internet -rrb- merchants are orienting themselves to the penny to already existing price guidelines for medications , " dr. leonhard hansen , a deputy director at kvb , told reporters at a news conference on monday .
those guidelines are used by traditional pharmacies to set their prices .
patients save by buying online , according to kvb , only when it comes to over-the-counter medications .
" then the savings are from ten to 30 percent , " said hansen .
the government had hoped that opening up the market for medications would create a competitive environment that would bring the cost of prescription drugs down .
" a price war that we had hoped for following the health reforms has failed to appear , " said hansen .
fewer doctor 's visits but another of the controversial health care reforms that went into effect this year seems to be having the intended effect , according to kvb .
starting january 1 , patients are required to pay a € 10 fee per quarter for doctor 's office visits .
in the first quarter of the year , studies have shown that 10 percent fewer people went to the doctor .
the trend has continued into the second quarter , according to a surveys of various doctors ' practices around the country .
" people are n't going to the doctor for just any little trifle anymore , " klaus vater , a spokesman for the health ministry , told reporters .
despite the fall in trips to the doctor , hansen said he did not see any of the " horror scenarios " critics of the reforms had painted in the lead-up to the changes .
" we have n't noticed any cuts in the level of basic care , " he said .
he warned , however , that because of the new fees , poor people were seeking a doctor 's help less than they should , thereby putting off treatment and potentially suffering more serious health problems over the long term .
such developments , he said , would have to be watched over the long run .
meeting savings goals ?
although the health ministry has pointed to successes , the hoped-for overall savings will likely not materialize , according to kvb .
when the reforms were passed , health minister ulla schmidt estimated savings of up to € 3 billion on medications alone in 2004 .
but hansen said a more realistic forecast would be somewhere in the neighborhood of € 1.4 billion and € 1.8 billion for this year .
the health ministry has rejected the lower estimate and is sticking by its forecast . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a mouse-click to medicine until now , germany has banned the sale of medicines by mail order .

the u.s. says the ban goes too far . for thousands of childless couples in western europe and north america , the dream of adopting a romanian child is over .
for the estimated 50,000 children still languishing in romania 's orphanages , their chances of finding a family have shrunk considerably . but the european union said the new law banning foreign adoptions is meant to better protect romania 's orphans , as many of the children supposedly destined for adoption were instead being trafficked into prostitution or the illegal organ trade . romania was also warned by the eu that its chances of joining the bloc in 2007 were in jeopardy if it did n't improve its record on children 's rights . romania 's new law bans all foreign adoptions , except by the child 's grandparents , and only then after all efforts have been made to place the child with a romanian family .
critics of the new law say it 's highly unlikely that the government will find enough romanian families with which to place the orphans . freeze on adoptions in progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian president ion iliescu in addition , the law is likely to end hundreds of foreign adoptions that are already in progress .
representatives of the hundreds of american families caught up in the lengthy adoption procedures are hoping to persuade romanian president ion iliescu -lrb- photo -rrb- to allow adoptions already underway to proceed . " it 's not up to us to tell romania how to write their laws , " said elaine macewen , executive director of nobody 's children , a north carolina-based group that helps children living in romanian orphanages .
" we 're asking them just to honor their commitments to assigned families . " the u.s. ambassador to bucharest described the law as a " tragedy " which punishes thousands of childless couples who have a legitimate wish to provide one of romania 's 50,000 orphans with a home and a higher standard of living in the u.s. but romanian officials are keen to end the perception that romania is a country that profits from the export of its own children .
" this law shows that our children are not for sale , that they are better off in romania , " florin iordache , a member of parliament for the ruling social democrat party , told reuters news agency . ceaucescu 's legacy international adoptions in romania boomed in 1989 after communist dictator nicolae ceaucescu was ousted from government and television pictures of children living in squalid conditions in orphanages were beamed around the world .
under ceaucescu 's iron-fisted rule , an estimated 100,000 children were confined to orphanages that looked more like prisons .
they were the products of his ban on contraception and abortion . the adoption system quickly became awash in corruption .
private adoption agencies were free to charge their own fees for arranging adoptions , usually ranging between € 7,500 -lrb- $ 9,000 -rrb- and € 25,000 -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- . earlier this month , baroness emma nicholson , the european parliament 's special envoy for romania , criticized the country for " persistent abandonment of children , child abuse and neglect , international adoption and child trafficking .

the u.s. says the ban goes too far . for thousands of childless couples in western europe and north america , the dream of adopting a romanian child is over .
for the estimated 50,000 children still languishing in romania 's orphanages , their chances of finding a family have shrunk considerably . but the european union said the new law banning foreign adoptions is meant to better protect romania 's orphans , as many of the children supposedly destined for adoption were instead being trafficked into prostitution or the illegal organ trade . romania was also warned by the eu that its chances of joining the bloc in 2007 were in jeopardy if it did n't improve its record on children 's rights . romania 's new law bans all foreign adoptions , except by the child 's grandparents , and only then after all efforts have been made to place the child with a romanian family .
critics of the new law say it 's highly unlikely that the government will find enough romanian families with which to place the orphans . freeze on adoptions in progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian president ion iliescu in addition , the law is likely to end hundreds of foreign adoptions that are already in progress .
representatives of the hundreds of american families caught up in the lengthy adoption procedures are hoping to persuade romanian president ion iliescu -lrb- photo -rrb- to allow adoptions already underway to proceed . " it 's not up to us to tell romania how to write their laws , " said elaine macewen , executive director of nobody 's children , a north carolina-based group that helps children living in romanian orphanages .
" we 're asking them just to honor their commitments to assigned families . " the u.s. ambassador to bucharest described the law as a " tragedy " which punishes thousands of childless couples who have a legitimate wish to provide one of romania 's 50,000 orphans with a home and a higher standard of living in the u.s. but romanian officials are keen to end the perception that romania is a country that profits from the export of its own children .
" this law shows that our children are not for sale , that they are better off in romania , " florin iordache , a member of parliament for the ruling social democrat party , told reuters news agency . ceaucescu 's legacy international adoptions in romania boomed in 1989 after communist dictator nicolae ceaucescu was ousted from government and television pictures of children living in squalid conditions in orphanages were beamed around the world .
under ceaucescu 's iron-fisted rule , an estimated 100,000 children were confined to orphanages that looked more like prisons .
they were the products of his ban on contraception and abortion . the adoption system quickly became awash in corruption .
private adoption agencies were free to charge their own fees for arranging adoptions , usually ranging between € 7,500 -lrb- $ 9,000 -rrb- and € 25,000 -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- . earlier this month , baroness emma nicholson , the european parliament 's special envoy for romania , criticized the country for " persistent abandonment of children , child abuse and neglect , international adoption and child trafficking . " her report , meant to assess romania 's readiness to join the eu , said that the country 's " extreme poverty can not be addressed by the sale of … children . " nicholson was said to be " delighted " at the romanian government 's decision to ban foreign adoptions . the ban , which will take effect at the beginning of next year , replaces a moratorium on foreign adoptions imposed three years ago , but which was widely ignored . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stolen youth : child prostitution plagues german-czech border the united nations children 's agency says child prostitution is rising across the german border in the czech republic .

german scientists have refuted a study made public by greenpeace , which claims genetically altered feed particles can make their way into milk . a german agricultural research institute took pains to explain to a worried public that components from genetically altered livestock feed are not carried over into a cow 's milk , but environmentalists at the activist group greenpeace are nonetheless saying more studies should be carried out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a study done in 2001 was recently brought to light by greenpeace , which claims the test showed that particles of genetically altered feed had made its way into cows ' milk .
a case of contamination ?
scientists from a munich-based research group who carried out the tests said there were indeed genetically altered particles in the milk - but said the results were scientifically irrelevant , because the test samples were most likely contaminated .
professor heinrich meyer of the weihenstephan center for the study of milk and food products at munich 's technical university , explained that in the 2001 study , samples taken from the association of milk and milk products in hessen were sent to the weihenstephan research institute , and " showed surprising indications of traces " of genetically altered materials .
but the testing samples had been sent by a private party and bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were n't part of a scientific study , meyer explained .
thus , the quality of the samples was unclear , making the study irrelevant , he said .
the result did prompt the weihenstephan institute to set up its own follow-up studies in 2003 , which failed to repeat the initial findings .
careful about samples " the results of the first study results have no basis , because there was no decent control group , " weihenstephan 's meyer told dw-world .
and the results had never been published because the conditions on the farm where the milk had been taken from were unknown .
" it is always a problem to work with samples from third parties .
you ca n't publish material like that , " she said .
greenpeace agrees that the particles found in 2001 could have gotten into the milk via feed-dust in the milking barn .
but greenpeace 's genetic-technology expert henning strodthoff told news agencies that they also could have traveled through the intestinal wall of the cow , and via the blood into the milk .
" that would be one possibility , but in the end , we really do n't know , " he said .

german scientists have refuted a study made public by greenpeace , which claims genetically altered feed particles can make their way into milk . a german agricultural research institute took pains to explain to a worried public that components from genetically altered livestock feed are not carried over into a cow 's milk , but environmentalists at the activist group greenpeace are nonetheless saying more studies should be carried out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a study done in 2001 was recently brought to light by greenpeace , which claims the test showed that particles of genetically altered feed had made its way into cows ' milk .
a case of contamination ?
scientists from a munich-based research group who carried out the tests said there were indeed genetically altered particles in the milk - but said the results were scientifically irrelevant , because the test samples were most likely contaminated .
professor heinrich meyer of the weihenstephan center for the study of milk and food products at munich 's technical university , explained that in the 2001 study , samples taken from the association of milk and milk products in hessen were sent to the weihenstephan research institute , and " showed surprising indications of traces " of genetically altered materials .
but the testing samples had been sent by a private party and bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were n't part of a scientific study , meyer explained .
thus , the quality of the samples was unclear , making the study irrelevant , he said .
the result did prompt the weihenstephan institute to set up its own follow-up studies in 2003 , which failed to repeat the initial findings .
careful about samples " the results of the first study results have no basis , because there was no decent control group , " weihenstephan 's meyer told dw-world .
and the results had never been published because the conditions on the farm where the milk had been taken from were unknown .
" it is always a problem to work with samples from third parties .
you ca n't publish material like that , " she said .
greenpeace agrees that the particles found in 2001 could have gotten into the milk via feed-dust in the milking barn .
but greenpeace 's genetic-technology expert henning strodthoff told news agencies that they also could have traveled through the intestinal wall of the cow , and via the blood into the milk .
" that would be one possibility , but in the end , we really do n't know , " he said .

egyptian embassy spokesman mahmoud gaafar said the 76-year-old president was in excellent health , denying rumors that he was seriously ill .
" if you listen to the rumors , you go nowhere , " gaafar told reuters .
" there are rumors everywhere .
he 's in good spirits .
his health is good , it 's excellent . "
german doctors postponed an operation monday to see if they could treat the president without resorting to surgery .
mubarak , who has been in power in egypt since 1981 , has prompted rumors about his health since he unexpectedly delayed two meetings with important visitors this month .
he also collapsed briefly during a speech in parliament last november .
officials blamed a combination of cold medication and fasting in the month of ramadan .
doctors in egypt had previously said the operation would involve inserting a microscopic endoscope in mubarak 's lower back to remove displaced cartilage . more briefs 21.06.2004 -pipe- crippling bureaucracy but great beer 21.06.2004 -pipe- schily to ban demonstrations by right-wing extremists 21.06.2004 -pipe- german greens give nod to immigration compromise 18.06.2004 -pipe- poll : schröder should stay in office 18.06.2004 -pipe- new law allows air force to down hijacked jets 18.06.2004 -pipe- political donations scandal engulfs third victim 18.06.2004 -pipe- bundestag passes stringent law on genetically modified crops 18.06.2004 -pipe- interior minister calls for centralization of terror fight radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

speaking in brussels on monday , giscard said , " things do seem to be pointing in the direction of a referendum , " referring to the fact that french interior minister dominque de villepin spoke out in favor of a poll on sunday .
moreover , the day after the constitution was signed , every party , including president jacques chirac 's own center-right ump , called on him to hold a vote on the text , according to le nouvel observateur .
giscard said that he thought a referendum " could well take place in spring 2005 . "
but like other politicians , the architect of the draft constitution adopted by eu leaders on friday , was wary of the problems that are likely to occur with ratification .
" we have to prepare the ground thoroughly , " he said while warning against some leaders who have " got into the habit of deflecting certain problems to the european level . "
-lrb- euobserver.com -rrb- dw-world.de ratifying eu constitution will be a ' tough battle ' european union leaders agreed on friday to the final text of europe 's first ever constitution , but now comes the hard part : selling it to the people .

the latest is former irish commissioner peter sutherland , according to irish media , who was briefly mentioned at the summit last friday amidst a growing list of possible candidates .
sutherland , who is now chair of oil company bp amoco , was pushed by irish prime minister bertie ahern at the meeting of eu leaders last week .
according to the irish times , ahern also put forward sutherland 's name during his tour of capitals before the summit .
however , sutherland would fall at the first fence if germany and france stick to their demands that the future commission president must come from a country which has the core eu policies .
german government spokesman bela anda on monday said , " it can hardly be imagined that the commission president will come from a country not represented in the core areas of eu bodies and its institutions . "
this followed a comment by french president jacques chirac last week where he said that he did not think it a good idea that the future commission president come from " a country which does n't take part in all european policies . "
this would exclude irish , danish , swedish and uk candidates as well as all of the new member states - over half of the total 25 member states - and has been flatly rejected by the uk .

environment minister cristina narbona said for the first time monday that meeting greenhouse gas targets will affect domestic electricity prices , while vowing to limit the impact on consumers .
" without doubt they -lrb- prices -rrb- will rise , " she said presenting a preview of madrid ’ s plan for allocating and trading co2 emission quotas to companies . although the eu plan for emissions trading does not include domestic consumers , the spanish government has vowed to work on the principle of " polluter pays . "
" it is not -lrb- only -rrb- industry that should act against diffuse excessive emissions , " narbona said .
spain has seen major economic growth since the environmental agreements were made as well as since its 1990 " base year " of 1990 against which targets are measured , making aims more difficult to reach .
spain has vowed to decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 15 percent by 2012 , based on 1990 levels .
but the country has already increased emissions by 41 percent since 1990 , according to the government ’ s own figures .

but according to an investigation carried out by kvb , an association representing doctors who have patients with public insurance , online prescriptions are just as expensive as traditional ones picked up in the corner bricks-and-mortar pharmacy .
" the results were clear : -lrb- internet -rrb- merchants are orienting themselves to the penny to already existing price guidelines for medications , " dr. leonhard hansen , a deputy director at kvb , told reporters at a news conference on monday .
those guidelines are used by traditional pharmacies to set their prices .
patients save by buying online , according to kvb , only when it comes to over-the-counter medications .
" then the savings are from ten to 30 percent , " said hansen .
the government had hoped that opening up the market for medications would create a competitive environment that would bring the cost of prescription drugs down .
" a price war that we had hoped for following the health reforms has failed to appear , " said hansen .
fewer doctor 's visits but another of the controversial health care reforms that went into effect this year seems to be having the intended effect , according to kvb .
starting january 1 , patients are required to pay a € 10 fee per quarter for doctor 's office visits .
in the first quarter of the year , studies have shown that 10 percent fewer people went to the doctor .
the trend has continued into the second quarter , according to a surveys of various doctors ' practices around the country .
" people are n't going to the doctor for just any little trifle anymore , " klaus vater , a spokesman for the health ministry , told reporters .
despite the fall in trips to the doctor , hansen said he did not see any of the " horror scenarios " critics of the reforms had painted in the lead-up to the changes .
" we have n't noticed any cuts in the level of basic care , " he said .
he warned , however , that because of the new fees , poor people were seeking a doctor 's help less than they should , thereby putting off treatment and potentially suffering more serious health problems over the long term .
such developments , he said , would have to be watched over the long run .
meeting savings goals ?
although the health ministry has pointed to successes , the hoped-for overall savings will likely not materialize , according to kvb .
when the reforms were passed , health minister ulla schmidt estimated savings of up to € 3 billion on medications alone in 2004 .
but hansen said a more realistic forecast would be somewhere in the neighborhood of € 1.4 billion and € 1.8 billion for this year .

but according to an investigation carried out by kvb , an association representing doctors who have patients with public insurance , online prescriptions are just as expensive as traditional ones picked up in the corner bricks-and-mortar pharmacy .
" the results were clear : -lrb- internet -rrb- merchants are orienting themselves to the penny to already existing price guidelines for medications , " dr. leonhard hansen , a deputy director at kvb , told reporters at a news conference on monday .
those guidelines are used by traditional pharmacies to set their prices .

he warned , however , that because of the new fees , poor people were seeking a doctor 's help less than they should , thereby putting off treatment and potentially suffering more serious health problems over the long term .
such developments , he said , would have to be watched over the long run .
meeting savings goals ?

when the reforms were passed , health minister ulla schmidt estimated savings of up to € 3 billion on medications alone in 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.06.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc germany boasts europe 's best highway rest stops adac , germany 's leading automobile association , on tuesday released the results of a test of 22 highway rest stops on the most important european highways in ten countries .
it found that travelers would do better to avoid every fourth rest stop , while more than half were described by the researchers as " passable . "
the study in particular criticized a lack of hospitality , expensive meals and problems of hygiene .
adac vice president max stich said that some rest stops could only be used to fill up on gasoline .
though none of the rest stops surveyed made the " very good " mark , those in germany were most frequently - seven out of ten times - described as " good . "
the worst performer was great britain , where six of the eight rest stops tested failed due to catastrophic hygiene and high prices .
italy did the worst when it came to hospitality .
in the latter aspect , germany 's highway rest stops fared the best , too . more briefs 22.06.2004 -pipe- egyptian president in good spirits in german hospital 21.06.2004 -pipe- crippling bureaucracy but great beer 21.06.2004 -pipe- schily to ban demonstrations by right-wing extremists 21.06.2004 -pipe- german greens give nod to immigration compromise 18.06.2004 -pipe- poll : schröder should stay in office 18.06.2004 -pipe- new law allows air force to down hijacked jets 18.06.2004 -pipe- political donations scandal engulfs third victim 18.06.2004 -pipe- bundestag passes stringent law on genetically modified crops radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the u.s. says the ban goes too far . for thousands of childless couples in western europe and north america , the dream of adopting a romanian child is over .
for the estimated 50,000 children still languishing in romania 's orphanages , their chances of finding a family have shrunk considerably . but the european union said the new law banning foreign adoptions is meant to better protect romania 's orphans , as many of the children supposedly destined for adoption were instead being trafficked into prostitution or the illegal organ trade . romania was also warned by the eu that its chances of joining the bloc in 2007 were in jeopardy if it did n't improve its record on children 's rights . romania 's new law bans all foreign adoptions , except by the child 's grandparents , and only then after all efforts have been made to place the child with a romanian family .
critics of the new law say it 's highly unlikely that the government will find enough romanian families with which to place the orphans . freeze on adoptions in progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian president ion iliescu in addition , the law is likely to end hundreds of foreign adoptions that are already in progress .
representatives of the hundreds of american families caught up in the lengthy adoption procedures are hoping to persuade romanian president ion iliescu -lrb- photo -rrb- to allow adoptions already underway to proceed . " it 's not up to us to tell romania how to write their laws , " said elaine macewen , executive director of nobody 's children , a north carolina-based group that helps children living in romanian orphanages .
" we 're asking them just to honor their commitments to assigned families . " the u.s. ambassador to bucharest described the law as a " tragedy " which punishes thousands of childless couples who have a legitimate wish to provide one of romania 's 50,000 orphans with a home and a higher standard of living in the u.s. but romanian officials are keen to end the perception that romania is a country that profits from the export of its own children .
" this law shows that our children are not for sale , that they are better off in romania , " florin iordache , a member of parliament for the ruling social democrat party , told reuters news agency . ceaucescu 's legacy international adoptions in romania boomed in 1989 after communist dictator nicolae ceaucescu was ousted from government and television pictures of children living in squalid conditions in orphanages were beamed around the world .
under ceaucescu 's iron-fisted rule , an estimated 100,000 children were confined to orphanages that looked more like prisons .
they were the products of his ban on contraception and abortion . the adoption system quickly became awash in corruption .
private adoption agencies were free to charge their own fees for arranging adoptions , usually ranging between € 7,500 -lrb- $ 9,000 -rrb- and € 25,000 -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- . earlier this month , baroness emma nicholson , the european parliament 's special envoy for romania , criticized the country for " persistent abandonment of children , child abuse and neglect , international adoption and child trafficking . " her report , meant to assess romania 's readiness to join the eu , said that the country 's " extreme poverty can not be addressed by the sale of … children . " nicholson was said to be " delighted " at the romanian government 's decision to ban foreign adoptions . the ban , which will take effect at the beginning of next year , replaces a moratorium on foreign adoptions imposed three years ago , but which was widely ignored . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stolen youth : child prostitution plagues german-czech border the united nations children 's agency says child prostitution is rising across the german border in the czech republic .

the u.s. says the ban goes too far . for thousands of childless couples in western europe and north america , the dream of adopting a romanian child is over .
for the estimated 50,000 children still languishing in romania 's orphanages , their chances of finding a family have shrunk considerably . but the european union said the new law banning foreign adoptions is meant to better protect romania 's orphans , as many of the children supposedly destined for adoption were instead being trafficked into prostitution or the illegal organ trade . romania was also warned by the eu that its chances of joining the bloc in 2007 were in jeopardy if it did n't improve its record on children 's rights . romania 's new law bans all foreign adoptions , except by the child 's grandparents , and only then after all efforts have been made to place the child with a romanian family .

they were the products of his ban on contraception and abortion . the adoption system quickly became awash in corruption .
private adoption agencies were free to charge their own fees for arranging adoptions , usually ranging between € 7,500 -lrb- $ 9,000 -rrb- and € 25,000 -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- . earlier this month , baroness emma nicholson , the european parliament 's special envoy for romania , criticized the country for " persistent abandonment of children , child abuse and neglect , international adoption and child trafficking .

chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum europe -pipe- 22.06.2004 militants raid russian region of ingushetia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aftermath of blast at ingushetia 's federal security service armed clashes erupted near russia 's separatist republic of chechnya overnight tuesday as militants stormed police targets in neighboring ingushetia , killing almost 50 people and wounding dozens , officials said . the incursion was the most spectacular military operation by chechen rebels outside the war-torn republic in years . forty-eight people , both civilians and policemen , were killed in the fighting in the southern russian province of ingushetia , russia 's interfax news agency quoted a local police official as saying .
ingushetia 's interior minister , abukar kostoyev , was among those killed , interfax reported . " among the casualties are 18 policemen and 28 civilians , " the ingush interior ministry 's top spokesman yakhya khadziyev said .
the bodies of two dead rebels had been discovered and were being identified .
he added that another 30 people had been wounded in the fighting . government posts targeted clashes between some 200 rebels and law enforcement authorities broke out in at least three towns in ingushetia , which houses tens of thousands of refugees who fled the fighting in chechnya and where many chechen rebels have taken shelter .
the fighters seized the interior ministry in nazran , ingushetia 's largest city , and attacked border guards ' posts there as well as in two villages near the border with chechnya , according to regional emergency officials . " they tried to take over the interior ministry and several of the regional police stations , " umar sapraviyev , an official with ingushetia 's representation in moscow told a radio station in the russian capital . terrified residents spent the night cowering in their homes to sounds of automatic gunfire , mortars , grenade launchers , and helicopters flying overhead , witnesses told afp news agency . russian authorities sent in troops shortly after dawn on tuesday .

but according to an investigation carried out by kvb , an association representing doctors who have patients with public insurance , online prescriptions are just as expensive as traditional ones picked up in the corner bricks-and-mortar pharmacy .
" the results were clear : -lrb- internet -rrb- merchants are orienting themselves to the penny to already existing price guidelines for medications , " dr. leonhard hansen , a deputy director at kvb , told reporters at a news conference on monday .
those guidelines are used by traditional pharmacies to set their prices .
patients save by buying online , according to kvb , only when it comes to over-the-counter medications .
" then the savings are from ten to 30 percent , " said hansen .
the government had hoped that opening up the market for medications would create a competitive environment that would bring the cost of prescription drugs down .
" a price war that we had hoped for following the health reforms has failed to appear , " said hansen .
fewer doctor 's visits but another of the controversial health care reforms that went into effect this year seems to be having the intended effect , according to kvb .
starting january 1 , patients are required to pay a € 10 fee per quarter for doctor 's office visits .
in the first quarter of the year , studies have shown that 10 percent fewer people went to the doctor .
the trend has continued into the second quarter , according to a surveys of various doctors ' practices around the country .
" people are n't going to the doctor for just any little trifle anymore , " klaus vater , a spokesman for the health ministry , told reporters .
despite the fall in trips to the doctor , hansen said he did not see any of the " horror scenarios " critics of the reforms had painted in the lead-up to the changes .
" we have n't noticed any cuts in the level of basic care , " he said .
he warned , however , that because of the new fees , poor people were seeking a doctor 's help less than they should , thereby putting off treatment and potentially suffering more serious health problems over the long term .
such developments , he said , would have to be watched over the long run .
meeting savings goals ?
although the health ministry has pointed to successes , the hoped-for overall savings will likely not materialize , according to kvb .
when the reforms were passed , health minister ulla schmidt estimated savings of up to € 3 billion on medications alone in 2004 .
but hansen said a more realistic forecast would be somewhere in the neighborhood of € 1.4 billion and € 1.8 billion for this year .
the health ministry has rejected the lower estimate and is sticking by its forecast . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a mouse-click to medicine until now , germany has banned the sale of medicines by mail order .

an accomplice was jailed for 25 years and a fourth defendant for five .

" a good piece of justice has finally been done , " said her lawyer , celine parisse . the 47-year-old dutroux had once again protested his innocence in a last session of pleading before the sentences were pronounced , but was slapped down by goux . " marc dutroux , the verdict is clear , " the judge , visibly agitated , said after a 10-minute intervention by dutroux , who nevertheless vowed to battle to the " end of his days " to prove his innocence . goux handed down the sentences in an emotionless voice to a hushed courtroom , at the end of a lengthy summation of a series of crimes that traumatised belgium and shocked the world . for dutroux , dubbed by the press " belgium 's most hated man , " life will most likely mean life without prospect of parole . but for his ex-wife michelle martin , 44 , and his 33-year-old " faithful companion " michel lelievre , their respective terms of 30 and 25 years could in theory be cut short with good behavior . the fourth defendant , michel nihoul , 63 , was jailed for five years for drug-dealing and fraud .

but according to an investigation carried out by kvb , an association representing doctors who have patients with public insurance , online prescriptions are just as expensive as traditional ones picked up in the corner bricks-and-mortar pharmacy .
" the results were clear : -lrb- internet -rrb- merchants are orienting themselves to the penny to already existing price guidelines for medications , " dr. leonhard hansen , a deputy director at kvb , told reporters at a news conference on monday .
those guidelines are used by traditional pharmacies to set their prices .
patients save by buying online , according to kvb , only when it comes to over-the-counter medications .
" then the savings are from ten to 30 percent , " said hansen .
the government had hoped that opening up the market for medications would create a competitive environment that would bring the cost of prescription drugs down .
" a price war that we had hoped for following the health reforms has failed to appear , " said hansen .
fewer doctor 's visits but another of the controversial health care reforms that went into effect this year seems to be having the intended effect , according to kvb .
starting january 1 , patients are required to pay a € 10 fee per quarter for doctor 's office visits .
in the first quarter of the year , studies have shown that 10 percent fewer people went to the doctor .
the trend has continued into the second quarter , according to a surveys of various doctors ' practices around the country .
" people are n't going to the doctor for just any little trifle anymore , " klaus vater , a spokesman for the health ministry , told reporters .
despite the fall in trips to the doctor , hansen said he did not see any of the " horror scenarios " critics of the reforms had painted in the lead-up to the changes .
" we have n't noticed any cuts in the level of basic care , " he said .
he warned , however , that because of the new fees , poor people were seeking a doctor 's help less than they should , thereby putting off treatment and potentially suffering more serious health problems over the long term .
such developments , he said , would have to be watched over the long run .
meeting savings goals ?
although the health ministry has pointed to successes , the hoped-for overall savings will likely not materialize , according to kvb .
when the reforms were passed , health minister ulla schmidt estimated savings of up to € 3 billion on medications alone in 2004 .
but hansen said a more realistic forecast would be somewhere in the neighborhood of € 1.4 billion and € 1.8 billion for this year .

german scientists have refuted a study made public by greenpeace , which claims genetically altered feed particles can make their way into milk . a german agricultural research institute took pains to explain to a worried public that components from genetically altered livestock feed are not carried over into a cow 's milk , but environmentalists at the activist group greenpeace are nonetheless saying more studies should be carried out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a study done in 2001 was recently brought to light by greenpeace , which claims the test showed that particles of genetically altered feed had made its way into cows ' milk .
a case of contamination ?
scientists from a munich-based research group who carried out the tests said there were indeed genetically altered particles in the milk - but said the results were scientifically irrelevant , because the test samples were most likely contaminated .
professor heinrich meyer of the weihenstephan center for the study of milk and food products at munich 's technical university , explained that in the 2001 study , samples taken from the association of milk and milk products in hessen were sent to the weihenstephan research institute , and " showed surprising indications of traces " of genetically altered materials .
but the testing samples had been sent by a private party and bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were n't part of a scientific study , meyer explained .
thus , the quality of the samples was unclear , making the study irrelevant , he said .
the result did prompt the weihenstephan institute to set up its own follow-up studies in 2003 , which failed to repeat the initial findings .
careful about samples " the results of the first study results have no basis , because there was no decent control group , " weihenstephan 's meyer told dw-world .
and the results had never been published because the conditions on the farm where the milk had been taken from were unknown .
" it is always a problem to work with samples from third parties .
you ca n't publish material like that , " she said .
greenpeace agrees that the particles found in 2001 could have gotten into the milk via feed-dust in the milking barn .
but greenpeace 's genetic-technology expert henning strodthoff told news agencies that they also could have traveled through the intestinal wall of the cow , and via the blood into the milk .
" that would be one possibility , but in the end , we really do n't know , " he said .

german scientists have refuted a study made public by greenpeace , which claims genetically altered feed particles can make their way into milk . a german agricultural research institute took pains to explain to a worried public that components from genetically altered livestock feed are not carried over into a cow 's milk , but environmentalists at the activist group greenpeace are nonetheless saying more studies should be carried out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a study done in 2001 was recently brought to light by greenpeace , which claims the test showed that particles of genetically altered feed had made its way into cows ' milk .
a case of contamination ?
scientists from a munich-based research group who carried out the tests said there were indeed genetically altered particles in the milk - but said the results were scientifically irrelevant , because the test samples were most likely contaminated .
professor heinrich meyer of the weihenstephan center for the study of milk and food products at munich 's technical university , explained that in the 2001 study , samples taken from the association of milk and milk products in hessen were sent to the weihenstephan research institute , and " showed surprising indications of traces " of genetically altered materials .
but the testing samples had been sent by a private party and bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were n't part of a scientific study , meyer explained .
thus , the quality of the samples was unclear , making the study irrelevant , he said .
the result did prompt the weihenstephan institute to set up its own follow-up studies in 2003 , which failed to repeat the initial findings .
careful about samples " the results of the first study results have no basis , because there was no decent control group , " weihenstephan 's meyer told dw-world .
and the results had never been published because the conditions on the farm where the milk had been taken from were unknown .
" it is always a problem to work with samples from third parties .
you ca n't publish material like that , " she said .
greenpeace agrees that the particles found in 2001 could have gotten into the milk via feed-dust in the milking barn .
but greenpeace 's genetic-technology expert henning strodthoff told news agencies that they also could have traveled through the intestinal wall of the cow , and via the blood into the milk .

the fighters seized the interior ministry in nazran , ingushetia 's largest city , and attacked border guards ' posts there as well as in two villages near the border with chechnya , according to regional emergency officials .

an accomplice was jailed for 25 years and a fourth defendant for five .

" a good piece of justice has finally been done , " said her lawyer , celine parisse . the 47-year-old dutroux had once again protested his innocence in a last session of pleading before the sentences were pronounced , but was slapped down by goux . " marc dutroux , the verdict is clear , " the judge , visibly agitated , said after a 10-minute intervention by dutroux , who nevertheless vowed to battle to the " end of his days " to prove his innocence . goux handed down the sentences in an emotionless voice to a hushed courtroom , at the end of a lengthy summation of a series of crimes that traumatised belgium and shocked the world . for dutroux , dubbed by the press " belgium 's most hated man , " life will most likely mean life without prospect of parole . but for his ex-wife michelle martin , 44 , and his 33-year-old " faithful companion " michel lelievre , their respective terms of 30 and 25 years could in theory be cut short with good behavior . the fourth defendant , michel nihoul , 63 , was jailed for five years for drug-dealing and fraud .

the u.s. says the ban goes too far . for thousands of childless couples in western europe and north america , the dream of adopting a romanian child is over .
for the estimated 50,000 children still languishing in romania 's orphanages , their chances of finding a family have shrunk considerably . but the european union said the new law banning foreign adoptions is meant to better protect romania 's orphans , as many of the children supposedly destined for adoption were instead being trafficked into prostitution or the illegal organ trade . romania was also warned by the eu that its chances of joining the bloc in 2007 were in jeopardy if it did n't improve its record on children 's rights . romania 's new law bans all foreign adoptions , except by the child 's grandparents , and only then after all efforts have been made to place the child with a romanian family .
critics of the new law say it 's highly unlikely that the government will find enough romanian families with which to place the orphans . freeze on adoptions in progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian president ion iliescu in addition , the law is likely to end hundreds of foreign adoptions that are already in progress .
representatives of the hundreds of american families caught up in the lengthy adoption procedures are hoping to persuade romanian president ion iliescu -lrb- photo -rrb- to allow adoptions already underway to proceed . " it 's not up to us to tell romania how to write their laws , " said elaine macewen , executive director of nobody 's children , a north carolina-based group that helps children living in romanian orphanages .
" we 're asking them just to honor their commitments to assigned families . " the u.s. ambassador to bucharest described the law as a " tragedy " which punishes thousands of childless couples who have a legitimate wish to provide one of romania 's 50,000 orphans with a home and a higher standard of living in the u.s. but romanian officials are keen to end the perception that romania is a country that profits from the export of its own children .
" this law shows that our children are not for sale , that they are better off in romania , " florin iordache , a member of parliament for the ruling social democrat party , told reuters news agency . ceaucescu 's legacy international adoptions in romania boomed in 1989 after communist dictator nicolae ceaucescu was ousted from government and television pictures of children living in squalid conditions in orphanages were beamed around the world .
under ceaucescu 's iron-fisted rule , an estimated 100,000 children were confined to orphanages that looked more like prisons .
they were the products of his ban on contraception and abortion . the adoption system quickly became awash in corruption .
private adoption agencies were free to charge their own fees for arranging adoptions , usually ranging between € 7,500 -lrb- $ 9,000 -rrb- and € 25,000 -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- . earlier this month , baroness emma nicholson , the european parliament 's special envoy for romania , criticized the country for " persistent abandonment of children , child abuse and neglect , international adoption and child trafficking . " her report , meant to assess romania 's readiness to join the eu , said that the country 's " extreme poverty can not be addressed by the sale of … children . " nicholson was said to be " delighted " at the romanian government 's decision to ban foreign adoptions . the ban , which will take effect at the beginning of next year , replaces a moratorium on foreign adoptions imposed three years ago , but which was widely ignored . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stolen youth : child prostitution plagues german-czech border the united nations children 's agency says child prostitution is rising across the german border in the czech republic .

" the results were clear : -lrb- internet -rrb- merchants are orienting themselves to the penny to already existing price guidelines for medications , " dr. leonhard hansen , a deputy director at kvb , told reporters at a news conference on monday .

the u.s. says the ban goes too far . for thousands of childless couples in western europe and north america , the dream of adopting a romanian child is over .
for the estimated 50,000 children still languishing in romania 's orphanages , their chances of finding a family have shrunk considerably . but the european union said the new law banning foreign adoptions is meant to better protect romania 's orphans , as many of the children supposedly destined for adoption were instead being trafficked into prostitution or the illegal organ trade . romania was also warned by the eu that its chances of joining the bloc in 2007 were in jeopardy if it did n't improve its record on children 's rights . romania 's new law bans all foreign adoptions , except by the child 's grandparents , and only then after all efforts have been made to place the child with a romanian family .

representatives of the hundreds of american families caught up in the lengthy adoption procedures are hoping to persuade romanian president ion iliescu -lrb- photo -rrb- to allow adoptions already underway to proceed . " it 's not up to us to tell romania how to write their laws , " said elaine macewen , executive director of nobody 's children , a north carolina-based group that helps children living in romanian orphanages .
" we 're asking them just to honor their commitments to assigned families . " the u.s. ambassador to bucharest described the law as a " tragedy " which punishes thousands of childless couples who have a legitimate wish to provide one of romania 's 50,000 orphans with a home and a higher standard of living in the u.s. but romanian officials are keen to end the perception that romania is a country that profits from the export of its own children .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.06.2004 internet pharmacies not bringing expected savings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online pharmacies are following the lead of their traditional counterparts although ordering prescriptions over the internet has been made legal in germany as part of the reform measures instituted to help the burdened public health system , the expected savings have n't materialized . internet pharmacies were supposed to offer a double benefit : not only would patients save money with access to cheaper medications ; germany 's overburdened public health system - estimated to be between € 6 and € 14 billion -lrb- $ 7.3 and $ 16.9 billion -rrb- in debt - would save too .
but according to an investigation carried out by kvb , an association representing doctors who have patients with public insurance , online prescriptions are just as expensive as traditional ones picked up in the corner bricks-and-mortar pharmacy .
" the results were clear : -lrb- internet -rrb- merchants are orienting themselves to the penny to already existing price guidelines for medications , " dr. leonhard hansen , a deputy director at kvb , told reporters at a news conference on monday .
those guidelines are used by traditional pharmacies to set their prices .
patients save by buying online , according to kvb , only when it comes to over-the-counter medications .
" then the savings are from ten to 30 percent , " said hansen .
the government had hoped that opening up the market for medications would create a competitive environment that would bring the cost of prescription drugs down .
" a price war that we had hoped for following the health reforms has failed to appear , " said hansen .
fewer doctor 's visits but another of the controversial health care reforms that went into effect this year seems to be having the intended effect , according to kvb .
starting january 1 , patients are required to pay a € 10 fee per quarter for doctor 's office visits .
in the first quarter of the year , studies have shown that 10 percent fewer people went to the doctor .
the trend has continued into the second quarter , according to a surveys of various doctors ' practices around the country .
" people are n't going to the doctor for just any little trifle anymore , " klaus vater , a spokesman for the health ministry , told reporters .
despite the fall in trips to the doctor , hansen said he did not see any of the " horror scenarios " critics of the reforms had painted in the lead-up to the changes .
" we have n't noticed any cuts in the level of basic care , " he said .
he warned , however , that because of the new fees , poor people were seeking a doctor 's help less than they should , thereby putting off treatment and potentially suffering more serious health problems over the long term .
such developments , he said , would have to be watched over the long run .
meeting savings goals ?
although the health ministry has pointed to successes , the hoped-for overall savings will likely not materialize , according to kvb .
when the reforms were passed , health minister ulla schmidt estimated savings of up to € 3 billion on medications alone in 2004 .
but hansen said a more realistic forecast would be somewhere in the neighborhood of € 1.4 billion and € 1.8 billion for this year .
the health ministry has rejected the lower estimate and is sticking by its forecast . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a mouse-click to medicine until now , germany has banned the sale of medicines by mail order .

an accomplice was jailed for 25 years and a fourth defendant for five .

the u.s. says the ban goes too far . for thousands of childless couples in western europe and north america , the dream of adopting a romanian child is over .
for the estimated 50,000 children still languishing in romania 's orphanages , their chances of finding a family have shrunk considerably . but the european union said the new law banning foreign adoptions is meant to better protect romania 's orphans , as many of the children supposedly destined for adoption were instead being trafficked into prostitution or the illegal organ trade . romania was also warned by the eu that its chances of joining the bloc in 2007 were in jeopardy if it did n't improve its record on children 's rights . romania 's new law bans all foreign adoptions , except by the child 's grandparents , and only then after all efforts have been made to place the child with a romanian family .
critics of the new law say it 's highly unlikely that the government will find enough romanian families with which to place the orphans . freeze on adoptions in progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian president ion iliescu in addition , the law is likely to end hundreds of foreign adoptions that are already in progress .
representatives of the hundreds of american families caught up in the lengthy adoption procedures are hoping to persuade romanian president ion iliescu -lrb- photo -rrb- to allow adoptions already underway to proceed . " it 's not up to us to tell romania how to write their laws , " said elaine macewen , executive director of nobody 's children , a north carolina-based group that helps children living in romanian orphanages .
" we 're asking them just to honor their commitments to assigned families . " the u.s. ambassador to bucharest described the law as a " tragedy " which punishes thousands of childless couples who have a legitimate wish to provide one of romania 's 50,000 orphans with a home and a higher standard of living in the u.s. but romanian officials are keen to end the perception that romania is a country that profits from the export of its own children .
" this law shows that our children are not for sale , that they are better off in romania , " florin iordache , a member of parliament for the ruling social democrat party , told reuters news agency . ceaucescu 's legacy international adoptions in romania boomed in 1989 after communist dictator nicolae ceaucescu was ousted from government and television pictures of children living in squalid conditions in orphanages were beamed around the world .
under ceaucescu 's iron-fisted rule , an estimated 100,000 children were confined to orphanages that looked more like prisons .
they were the products of his ban on contraception and abortion . the adoption system quickly became awash in corruption .
private adoption agencies were free to charge their own fees for arranging adoptions , usually ranging between € 7,500 -lrb- $ 9,000 -rrb- and € 25,000 -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- . earlier this month , baroness emma nicholson , the european parliament 's special envoy for romania , criticized the country for " persistent abandonment of children , child abuse and neglect , international adoption and child trafficking . " her report , meant to assess romania 's readiness to join the eu , said that the country 's " extreme poverty can not be addressed by the sale of … children . " nicholson was said to be " delighted " at the romanian government 's decision to ban foreign adoptions . the ban , which will take effect at the beginning of next year , replaces a moratorium on foreign adoptions imposed three years ago , but which was widely ignored . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stolen youth : child prostitution plagues german-czech border the united nations children 's agency says child prostitution is rising across the german border in the czech republic .

but according to an investigation carried out by kvb , an association representing doctors who have patients with public insurance , online prescriptions are just as expensive as traditional ones picked up in the corner bricks-and-mortar pharmacy .
" the results were clear : -lrb- internet -rrb- merchants are orienting themselves to the penny to already existing price guidelines for medications , " dr. leonhard hansen , a deputy director at kvb , told reporters at a news conference on monday .
those guidelines are used by traditional pharmacies to set their prices .
patients save by buying online , according to kvb , only when it comes to over-the-counter medications .
" then the savings are from ten to 30 percent , " said hansen .
the government had hoped that opening up the market for medications would create a competitive environment that would bring the cost of prescription drugs down .

the trend has continued into the second quarter , according to a surveys of various doctors ' practices around the country .
" people are n't going to the doctor for just any little trifle anymore , " klaus vater , a spokesman for the health ministry , told reporters .
despite the fall in trips to the doctor , hansen said he did not see any of the " horror scenarios " critics of the reforms had painted in the lead-up to the changes .
" we have n't noticed any cuts in the level of basic care , " he said .
he warned , however , that because of the new fees , poor people were seeking a doctor 's help less than they should , thereby putting off treatment and potentially suffering more serious health problems over the long term .
such developments , he said , would have to be watched over the long run .
meeting savings goals ?
although the health ministry has pointed to successes , the hoped-for overall savings will likely not materialize , according to kvb .
when the reforms were passed , health minister ulla schmidt estimated savings of up to € 3 billion on medications alone in 2004 .

fewer doctor 's visits but another of the controversial health care reforms that went into effect this year seems to be having the intended effect , according to kvb .

" we have n't noticed any cuts in the level of basic care , " he said .
he warned , however , that because of the new fees , poor people were seeking a doctor 's help less than they should , thereby putting off treatment and potentially suffering more serious health problems over the long term .
such developments , he said , would have to be watched over the long run .

german scientists have refuted a study made public by greenpeace , which claims genetically altered feed particles can make their way into milk . a german agricultural research institute took pains to explain to a worried public that components from genetically altered livestock feed are not carried over into a cow 's milk , but environmentalists at the activist group greenpeace are nonetheless saying more studies should be carried out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a study done in 2001 was recently brought to light by greenpeace , which claims the test showed that particles of genetically altered feed had made its way into cows ' milk .
a case of contamination ?
scientists from a munich-based research group who carried out the tests said there were indeed genetically altered particles in the milk - but said the results were scientifically irrelevant , because the test samples were most likely contaminated .
professor heinrich meyer of the weihenstephan center for the study of milk and food products at munich 's technical university , explained that in the 2001 study , samples taken from the association of milk and milk products in hessen were sent to the weihenstephan research institute , and " showed surprising indications of traces " of genetically altered materials .
but the testing samples had been sent by a private party and bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were n't part of a scientific study , meyer explained .
thus , the quality of the samples was unclear , making the study irrelevant , he said .
the result did prompt the weihenstephan institute to set up its own follow-up studies in 2003 , which failed to repeat the initial findings .
careful about samples " the results of the first study results have no basis , because there was no decent control group , " weihenstephan 's meyer told dw-world .
and the results had never been published because the conditions on the farm where the milk had been taken from were unknown .
" it is always a problem to work with samples from third parties .
you ca n't publish material like that , " she said .
greenpeace agrees that the particles found in 2001 could have gotten into the milk via feed-dust in the milking barn .
but greenpeace 's genetic-technology expert henning strodthoff told news agencies that they also could have traveled through the intestinal wall of the cow , and via the blood into the milk .
" that would be one possibility , but in the end , we really do n't know , " he said .

german scientists have refuted a study made public by greenpeace , which claims genetically altered feed particles can make their way into milk . a german agricultural research institute took pains to explain to a worried public that components from genetically altered livestock feed are not carried over into a cow 's milk , but environmentalists at the activist group greenpeace are nonetheless saying more studies should be carried out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a study done in 2001 was recently brought to light by greenpeace , which claims the test showed that particles of genetically altered feed had made its way into cows ' milk .
a case of contamination ?
scientists from a munich-based research group who carried out the tests said there were indeed genetically altered particles in the milk - but said the results were scientifically irrelevant , because the test samples were most likely contaminated .
professor heinrich meyer of the weihenstephan center for the study of milk and food products at munich 's technical university , explained that in the 2001 study , samples taken from the association of milk and milk products in hessen were sent to the weihenstephan research institute , and " showed surprising indications of traces " of genetically altered materials .
but the testing samples had been sent by a private party and bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were n't part of a scientific study , meyer explained .
thus , the quality of the samples was unclear , making the study irrelevant , he said .
the result did prompt the weihenstephan institute to set up its own follow-up studies in 2003 , which failed to repeat the initial findings .
careful about samples " the results of the first study results have no basis , because there was no decent control group , " weihenstephan 's meyer told dw-world .
and the results had never been published because the conditions on the farm where the milk had been taken from were unknown .
" it is always a problem to work with samples from third parties .
you ca n't publish material like that , " she said .
greenpeace agrees that the particles found in 2001 could have gotten into the milk via feed-dust in the milking barn .
but greenpeace 's genetic-technology expert henning strodthoff told news agencies that they also could have traveled through the intestinal wall of the cow , and via the blood into the milk .
" that would be one possibility , but in the end , we really do n't know , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.06.2004 romania bans foreign adoptions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a romanian family will do the romanian government has passed a law banning foreign adoptions of its orphans after pressure from the eu to curb abuses of the system by child traffickers .
the u.s. says the ban goes too far . for thousands of childless couples in western europe and north america , the dream of adopting a romanian child is over .
for the estimated 50,000 children still languishing in romania 's orphanages , their chances of finding a family have shrunk considerably . but the european union said the new law banning foreign adoptions is meant to better protect romania 's orphans , as many of the children supposedly destined for adoption were instead being trafficked into prostitution or the illegal organ trade . romania was also warned by the eu that its chances of joining the bloc in 2007 were in jeopardy if it did n't improve its record on children 's rights . romania 's new law bans all foreign adoptions , except by the child 's grandparents , and only then after all efforts have been made to place the child with a romanian family .
critics of the new law say it 's highly unlikely that the government will find enough romanian families with which to place the orphans . freeze on adoptions in progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian president ion iliescu in addition , the law is likely to end hundreds of foreign adoptions that are already in progress .
representatives of the hundreds of american families caught up in the lengthy adoption procedures are hoping to persuade romanian president ion iliescu -lrb- photo -rrb- to allow adoptions already underway to proceed . " it 's not up to us to tell romania how to write their laws , " said elaine macewen , executive director of nobody 's children , a north carolina-based group that helps children living in romanian orphanages .
" we 're asking them just to honor their commitments to assigned families . " the u.s. ambassador to bucharest described the law as a " tragedy " which punishes thousands of childless couples who have a legitimate wish to provide one of romania 's 50,000 orphans with a home and a higher standard of living in the u.s. but romanian officials are keen to end the perception that romania is a country that profits from the export of its own children .
" this law shows that our children are not for sale , that they are better off in romania , " florin iordache , a member of parliament for the ruling social democrat party , told reuters news agency . ceaucescu 's legacy international adoptions in romania boomed in 1989 after communist dictator nicolae ceaucescu was ousted from government and television pictures of children living in squalid conditions in orphanages were beamed around the world .
under ceaucescu 's iron-fisted rule , an estimated 100,000 children were confined to orphanages that looked more like prisons .
they were the products of his ban on contraception and abortion . the adoption system quickly became awash in corruption .
private adoption agencies were free to charge their own fees for arranging adoptions , usually ranging between € 7,500 -lrb- $ 9,000 -rrb- and € 25,000 -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- . earlier this month , baroness emma nicholson , the european parliament 's special envoy for romania , criticized the country for " persistent abandonment of children , child abuse and neglect , international adoption and child trafficking . " her report , meant to assess romania 's readiness to join the eu , said that the country 's " extreme poverty can not be addressed by the sale of … children . " nicholson was said to be " delighted " at the romanian government 's decision to ban foreign adoptions . the ban , which will take effect at the beginning of next year , replaces a moratorium on foreign adoptions imposed three years ago , but which was widely ignored . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stolen youth : child prostitution plagues german-czech border the united nations children 's agency says child prostitution is rising across the german border in the czech republic .

german scientists have refuted a study made public by greenpeace , which claims genetically altered feed particles can make their way into milk . a german agricultural research institute took pains to explain to a worried public that components from genetically altered livestock feed are not carried over into a cow 's milk , but environmentalists at the activist group greenpeace are nonetheless saying more studies should be carried out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a study done in 2001 was recently brought to light by greenpeace , which claims the test showed that particles of genetically altered feed had made its way into cows ' milk .
a case of contamination ?
scientists from a munich-based research group who carried out the tests said there were indeed genetically altered particles in the milk - but said the results were scientifically irrelevant , because the test samples were most likely contaminated .
professor heinrich meyer of the weihenstephan center for the study of milk and food products at munich 's technical university , explained that in the 2001 study , samples taken from the association of milk and milk products in hessen were sent to the weihenstephan research institute , and " showed surprising indications of traces " of genetically altered materials .
but the testing samples had been sent by a private party and bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were n't part of a scientific study , meyer explained .
thus , the quality of the samples was unclear , making the study irrelevant , he said .
the result did prompt the weihenstephan institute to set up its own follow-up studies in 2003 , which failed to repeat the initial findings .
careful about samples " the results of the first study results have no basis , because there was no decent control group , " weihenstephan 's meyer told dw-world .
and the results had never been published because the conditions on the farm where the milk had been taken from were unknown .
" it is always a problem to work with samples from third parties .
you ca n't publish material like that , " she said .
greenpeace agrees that the particles found in 2001 could have gotten into the milk via feed-dust in the milking barn .
but greenpeace 's genetic-technology expert henning strodthoff told news agencies that they also could have traveled through the intestinal wall of the cow , and via the blood into the milk .
" that would be one possibility , but in the end , we really do n't know , " he said .

professor heinrich meyer of the weihenstephan center for the study of milk and food products at munich 's technical university , explained that in the 2001 study , samples taken from the association of milk and milk products in hessen were sent to the weihenstephan research institute , and " showed surprising indications of traces " of genetically altered materials .
but the testing samples had been sent by a private party and bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were n't part of a scientific study , meyer explained .
thus , the quality of the samples was unclear , making the study irrelevant , he said .
the result did prompt the weihenstephan institute to set up its own follow-up studies in 2003 , which failed to repeat the initial findings .
careful about samples " the results of the first study results have no basis , because there was no decent control group , " weihenstephan 's meyer told dw-world .
and the results had never been published because the conditions on the farm where the milk had been taken from were unknown .
" it is always a problem to work with samples from third parties .
you ca n't publish material like that , " she said .
greenpeace agrees that the particles found in 2001 could have gotten into the milk via feed-dust in the milking barn .
but greenpeace 's genetic-technology expert henning strodthoff told news agencies that they also could have traveled through the intestinal wall of the cow , and via the blood into the milk .
" that would be one possibility , but in the end , we really do n't know , " he said .
germany has a popular brand of milk products called weihenstephan , but the company has no connection to the research organization or this study . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament approves gene-food law the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations .

german scientists have refuted a study made public by greenpeace , which claims genetically altered feed particles can make their way into milk . a german agricultural research institute took pains to explain to a worried public that components from genetically altered livestock feed are not carried over into a cow 's milk , but environmentalists at the activist group greenpeace are nonetheless saying more studies should be carried out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a study done in 2001 was recently brought to light by greenpeace , which claims the test showed that particles of genetically altered feed had made its way into cows ' milk .
a case of contamination ?
scientists from a munich-based research group who carried out the tests said there were indeed genetically altered particles in the milk - but said the results were scientifically irrelevant , because the test samples were most likely contaminated .
professor heinrich meyer of the weihenstephan center for the study of milk and food products at munich 's technical university , explained that in the 2001 study , samples taken from the association of milk and milk products in hessen were sent to the weihenstephan research institute , and " showed surprising indications of traces " of genetically altered materials .
but the testing samples had been sent by a private party and bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were n't part of a scientific study , meyer explained .
thus , the quality of the samples was unclear , making the study irrelevant , he said .
the result did prompt the weihenstephan institute to set up its own follow-up studies in 2003 , which failed to repeat the initial findings .
careful about samples " the results of the first study results have no basis , because there was no decent control group , " weihenstephan 's meyer told dw-world .
and the results had never been published because the conditions on the farm where the milk had been taken from were unknown .
" it is always a problem to work with samples from third parties .
you ca n't publish material like that , " she said .
greenpeace agrees that the particles found in 2001 could have gotten into the milk via feed-dust in the milking barn .
but greenpeace 's genetic-technology expert henning strodthoff told news agencies that they also could have traveled through the intestinal wall of the cow , and via the blood into the milk .
" that would be one possibility , but in the end , we really do n't know , " he said .

german scientists have refuted a study made public by greenpeace , which claims genetically altered feed particles can make their way into milk . a german agricultural research institute took pains to explain to a worried public that components from genetically altered livestock feed are not carried over into a cow 's milk , but environmentalists at the activist group greenpeace are nonetheless saying more studies should be carried out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a study done in 2001 was recently brought to light by greenpeace , which claims the test showed that particles of genetically altered feed had made its way into cows ' milk .
a case of contamination ?
scientists from a munich-based research group who carried out the tests said there were indeed genetically altered particles in the milk - but said the results were scientifically irrelevant , because the test samples were most likely contaminated .
professor heinrich meyer of the weihenstephan center for the study of milk and food products at munich 's technical university , explained that in the 2001 study , samples taken from the association of milk and milk products in hessen were sent to the weihenstephan research institute , and " showed surprising indications of traces " of genetically altered materials .
but the testing samples had been sent by a private party and bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were n't part of a scientific study , meyer explained .
thus , the quality of the samples was unclear , making the study irrelevant , he said .
the result did prompt the weihenstephan institute to set up its own follow-up studies in 2003 , which failed to repeat the initial findings .
careful about samples " the results of the first study results have no basis , because there was no decent control group , " weihenstephan 's meyer told dw-world .
and the results had never been published because the conditions on the farm where the milk had been taken from were unknown .
" it is always a problem to work with samples from third parties .

but according to an investigation carried out by kvb , an association representing doctors who have patients with public insurance , online prescriptions are just as expensive as traditional ones picked up in the corner bricks-and-mortar pharmacy .
" the results were clear : -lrb- internet -rrb- merchants are orienting themselves to the penny to already existing price guidelines for medications , " dr. leonhard hansen , a deputy director at kvb , told reporters at a news conference on monday .
those guidelines are used by traditional pharmacies to set their prices .
patients save by buying online , according to kvb , only when it comes to over-the-counter medications .
" then the savings are from ten to 30 percent , " said hansen .
the government had hoped that opening up the market for medications would create a competitive environment that would bring the cost of prescription drugs down .
" a price war that we had hoped for following the health reforms has failed to appear , " said hansen .
fewer doctor 's visits but another of the controversial health care reforms that went into effect this year seems to be having the intended effect , according to kvb .
starting january 1 , patients are required to pay a € 10 fee per quarter for doctor 's office visits .
in the first quarter of the year , studies have shown that 10 percent fewer people went to the doctor .
the trend has continued into the second quarter , according to a surveys of various doctors ' practices around the country .
" people are n't going to the doctor for just any little trifle anymore , " klaus vater , a spokesman for the health ministry , told reporters .
despite the fall in trips to the doctor , hansen said he did not see any of the " horror scenarios " critics of the reforms had painted in the lead-up to the changes .
" we have n't noticed any cuts in the level of basic care , " he said .
he warned , however , that because of the new fees , poor people were seeking a doctor 's help less than they should , thereby putting off treatment and potentially suffering more serious health problems over the long term .
such developments , he said , would have to be watched over the long run .
meeting savings goals ?
although the health ministry has pointed to successes , the hoped-for overall savings will likely not materialize , according to kvb .
when the reforms were passed , health minister ulla schmidt estimated savings of up to € 3 billion on medications alone in 2004 .
but hansen said a more realistic forecast would be somewhere in the neighborhood of € 1.4 billion and € 1.8 billion for this year .

starting january 1 , patients are required to pay a € 10 fee per quarter for doctor 's office visits .
in the first quarter of the year , studies have shown that 10 percent fewer people went to the doctor .
the trend has continued into the second quarter , according to a surveys of various doctors ' practices around the country .
" people are n't going to the doctor for just any little trifle anymore , " klaus vater , a spokesman for the health ministry , told reporters .
despite the fall in trips to the doctor , hansen said he did not see any of the " horror scenarios " critics of the reforms had painted in the lead-up to the changes .
" we have n't noticed any cuts in the level of basic care , " he said .
he warned , however , that because of the new fees , poor people were seeking a doctor 's help less than they should , thereby putting off treatment and potentially suffering more serious health problems over the long term .
such developments , he said , would have to be watched over the long run .
meeting savings goals ?
although the health ministry has pointed to successes , the hoped-for overall savings will likely not materialize , according to kvb .
when the reforms were passed , health minister ulla schmidt estimated savings of up to € 3 billion on medications alone in 2004 .
but hansen said a more realistic forecast would be somewhere in the neighborhood of € 1.4 billion and € 1.8 billion for this year .

the u.s. says the ban goes too far . for thousands of childless couples in western europe and north america , the dream of adopting a romanian child is over .
for the estimated 50,000 children still languishing in romania 's orphanages , their chances of finding a family have shrunk considerably . but the european union said the new law banning foreign adoptions is meant to better protect romania 's orphans , as many of the children supposedly destined for adoption were instead being trafficked into prostitution or the illegal organ trade . romania was also warned by the eu that its chances of joining the bloc in 2007 were in jeopardy if it did n't improve its record on children 's rights . romania 's new law bans all foreign adoptions , except by the child 's grandparents , and only then after all efforts have been made to place the child with a romanian family .
critics of the new law say it 's highly unlikely that the government will find enough romanian families with which to place the orphans . freeze on adoptions in progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian president ion iliescu in addition , the law is likely to end hundreds of foreign adoptions that are already in progress .
representatives of the hundreds of american families caught up in the lengthy adoption procedures are hoping to persuade romanian president ion iliescu -lrb- photo -rrb- to allow adoptions already underway to proceed . " it 's not up to us to tell romania how to write their laws , " said elaine macewen , executive director of nobody 's children , a north carolina-based group that helps children living in romanian orphanages .
" we 're asking them just to honor their commitments to assigned families . " the u.s. ambassador to bucharest described the law as a " tragedy " which punishes thousands of childless couples who have a legitimate wish to provide one of romania 's 50,000 orphans with a home and a higher standard of living in the u.s. but romanian officials are keen to end the perception that romania is a country that profits from the export of its own children .
" this law shows that our children are not for sale , that they are better off in romania , " florin iordache , a member of parliament for the ruling social democrat party , told reuters news agency . ceaucescu 's legacy international adoptions in romania boomed in 1989 after communist dictator nicolae ceaucescu was ousted from government and television pictures of children living in squalid conditions in orphanages were beamed around the world .
under ceaucescu 's iron-fisted rule , an estimated 100,000 children were confined to orphanages that looked more like prisons .
they were the products of his ban on contraception and abortion . the adoption system quickly became awash in corruption .
private adoption agencies were free to charge their own fees for arranging adoptions , usually ranging between € 7,500 -lrb- $ 9,000 -rrb- and € 25,000 -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- . earlier this month , baroness emma nicholson , the european parliament 's special envoy for romania , criticized the country for " persistent abandonment of children , child abuse and neglect , international adoption and child trafficking .

welcome to the story of convenience store group londis , a lively tale that includes accusations of ' fat cat ' greed , shareholder power and , hopefully , a happy ending .
londis shareholders meet on tuesday to vote on whether the company should be bought by irish retail group musgrave .
they are expected to almost universally back the takeover .
the shareholders , the majority of whom are also londis shopkeepers , are each in line to pocket about £ 31,000 from the £ 60m deal .
it will bring to an end six months of takeover to-ing and fro-ing that has seen four londis directors lose their jobs and shopkeepers successfully fight for a bigger share of the takeover windfall .
shopkeeper 's anger the saga first started last december when it was revealed that four londis directors had agreed to sell the company to musgrave for £ 40m , in a deal in which they would have pocketed £ 20m , or £ 5m each .
by contrast , the shopkeepers would have received only £ 10,000 each and , to put it mildly , they were not impressed .
their antagonism was further fuelled by the fact that londis is a mutual company , and so in theory should be run in the best financial interests of each and every member .
we believe the takeover will comfortably get the 75 % of the vote it needs john wood , editor the grocer in response , the shopkeepers formed a pressure group called londis shareholder action group -lrb- lsag -rrb- .
amid much fury and media coverage , the londis board was forced to withdraw its support for the takeover and accountancy giant kpmg was appointed to oversee an open sale .
backing however , the damage was already done for the four directors who had originally stood to get £ 5m each and in march they stood down from the board .
the four - graham white , andrew wallace , terry bedford and denise buller - will instead get a total of £ 2m in compensation - between them - for dropping their rights to the £ 20m .
a few other companies subsequently expressed an interest in taking over londis , including big food group and some former executives of rival shops group t & s stores under the name lancelot .
however , until today only musgrave , which owns budgens , made a definite offer - £ 60m , which is to be shared more equally at londis .
lancelot has since returned with a last minute offer of £ 63m , which includes buying a minority 40 % interest in londis for £ 25.2m , and leaving 60 % of the company in the hands of the shopkeepers through a share issue .
however , it is unlikely that this will be considered at this late stage .
instead the musgrave offer has the support of lsag , after the irish firm met the pressure group 's leaders and held a number of roadshows to explain its plans , including more fresh and chilled products on the shelves .
john wood , news editor of trade magazine the grocer , said his impression was that the londis shareholders will vote in favour of the musgrave takeover .
" with the main pressure group now in favour , we believe the takeover will comfortably get the 75 % of the vote it needs , " he said .
cheaper prices kishor patel , chairman of the lsag , said the £ 31,000 will mean a lot to most of the shopkeeper shareholders .
2,200 uk stores four formats - convenience , neighbourhood , supermarket , forecourt 600 own-brand products " we were originally opposed to the takeover , but musgrave has been very good and open in meeting with us to share their plans , " he said .
" it has also agreed to meet certain issues which we have brought up , such as improved fresh and chilled foods and lower prices .
" it is sad that londis will lose its mutual status , but the company needs an influx of capital that it simply does not have on its own . "
and any sadness felt by shopkeepers is likely to be offset by the prospect of a cash windfall and a happy ending to the corporate wrangling of the past six months .

computer users across the world are being invited to download and run a climate model of what may happen this century .
the test will see how predictions may change if the behaviour of the gulf stream is affected , as the film shows .
the project is the work of climate prediction .net , a consortium of uk universities and the met office . "
extreme scenarios make great films , but for practical planning we need to know how likely it is that such events will actually happen " dr mat collins , met office last september the group launched a global online effort to generate " the world 's most comprehensive probability-based forecast of 21st century climate " .
visitors to its website were able to download a unique version of the met office 's climate model , simulating several decades of global climate at a time .
that experiment has recruited 49,000 participants in 130 countries , but the new one aims to go further .
dr david frame , the project coordinator , said : " so far we have been asking people to simulate how the climate could respond to rising carbon dioxide levels .
" now we are extending the project to investigate how predictions might change if the thermo-haline circulation in the oceans were to slow down , altering the flow of the gulf stream . "
' physically plausible ' dr mat collins of the met office said : " extreme scenarios make great films , but for practical planning we need to know how likely it is that such events will actually happen . "
the university of oxford scientist leading the experiment is nick faull .
he said : " we are not trying to predict the odds on a shut-down of the thermo-haline circulation , but we are asking : ' if it did happen , what are the chances it would offset the warming due to rising greenhouse gases and cause a cooling ?
what consequences would it have for the atmosphere and oceans ? " '
anyone wanting to join the experiment can download a secure software package , including a version of the met office 's state-of-the-art climate model , from the climate prediction .net site .
each model , the organisers say , is a slightly different but " physically plausible " representation of processes going on in the atmosphere , land and near-surface ocean .
the model will run for a few weeks as a background process on an ordinary desktop computer without interfering with other computing tasks .
interactive graphics will let participants watch as their computer calculates how the weather in their model responds , first to a rise in carbon dioxide and then to a thermo-haline shut-down .
the results are finally sent back to the organisers on the internet .
carl christensen , the project 's chief computer scientist , said : " there is no way we could complete an experiment this size even using the world 's biggest supercomputer .
" the project has really captured the world 's imagination : anyone can join in . "

donald john mackay 's design , produced on a loom in a shed behind his house on harris will soon feature on thousands of pairs of nike women 's training shoes .
unable to cope on his own , mr mackay has enlisted the help of a nearby mill to meet the firm 's massive order .
experts described it as a massive boost to the ailing cottage industry .
mr mackay was first contacted by nike last september and was asked to send several pieces of his hand-woven yarn .
just a few weeks later the firm came back to request more small samples , then in march this year they contacted him with an order - the size of which left both he and his wife maureen stunned . "
it does n't just have to be grandpa 's sports jacket or suit that is made with tweed - it is a very versatile material " donald john mackay he said : " i was in the weaving shed when maureen came in to say nike had placed an order for 950m to be done by the end of may .
" i thought that was a large order for us , then she came back in and said she had got it wrong - they actually wanted 9,500m . "
mrs mackay said that after he and his wife had got over the " sheer panic " which initially struck them , they contacted the kenneth macleod mill on lewis , which agreed to help them with the order .
those in the industry believe the new product will take tweed to the height of fashion .
' younger market ' mr mackay said : " it was a fantastic order and we have had more , larger , orders come in since then .
" i was very surprised when they first suggested the idea but it 's a good thing for the industry and will hopefully capture a younger market .
" it is a good way to introduce younger people to the quality product that is harris tweed and show that it does n't just have to be grandpa 's sports jacket or suit that is made with tweed - it is a very versatile material .
" it will also carry the name around the world - not only will the trainers carry the nike logo they will also bear the harris tweed label , " he said .
it is understood the yarn will be used on several styles of women 's training shoe which will go on sale later this year .

computer users across the world are being invited to download and run a climate model of what may happen this century .
the test will see how predictions may change if the behaviour of the gulf stream is affected , as the film shows .
the project is the work of climate prediction .net , a consortium of uk universities and the met office .
extreme scenarios make great films , but for practical planning we need to know how likely it is that such events will actually happen dr mat collins , met office last september the group launched a global online effort to generate " the world 's most comprehensive probability-based forecast of 21st century climate " .
visitors to its website were able to download a unique version of the met office 's climate model , simulating several decades of global climate at a time .
that experiment has recruited 49,000 participants in 130 countries , but the new one aims to go further .
dr david frame , the project coordinator , said : " so far we have been asking people to simulate how the climate could respond to rising carbon dioxide levels .
" now we are extending the project to investigate how predictions might change if the thermo-haline circulation in the oceans were to slow down , altering the flow of the gulf stream . "

the university of oxford scientist leading the experiment is nick faull .
he said : " we are not trying to predict the odds on a shut-down of the thermo-haline circulation , but we are asking : ' if it did happen , what are the chances it would offset the warming due to rising greenhouse gases and cause a cooling ?
what consequences would it have for the atmosphere and oceans ? " '
anyone wanting to join the experiment can download a secure software package , including a version of the met office 's state-of-the-art climate model , from the climate prediction .net site .
thermo-haline circulation in the oceans could affect the gulf stream each model , the organisers say , is a slightly different but " physically plausible " representation of processes going on in the atmosphere , land and near-surface ocean .
the model will run for a few weeks as a background process on an ordinary desktop computer without interfering with other computing tasks .
interactive graphics will let participants watch as their computer calculates how the weather in their model responds , first to a rise in carbon dioxide and then to a thermo-haline shut-down .

computer users across the world are being invited to download and run a climate model of what may happen this century .
the test will see how predictions may change if the behaviour of the gulf stream is affected , as the film shows .
the project is the work of climate prediction .net , a consortium of uk universities and the met office .
extreme scenarios make great films , but for practical planning we need to know how likely it is that such events will actually happen dr mat collins , met office last september the group launched a global online effort to generate " the world 's most comprehensive probability-based forecast of 21st century climate " .
visitors to its website were able to download a unique version of the met office 's climate model , simulating several decades of global climate at a time .
that experiment has recruited 49,000 participants in 130 countries , but the new one aims to go further .
dr david frame , the project coordinator , said : " so far we have been asking people to simulate how the climate could respond to rising carbon dioxide levels .
" now we are extending the project to investigate how predictions might change if the thermo-haline circulation in the oceans were to slow down , altering the flow of the gulf stream . "
' physically plausible ' dr mat collins of the met office said : " extreme scenarios make great films , but for practical planning we need to know how likely it is that such events will actually happen . "
the university of oxford scientist leading the experiment is nick faull .
he said : " we are not trying to predict the odds on a shut-down of the thermo-haline circulation , but we are asking : ' if it did happen , what are the chances it would offset the warming due to rising greenhouse gases and cause a cooling ?
what consequences would it have for the atmosphere and oceans ? " '
anyone wanting to join the experiment can download a secure software package , including a version of the met office 's state-of-the-art climate model , from the climate prediction .net site .
thermo-haline circulation in the oceans could affect the gulf stream each model , the organisers say , is a slightly different but " physically plausible " representation of processes going on in the atmosphere , land and near-surface ocean .
the model will run for a few weeks as a background process on an ordinary desktop computer without interfering with other computing tasks .
interactive graphics will let participants watch as their computer calculates how the weather in their model responds , first to a rise in carbon dioxide and then to a thermo-haline shut-down .
the results are finally sent back to the organisers on the internet .

donald john mackay 's design , produced on a loom in a shed behind his house on harris will soon feature on thousands of pairs of nike women 's training shoes .
unable to cope on his own , mr mackay has enlisted the help of a nearby mill to meet the firm 's massive order .
experts described it as a massive boost to the ailing cottage industry .
mr mackay was first contacted by nike last september and was asked to send several pieces of his hand-woven yarn .
just a few weeks later the firm came back to request more small samples , then in march this year they contacted him with an order - the size of which left both he and his wife maureen stunned .

mrs mackay said that after he and his wife had got over the " sheer panic " which initially struck them , they contacted the kenneth macleod mill on lewis , which agreed to help them with the order .
those in the industry believe the new product will take tweed to the height of fashion .

" i was very surprised when they first suggested the idea but it 's a good thing for the industry and will hopefully capture a younger market .

industry minister lee hee-beom said most civilians had already left , with just 22 remaining .
islamic militants had threatened to kill mr kim on monday unless south korea ended its military role in iraq .
a foreign ministry spokesman said on tuesday he had " no definite answer " as to whether mr kim was still alive .
the south korean government has said it is doing all it can to secure mr kim 's release .
seoul has also said it will go ahead with plans to deploy 3,000 troops to northern iraq , to add to a force of 660 already in the country .
the troops are due to be involved in humanitarian and rebuilding work , and the area they are to be based in , near kurdish-controlled irbil , has been largely peaceful .
but the bbc 's charles scanlon in seoul says that internet chat sites suggest a majority of koreans believe their troops should not be taking part in what they see as an immoral occupation .
however , the conservative press is backing the government and says it can not surrender to terrorists .
hundreds of south koreans held candle lit vigils on monday night as they waited for news about mr kim .
family 's fear there has been no news since the expiry on monday of a deadline set by the kidnappers , who said they would kill mr kim if korean troops were not withdrawn by sunset .
kim has been working as a translator in iraq asked at a briefing on tuesday whether the hostage was still alive , foreign ministry spokesman shin bong-kil said : " we have various intelligence and information on that matter , but we can not give you a definite answer " .
mr kim 's family have pleaded with the government to rethink its policy .
south korea 's foreign minister ban ki-moon has appealed for the man 's release , saying south korea is a friend of iraq .
mr ban said south korea 's decision to send troops was to help in the rehabilitation of the country .
" we regard -lsb- ourselves as -rsb- ... friends of the iraqi people and there should be no cause for anyone to have kidnapped our national , " he said .
desperate plea in a video released by the militants on sunday , which was broadcast on arabic tv channel al-jazeera , mr kim was seen screaming : " korean soldiers , please get out of here .
i do n't want to die .
my life is important . "
the two-minute video showed the hostage surrounded by armed men wearing masks .
the tape said that the 24-hour deadline would expire at sunset -lrb- 2015 local time , 1615 gmt -rrb- on monday and that after that the korean would be executed .
a banner identified the group as jamaat al-tawhid and jihad , which is led by a leading al-qaeda member , abu musab al-zarqawi .
last month , the same group beheaded an american hostage , nick berg , and it has been responsible for a number of other attacks , including the killing of iraqi governing council head ezzedine salim .
