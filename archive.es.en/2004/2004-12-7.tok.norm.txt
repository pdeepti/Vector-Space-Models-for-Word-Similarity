the three men had been under close surveillance by german intelligence following a tip-off from kurdish agents in northern iraq . the kurdish intelligence service had passed on the telephone numbers of the three iraqis .
the numbers were found in a notebook of a kurd suspected to be an important courier for ansar al islam .
german general prosecutor kay nehm said the arrest warrants were issued because the three men are accused of belonging to a terrorist network . he admitted , however , that house searches had failed to uncover any weapons or explosives which could have suggested that the suspects were planning to kill the iraqi prime minister . “ in germany , ansar-al-islam members are known to be involved in fund-raising campaigns , human trafficking and the forging of passports and other documents , ” nehm told reporters .
“ so far we have no record of them using force or carrying out assassinations here . ” on monday , a fourth suspect of lebanese origin was set free again after initial suspicions turned out to be groundless . high political profile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily interior minister otto schily has been trying to profit politically from the events surrounding allawi ’ s visit in berlin .

schily had initiated the hard-hitting laws after the sept .
11 attacks on the united states . “ we ’ re responsible for the security of state leaders visiting us , ” he said .
“ we will do whatever we feel is required to ensure the safety of a guest .
in the case of prime minister ayad allawi , we also took all the necessary precautions and didn ’ t leave anything to chance . ” “ terrorists should know that our intelligence services are well informed about their intentions at any given time , no matter where and how they plan to step into action , ” schily added . bavarian interior minister günter beckstein , a member of the conservative christian social union , acknowledged that german intelligence performed well in the run-up to the allawi visit . “ the good news is that the german intelligence services are able to keep such a tight check on potentially dangerous people so that they are not in a position to commit acts of terror here , ” he said .
“ it ’ s gratifying to know that the safety of mr. allawi was ensured throughout his visit to berlin .
this goes to show that cooperation between the various intelligence people at regional and national level leaves nothing to be desired . ” hidden criticism but beckstein ’ s praise was not without a bit of hidden criticism directed towards schily and the minister ’ s plans to reorganize the intelligence services . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's conservative state interior minister günther beckstein the bavarian politician ’ s reference to cooperation between security services was intended as a rebuke to otto schily , who had recently launched a campaign to centralize intelligence gathering at national level .
schily is known to be a staunch supporter of a proposed national clearing house in which intelligence from all the various regional departments would be collected , collated and made easily accessible to officials entitled to use it . for beckstein , the uncovering and thwarting of the attack against allawi demonstrated that the current structure of regional and national units is sufficient for the job and requires no reorganization . hardy graupner -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany probes militant group ; holds three suspects arrest warrants have been issued for three iraqis suspected of planning to attack visiting iraqi prime minister ayad allawi in berlin .

critics say germany is too eager to export to questionable buyers . last wednesday , the german government released its annual report documenting the number of german-made arms exported abroad .
the report confirmed an upward trend , with foreign sales reaching an all time high of € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- in 2003 , compared to € 318 million in 2002 and € 367 million in 2001 , firmly establishing germany as the world 's fourth largest arms producer . while the increase was partly explained by the sale of a few big ticket items , including a submarine worth € 210 million to south africa , arms control advocates say the german government is all too willing to allow the sale of arms and military hardware to countries engaged in conflict or with questionable human rights records .
they point to recent sales to nigeria and india . less than a week after the report was released , german chancellor gerhard schröder kicked off a trip to china , where he promised to lobby the international community to end an arms embargo imposed in the wake of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre .
he thereby signalled his government 's willingness to further liberalize germany 's arms export policies . with the global weapons trade worth more than € 521 billion -lrb- $ 700 billion -rrb- per year , it 's not surprising that schröder , struggling with a stagnant economy and high unemployment , wants to provide a boost to a highly profitable domestic business .
but arms control advocates - with the support of green party parliamentarians - have vowed to block his efforts . government says proper checks met bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german " leopard " tanks fetch top dollar .
following widespread pressure in the late 1990 's to impose more control on the international arms trade , the german governing coalition of social democrats and greens - who campaigned promising more transparency - issued the first annual report in 2000 documenting german arms exports . that same year , the government toughened laws governing arms exports and gave an oversight committee , known as bafa , final approval over all foreign sales .
according to the rules , such sales can only be completed after it is established that the weapons are n't intended for conflict zones or countries with poor human rights records . in a press release accompanying this year 's report , the government claimed 67 percent of 2003 exports were bound for eu or nato allies and permission for the remaining exports was only granted after a careful check and bafa review were carried out . critics take issue with report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german arms sales remain undetected in official reports , say critics .
but bernhart moltmann , chairman of the study group on german arms exports of the joint conference church and development -lrb- gkke -rrb- , which will issue its own report on german arms exports next wednesday , said the government report misrepresents the facts . " the numbers given are n't clear , " he told dw-world .
" they are directed to give a good impression . " he points to the fact that more arms are bound for so-called " developing countries " than the report indicates because the government used its own definition of a " developing country , " rather than the one generally agreed upon by the development assistance committee -lrb- dac -rrb- of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . " there are problems with the definitions used , " he said . loopholes remain in addition to finding fault with the definitions used , some experts also point to loopholes in the rules . siemon wezeman , the acting head of the arms transfers project at the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- , does not dispute the government 's claim that the majority of weapons defined as " arms , " according to the criteria used to compile the government report , are bound for the eu and nato allies . of greater concern , according to wezeman , are the individual components , such as engines , which are not counted in the report and are not subject to the approval of bafa .
they may be installed in , say , a french tank and ultimately end up in the middle east or elsewhere . " we only have the figures for the major weapons systems , but not for the smaller components , " he told dw-world .
" it 's a loophole and a way for german-made arms to end up pretty much anywhere in the world . " winfried nachtwei , a deputy parliamentary leader for the green party and claudia roth , head of the greens , issued a press release on the same day the government arms report was released promising to look into ways to close the loopholes and make all german arms - whether entire weapons systems or individual components - accountable to the same checks and restrictions . just political posturing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder has promised to help lift the arms embargo on china .
if chancellor schröder intends to pave the way for german companies to sell sophisticated weapons systems to china , he could have a tough fight on his hands .
five years ago , the green party successfully blocked the controversial sale of german-made tanks to turkey . wezeman , of sipri , suspects chancellor schröder 's effort to help convince the eu to end the chinese arms embargo is pure political posturing .

critics say germany is too eager to export to questionable buyers . last wednesday , the german government released its annual report documenting the number of german-made arms exported abroad .
the report confirmed an upward trend , with foreign sales reaching an all time high of € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- in 2003 , compared to € 318 million in 2002 and € 367 million in 2001 , firmly establishing germany as the world 's fourth largest arms producer . while the increase was partly explained by the sale of a few big ticket items , including a submarine worth € 210 million to south africa , arms control advocates say the german government is all too willing to allow the sale of arms and military hardware to countries engaged in conflict or with questionable human rights records .
they point to recent sales to nigeria and india . less than a week after the report was released , german chancellor gerhard schröder kicked off a trip to china , where he promised to lobby the international community to end an arms embargo imposed in the wake of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre .
he thereby signalled his government 's willingness to further liberalize germany 's arms export policies . with the global weapons trade worth more than € 521 billion -lrb- $ 700 billion -rrb- per year , it 's not surprising that schröder , struggling with a stagnant economy and high unemployment , wants to provide a boost to a highly profitable domestic business .
but arms control advocates - with the support of green party parliamentarians - have vowed to block his efforts . government says proper checks met bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german " leopard " tanks fetch top dollar .
following widespread pressure in the late 1990 's to impose more control on the international arms trade , the german governing coalition of social democrats and greens - who campaigned promising more transparency - issued the first annual report in 2000 documenting german arms exports . that same year , the government toughened laws governing arms exports and gave an oversight committee , known as bafa , final approval over all foreign sales .
according to the rules , such sales can only be completed after it is established that the weapons are n't intended for conflict zones or countries with poor human rights records . in a press release accompanying this year 's report , the government claimed 67 percent of 2003 exports were bound for eu or nato allies and permission for the remaining exports was only granted after a careful check and bafa review were carried out . critics take issue with report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german arms sales remain undetected in official reports , say critics .

the three men had been under close surveillance by german intelligence following a tip-off from kurdish agents in northern iraq . the kurdish intelligence service had passed on the telephone numbers of the three iraqis .
the numbers were found in a notebook of a kurd suspected to be an important courier for ansar al islam .
german general prosecutor kay nehm said the arrest warrants were issued because the three men are accused of belonging to a terrorist network . he admitted , however , that house searches had failed to uncover any weapons or explosives which could have suggested that the suspects were planning to kill the iraqi prime minister . “ in germany , ansar-al-islam members are known to be involved in fund-raising campaigns , human trafficking and the forging of passports and other documents , ” nehm told reporters .
“ so far we have no record of them using force or carrying out assassinations here . ” on monday , a fourth suspect of lebanese origin was set free again after initial suspicions turned out to be groundless . high political profile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily interior minister otto schily has been trying to profit politically from the events surrounding allawi ’ s visit in berlin .
insisting that an assassination plot had been thwarted , he sought to highlight the efficiency of the domestic intelligence services and the positive impact of the country ’ s new anti-terror legislation .
schily had initiated the hard-hitting laws after the sept .
11 attacks on the united states . “ we ’ re responsible for the security of state leaders visiting us , ” he said .
“ we will do whatever we feel is required to ensure the safety of a guest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 07.12.2004 a finnish lesson for german students großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is germany failing its children ?
according to pisa , german students lack essential educational skills .
but now they can benefit from some private tutoring courtesy of the finnish embassy 's new website , which has a few tips on how to catch up . after pisa , the program for international student assessment , once again awarded finland top marks in their latest study on monday , the nordic country is taking matters into its own hands and helping europe 's educational dunces improve its performance with a new web site . initiated by the finnish embassies in berlin , vienna and bern , it demonstrates the efficiency of the finnish school system with the help of a small , blue troll , who guides visitors through a day in the life of emilia , a finnish school girl . topping the poll which emphasizes knowledge and skills needed for participation in society rather than mastery of a curriculum , finland 's strong points are excellent pre-school care , literacy skills , overall proficiency and an absence of a gender gap . could do better while germany has improved slightly in the pisa ranking , the results of the oecd survey published monday still give the german school system a resounding " could do better " and suggest the country is failing to equip children with the life skills and basic abilities they need . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crucially , the study also suggests german schools are failing children from disadvantaged and immigrant families and confirms that family income and status play too great a role in educational success . in a zdf television interview , wilfried steinert , the president of the national parents ' association , called the situation a disgrace . " this broad gap that we have in our schools and the fact that kids from middle-class or lower-class families have much less of a chance to lead significant careers is a scandal in educational policy , " he said . shows improvement the study , which surveyed a quarter of a million 15-year-olds across 41 countries , does say that german high school students now do better than in the first such survey three years ago .
but on the whole they 're still way behind their counterparts in top-of-the-class countries like finland and south korea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at germany 's college prep schools , known as " gymnasien , " are doing better in the natural sciences than four years ago .
but their peers at germany 's other secondary education schools still perform poorly in both areas .
it 's a finding that has triggered fresh debate on germany 's three-tiered educational model , which disperses children from the age of 10 across its three school systems - unlike finland 's non-selective , non-grade oriented educational system . the polish example " considering the general conditions , countries like germany are not achieving what we would expect them to , " said andreas schleicher , pisa 's international coordinator .
he added that he believes only widespread reforms in the german school system will solve the problem . but other education experts caution that the results of reforms made over the past four years since the last pisa test will take a decade to do any good . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland , though , has proved that theory wrong .
polish high school students placed nearly last in reading and comprehension in the 2000 pisa study . now , after significant changes in its school system , poland has passed germany , with its students ranking above average in reading skills .
the pisa study says that at the end of their required schooling , one in five german students can at best do basic grammar school arithmetic and can not even understand simple reading texts . by the time the next oecd study is published , educational reforms in germany might have started to kick in .
but federal minister for family affairs renate schmidt is n't overly optimistic . " in the next five years , germany may have progressed five places forward , " she told broadcaster n24 . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german kindergartens fail to impress it 's more bad news for the german education system .

starting this week , beethoven fans around the world will have access to the collection ’ s huge library of musical notations , letters and other objects from the composer ’ s life as well as a virtual tour through the house ’ s exhibits and a forum for the exploration of music and new media . free access for music lovers according to the museum ’ s organizers the project is “ a unique example of how a cultural institution focusing on a composer can create a modern connection between the traditional approach to his works and the use of new media . ” for a cost of € 4.5 million -lrb- $ 6.03 million -rrb- , more than 26,000 historical documents and images were scanned , digitalized and catalogued in a giant database by the fraunhofer institute for media communication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's score for the ninth symphony until their internet debut , many of the first editions , manuscripts and pictures of the composer never appeared for viewing by the general public .
because of their extremely fragile nature and value , only researchers and beethoven interpreters were allowed access to them .
the internet site changes that by providing free access to fans any where in the world . it also provides audio samples of key works and reads letters out loud to visitors . “ the digital beethoven house enables us to preserve the original documents while still informing the world about our unique collection and introducing the composer to completely new audiences , ” said museum director andreas eckhardt . cultural bridges through the ages in the beethoven house itself , visitors can take part in a stage for music visualization , a forum where new media is used to interpret beethoven ’ s works in a visual way .

it is the first project of its kind bridging traditional music with futuristic elements and technology , he said . the museum director is convinced the digitalization of the beethoven house and the introduction of more experimental musical fields will go a long way in promoting not only the composer , but also lead to new interpretations of his work and further questioning about the connection between music and multimedia . on a more pragmatic side , eckhardt expects the project to attract more visitors to the brick-and-mortar exhibits . “ yearly we have about 90,000 to 100,000 visitors at the house in bonn , ” he said .

the resulting bans are something of a measure of last resort . banned from city centers occasionally banning diesel powered cars without particle filters from city centers would help keep the amount of microscopic particulate pollution , which a german federal environmental agency study showed contributed to the premature death of 14,000 people last year , within acceptable levels .
the particulate pollution has been linked to cancer and a host of other health problems . according to the council of german cities , the bans may start as soon as february , when weather conditions tend to increase the particulate pollution problem . " we assume that there will be driving bans in all the big german cities , in built-up areas and indeed several times a year depending on weather and traffic conditions , " jürgen resch of the duh , a german environmental organization , told reuters . the bans have also received the blessing of germany 's environment minister , jürgen trittin . filters to be introduced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of 2009 , filters will be installed in new diesel models in a few years ' time , diesel powered cars without filters will be less of an issue .
in july , after months of resistance , the german car industry agreed to start installing filters in all its new domestic diesel models by 2009 . previously , german car makers claimed that installing such filters would be too expensive , but they eventually conceded to their customers ' demands , many of whom wanted the filters .
if properly fitted , filters can reduce particulate emissions by up to 99 percent . though filters will be standard in all new models from 2009 onwards , that still leaves the matter of the many diesel cars which will be sold without filters over the next four years , and those already on the road .
diesel cars currently make up 40 percent of all new european sales . some german car parts makers , including hjs , have been manufacturing filters priced at around € 700 -lrb- $ 934 -rrb- , which can be installed in older model cars . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cars get diesel filters by 2009 after years of stalling on the issue , the german car industry has decided to introduce serial production of emission filters for diesel cars .
the announcement comes amidst mounting pressure from environmentalists .
-lrb- july 14 , 2004 -rrb- debate over diesel car filters heats up german car manufacturers and environmentalists are battling over diesel cars .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.12.2004 beethoven in bits and bytes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven enters the 21st century in bonn born more than 200 years ago , ludwig van beethoven has now come of age in the digital era .
with a complete online archive , a multimedia exhibit and a virtual opera , the classical composer is paving the way to the future . even the most classical of composers eventually find their way into the contemporary stage of the internet .
for germany ’ s favorite musical son , ludwig van beethoven , the entry into the digital era was six years in the making , but the bonn beethoven house hopes the launch of a comprehensive online archive and research center will usher in the rebirth – or at least the revival – of a musical tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house in bonn , germany .
the world ’ s largest beehoven collection , housed in the composer ’ s birthplace in bonn , germany , has turned itself into a state-of-the-art musical complex drawing on the latest in digital technology and information science .
starting this week , beethoven fans around the world will have access to the collection ’ s huge library of musical notations , letters and other objects from the composer ’ s life as well as a virtual tour through the house ’ s exhibits and a forum for the exploration of music and new media . free access for music lovers according to the museum ’ s organizers the project is “ a unique example of how a cultural institution focusing on a composer can create a modern connection between the traditional approach to his works and the use of new media . ” for a cost of € 4.5 million -lrb- $ 6.03 million -rrb- , more than 26,000 historical documents and images were scanned , digitalized and catalogued in a giant database by the fraunhofer institute for media communication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's score for the ninth symphony until their internet debut , many of the first editions , manuscripts and pictures of the composer never appeared for viewing by the general public .
because of their extremely fragile nature and value , only researchers and beethoven interpreters were allowed access to them .
the internet site changes that by providing free access to fans any where in the world . it also provides audio samples of key works and reads letters out loud to visitors . “ the digital beethoven house enables us to preserve the original documents while still informing the world about our unique collection and introducing the composer to completely new audiences , ” said museum director andreas eckhardt . cultural bridges through the ages in the beethoven house itself , visitors can take part in a stage for music visualization , a forum where new media is used to interpret beethoven ’ s works in a visual way .
inaugurated with the performance of “ fidelio , 21st century , ” a musical performance that combines beethoven ’ s only opera with 3-d computer graphics and sounds and transfers it to abstract geometrical characters on a projected stage . the protagonists of beethoven ’ s “ fidelio ” – spirals , planes and fields of color – fly across the specially created stage in the basement of the composer ’ s birth house as visitors take joysticks in hand and manipulate them to the tones of the composition .
an integrated sound system allows the music to follow the figures through the room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven , born 1770 in bonn , died 1827 in vienna “ with this step into the digital world , we hope to reach out to young people especially , ” eckhardt said , justifying the investment in new and interactive media .
it is the first project of its kind bridging traditional music with futuristic elements and technology , he said . the museum director is convinced the digitalization of the beethoven house and the introduction of more experimental musical fields will go a long way in promoting not only the composer , but also lead to new interpretations of his work and further questioning about the connection between music and multimedia . on a more pragmatic side , eckhardt expects the project to attract more visitors to the brick-and-mortar exhibits . “ yearly we have about 90,000 to 100,000 visitors at the house in bonn , ” he said .
“ i think these numbers could jump by 20 to 30 percent now . ” dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beethoven enters the modern era in bonn classical music fans from around the world are descending on bonn , germany , for the annual beethoven festival .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.12.2004 lufthansa forges ahead with cost-cutting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on an upwards trajectory again ?
lufthansa airlines has reached an agreement with pilots to freeze pay and make hours more flexible .
it 's part of the company 's strategy to get out of the economic blues largely brought on by low-cost carriers . german powerhouse lufthansa may be europe 's third-largest airline , but lately it has felt something like gulliver tied down by an onslaught of lilliputians in the guise of europe 's budget air carriers like ryanair or easyjet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang mayrhuber , ceo of lufthansa that 's why ceo wolfgang mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- has embarked on a campaign to slash costs at the airline , which at the end of last year found itself swimming in a sea of red ink and wondering about its long-term chances of survival in an era where early bookers can fly from germany to the uk for € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- on low-cost carriers . on monday , the company reached a pay deal with the union representing 4,400 pilots that included a wage freeze for 23 months .
the agreement will save the company more than € 30 million a year . the agreement , which will take retroactive effect to may 1 , 2004 and runs until march 31 , 2006 , includes lower starting pay for new pilots , requires an extra two hours a month flying time before overtime kicks in and generally makes working times more flexible . chief lufthansa negotiator stefan lauer said the agreement was " a milestone in concerted action to ensure competitive personnel costs . "
the pilots ' union vereinigung cockpit said the deal includes improvements in pension arrangements and brings the low-cost affiliate germanwings into the company 's collective bargaining agreement . turbulent few years in addition to cut-throat competition from the discount carriers , lufthansa has also been hit by a decline in air travel , attributed to the terrorist attacks in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 , and overall slower economic growth .
fuel price rises in recent months have also depressed profits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-cost carrier easyjet the carrier was not helped by the fact that germany has become continental europe 's most competitive travel market .
" the low-cost market in germany has absolutely exploded , " tim coombs , a managing director at aviation economics , told bloomberg . last year proved a low point , when the airline reported a record loss of € 980 million .
ceo mayrhuber , 57 , decided to take drastic action , which he first outlined in november 2003 . already familiar with slashing costs - he was placed in charge of cost-cutting in 1992 to save the carrier from bankruptcy - he announced a plan to turn lufthansa 's fortunes around in the next two years by cutting € 1.2 billion or some 20 percent .
he said 2,000 jobs would be eliminated by 2005 , following 3,600 that were cut due to a hiring freeze put into place last year . is it enough ? but some analysts wonder if lufthansa is flying fast enough to stay above insolvency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agreement is " nice to have , but it 's not a big step , " uwe weinreich , an analyst with hvb bank in munich told bloomberg .
" it 's only a € 30 million chunk out of € 4.6 billion in personnel costs every year .
nevertheless , it 's a good indication that they can reach a settlement with the other unions , " such as those representing the company 's 38,000 ground crew and 14,000 flight attendants . besides the cost cutting , lufthansa has been lowering fares and making ticketing more flexible in an attempt to attract customers .
even so , lufthansa 's fares on short-haul routes are still often triple those of low-cost competitors . still , things appear to be looking up .
the company 's cost-cutting plans combined with increased passenger numbers appear to be having an effect , and the carrier announced a third quarter profit of € 125 million , largely due to an increase in air traffic revenue of 10 percent . mayrhuber said cuts still needed to be deeper and problems of overcapacity addressed if the company is to stay healthy in the long run . " our current numbers should not hide the fact that we clearly need better operating earnings , in order to secure the future of the enterprise for the next generation , " he said last month . but after monday 's pay agreement , he was feeling somewhat better . " lufthansa now has the chance to grow in europe again , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lufthansa lures with luxury trying to set themselves apart from an increasing number of discount airlines , officials for germany 's lufthansa have started a luxury offensive to attract more customers .

lufthansa airlines has reached an agreement with pilots to freeze pay and make hours more flexible .
it 's part of the company 's strategy to get out of the economic blues largely brought on by low-cost carriers . german powerhouse lufthansa may be europe 's third-largest airline , but lately it has felt something like gulliver tied down by an onslaught of lilliputians in the guise of europe 's budget air carriers like ryanair or easyjet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang mayrhuber , ceo of lufthansa that 's why ceo wolfgang mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- has embarked on a campaign to slash costs at the airline , which at the end of last year found itself swimming in a sea of red ink and wondering about its long-term chances of survival in an era where early bookers can fly from germany to the uk for € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- on low-cost carriers . on monday , the company reached a pay deal with the union representing 4,400 pilots that included a wage freeze for 23 months .
the agreement will save the company more than € 30 million a year . the agreement , which will take retroactive effect to may 1 , 2004 and runs until march 31 , 2006 , includes lower starting pay for new pilots , requires an extra two hours a month flying time before overtime kicks in and generally makes working times more flexible . chief lufthansa negotiator stefan lauer said the agreement was " a milestone in concerted action to ensure competitive personnel costs . "
the pilots ' union vereinigung cockpit said the deal includes improvements in pension arrangements and brings the low-cost affiliate germanwings into the company 's collective bargaining agreement . turbulent few years in addition to cut-throat competition from the discount carriers , lufthansa has also been hit by a decline in air travel , attributed to the terrorist attacks in the united states on sept .

ceo mayrhuber , 57 , decided to take drastic action , which he first outlined in november 2003 . already familiar with slashing costs - he was placed in charge of cost-cutting in 1992 to save the carrier from bankruptcy - he announced a plan to turn lufthansa 's fortunes around in the next two years by cutting € 1.2 billion or some 20 percent .
he said 2,000 jobs would be eliminated by 2005 , following 3,600 that were cut due to a hiring freeze put into place last year . is it enough ? but some analysts wonder if lufthansa is flying fast enough to stay above insolvency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agreement is " nice to have , but it 's not a big step , " uwe weinreich , an analyst with hvb bank in munich told bloomberg .
" it 's only a € 30 million chunk out of € 4.6 billion in personnel costs every year .
nevertheless , it 's a good indication that they can reach a settlement with the other unions , " such as those representing the company 's 38,000 ground crew and 14,000 flight attendants . besides the cost cutting , lufthansa has been lowering fares and making ticketing more flexible in an attempt to attract customers .
even so , lufthansa 's fares on short-haul routes are still often triple those of low-cost competitors . still , things appear to be looking up .
the company 's cost-cutting plans combined with increased passenger numbers appear to be having an effect , and the carrier announced a third quarter profit of € 125 million , largely due to an increase in air traffic revenue of 10 percent . mayrhuber said cuts still needed to be deeper and problems of overcapacity addressed if the company is to stay healthy in the long run . " our current numbers should not hide the fact that we clearly need better operating earnings , in order to secure the future of the enterprise for the next generation , " he said last month . but after monday 's pay agreement , he was feeling somewhat better .

lufthansa airlines has reached an agreement with pilots to freeze pay and make hours more flexible .
it 's part of the company 's strategy to get out of the economic blues largely brought on by low-cost carriers . german powerhouse lufthansa may be europe 's third-largest airline , but lately it has felt something like gulliver tied down by an onslaught of lilliputians in the guise of europe 's budget air carriers like ryanair or easyjet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang mayrhuber , ceo of lufthansa that 's why ceo wolfgang mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- has embarked on a campaign to slash costs at the airline , which at the end of last year found itself swimming in a sea of red ink and wondering about its long-term chances of survival in an era where early bookers can fly from germany to the uk for € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- on low-cost carriers . on monday , the company reached a pay deal with the union representing 4,400 pilots that included a wage freeze for 23 months .
the agreement will save the company more than € 30 million a year . the agreement , which will take retroactive effect to may 1 , 2004 and runs until march 31 , 2006 , includes lower starting pay for new pilots , requires an extra two hours a month flying time before overtime kicks in and generally makes working times more flexible . chief lufthansa negotiator stefan lauer said the agreement was " a milestone in concerted action to ensure competitive personnel costs . "
the pilots ' union vereinigung cockpit said the deal includes improvements in pension arrangements and brings the low-cost affiliate germanwings into the company 's collective bargaining agreement . turbulent few years in addition to cut-throat competition from the discount carriers , lufthansa has also been hit by a decline in air travel , attributed to the terrorist attacks in the united states on sept .

with a complete online archive , a multimedia exhibit and a virtual opera , the classical composer is paving the way to the future . even the most classical of composers eventually find their way into the contemporary stage of the internet .
for germany ’ s favorite musical son , ludwig van beethoven , the entry into the digital era was six years in the making , but the bonn beethoven house hopes the launch of a comprehensive online archive and research center will usher in the rebirth – or at least the revival – of a musical tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house in bonn , germany .
the world ’ s largest beehoven collection , housed in the composer ’ s birthplace in bonn , germany , has turned itself into a state-of-the-art musical complex drawing on the latest in digital technology and information science .
starting this week , beethoven fans around the world will have access to the collection ’ s huge library of musical notations , letters and other objects from the composer ’ s life as well as a virtual tour through the house ’ s exhibits and a forum for the exploration of music and new media . free access for music lovers according to the museum ’ s organizers the project is “ a unique example of how a cultural institution focusing on a composer can create a modern connection between the traditional approach to his works and the use of new media . ” for a cost of € 4.5 million -lrb- $ 6.03 million -rrb- , more than 26,000 historical documents and images were scanned , digitalized and catalogued in a giant database by the fraunhofer institute for media communication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's score for the ninth symphony until their internet debut , many of the first editions , manuscripts and pictures of the composer never appeared for viewing by the general public .
because of their extremely fragile nature and value , only researchers and beethoven interpreters were allowed access to them .
the internet site changes that by providing free access to fans any where in the world . it also provides audio samples of key works and reads letters out loud to visitors . “ the digital beethoven house enables us to preserve the original documents while still informing the world about our unique collection and introducing the composer to completely new audiences , ” said museum director andreas eckhardt . cultural bridges through the ages in the beethoven house itself , visitors can take part in a stage for music visualization , a forum where new media is used to interpret beethoven ’ s works in a visual way .
inaugurated with the performance of “ fidelio , 21st century , ” a musical performance that combines beethoven ’ s only opera with 3-d computer graphics and sounds and transfers it to abstract geometrical characters on a projected stage . the protagonists of beethoven ’ s “ fidelio ” – spirals , planes and fields of color – fly across the specially created stage in the basement of the composer ’ s birth house as visitors take joysticks in hand and manipulate them to the tones of the composition .
an integrated sound system allows the music to follow the figures through the room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven , born 1770 in bonn , died 1827 in vienna “ with this step into the digital world , we hope to reach out to young people especially , ” eckhardt said , justifying the investment in new and interactive media .
it is the first project of its kind bridging traditional music with futuristic elements and technology , he said . the museum director is convinced the digitalization of the beethoven house and the introduction of more experimental musical fields will go a long way in promoting not only the composer , but also lead to new interpretations of his work and further questioning about the connection between music and multimedia . on a more pragmatic side , eckhardt expects the project to attract more visitors to the brick-and-mortar exhibits . “ yearly we have about 90,000 to 100,000 visitors at the house in bonn , ” he said .
“ i think these numbers could jump by 20 to 30 percent now . ” dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beethoven enters the modern era in bonn classical music fans from around the world are descending on bonn , germany , for the annual beethoven festival .

lufthansa airlines has reached an agreement with pilots to freeze pay and make hours more flexible .
it 's part of the company 's strategy to get out of the economic blues largely brought on by low-cost carriers . german powerhouse lufthansa may be europe 's third-largest airline , but lately it has felt something like gulliver tied down by an onslaught of lilliputians in the guise of europe 's budget air carriers like ryanair or easyjet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang mayrhuber , ceo of lufthansa that 's why ceo wolfgang mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- has embarked on a campaign to slash costs at the airline , which at the end of last year found itself swimming in a sea of red ink and wondering about its long-term chances of survival in an era where early bookers can fly from germany to the uk for € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- on low-cost carriers . on monday , the company reached a pay deal with the union representing 4,400 pilots that included a wage freeze for 23 months .
the agreement will save the company more than € 30 million a year . the agreement , which will take retroactive effect to may 1 , 2004 and runs until march 31 , 2006 , includes lower starting pay for new pilots , requires an extra two hours a month flying time before overtime kicks in and generally makes working times more flexible . chief lufthansa negotiator stefan lauer said the agreement was " a milestone in concerted action to ensure competitive personnel costs . "
the pilots ' union vereinigung cockpit said the deal includes improvements in pension arrangements and brings the low-cost affiliate germanwings into the company 's collective bargaining agreement . turbulent few years in addition to cut-throat competition from the discount carriers , lufthansa has also been hit by a decline in air travel , attributed to the terrorist attacks in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 , and overall slower economic growth .
fuel price rises in recent months have also depressed profits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-cost carrier easyjet the carrier was not helped by the fact that germany has become continental europe 's most competitive travel market .
" the low-cost market in germany has absolutely exploded , " tim coombs , a managing director at aviation economics , told bloomberg . last year proved a low point , when the airline reported a record loss of € 980 million .
ceo mayrhuber , 57 , decided to take drastic action , which he first outlined in november 2003 . already familiar with slashing costs - he was placed in charge of cost-cutting in 1992 to save the carrier from bankruptcy - he announced a plan to turn lufthansa 's fortunes around in the next two years by cutting € 1.2 billion or some 20 percent .
he said 2,000 jobs would be eliminated by 2005 , following 3,600 that were cut due to a hiring freeze put into place last year . is it enough ? but some analysts wonder if lufthansa is flying fast enough to stay above insolvency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agreement is " nice to have , but it 's not a big step , " uwe weinreich , an analyst with hvb bank in munich told bloomberg .
" it 's only a € 30 million chunk out of € 4.6 billion in personnel costs every year .
nevertheless , it 's a good indication that they can reach a settlement with the other unions , " such as those representing the company 's 38,000 ground crew and 14,000 flight attendants . besides the cost cutting , lufthansa has been lowering fares and making ticketing more flexible in an attempt to attract customers .
even so , lufthansa 's fares on short-haul routes are still often triple those of low-cost competitors . still , things appear to be looking up .
the company 's cost-cutting plans combined with increased passenger numbers appear to be having an effect , and the carrier announced a third quarter profit of € 125 million , largely due to an increase in air traffic revenue of 10 percent . mayrhuber said cuts still needed to be deeper and problems of overcapacity addressed if the company is to stay healthy in the long run . " our current numbers should not hide the fact that we clearly need better operating earnings , in order to secure the future of the enterprise for the next generation , " he said last month . but after monday 's pay agreement , he was feeling somewhat better . " lufthansa now has the chance to grow in europe again , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lufthansa lures with luxury trying to set themselves apart from an increasing number of discount airlines , officials for germany 's lufthansa have started a luxury offensive to attract more customers .

according to pisa , german students lack essential educational skills .
but now they can benefit from some private tutoring courtesy of the finnish embassy 's new website , which has a few tips on how to catch up . after pisa , the program for international student assessment , once again awarded finland top marks in their latest study on monday , the nordic country is taking matters into its own hands and helping europe 's educational dunces improve its performance with a new web site . initiated by the finnish embassies in berlin , vienna and bern , it demonstrates the efficiency of the finnish school system with the help of a small , blue troll , who guides visitors through a day in the life of emilia , a finnish school girl . topping the poll which emphasizes knowledge and skills needed for participation in society rather than mastery of a curriculum , finland 's strong points are excellent pre-school care , literacy skills , overall proficiency and an absence of a gender gap . could do better while germany has improved slightly in the pisa ranking , the results of the oecd survey published monday still give the german school system a resounding " could do better " and suggest the country is failing to equip children with the life skills and basic abilities they need . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crucially , the study also suggests german schools are failing children from disadvantaged and immigrant families and confirms that family income and status play too great a role in educational success . in a zdf television interview , wilfried steinert , the president of the national parents ' association , called the situation a disgrace . " this broad gap that we have in our schools and the fact that kids from middle-class or lower-class families have much less of a chance to lead significant careers is a scandal in educational policy , " he said . shows improvement the study , which surveyed a quarter of a million 15-year-olds across 41 countries , does say that german high school students now do better than in the first such survey three years ago .
but on the whole they 're still way behind their counterparts in top-of-the-class countries like finland and south korea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at germany 's college prep schools , known as " gymnasien , " are doing better in the natural sciences than four years ago .
but their peers at germany 's other secondary education schools still perform poorly in both areas .
it 's a finding that has triggered fresh debate on germany 's three-tiered educational model , which disperses children from the age of 10 across its three school systems - unlike finland 's non-selective , non-grade oriented educational system . the polish example " considering the general conditions , countries like germany are not achieving what we would expect them to , " said andreas schleicher , pisa 's international coordinator .
he added that he believes only widespread reforms in the german school system will solve the problem . but other education experts caution that the results of reforms made over the past four years since the last pisa test will take a decade to do any good . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland , though , has proved that theory wrong .
polish high school students placed nearly last in reading and comprehension in the 2000 pisa study . now , after significant changes in its school system , poland has passed germany , with its students ranking above average in reading skills .
the pisa study says that at the end of their required schooling , one in five german students can at best do basic grammar school arithmetic and can not even understand simple reading texts . by the time the next oecd study is published , educational reforms in germany might have started to kick in .
but federal minister for family affairs renate schmidt is n't overly optimistic . " in the next five years , germany may have progressed five places forward , " she told broadcaster n24 . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german kindergartens fail to impress it 's more bad news for the german education system .

the resulting bans are something of a measure of last resort . banned from city centers occasionally banning diesel powered cars without particle filters from city centers would help keep the amount of microscopic particulate pollution , which a german federal environmental agency study showed contributed to the premature death of 14,000 people last year , within acceptable levels .
the particulate pollution has been linked to cancer and a host of other health problems . according to the council of german cities , the bans may start as soon as february , when weather conditions tend to increase the particulate pollution problem . " we assume that there will be driving bans in all the big german cities , in built-up areas and indeed several times a year depending on weather and traffic conditions , " jürgen resch of the duh , a german environmental organization , told reuters . the bans have also received the blessing of germany 's environment minister , jürgen trittin . filters to be introduced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of 2009 , filters will be installed in new diesel models in a few years ' time , diesel powered cars without filters will be less of an issue .
in july , after months of resistance , the german car industry agreed to start installing filters in all its new domestic diesel models by 2009 . previously , german car makers claimed that installing such filters would be too expensive , but they eventually conceded to their customers ' demands , many of whom wanted the filters .
if properly fitted , filters can reduce particulate emissions by up to 99 percent . though filters will be standard in all new models from 2009 onwards , that still leaves the matter of the many diesel cars which will be sold without filters over the next four years , and those already on the road .
diesel cars currently make up 40 percent of all new european sales . some german car parts makers , including hjs , have been manufacturing filters priced at around € 700 -lrb- $ 934 -rrb- , which can be installed in older model cars . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cars get diesel filters by 2009 after years of stalling on the issue , the german car industry has decided to introduce serial production of emission filters for diesel cars .
the announcement comes amidst mounting pressure from environmentalists .
-lrb- july 14 , 2004 -rrb- debate over diesel car filters heats up german car manufacturers and environmentalists are battling over diesel cars .
should they be fitted with filters , and should motorists who opt for so-called " clean diesel " models be given tax breaks ?

lufthansa airlines has reached an agreement with pilots to freeze pay and make hours more flexible .
it 's part of the company 's strategy to get out of the economic blues largely brought on by low-cost carriers . german powerhouse lufthansa may be europe 's third-largest airline , but lately it has felt something like gulliver tied down by an onslaught of lilliputians in the guise of europe 's budget air carriers like ryanair or easyjet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang mayrhuber , ceo of lufthansa that 's why ceo wolfgang mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- has embarked on a campaign to slash costs at the airline , which at the end of last year found itself swimming in a sea of red ink and wondering about its long-term chances of survival in an era where early bookers can fly from germany to the uk for € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- on low-cost carriers . on monday , the company reached a pay deal with the union representing 4,400 pilots that included a wage freeze for 23 months .
the agreement will save the company more than € 30 million a year . the agreement , which will take retroactive effect to may 1 , 2004 and runs until march 31 , 2006 , includes lower starting pay for new pilots , requires an extra two hours a month flying time before overtime kicks in and generally makes working times more flexible . chief lufthansa negotiator stefan lauer said the agreement was " a milestone in concerted action to ensure competitive personnel costs . "
the pilots ' union vereinigung cockpit said the deal includes improvements in pension arrangements and brings the low-cost affiliate germanwings into the company 's collective bargaining agreement . turbulent few years in addition to cut-throat competition from the discount carriers , lufthansa has also been hit by a decline in air travel , attributed to the terrorist attacks in the united states on sept .

ceo mayrhuber , 57 , decided to take drastic action , which he first outlined in november 2003 . already familiar with slashing costs - he was placed in charge of cost-cutting in 1992 to save the carrier from bankruptcy - he announced a plan to turn lufthansa 's fortunes around in the next two years by cutting € 1.2 billion or some 20 percent .
he said 2,000 jobs would be eliminated by 2005 , following 3,600 that were cut due to a hiring freeze put into place last year . is it enough ? but some analysts wonder if lufthansa is flying fast enough to stay above insolvency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agreement is " nice to have , but it 's not a big step , " uwe weinreich , an analyst with hvb bank in munich told bloomberg .
" it 's only a € 30 million chunk out of € 4.6 billion in personnel costs every year .
nevertheless , it 's a good indication that they can reach a settlement with the other unions , " such as those representing the company 's 38,000 ground crew and 14,000 flight attendants . besides the cost cutting , lufthansa has been lowering fares and making ticketing more flexible in an attempt to attract customers .
even so , lufthansa 's fares on short-haul routes are still often triple those of low-cost competitors . still , things appear to be looking up .
the company 's cost-cutting plans combined with increased passenger numbers appear to be having an effect , and the carrier announced a third quarter profit of € 125 million , largely due to an increase in air traffic revenue of 10 percent . mayrhuber said cuts still needed to be deeper and problems of overcapacity addressed if the company is to stay healthy in the long run . " our current numbers should not hide the fact that we clearly need better operating earnings , in order to secure the future of the enterprise for the next generation , " he said last month . but after monday 's pay agreement , he was feeling somewhat better .

lufthansa airlines has reached an agreement with pilots to freeze pay and make hours more flexible .
it 's part of the company 's strategy to get out of the economic blues largely brought on by low-cost carriers . german powerhouse lufthansa may be europe 's third-largest airline , but lately it has felt something like gulliver tied down by an onslaught of lilliputians in the guise of europe 's budget air carriers like ryanair or easyjet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang mayrhuber , ceo of lufthansa that 's why ceo wolfgang mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- has embarked on a campaign to slash costs at the airline , which at the end of last year found itself swimming in a sea of red ink and wondering about its long-term chances of survival in an era where early bookers can fly from germany to the uk for € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- on low-cost carriers . on monday , the company reached a pay deal with the union representing 4,400 pilots that included a wage freeze for 23 months .
the agreement will save the company more than € 30 million a year . the agreement , which will take retroactive effect to may 1 , 2004 and runs until march 31 , 2006 , includes lower starting pay for new pilots , requires an extra two hours a month flying time before overtime kicks in and generally makes working times more flexible . chief lufthansa negotiator stefan lauer said the agreement was " a milestone in concerted action to ensure competitive personnel costs . "
the pilots ' union vereinigung cockpit said the deal includes improvements in pension arrangements and brings the low-cost affiliate germanwings into the company 's collective bargaining agreement . turbulent few years in addition to cut-throat competition from the discount carriers , lufthansa has also been hit by a decline in air travel , attributed to the terrorist attacks in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 , and overall slower economic growth .
fuel price rises in recent months have also depressed profits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-cost carrier easyjet the carrier was not helped by the fact that germany has become continental europe 's most competitive travel market .
" the low-cost market in germany has absolutely exploded , " tim coombs , a managing director at aviation economics , told bloomberg . last year proved a low point , when the airline reported a record loss of € 980 million .
ceo mayrhuber , 57 , decided to take drastic action , which he first outlined in november 2003 . already familiar with slashing costs - he was placed in charge of cost-cutting in 1992 to save the carrier from bankruptcy - he announced a plan to turn lufthansa 's fortunes around in the next two years by cutting € 1.2 billion or some 20 percent .
he said 2,000 jobs would be eliminated by 2005 , following 3,600 that were cut due to a hiring freeze put into place last year . is it enough ? but some analysts wonder if lufthansa is flying fast enough to stay above insolvency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agreement is " nice to have , but it 's not a big step , " uwe weinreich , an analyst with hvb bank in munich told bloomberg .
" it 's only a € 30 million chunk out of € 4.6 billion in personnel costs every year .
nevertheless , it 's a good indication that they can reach a settlement with the other unions , " such as those representing the company 's 38,000 ground crew and 14,000 flight attendants . besides the cost cutting , lufthansa has been lowering fares and making ticketing more flexible in an attempt to attract customers .
even so , lufthansa 's fares on short-haul routes are still often triple those of low-cost competitors . still , things appear to be looking up .
the company 's cost-cutting plans combined with increased passenger numbers appear to be having an effect , and the carrier announced a third quarter profit of € 125 million , largely due to an increase in air traffic revenue of 10 percent . mayrhuber said cuts still needed to be deeper and problems of overcapacity addressed if the company is to stay healthy in the long run . " our current numbers should not hide the fact that we clearly need better operating earnings , in order to secure the future of the enterprise for the next generation , " he said last month . but after monday 's pay agreement , he was feeling somewhat better .

with a complete online archive , a multimedia exhibit and a virtual opera , the classical composer is paving the way to the future . even the most classical of composers eventually find their way into the contemporary stage of the internet .
for germany ’ s favorite musical son , ludwig van beethoven , the entry into the digital era was six years in the making , but the bonn beethoven house hopes the launch of a comprehensive online archive and research center will usher in the rebirth – or at least the revival – of a musical tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house in bonn , germany .
the world ’ s largest beehoven collection , housed in the composer ’ s birthplace in bonn , germany , has turned itself into a state-of-the-art musical complex drawing on the latest in digital technology and information science .
starting this week , beethoven fans around the world will have access to the collection ’ s huge library of musical notations , letters and other objects from the composer ’ s life as well as a virtual tour through the house ’ s exhibits and a forum for the exploration of music and new media . free access for music lovers according to the museum ’ s organizers the project is “ a unique example of how a cultural institution focusing on a composer can create a modern connection between the traditional approach to his works and the use of new media . ” for a cost of € 4.5 million -lrb- $ 6.03 million -rrb- , more than 26,000 historical documents and images were scanned , digitalized and catalogued in a giant database by the fraunhofer institute for media communication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's score for the ninth symphony until their internet debut , many of the first editions , manuscripts and pictures of the composer never appeared for viewing by the general public .
because of their extremely fragile nature and value , only researchers and beethoven interpreters were allowed access to them .
the internet site changes that by providing free access to fans any where in the world . it also provides audio samples of key works and reads letters out loud to visitors . “ the digital beethoven house enables us to preserve the original documents while still informing the world about our unique collection and introducing the composer to completely new audiences , ” said museum director andreas eckhardt . cultural bridges through the ages in the beethoven house itself , visitors can take part in a stage for music visualization , a forum where new media is used to interpret beethoven ’ s works in a visual way .
inaugurated with the performance of “ fidelio , 21st century , ” a musical performance that combines beethoven ’ s only opera with 3-d computer graphics and sounds and transfers it to abstract geometrical characters on a projected stage . the protagonists of beethoven ’ s “ fidelio ” – spirals , planes and fields of color – fly across the specially created stage in the basement of the composer ’ s birth house as visitors take joysticks in hand and manipulate them to the tones of the composition .
an integrated sound system allows the music to follow the figures through the room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven , born 1770 in bonn , died 1827 in vienna “ with this step into the digital world , we hope to reach out to young people especially , ” eckhardt said , justifying the investment in new and interactive media .
it is the first project of its kind bridging traditional music with futuristic elements and technology , he said . the museum director is convinced the digitalization of the beethoven house and the introduction of more experimental musical fields will go a long way in promoting not only the composer , but also lead to new interpretations of his work and further questioning about the connection between music and multimedia . on a more pragmatic side , eckhardt expects the project to attract more visitors to the brick-and-mortar exhibits . “ yearly we have about 90,000 to 100,000 visitors at the house in bonn , ” he said .

with a complete online archive , a multimedia exhibit and a virtual opera , the classical composer is paving the way to the future . even the most classical of composers eventually find their way into the contemporary stage of the internet .
for germany ’ s favorite musical son , ludwig van beethoven , the entry into the digital era was six years in the making , but the bonn beethoven house hopes the launch of a comprehensive online archive and research center will usher in the rebirth – or at least the revival – of a musical tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house in bonn , germany .
the world ’ s largest beehoven collection , housed in the composer ’ s birthplace in bonn , germany , has turned itself into a state-of-the-art musical complex drawing on the latest in digital technology and information science .
starting this week , beethoven fans around the world will have access to the collection ’ s huge library of musical notations , letters and other objects from the composer ’ s life as well as a virtual tour through the house ’ s exhibits and a forum for the exploration of music and new media . free access for music lovers according to the museum ’ s organizers the project is “ a unique example of how a cultural institution focusing on a composer can create a modern connection between the traditional approach to his works and the use of new media . ” for a cost of € 4.5 million -lrb- $ 6.03 million -rrb- , more than 26,000 historical documents and images were scanned , digitalized and catalogued in a giant database by the fraunhofer institute for media communication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's score for the ninth symphony until their internet debut , many of the first editions , manuscripts and pictures of the composer never appeared for viewing by the general public .
because of their extremely fragile nature and value , only researchers and beethoven interpreters were allowed access to them .
the internet site changes that by providing free access to fans any where in the world . it also provides audio samples of key works and reads letters out loud to visitors . “ the digital beethoven house enables us to preserve the original documents while still informing the world about our unique collection and introducing the composer to completely new audiences , ” said museum director andreas eckhardt . cultural bridges through the ages in the beethoven house itself , visitors can take part in a stage for music visualization , a forum where new media is used to interpret beethoven ’ s works in a visual way .
inaugurated with the performance of “ fidelio , 21st century , ” a musical performance that combines beethoven ’ s only opera with 3-d computer graphics and sounds and transfers it to abstract geometrical characters on a projected stage . the protagonists of beethoven ’ s “ fidelio ” – spirals , planes and fields of color – fly across the specially created stage in the basement of the composer ’ s birth house as visitors take joysticks in hand and manipulate them to the tones of the composition .
an integrated sound system allows the music to follow the figures through the room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven , born 1770 in bonn , died 1827 in vienna “ with this step into the digital world , we hope to reach out to young people especially , ” eckhardt said , justifying the investment in new and interactive media .
it is the first project of its kind bridging traditional music with futuristic elements and technology , he said . the museum director is convinced the digitalization of the beethoven house and the introduction of more experimental musical fields will go a long way in promoting not only the composer , but also lead to new interpretations of his work and further questioning about the connection between music and multimedia . on a more pragmatic side , eckhardt expects the project to attract more visitors to the brick-and-mortar exhibits . “ yearly we have about 90,000 to 100,000 visitors at the house in bonn , ” he said .

the three men had been under close surveillance by german intelligence following a tip-off from kurdish agents in northern iraq . the kurdish intelligence service had passed on the telephone numbers of the three iraqis .
the numbers were found in a notebook of a kurd suspected to be an important courier for ansar al islam .
german general prosecutor kay nehm said the arrest warrants were issued because the three men are accused of belonging to a terrorist network . he admitted , however , that house searches had failed to uncover any weapons or explosives which could have suggested that the suspects were planning to kill the iraqi prime minister . “ in germany , ansar-al-islam members are known to be involved in fund-raising campaigns , human trafficking and the forging of passports and other documents , ” nehm told reporters .

“ it ’ s gratifying to know that the safety of mr. allawi was ensured throughout his visit to berlin .

the three men had been under close surveillance by german intelligence following a tip-off from kurdish agents in northern iraq . the kurdish intelligence service had passed on the telephone numbers of the three iraqis .
the numbers were found in a notebook of a kurd suspected to be an important courier for ansar al islam .
german general prosecutor kay nehm said the arrest warrants were issued because the three men are accused of belonging to a terrorist network . he admitted , however , that house searches had failed to uncover any weapons or explosives which could have suggested that the suspects were planning to kill the iraqi prime minister . “ in germany , ansar-al-islam members are known to be involved in fund-raising campaigns , human trafficking and the forging of passports and other documents , ” nehm told reporters .

critics say germany is too eager to export to questionable buyers . last wednesday , the german government released its annual report documenting the number of german-made arms exported abroad .
the report confirmed an upward trend , with foreign sales reaching an all time high of € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- in 2003 , compared to € 318 million in 2002 and € 367 million in 2001 , firmly establishing germany as the world 's fourth largest arms producer . while the increase was partly explained by the sale of a few big ticket items , including a submarine worth € 210 million to south africa , arms control advocates say the german government is all too willing to allow the sale of arms and military hardware to countries engaged in conflict or with questionable human rights records .
they point to recent sales to nigeria and india . less than a week after the report was released , german chancellor gerhard schröder kicked off a trip to china , where he promised to lobby the international community to end an arms embargo imposed in the wake of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre .
he thereby signalled his government 's willingness to further liberalize germany 's arms export policies . with the global weapons trade worth more than € 521 billion -lrb- $ 700 billion -rrb- per year , it 's not surprising that schröder , struggling with a stagnant economy and high unemployment , wants to provide a boost to a highly profitable domestic business .
but arms control advocates - with the support of green party parliamentarians - have vowed to block his efforts . government says proper checks met bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german " leopard " tanks fetch top dollar .
following widespread pressure in the late 1990 's to impose more control on the international arms trade , the german governing coalition of social democrats and greens - who campaigned promising more transparency - issued the first annual report in 2000 documenting german arms exports . that same year , the government toughened laws governing arms exports and gave an oversight committee , known as bafa , final approval over all foreign sales .
according to the rules , such sales can only be completed after it is established that the weapons are n't intended for conflict zones or countries with poor human rights records . in a press release accompanying this year 's report , the government claimed 67 percent of 2003 exports were bound for eu or nato allies and permission for the remaining exports was only granted after a careful check and bafa review were carried out . critics take issue with report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german arms sales remain undetected in official reports , say critics .
but bernhart moltmann , chairman of the study group on german arms exports of the joint conference church and development -lrb- gkke -rrb- , which will issue its own report on german arms exports next wednesday , said the government report misrepresents the facts . " the numbers given are n't clear , " he told dw-world .
" they are directed to give a good impression . " he points to the fact that more arms are bound for so-called " developing countries " than the report indicates because the government used its own definition of a " developing country , " rather than the one generally agreed upon by the development assistance committee -lrb- dac -rrb- of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . " there are problems with the definitions used , " he said . loopholes remain in addition to finding fault with the definitions used , some experts also point to loopholes in the rules . siemon wezeman , the acting head of the arms transfers project at the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- , does not dispute the government 's claim that the majority of weapons defined as " arms , " according to the criteria used to compile the government report , are bound for the eu and nato allies . of greater concern , according to wezeman , are the individual components , such as engines , which are not counted in the report and are not subject to the approval of bafa .
they may be installed in , say , a french tank and ultimately end up in the middle east or elsewhere . " we only have the figures for the major weapons systems , but not for the smaller components , " he told dw-world .
" it 's a loophole and a way for german-made arms to end up pretty much anywhere in the world . " winfried nachtwei , a deputy parliamentary leader for the green party and claudia roth , head of the greens , issued a press release on the same day the government arms report was released promising to look into ways to close the loopholes and make all german arms - whether entire weapons systems or individual components - accountable to the same checks and restrictions . just political posturing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder has promised to help lift the arms embargo on china .
if chancellor schröder intends to pave the way for german companies to sell sophisticated weapons systems to china , he could have a tough fight on his hands .
five years ago , the green party successfully blocked the controversial sale of german-made tanks to turkey . wezeman , of sipri , suspects chancellor schröder 's effort to help convince the eu to end the chinese arms embargo is pure political posturing .
even if the eu agrees , the united states has made its intention to block weapons sales to china very clear and has promised not to do business with european countries that sell arms to beijing . " he wants to make german policy look china friendly to open the civilian market , not the arms market , " said wezeman . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany mulls tanks sale to turkey barely a week after the european commission recommended initiating membership talks with turkey , the german government is reportedly considering to deliver tanks to that country .

critics say germany is too eager to export to questionable buyers . last wednesday , the german government released its annual report documenting the number of german-made arms exported abroad .
the report confirmed an upward trend , with foreign sales reaching an all time high of € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- in 2003 , compared to € 318 million in 2002 and € 367 million in 2001 , firmly establishing germany as the world 's fourth largest arms producer . while the increase was partly explained by the sale of a few big ticket items , including a submarine worth € 210 million to south africa , arms control advocates say the german government is all too willing to allow the sale of arms and military hardware to countries engaged in conflict or with questionable human rights records .
they point to recent sales to nigeria and india . less than a week after the report was released , german chancellor gerhard schröder kicked off a trip to china , where he promised to lobby the international community to end an arms embargo imposed in the wake of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre .
he thereby signalled his government 's willingness to further liberalize germany 's arms export policies . with the global weapons trade worth more than € 521 billion -lrb- $ 700 billion -rrb- per year , it 's not surprising that schröder , struggling with a stagnant economy and high unemployment , wants to provide a boost to a highly profitable domestic business .

he thereby signalled his government 's willingness to further liberalize germany 's arms export policies . with the global weapons trade worth more than € 521 billion -lrb- $ 700 billion -rrb- per year , it 's not surprising that schröder , struggling with a stagnant economy and high unemployment , wants to provide a boost to a highly profitable domestic business .
but arms control advocates - with the support of green party parliamentarians - have vowed to block his efforts . government says proper checks met bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german " leopard " tanks fetch top dollar .
following widespread pressure in the late 1990 's to impose more control on the international arms trade , the german governing coalition of social democrats and greens - who campaigned promising more transparency - issued the first annual report in 2000 documenting german arms exports . that same year , the government toughened laws governing arms exports and gave an oversight committee , known as bafa , final approval over all foreign sales .
according to the rules , such sales can only be completed after it is established that the weapons are n't intended for conflict zones or countries with poor human rights records . in a press release accompanying this year 's report , the government claimed 67 percent of 2003 exports were bound for eu or nato allies and permission for the remaining exports was only granted after a careful check and bafa review were carried out . critics take issue with report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german arms sales remain undetected in official reports , say critics .
but bernhart moltmann , chairman of the study group on german arms exports of the joint conference church and development -lrb- gkke -rrb- , which will issue its own report on german arms exports next wednesday , said the government report misrepresents the facts . " the numbers given are n't clear , " he told dw-world .
" they are directed to give a good impression . " he points to the fact that more arms are bound for so-called " developing countries " than the report indicates because the government used its own definition of a " developing country , " rather than the one generally agreed upon by the development assistance committee -lrb- dac -rrb- of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . " there are problems with the definitions used , " he said . loopholes remain in addition to finding fault with the definitions used , some experts also point to loopholes in the rules . siemon wezeman , the acting head of the arms transfers project at the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- , does not dispute the government 's claim that the majority of weapons defined as " arms , " according to the criteria used to compile the government report , are bound for the eu and nato allies . of greater concern , according to wezeman , are the individual components , such as engines , which are not counted in the report and are not subject to the approval of bafa .
they may be installed in , say , a french tank and ultimately end up in the middle east or elsewhere . " we only have the figures for the major weapons systems , but not for the smaller components , " he told dw-world .
" it 's a loophole and a way for german-made arms to end up pretty much anywhere in the world . " winfried nachtwei , a deputy parliamentary leader for the green party and claudia roth , head of the greens , issued a press release on the same day the government arms report was released promising to look into ways to close the loopholes and make all german arms - whether entire weapons systems or individual components - accountable to the same checks and restrictions . just political posturing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder has promised to help lift the arms embargo on china .
if chancellor schröder intends to pave the way for german companies to sell sophisticated weapons systems to china , he could have a tough fight on his hands .
five years ago , the green party successfully blocked the controversial sale of german-made tanks to turkey . wezeman , of sipri , suspects chancellor schröder 's effort to help convince the eu to end the chinese arms embargo is pure political posturing .
even if the eu agrees , the united states has made its intention to block weapons sales to china very clear and has promised not to do business with european countries that sell arms to beijing . " he wants to make german policy look china friendly to open the civilian market , not the arms market , " said wezeman . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany mulls tanks sale to turkey barely a week after the european commission recommended initiating membership talks with turkey , the german government is reportedly considering to deliver tanks to that country .

chief among the issues was the tit-for-tat spat over government subsidies for europe ’ s airbus consortium and boeing . after the meeting , the men announced they would continue talking over the new few weeks to try to settle their differences by negotiation , but would retain the option of litigation through the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- . " if we are going to avoid litigation in pursuit of the cases that both of us have now entered , we are going to have to have some pretty serious discussions about the alternative to that litigation , " mandelson told reporters . " i am interested in seeing how we can resolve our differences through a proper set of negotiations , " he added . his us counterpart , zoellick , said that if negotiations did not succeed , " litigation is an option " and that the bush administration was prepared for that eventuality . fresh start mandelson , a close ally of british prime minister tony blair , had promised “ a fresh start ” in transatlantic negotiations which turned bad after the united states filed a complaint with the wto in october challenging european loans to help airbus develop aircraft , such as the new a380 super-jumbo jet .
the eu responded by filing its own case against the us government over aid for boeing . the filing of cases triggered a 60-day consultation period , which expired monday .

lufthansa airlines has reached an agreement with pilots to freeze pay and make hours more flexible .
it 's part of the company 's strategy to get out of the economic blues largely brought on by low-cost carriers . german powerhouse lufthansa may be europe 's third-largest airline , but lately it has felt something like gulliver tied down by an onslaught of lilliputians in the guise of europe 's budget air carriers like ryanair or easyjet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang mayrhuber , ceo of lufthansa that 's why ceo wolfgang mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- has embarked on a campaign to slash costs at the airline , which at the end of last year found itself swimming in a sea of red ink and wondering about its long-term chances of survival in an era where early bookers can fly from germany to the uk for € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- on low-cost carriers . on monday , the company reached a pay deal with the union representing 4,400 pilots that included a wage freeze for 23 months .
the agreement will save the company more than € 30 million a year . the agreement , which will take retroactive effect to may 1 , 2004 and runs until march 31 , 2006 , includes lower starting pay for new pilots , requires an extra two hours a month flying time before overtime kicks in and generally makes working times more flexible . chief lufthansa negotiator stefan lauer said the agreement was " a milestone in concerted action to ensure competitive personnel costs . "
the pilots ' union vereinigung cockpit said the deal includes improvements in pension arrangements and brings the low-cost affiliate germanwings into the company 's collective bargaining agreement . turbulent few years in addition to cut-throat competition from the discount carriers , lufthansa has also been hit by a decline in air travel , attributed to the terrorist attacks in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 , and overall slower economic growth .
fuel price rises in recent months have also depressed profits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-cost carrier easyjet the carrier was not helped by the fact that germany has become continental europe 's most competitive travel market .
" the low-cost market in germany has absolutely exploded , " tim coombs , a managing director at aviation economics , told bloomberg . last year proved a low point , when the airline reported a record loss of € 980 million .
ceo mayrhuber , 57 , decided to take drastic action , which he first outlined in november 2003 . already familiar with slashing costs - he was placed in charge of cost-cutting in 1992 to save the carrier from bankruptcy - he announced a plan to turn lufthansa 's fortunes around in the next two years by cutting € 1.2 billion or some 20 percent .
he said 2,000 jobs would be eliminated by 2005 , following 3,600 that were cut due to a hiring freeze put into place last year . is it enough ? but some analysts wonder if lufthansa is flying fast enough to stay above insolvency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agreement is " nice to have , but it 's not a big step , " uwe weinreich , an analyst with hvb bank in munich told bloomberg .
" it 's only a € 30 million chunk out of € 4.6 billion in personnel costs every year .
nevertheless , it 's a good indication that they can reach a settlement with the other unions , " such as those representing the company 's 38,000 ground crew and 14,000 flight attendants . besides the cost cutting , lufthansa has been lowering fares and making ticketing more flexible in an attempt to attract customers .
even so , lufthansa 's fares on short-haul routes are still often triple those of low-cost competitors . still , things appear to be looking up .
the company 's cost-cutting plans combined with increased passenger numbers appear to be having an effect , and the carrier announced a third quarter profit of € 125 million , largely due to an increase in air traffic revenue of 10 percent . mayrhuber said cuts still needed to be deeper and problems of overcapacity addressed if the company is to stay healthy in the long run . " our current numbers should not hide the fact that we clearly need better operating earnings , in order to secure the future of the enterprise for the next generation , " he said last month . but after monday 's pay agreement , he was feeling somewhat better . " lufthansa now has the chance to grow in europe again , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lufthansa lures with luxury trying to set themselves apart from an increasing number of discount airlines , officials for germany 's lufthansa have started a luxury offensive to attract more customers .

the resulting bans are something of a measure of last resort . banned from city centers occasionally banning diesel powered cars without particle filters from city centers would help keep the amount of microscopic particulate pollution , which a german federal environmental agency study showed contributed to the premature death of 14,000 people last year , within acceptable levels .
the particulate pollution has been linked to cancer and a host of other health problems . according to the council of german cities , the bans may start as soon as february , when weather conditions tend to increase the particulate pollution problem . " we assume that there will be driving bans in all the big german cities , in built-up areas and indeed several times a year depending on weather and traffic conditions , " jürgen resch of the duh , a german environmental organization , told reuters . the bans have also received the blessing of germany 's environment minister , jürgen trittin . filters to be introduced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of 2009 , filters will be installed in new diesel models in a few years ' time , diesel powered cars without filters will be less of an issue .
in july , after months of resistance , the german car industry agreed to start installing filters in all its new domestic diesel models by 2009 . previously , german car makers claimed that installing such filters would be too expensive , but they eventually conceded to their customers ' demands , many of whom wanted the filters .
if properly fitted , filters can reduce particulate emissions by up to 99 percent . though filters will be standard in all new models from 2009 onwards , that still leaves the matter of the many diesel cars which will be sold without filters over the next four years , and those already on the road .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.12.2004 germany examines allawi assassination plot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorists had iraqi prime minister allawi -lrb- left -rrb- in their sights prosecutors have issued arrest warrants for three iraqis belonging to the fundamentalist ansar al islam network suspected of planning an attack on iraqi interim prime minister ayad allawi last friday in germany . following warnings from german intelligence agencies that three iraqis living in germany could be planning to assassinate ayad allawi while in berlin , the prime minister ’ s agenda was changed immediately to heighten security . arrest warrants were issued over the weekend for the three members of the fundamentalist ansar al islam group who were residing in berlin , stuttgart and augsburg respectively .
the three men had been under close surveillance by german intelligence following a tip-off from kurdish agents in northern iraq . the kurdish intelligence service had passed on the telephone numbers of the three iraqis .
the numbers were found in a notebook of a kurd suspected to be an important courier for ansar al islam .
german general prosecutor kay nehm said the arrest warrants were issued because the three men are accused of belonging to a terrorist network . he admitted , however , that house searches had failed to uncover any weapons or explosives which could have suggested that the suspects were planning to kill the iraqi prime minister . “ in germany , ansar-al-islam members are known to be involved in fund-raising campaigns , human trafficking and the forging of passports and other documents , ” nehm told reporters .
“ so far we have no record of them using force or carrying out assassinations here . ” on monday , a fourth suspect of lebanese origin was set free again after initial suspicions turned out to be groundless . high political profile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily interior minister otto schily has been trying to profit politically from the events surrounding allawi ’ s visit in berlin .
insisting that an assassination plot had been thwarted , he sought to highlight the efficiency of the domestic intelligence services and the positive impact of the country ’ s new anti-terror legislation .
schily had initiated the hard-hitting laws after the sept .
11 attacks on the united states . “ we ’ re responsible for the security of state leaders visiting us , ” he said .
“ we will do whatever we feel is required to ensure the safety of a guest .
in the case of prime minister ayad allawi , we also took all the necessary precautions and didn ’ t leave anything to chance . ” “ terrorists should know that our intelligence services are well informed about their intentions at any given time , no matter where and how they plan to step into action , ” schily added . bavarian interior minister günter beckstein , a member of the conservative christian social union , acknowledged that german intelligence performed well in the run-up to the allawi visit . “ the good news is that the german intelligence services are able to keep such a tight check on potentially dangerous people so that they are not in a position to commit acts of terror here , ” he said .
“ it ’ s gratifying to know that the safety of mr. allawi was ensured throughout his visit to berlin .
this goes to show that cooperation between the various intelligence people at regional and national level leaves nothing to be desired . ” hidden criticism but beckstein ’ s praise was not without a bit of hidden criticism directed towards schily and the minister ’ s plans to reorganize the intelligence services . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's conservative state interior minister günther beckstein the bavarian politician ’ s reference to cooperation between security services was intended as a rebuke to otto schily , who had recently launched a campaign to centralize intelligence gathering at national level .
schily is known to be a staunch supporter of a proposed national clearing house in which intelligence from all the various regional departments would be collected , collated and made easily accessible to officials entitled to use it . for beckstein , the uncovering and thwarting of the attack against allawi demonstrated that the current structure of regional and national units is sufficient for the job and requires no reorganization . hardy graupner -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany probes militant group ; holds three suspects arrest warrants have been issued for three iraqis suspected of planning to attack visiting iraqi prime minister ayad allawi in berlin .

according to pisa , german students lack essential educational skills .
but now they can benefit from some private tutoring courtesy of the finnish embassy 's new website , which has a few tips on how to catch up . after pisa , the program for international student assessment , once again awarded finland top marks in their latest study on monday , the nordic country is taking matters into its own hands and helping europe 's educational dunces improve its performance with a new web site . initiated by the finnish embassies in berlin , vienna and bern , it demonstrates the efficiency of the finnish school system with the help of a small , blue troll , who guides visitors through a day in the life of emilia , a finnish school girl . topping the poll which emphasizes knowledge and skills needed for participation in society rather than mastery of a curriculum , finland 's strong points are excellent pre-school care , literacy skills , overall proficiency and an absence of a gender gap . could do better while germany has improved slightly in the pisa ranking , the results of the oecd survey published monday still give the german school system a resounding " could do better " and suggest the country is failing to equip children with the life skills and basic abilities they need . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crucially , the study also suggests german schools are failing children from disadvantaged and immigrant families and confirms that family income and status play too great a role in educational success . in a zdf television interview , wilfried steinert , the president of the national parents ' association , called the situation a disgrace . " this broad gap that we have in our schools and the fact that kids from middle-class or lower-class families have much less of a chance to lead significant careers is a scandal in educational policy , " he said . shows improvement the study , which surveyed a quarter of a million 15-year-olds across 41 countries , does say that german high school students now do better than in the first such survey three years ago .
but on the whole they 're still way behind their counterparts in top-of-the-class countries like finland and south korea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at germany 's college prep schools , known as " gymnasien , " are doing better in the natural sciences than four years ago .
but their peers at germany 's other secondary education schools still perform poorly in both areas .
it 's a finding that has triggered fresh debate on germany 's three-tiered educational model , which disperses children from the age of 10 across its three school systems - unlike finland 's non-selective , non-grade oriented educational system . the polish example " considering the general conditions , countries like germany are not achieving what we would expect them to , " said andreas schleicher , pisa 's international coordinator .
he added that he believes only widespread reforms in the german school system will solve the problem . but other education experts caution that the results of reforms made over the past four years since the last pisa test will take a decade to do any good . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland , though , has proved that theory wrong .
polish high school students placed nearly last in reading and comprehension in the 2000 pisa study . now , after significant changes in its school system , poland has passed germany , with its students ranking above average in reading skills .
the pisa study says that at the end of their required schooling , one in five german students can at best do basic grammar school arithmetic and can not even understand simple reading texts . by the time the next oecd study is published , educational reforms in germany might have started to kick in .
but federal minister for family affairs renate schmidt is n't overly optimistic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.12.2004 lufthansa forges ahead with cost-cutting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on an upwards trajectory again ?
lufthansa airlines has reached an agreement with pilots to freeze pay and make hours more flexible .
it 's part of the company 's strategy to get out of the economic blues largely brought on by low-cost carriers . german powerhouse lufthansa may be europe 's third-largest airline , but lately it has felt something like gulliver tied down by an onslaught of lilliputians in the guise of europe 's budget air carriers like ryanair or easyjet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang mayrhuber , ceo of lufthansa that 's why ceo wolfgang mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- has embarked on a campaign to slash costs at the airline , which at the end of last year found itself swimming in a sea of red ink and wondering about its long-term chances of survival in an era where early bookers can fly from germany to the uk for € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- on low-cost carriers . on monday , the company reached a pay deal with the union representing 4,400 pilots that included a wage freeze for 23 months .
the agreement will save the company more than € 30 million a year . the agreement , which will take retroactive effect to may 1 , 2004 and runs until march 31 , 2006 , includes lower starting pay for new pilots , requires an extra two hours a month flying time before overtime kicks in and generally makes working times more flexible . chief lufthansa negotiator stefan lauer said the agreement was " a milestone in concerted action to ensure competitive personnel costs . "
the pilots ' union vereinigung cockpit said the deal includes improvements in pension arrangements and brings the low-cost affiliate germanwings into the company 's collective bargaining agreement . turbulent few years in addition to cut-throat competition from the discount carriers , lufthansa has also been hit by a decline in air travel , attributed to the terrorist attacks in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 , and overall slower economic growth .
fuel price rises in recent months have also depressed profits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-cost carrier easyjet the carrier was not helped by the fact that germany has become continental europe 's most competitive travel market .
" the low-cost market in germany has absolutely exploded , " tim coombs , a managing director at aviation economics , told bloomberg . last year proved a low point , when the airline reported a record loss of € 980 million .
ceo mayrhuber , 57 , decided to take drastic action , which he first outlined in november 2003 . already familiar with slashing costs - he was placed in charge of cost-cutting in 1992 to save the carrier from bankruptcy - he announced a plan to turn lufthansa 's fortunes around in the next two years by cutting € 1.2 billion or some 20 percent .
he said 2,000 jobs would be eliminated by 2005 , following 3,600 that were cut due to a hiring freeze put into place last year . is it enough ? but some analysts wonder if lufthansa is flying fast enough to stay above insolvency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agreement is " nice to have , but it 's not a big step , " uwe weinreich , an analyst with hvb bank in munich told bloomberg .
" it 's only a € 30 million chunk out of € 4.6 billion in personnel costs every year .
nevertheless , it 's a good indication that they can reach a settlement with the other unions , " such as those representing the company 's 38,000 ground crew and 14,000 flight attendants . besides the cost cutting , lufthansa has been lowering fares and making ticketing more flexible in an attempt to attract customers .
even so , lufthansa 's fares on short-haul routes are still often triple those of low-cost competitors . still , things appear to be looking up .
the company 's cost-cutting plans combined with increased passenger numbers appear to be having an effect , and the carrier announced a third quarter profit of € 125 million , largely due to an increase in air traffic revenue of 10 percent . mayrhuber said cuts still needed to be deeper and problems of overcapacity addressed if the company is to stay healthy in the long run . " our current numbers should not hide the fact that we clearly need better operating earnings , in order to secure the future of the enterprise for the next generation , " he said last month . but after monday 's pay agreement , he was feeling somewhat better . " lufthansa now has the chance to grow in europe again , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lufthansa lures with luxury trying to set themselves apart from an increasing number of discount airlines , officials for germany 's lufthansa have started a luxury offensive to attract more customers .

with a complete online archive , a multimedia exhibit and a virtual opera , the classical composer is paving the way to the future . even the most classical of composers eventually find their way into the contemporary stage of the internet .
for germany ’ s favorite musical son , ludwig van beethoven , the entry into the digital era was six years in the making , but the bonn beethoven house hopes the launch of a comprehensive online archive and research center will usher in the rebirth – or at least the revival – of a musical tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house in bonn , germany .
the world ’ s largest beehoven collection , housed in the composer ’ s birthplace in bonn , germany , has turned itself into a state-of-the-art musical complex drawing on the latest in digital technology and information science .
starting this week , beethoven fans around the world will have access to the collection ’ s huge library of musical notations , letters and other objects from the composer ’ s life as well as a virtual tour through the house ’ s exhibits and a forum for the exploration of music and new media . free access for music lovers according to the museum ’ s organizers the project is “ a unique example of how a cultural institution focusing on a composer can create a modern connection between the traditional approach to his works and the use of new media . ” for a cost of € 4.5 million -lrb- $ 6.03 million -rrb- , more than 26,000 historical documents and images were scanned , digitalized and catalogued in a giant database by the fraunhofer institute for media communication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's score for the ninth symphony until their internet debut , many of the first editions , manuscripts and pictures of the composer never appeared for viewing by the general public .
because of their extremely fragile nature and value , only researchers and beethoven interpreters were allowed access to them .
the internet site changes that by providing free access to fans any where in the world . it also provides audio samples of key works and reads letters out loud to visitors . “ the digital beethoven house enables us to preserve the original documents while still informing the world about our unique collection and introducing the composer to completely new audiences , ” said museum director andreas eckhardt . cultural bridges through the ages in the beethoven house itself , visitors can take part in a stage for music visualization , a forum where new media is used to interpret beethoven ’ s works in a visual way .
inaugurated with the performance of “ fidelio , 21st century , ” a musical performance that combines beethoven ’ s only opera with 3-d computer graphics and sounds and transfers it to abstract geometrical characters on a projected stage . the protagonists of beethoven ’ s “ fidelio ” – spirals , planes and fields of color – fly across the specially created stage in the basement of the composer ’ s birth house as visitors take joysticks in hand and manipulate them to the tones of the composition .
an integrated sound system allows the music to follow the figures through the room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven , born 1770 in bonn , died 1827 in vienna “ with this step into the digital world , we hope to reach out to young people especially , ” eckhardt said , justifying the investment in new and interactive media .
it is the first project of its kind bridging traditional music with futuristic elements and technology , he said . the museum director is convinced the digitalization of the beethoven house and the introduction of more experimental musical fields will go a long way in promoting not only the composer , but also lead to new interpretations of his work and further questioning about the connection between music and multimedia . on a more pragmatic side , eckhardt expects the project to attract more visitors to the brick-and-mortar exhibits . “ yearly we have about 90,000 to 100,000 visitors at the house in bonn , ” he said .
“ i think these numbers could jump by 20 to 30 percent now . ” dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beethoven enters the modern era in bonn classical music fans from around the world are descending on bonn , germany , for the annual beethoven festival .

the resulting bans are something of a measure of last resort . banned from city centers occasionally banning diesel powered cars without particle filters from city centers would help keep the amount of microscopic particulate pollution , which a german federal environmental agency study showed contributed to the premature death of 14,000 people last year , within acceptable levels .
the particulate pollution has been linked to cancer and a host of other health problems . according to the council of german cities , the bans may start as soon as february , when weather conditions tend to increase the particulate pollution problem . " we assume that there will be driving bans in all the big german cities , in built-up areas and indeed several times a year depending on weather and traffic conditions , " jürgen resch of the duh , a german environmental organization , told reuters . the bans have also received the blessing of germany 's environment minister , jürgen trittin . filters to be introduced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of 2009 , filters will be installed in new diesel models in a few years ' time , diesel powered cars without filters will be less of an issue .
in july , after months of resistance , the german car industry agreed to start installing filters in all its new domestic diesel models by 2009 . previously , german car makers claimed that installing such filters would be too expensive , but they eventually conceded to their customers ' demands , many of whom wanted the filters .
if properly fitted , filters can reduce particulate emissions by up to 99 percent . though filters will be standard in all new models from 2009 onwards , that still leaves the matter of the many diesel cars which will be sold without filters over the next four years , and those already on the road .
diesel cars currently make up 40 percent of all new european sales . some german car parts makers , including hjs , have been manufacturing filters priced at around € 700 -lrb- $ 934 -rrb- , which can be installed in older model cars . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cars get diesel filters by 2009 after years of stalling on the issue , the german car industry has decided to introduce serial production of emission filters for diesel cars .

chief among the issues was the tit-for-tat spat over government subsidies for europe ’ s airbus consortium and boeing . after the meeting , the men announced they would continue talking over the new few weeks to try to settle their differences by negotiation , but would retain the option of litigation through the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- . " if we are going to avoid litigation in pursuit of the cases that both of us have now entered , we are going to have to have some pretty serious discussions about the alternative to that litigation , " mandelson told reporters . " i am interested in seeing how we can resolve our differences through a proper set of negotiations , " he added . his us counterpart , zoellick , said that if negotiations did not succeed , " litigation is an option " and that the bush administration was prepared for that eventuality . fresh start mandelson , a close ally of british prime minister tony blair , had promised “ a fresh start ” in transatlantic negotiations which turned bad after the united states filed a complaint with the wto in october challenging european loans to help airbus develop aircraft , such as the new a380 super-jumbo jet .
the eu responded by filing its own case against the us government over aid for boeing . the filing of cases triggered a 60-day consultation period , which expired monday .
ordinarily the failure to reach a settlement by consensus would prompt one or both of the parties to ask the wto to settle the case by a special panel and ultimately result in punitive sanctions .

chief among the issues was the tit-for-tat spat over government subsidies for europe ’ s airbus consortium and boeing . after the meeting , the men announced they would continue talking over the new few weeks to try to settle their differences by negotiation , but would retain the option of litigation through the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- . " if we are going to avoid litigation in pursuit of the cases that both of us have now entered , we are going to have to have some pretty serious discussions about the alternative to that litigation , " mandelson told reporters . " i am interested in seeing how we can resolve our differences through a proper set of negotiations , " he added . his us counterpart , zoellick , said that if negotiations did not succeed , " litigation is an option " and that the bush administration was prepared for that eventuality . fresh start mandelson , a close ally of british prime minister tony blair , had promised “ a fresh start ” in transatlantic negotiations which turned bad after the united states filed a complaint with the wto in october challenging european loans to help airbus develop aircraft , such as the new a380 super-jumbo jet .
the eu responded by filing its own case against the us government over aid for boeing . the filing of cases triggered a 60-day consultation period , which expired monday .
ordinarily the failure to reach a settlement by consensus would prompt one or both of the parties to ask the wto to settle the case by a special panel and ultimately result in punitive sanctions .

chief among the issues was the tit-for-tat spat over government subsidies for europe ’ s airbus consortium and boeing . after the meeting , the men announced they would continue talking over the new few weeks to try to settle their differences by negotiation , but would retain the option of litigation through the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- . " if we are going to avoid litigation in pursuit of the cases that both of us have now entered , we are going to have to have some pretty serious discussions about the alternative to that litigation , " mandelson told reporters . " i am interested in seeing how we can resolve our differences through a proper set of negotiations , " he added . his us counterpart , zoellick , said that if negotiations did not succeed , " litigation is an option " and that the bush administration was prepared for that eventuality . fresh start mandelson , a close ally of british prime minister tony blair , had promised “ a fresh start ” in transatlantic negotiations which turned bad after the united states filed a complaint with the wto in october challenging european loans to help airbus develop aircraft , such as the new a380 super-jumbo jet .
the eu responded by filing its own case against the us government over aid for boeing . the filing of cases triggered a 60-day consultation period , which expired monday .
ordinarily the failure to reach a settlement by consensus would prompt one or both of the parties to ask the wto to settle the case by a special panel and ultimately result in punitive sanctions .
but on thursday a us official said washington would delay referring its complaint to the wto in order to allow mandelson time to review the matter . bumpy ride ? according to eu trade experts , boeing has received around $ 23 billion -lrb- € 17.1 billion -rrb- in governmental development aid since 1992 .
the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- – the major owner in the airbus conglomerate – has taken the american competitor to task for profiting from us defense department subsidies for research in aviation and space science and nasa projects . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus a318 the us accuses the eu of handing out “ unfair subsidies amounting to billions of dollars ” for the development of airbus , a four-country consortium designed to rival the market leader boeing in building giant commercial aircraft . the aviation dispute is only the latest in a series of trade rivalries between the european union and the us .
only in october were the two sides able to find a solution to a year-long row over sanctions the eu had applied as a response to us corporate tax breaks for companies with foreign operations . all clear for take off while the international trade dispute over aviation simmers , airbus developers in germany announced that the last obstacle to extending the runway at the hamburg production facility finkenwerder had been cleared . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus construction facility for the a318 , a319 , a321 and a380 in hamburg after months of negotiations with owners of property adjacent to the proposed runway , the city council on monday announced it had purchased four parcels of land from a fruit orchard owner , paving the way for the tarmac to be extended to the necessary length for the arrival of the new a380 super-jumbo jets . the construction of the runway and the production of the a380 had been delayed for 18 months due to a land dispute .
a local church parish , which owned property bordering the finkenwerder facility , had refused to sell to land the city for the purpose of extending the airbus tarmac .
without a longer runway , the plant could not have built the super-size aircraft .
hamburg risked losing the lucrative contract and put 2,500 to 4,000 jobs in peril . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus sees light at the end of the runway the hamburg senate on thursday brought the two sides of the airbus hamburg runway dispute together and brokered an agreement that would see property sold to the aviation plant for expansion purposes .

the resulting bans are something of a measure of last resort . banned from city centers occasionally banning diesel powered cars without particle filters from city centers would help keep the amount of microscopic particulate pollution , which a german federal environmental agency study showed contributed to the premature death of 14,000 people last year , within acceptable levels .
the particulate pollution has been linked to cancer and a host of other health problems . according to the council of german cities , the bans may start as soon as february , when weather conditions tend to increase the particulate pollution problem .

in july , after months of resistance , the german car industry agreed to start installing filters in all its new domestic diesel models by 2009 . previously , german car makers claimed that installing such filters would be too expensive , but they eventually conceded to their customers ' demands , many of whom wanted the filters .
if properly fitted , filters can reduce particulate emissions by up to 99 percent . though filters will be standard in all new models from 2009 onwards , that still leaves the matter of the many diesel cars which will be sold without filters over the next four years , and those already on the road .
diesel cars currently make up 40 percent of all new european sales . some german car parts makers , including hjs , have been manufacturing filters priced at around € 700 -lrb- $ 934 -rrb- , which can be installed in older model cars . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cars get diesel filters by 2009 after years of stalling on the issue , the german car industry has decided to introduce serial production of emission filters for diesel cars .

with a complete online archive , a multimedia exhibit and a virtual opera , the classical composer is paving the way to the future . even the most classical of composers eventually find their way into the contemporary stage of the internet .
for germany ’ s favorite musical son , ludwig van beethoven , the entry into the digital era was six years in the making , but the bonn beethoven house hopes the launch of a comprehensive online archive and research center will usher in the rebirth – or at least the revival – of a musical tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house in bonn , germany .
the world ’ s largest beehoven collection , housed in the composer ’ s birthplace in bonn , germany , has turned itself into a state-of-the-art musical complex drawing on the latest in digital technology and information science .
starting this week , beethoven fans around the world will have access to the collection ’ s huge library of musical notations , letters and other objects from the composer ’ s life as well as a virtual tour through the house ’ s exhibits and a forum for the exploration of music and new media . free access for music lovers according to the museum ’ s organizers the project is “ a unique example of how a cultural institution focusing on a composer can create a modern connection between the traditional approach to his works and the use of new media . ” for a cost of € 4.5 million -lrb- $ 6.03 million -rrb- , more than 26,000 historical documents and images were scanned , digitalized and catalogued in a giant database by the fraunhofer institute for media communication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's score for the ninth symphony until their internet debut , many of the first editions , manuscripts and pictures of the composer never appeared for viewing by the general public .
because of their extremely fragile nature and value , only researchers and beethoven interpreters were allowed access to them .
the internet site changes that by providing free access to fans any where in the world . it also provides audio samples of key works and reads letters out loud to visitors . “ the digital beethoven house enables us to preserve the original documents while still informing the world about our unique collection and introducing the composer to completely new audiences , ” said museum director andreas eckhardt . cultural bridges through the ages in the beethoven house itself , visitors can take part in a stage for music visualization , a forum where new media is used to interpret beethoven ’ s works in a visual way .
inaugurated with the performance of “ fidelio , 21st century , ” a musical performance that combines beethoven ’ s only opera with 3-d computer graphics and sounds and transfers it to abstract geometrical characters on a projected stage . the protagonists of beethoven ’ s “ fidelio ” – spirals , planes and fields of color – fly across the specially created stage in the basement of the composer ’ s birth house as visitors take joysticks in hand and manipulate them to the tones of the composition .
an integrated sound system allows the music to follow the figures through the room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven , born 1770 in bonn , died 1827 in vienna “ with this step into the digital world , we hope to reach out to young people especially , ” eckhardt said , justifying the investment in new and interactive media .
it is the first project of its kind bridging traditional music with futuristic elements and technology , he said . the museum director is convinced the digitalization of the beethoven house and the introduction of more experimental musical fields will go a long way in promoting not only the composer , but also lead to new interpretations of his work and further questioning about the connection between music and multimedia . on a more pragmatic side , eckhardt expects the project to attract more visitors to the brick-and-mortar exhibits . “ yearly we have about 90,000 to 100,000 visitors at the house in bonn , ” he said .

with a complete online archive , a multimedia exhibit and a virtual opera , the classical composer is paving the way to the future . even the most classical of composers eventually find their way into the contemporary stage of the internet .
for germany ’ s favorite musical son , ludwig van beethoven , the entry into the digital era was six years in the making , but the bonn beethoven house hopes the launch of a comprehensive online archive and research center will usher in the rebirth – or at least the revival – of a musical tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house in bonn , germany .
the world ’ s largest beehoven collection , housed in the composer ’ s birthplace in bonn , germany , has turned itself into a state-of-the-art musical complex drawing on the latest in digital technology and information science .
starting this week , beethoven fans around the world will have access to the collection ’ s huge library of musical notations , letters and other objects from the composer ’ s life as well as a virtual tour through the house ’ s exhibits and a forum for the exploration of music and new media . free access for music lovers according to the museum ’ s organizers the project is “ a unique example of how a cultural institution focusing on a composer can create a modern connection between the traditional approach to his works and the use of new media . ” for a cost of € 4.5 million -lrb- $ 6.03 million -rrb- , more than 26,000 historical documents and images were scanned , digitalized and catalogued in a giant database by the fraunhofer institute for media communication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's score for the ninth symphony until their internet debut , many of the first editions , manuscripts and pictures of the composer never appeared for viewing by the general public .
because of their extremely fragile nature and value , only researchers and beethoven interpreters were allowed access to them .
the internet site changes that by providing free access to fans any where in the world . it also provides audio samples of key works and reads letters out loud to visitors . “ the digital beethoven house enables us to preserve the original documents while still informing the world about our unique collection and introducing the composer to completely new audiences , ” said museum director andreas eckhardt . cultural bridges through the ages in the beethoven house itself , visitors can take part in a stage for music visualization , a forum where new media is used to interpret beethoven ’ s works in a visual way .
inaugurated with the performance of “ fidelio , 21st century , ” a musical performance that combines beethoven ’ s only opera with 3-d computer graphics and sounds and transfers it to abstract geometrical characters on a projected stage . the protagonists of beethoven ’ s “ fidelio ” – spirals , planes and fields of color – fly across the specially created stage in the basement of the composer ’ s birth house as visitors take joysticks in hand and manipulate them to the tones of the composition .
an integrated sound system allows the music to follow the figures through the room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven , born 1770 in bonn , died 1827 in vienna “ with this step into the digital world , we hope to reach out to young people especially , ” eckhardt said , justifying the investment in new and interactive media .
it is the first project of its kind bridging traditional music with futuristic elements and technology , he said . the museum director is convinced the digitalization of the beethoven house and the introduction of more experimental musical fields will go a long way in promoting not only the composer , but also lead to new interpretations of his work and further questioning about the connection between music and multimedia . on a more pragmatic side , eckhardt expects the project to attract more visitors to the brick-and-mortar exhibits . “ yearly we have about 90,000 to 100,000 visitors at the house in bonn , ” he said .

the resulting bans are something of a measure of last resort . banned from city centers occasionally banning diesel powered cars without particle filters from city centers would help keep the amount of microscopic particulate pollution , which a german federal environmental agency study showed contributed to the premature death of 14,000 people last year , within acceptable levels .
the particulate pollution has been linked to cancer and a host of other health problems . according to the council of german cities , the bans may start as soon as february , when weather conditions tend to increase the particulate pollution problem . " we assume that there will be driving bans in all the big german cities , in built-up areas and indeed several times a year depending on weather and traffic conditions , " jürgen resch of the duh , a german environmental organization , told reuters . the bans have also received the blessing of germany 's environment minister , jürgen trittin . filters to be introduced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of 2009 , filters will be installed in new diesel models in a few years ' time , diesel powered cars without filters will be less of an issue .
in july , after months of resistance , the german car industry agreed to start installing filters in all its new domestic diesel models by 2009 . previously , german car makers claimed that installing such filters would be too expensive , but they eventually conceded to their customers ' demands , many of whom wanted the filters .
if properly fitted , filters can reduce particulate emissions by up to 99 percent . though filters will be standard in all new models from 2009 onwards , that still leaves the matter of the many diesel cars which will be sold without filters over the next four years , and those already on the road .
diesel cars currently make up 40 percent of all new european sales . some german car parts makers , including hjs , have been manufacturing filters priced at around € 700 -lrb- $ 934 -rrb- , which can be installed in older model cars . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cars get diesel filters by 2009 after years of stalling on the issue , the german car industry has decided to introduce serial production of emission filters for diesel cars .
the announcement comes amidst mounting pressure from environmentalists .
-lrb- july 14 , 2004 -rrb- debate over diesel car filters heats up german car manufacturers and environmentalists are battling over diesel cars .
should they be fitted with filters , and should motorists who opt for so-called " clean diesel " models be given tax breaks ?
-lrb- july 6 , 2004 -rrb- feedback does the new regulation go far enough , or too far when it comes to banning diesel cars from city centers on some days ?

lufthansa airlines has reached an agreement with pilots to freeze pay and make hours more flexible .
it 's part of the company 's strategy to get out of the economic blues largely brought on by low-cost carriers . german powerhouse lufthansa may be europe 's third-largest airline , but lately it has felt something like gulliver tied down by an onslaught of lilliputians in the guise of europe 's budget air carriers like ryanair or easyjet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang mayrhuber , ceo of lufthansa that 's why ceo wolfgang mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- has embarked on a campaign to slash costs at the airline , which at the end of last year found itself swimming in a sea of red ink and wondering about its long-term chances of survival in an era where early bookers can fly from germany to the uk for € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- on low-cost carriers . on monday , the company reached a pay deal with the union representing 4,400 pilots that included a wage freeze for 23 months .
the agreement will save the company more than € 30 million a year . the agreement , which will take retroactive effect to may 1 , 2004 and runs until march 31 , 2006 , includes lower starting pay for new pilots , requires an extra two hours a month flying time before overtime kicks in and generally makes working times more flexible . chief lufthansa negotiator stefan lauer said the agreement was " a milestone in concerted action to ensure competitive personnel costs . "
the pilots ' union vereinigung cockpit said the deal includes improvements in pension arrangements and brings the low-cost affiliate germanwings into the company 's collective bargaining agreement . turbulent few years in addition to cut-throat competition from the discount carriers , lufthansa has also been hit by a decline in air travel , attributed to the terrorist attacks in the united states on sept .

nevertheless , it 's a good indication that they can reach a settlement with the other unions , " such as those representing the company 's 38,000 ground crew and 14,000 flight attendants . besides the cost cutting , lufthansa has been lowering fares and making ticketing more flexible in an attempt to attract customers .

the company 's cost-cutting plans combined with increased passenger numbers appear to be having an effect , and the carrier announced a third quarter profit of € 125 million , largely due to an increase in air traffic revenue of 10 percent . mayrhuber said cuts still needed to be deeper and problems of overcapacity addressed if the company is to stay healthy in the long run .

the resulting bans are something of a measure of last resort . banned from city centers occasionally banning diesel powered cars without particle filters from city centers would help keep the amount of microscopic particulate pollution , which a german federal environmental agency study showed contributed to the premature death of 14,000 people last year , within acceptable levels .
the particulate pollution has been linked to cancer and a host of other health problems . according to the council of german cities , the bans may start as soon as february , when weather conditions tend to increase the particulate pollution problem . " we assume that there will be driving bans in all the big german cities , in built-up areas and indeed several times a year depending on weather and traffic conditions , " jürgen resch of the duh , a german environmental organization , told reuters . the bans have also received the blessing of germany 's environment minister , jürgen trittin . filters to be introduced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of 2009 , filters will be installed in new diesel models in a few years ' time , diesel powered cars without filters will be less of an issue .
in july , after months of resistance , the german car industry agreed to start installing filters in all its new domestic diesel models by 2009 . previously , german car makers claimed that installing such filters would be too expensive , but they eventually conceded to their customers ' demands , many of whom wanted the filters .
if properly fitted , filters can reduce particulate emissions by up to 99 percent . though filters will be standard in all new models from 2009 onwards , that still leaves the matter of the many diesel cars which will be sold without filters over the next four years , and those already on the road .
diesel cars currently make up 40 percent of all new european sales . some german car parts makers , including hjs , have been manufacturing filters priced at around € 700 -lrb- $ 934 -rrb- , which can be installed in older model cars . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cars get diesel filters by 2009 after years of stalling on the issue , the german car industry has decided to introduce serial production of emission filters for diesel cars .

lufthansa airlines has reached an agreement with pilots to freeze pay and make hours more flexible .
it 's part of the company 's strategy to get out of the economic blues largely brought on by low-cost carriers . german powerhouse lufthansa may be europe 's third-largest airline , but lately it has felt something like gulliver tied down by an onslaught of lilliputians in the guise of europe 's budget air carriers like ryanair or easyjet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang mayrhuber , ceo of lufthansa that 's why ceo wolfgang mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- has embarked on a campaign to slash costs at the airline , which at the end of last year found itself swimming in a sea of red ink and wondering about its long-term chances of survival in an era where early bookers can fly from germany to the uk for € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- on low-cost carriers . on monday , the company reached a pay deal with the union representing 4,400 pilots that included a wage freeze for 23 months .
the agreement will save the company more than € 30 million a year . the agreement , which will take retroactive effect to may 1 , 2004 and runs until march 31 , 2006 , includes lower starting pay for new pilots , requires an extra two hours a month flying time before overtime kicks in and generally makes working times more flexible . chief lufthansa negotiator stefan lauer said the agreement was " a milestone in concerted action to ensure competitive personnel costs . "
the pilots ' union vereinigung cockpit said the deal includes improvements in pension arrangements and brings the low-cost affiliate germanwings into the company 's collective bargaining agreement . turbulent few years in addition to cut-throat competition from the discount carriers , lufthansa has also been hit by a decline in air travel , attributed to the terrorist attacks in the united states on sept .

ceo mayrhuber , 57 , decided to take drastic action , which he first outlined in november 2003 . already familiar with slashing costs - he was placed in charge of cost-cutting in 1992 to save the carrier from bankruptcy - he announced a plan to turn lufthansa 's fortunes around in the next two years by cutting € 1.2 billion or some 20 percent .
he said 2,000 jobs would be eliminated by 2005 , following 3,600 that were cut due to a hiring freeze put into place last year . is it enough ? but some analysts wonder if lufthansa is flying fast enough to stay above insolvency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agreement is " nice to have , but it 's not a big step , " uwe weinreich , an analyst with hvb bank in munich told bloomberg .
" it 's only a € 30 million chunk out of € 4.6 billion in personnel costs every year .
nevertheless , it 's a good indication that they can reach a settlement with the other unions , " such as those representing the company 's 38,000 ground crew and 14,000 flight attendants . besides the cost cutting , lufthansa has been lowering fares and making ticketing more flexible in an attempt to attract customers .
even so , lufthansa 's fares on short-haul routes are still often triple those of low-cost competitors . still , things appear to be looking up .
the company 's cost-cutting plans combined with increased passenger numbers appear to be having an effect , and the carrier announced a third quarter profit of € 125 million , largely due to an increase in air traffic revenue of 10 percent . mayrhuber said cuts still needed to be deeper and problems of overcapacity addressed if the company is to stay healthy in the long run . " our current numbers should not hide the fact that we clearly need better operating earnings , in order to secure the future of the enterprise for the next generation , " he said last month . but after monday 's pay agreement , he was feeling somewhat better .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.12.2004 german arms exports under fire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german made , south africa bound days after a report confirmed an increase in german arms exports , chancellor schröder promised to help end the eu embargo imposed on arms sales to china .
critics say germany is too eager to export to questionable buyers . last wednesday , the german government released its annual report documenting the number of german-made arms exported abroad .
the report confirmed an upward trend , with foreign sales reaching an all time high of € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- in 2003 , compared to € 318 million in 2002 and € 367 million in 2001 , firmly establishing germany as the world 's fourth largest arms producer . while the increase was partly explained by the sale of a few big ticket items , including a submarine worth € 210 million to south africa , arms control advocates say the german government is all too willing to allow the sale of arms and military hardware to countries engaged in conflict or with questionable human rights records .
they point to recent sales to nigeria and india . less than a week after the report was released , german chancellor gerhard schröder kicked off a trip to china , where he promised to lobby the international community to end an arms embargo imposed in the wake of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre .
he thereby signalled his government 's willingness to further liberalize germany 's arms export policies . with the global weapons trade worth more than € 521 billion -lrb- $ 700 billion -rrb- per year , it 's not surprising that schröder , struggling with a stagnant economy and high unemployment , wants to provide a boost to a highly profitable domestic business .
but arms control advocates - with the support of green party parliamentarians - have vowed to block his efforts . government says proper checks met bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german " leopard " tanks fetch top dollar .
following widespread pressure in the late 1990 's to impose more control on the international arms trade , the german governing coalition of social democrats and greens - who campaigned promising more transparency - issued the first annual report in 2000 documenting german arms exports . that same year , the government toughened laws governing arms exports and gave an oversight committee , known as bafa , final approval over all foreign sales .
according to the rules , such sales can only be completed after it is established that the weapons are n't intended for conflict zones or countries with poor human rights records . in a press release accompanying this year 's report , the government claimed 67 percent of 2003 exports were bound for eu or nato allies and permission for the remaining exports was only granted after a careful check and bafa review were carried out . critics take issue with report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german arms sales remain undetected in official reports , say critics .
but bernhart moltmann , chairman of the study group on german arms exports of the joint conference church and development -lrb- gkke -rrb- , which will issue its own report on german arms exports next wednesday , said the government report misrepresents the facts . " the numbers given are n't clear , " he told dw-world .
" they are directed to give a good impression . " he points to the fact that more arms are bound for so-called " developing countries " than the report indicates because the government used its own definition of a " developing country , " rather than the one generally agreed upon by the development assistance committee -lrb- dac -rrb- of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . " there are problems with the definitions used , " he said . loopholes remain in addition to finding fault with the definitions used , some experts also point to loopholes in the rules . siemon wezeman , the acting head of the arms transfers project at the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- , does not dispute the government 's claim that the majority of weapons defined as " arms , " according to the criteria used to compile the government report , are bound for the eu and nato allies . of greater concern , according to wezeman , are the individual components , such as engines , which are not counted in the report and are not subject to the approval of bafa .
they may be installed in , say , a french tank and ultimately end up in the middle east or elsewhere . " we only have the figures for the major weapons systems , but not for the smaller components , " he told dw-world .
" it 's a loophole and a way for german-made arms to end up pretty much anywhere in the world . " winfried nachtwei , a deputy parliamentary leader for the green party and claudia roth , head of the greens , issued a press release on the same day the government arms report was released promising to look into ways to close the loopholes and make all german arms - whether entire weapons systems or individual components - accountable to the same checks and restrictions . just political posturing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder has promised to help lift the arms embargo on china .
if chancellor schröder intends to pave the way for german companies to sell sophisticated weapons systems to china , he could have a tough fight on his hands .
five years ago , the green party successfully blocked the controversial sale of german-made tanks to turkey . wezeman , of sipri , suspects chancellor schröder 's effort to help convince the eu to end the chinese arms embargo is pure political posturing .
even if the eu agrees , the united states has made its intention to block weapons sales to china very clear and has promised not to do business with european countries that sell arms to beijing . " he wants to make german policy look china friendly to open the civilian market , not the arms market , " said wezeman . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany mulls tanks sale to turkey barely a week after the european commission recommended initiating membership talks with turkey , the german government is reportedly considering to deliver tanks to that country .

critics say germany is too eager to export to questionable buyers . last wednesday , the german government released its annual report documenting the number of german-made arms exported abroad .
the report confirmed an upward trend , with foreign sales reaching an all time high of € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- in 2003 , compared to € 318 million in 2002 and € 367 million in 2001 , firmly establishing germany as the world 's fourth largest arms producer . while the increase was partly explained by the sale of a few big ticket items , including a submarine worth € 210 million to south africa , arms control advocates say the german government is all too willing to allow the sale of arms and military hardware to countries engaged in conflict or with questionable human rights records .
they point to recent sales to nigeria and india . less than a week after the report was released , german chancellor gerhard schröder kicked off a trip to china , where he promised to lobby the international community to end an arms embargo imposed in the wake of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre .
he thereby signalled his government 's willingness to further liberalize germany 's arms export policies . with the global weapons trade worth more than € 521 billion -lrb- $ 700 billion -rrb- per year , it 's not surprising that schröder , struggling with a stagnant economy and high unemployment , wants to provide a boost to a highly profitable domestic business .
but arms control advocates - with the support of green party parliamentarians - have vowed to block his efforts . government says proper checks met bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german " leopard " tanks fetch top dollar .
following widespread pressure in the late 1990 's to impose more control on the international arms trade , the german governing coalition of social democrats and greens - who campaigned promising more transparency - issued the first annual report in 2000 documenting german arms exports . that same year , the government toughened laws governing arms exports and gave an oversight committee , known as bafa , final approval over all foreign sales .
according to the rules , such sales can only be completed after it is established that the weapons are n't intended for conflict zones or countries with poor human rights records . in a press release accompanying this year 's report , the government claimed 67 percent of 2003 exports were bound for eu or nato allies and permission for the remaining exports was only granted after a careful check and bafa review were carried out . critics take issue with report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german arms sales remain undetected in official reports , say critics .
but bernhart moltmann , chairman of the study group on german arms exports of the joint conference church and development -lrb- gkke -rrb- , which will issue its own report on german arms exports next wednesday , said the government report misrepresents the facts . " the numbers given are n't clear , " he told dw-world .
" they are directed to give a good impression . " he points to the fact that more arms are bound for so-called " developing countries " than the report indicates because the government used its own definition of a " developing country , " rather than the one generally agreed upon by the development assistance committee -lrb- dac -rrb- of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . " there are problems with the definitions used , " he said . loopholes remain in addition to finding fault with the definitions used , some experts also point to loopholes in the rules . siemon wezeman , the acting head of the arms transfers project at the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- , does not dispute the government 's claim that the majority of weapons defined as " arms , " according to the criteria used to compile the government report , are bound for the eu and nato allies . of greater concern , according to wezeman , are the individual components , such as engines , which are not counted in the report and are not subject to the approval of bafa .
they may be installed in , say , a french tank and ultimately end up in the middle east or elsewhere . " we only have the figures for the major weapons systems , but not for the smaller components , " he told dw-world .
" it 's a loophole and a way for german-made arms to end up pretty much anywhere in the world . " winfried nachtwei , a deputy parliamentary leader for the green party and claudia roth , head of the greens , issued a press release on the same day the government arms report was released promising to look into ways to close the loopholes and make all german arms - whether entire weapons systems or individual components - accountable to the same checks and restrictions . just political posturing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder has promised to help lift the arms embargo on china .
if chancellor schröder intends to pave the way for german companies to sell sophisticated weapons systems to china , he could have a tough fight on his hands .
five years ago , the green party successfully blocked the controversial sale of german-made tanks to turkey . wezeman , of sipri , suspects chancellor schröder 's effort to help convince the eu to end the chinese arms embargo is pure political posturing .

the three men had been under close surveillance by german intelligence following a tip-off from kurdish agents in northern iraq . the kurdish intelligence service had passed on the telephone numbers of the three iraqis .
the numbers were found in a notebook of a kurd suspected to be an important courier for ansar al islam .
german general prosecutor kay nehm said the arrest warrants were issued because the three men are accused of belonging to a terrorist network . he admitted , however , that house searches had failed to uncover any weapons or explosives which could have suggested that the suspects were planning to kill the iraqi prime minister . “ in germany , ansar-al-islam members are known to be involved in fund-raising campaigns , human trafficking and the forging of passports and other documents , ” nehm told reporters .

the three men had been under close surveillance by german intelligence following a tip-off from kurdish agents in northern iraq . the kurdish intelligence service had passed on the telephone numbers of the three iraqis .
the numbers were found in a notebook of a kurd suspected to be an important courier for ansar al islam .
german general prosecutor kay nehm said the arrest warrants were issued because the three men are accused of belonging to a terrorist network . he admitted , however , that house searches had failed to uncover any weapons or explosives which could have suggested that the suspects were planning to kill the iraqi prime minister . “ in germany , ansar-al-islam members are known to be involved in fund-raising campaigns , human trafficking and the forging of passports and other documents , ” nehm told reporters .
“ so far we have no record of them using force or carrying out assassinations here . ” on monday , a fourth suspect of lebanese origin was set free again after initial suspicions turned out to be groundless . high political profile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily interior minister otto schily has been trying to profit politically from the events surrounding allawi ’ s visit in berlin .
insisting that an assassination plot had been thwarted , he sought to highlight the efficiency of the domestic intelligence services and the positive impact of the country ’ s new anti-terror legislation .
schily had initiated the hard-hitting laws after the sept .
11 attacks on the united states . “ we ’ re responsible for the security of state leaders visiting us , ” he said .
“ we will do whatever we feel is required to ensure the safety of a guest .
in the case of prime minister ayad allawi , we also took all the necessary precautions and didn ’ t leave anything to chance . ” “ terrorists should know that our intelligence services are well informed about their intentions at any given time , no matter where and how they plan to step into action , ” schily added . bavarian interior minister günter beckstein , a member of the conservative christian social union , acknowledged that german intelligence performed well in the run-up to the allawi visit . “ the good news is that the german intelligence services are able to keep such a tight check on potentially dangerous people so that they are not in a position to commit acts of terror here , ” he said .
“ it ’ s gratifying to know that the safety of mr. allawi was ensured throughout his visit to berlin .
this goes to show that cooperation between the various intelligence people at regional and national level leaves nothing to be desired . ” hidden criticism but beckstein ’ s praise was not without a bit of hidden criticism directed towards schily and the minister ’ s plans to reorganize the intelligence services . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's conservative state interior minister günther beckstein the bavarian politician ’ s reference to cooperation between security services was intended as a rebuke to otto schily , who had recently launched a campaign to centralize intelligence gathering at national level .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.12.2004 german arms exports under fire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german made , south africa bound days after a report confirmed an increase in german arms exports , chancellor schröder promised to help end the eu embargo imposed on arms sales to china .
critics say germany is too eager to export to questionable buyers . last wednesday , the german government released its annual report documenting the number of german-made arms exported abroad .
the report confirmed an upward trend , with foreign sales reaching an all time high of € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- in 2003 , compared to € 318 million in 2002 and € 367 million in 2001 , firmly establishing germany as the world 's fourth largest arms producer . while the increase was partly explained by the sale of a few big ticket items , including a submarine worth € 210 million to south africa , arms control advocates say the german government is all too willing to allow the sale of arms and military hardware to countries engaged in conflict or with questionable human rights records .
they point to recent sales to nigeria and india . less than a week after the report was released , german chancellor gerhard schröder kicked off a trip to china , where he promised to lobby the international community to end an arms embargo imposed in the wake of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre .
he thereby signalled his government 's willingness to further liberalize germany 's arms export policies . with the global weapons trade worth more than € 521 billion -lrb- $ 700 billion -rrb- per year , it 's not surprising that schröder , struggling with a stagnant economy and high unemployment , wants to provide a boost to a highly profitable domestic business .
but arms control advocates - with the support of green party parliamentarians - have vowed to block his efforts . government says proper checks met bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german " leopard " tanks fetch top dollar .
following widespread pressure in the late 1990 's to impose more control on the international arms trade , the german governing coalition of social democrats and greens - who campaigned promising more transparency - issued the first annual report in 2000 documenting german arms exports . that same year , the government toughened laws governing arms exports and gave an oversight committee , known as bafa , final approval over all foreign sales .
according to the rules , such sales can only be completed after it is established that the weapons are n't intended for conflict zones or countries with poor human rights records . in a press release accompanying this year 's report , the government claimed 67 percent of 2003 exports were bound for eu or nato allies and permission for the remaining exports was only granted after a careful check and bafa review were carried out . critics take issue with report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german arms sales remain undetected in official reports , say critics .
but bernhart moltmann , chairman of the study group on german arms exports of the joint conference church and development -lrb- gkke -rrb- , which will issue its own report on german arms exports next wednesday , said the government report misrepresents the facts . " the numbers given are n't clear , " he told dw-world .
" they are directed to give a good impression . " he points to the fact that more arms are bound for so-called " developing countries " than the report indicates because the government used its own definition of a " developing country , " rather than the one generally agreed upon by the development assistance committee -lrb- dac -rrb- of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . " there are problems with the definitions used , " he said . loopholes remain in addition to finding fault with the definitions used , some experts also point to loopholes in the rules . siemon wezeman , the acting head of the arms transfers project at the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- , does not dispute the government 's claim that the majority of weapons defined as " arms , " according to the criteria used to compile the government report , are bound for the eu and nato allies . of greater concern , according to wezeman , are the individual components , such as engines , which are not counted in the report and are not subject to the approval of bafa .
they may be installed in , say , a french tank and ultimately end up in the middle east or elsewhere . " we only have the figures for the major weapons systems , but not for the smaller components , " he told dw-world .
" it 's a loophole and a way for german-made arms to end up pretty much anywhere in the world . " winfried nachtwei , a deputy parliamentary leader for the green party and claudia roth , head of the greens , issued a press release on the same day the government arms report was released promising to look into ways to close the loopholes and make all german arms - whether entire weapons systems or individual components - accountable to the same checks and restrictions . just political posturing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder has promised to help lift the arms embargo on china .
if chancellor schröder intends to pave the way for german companies to sell sophisticated weapons systems to china , he could have a tough fight on his hands .
five years ago , the green party successfully blocked the controversial sale of german-made tanks to turkey . wezeman , of sipri , suspects chancellor schröder 's effort to help convince the eu to end the chinese arms embargo is pure political posturing .
even if the eu agrees , the united states has made its intention to block weapons sales to china very clear and has promised not to do business with european countries that sell arms to beijing . " he wants to make german policy look china friendly to open the civilian market , not the arms market , " said wezeman . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany mulls tanks sale to turkey barely a week after the european commission recommended initiating membership talks with turkey , the german government is reportedly considering to deliver tanks to that country .

critics say germany is too eager to export to questionable buyers . last wednesday , the german government released its annual report documenting the number of german-made arms exported abroad .
the report confirmed an upward trend , with foreign sales reaching an all time high of € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- in 2003 , compared to € 318 million in 2002 and € 367 million in 2001 , firmly establishing germany as the world 's fourth largest arms producer . while the increase was partly explained by the sale of a few big ticket items , including a submarine worth € 210 million to south africa , arms control advocates say the german government is all too willing to allow the sale of arms and military hardware to countries engaged in conflict or with questionable human rights records .
they point to recent sales to nigeria and india . less than a week after the report was released , german chancellor gerhard schröder kicked off a trip to china , where he promised to lobby the international community to end an arms embargo imposed in the wake of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre .
he thereby signalled his government 's willingness to further liberalize germany 's arms export policies . with the global weapons trade worth more than € 521 billion -lrb- $ 700 billion -rrb- per year , it 's not surprising that schröder , struggling with a stagnant economy and high unemployment , wants to provide a boost to a highly profitable domestic business .
but arms control advocates - with the support of green party parliamentarians - have vowed to block his efforts . government says proper checks met bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german " leopard " tanks fetch top dollar .
following widespread pressure in the late 1990 's to impose more control on the international arms trade , the german governing coalition of social democrats and greens - who campaigned promising more transparency - issued the first annual report in 2000 documenting german arms exports . that same year , the government toughened laws governing arms exports and gave an oversight committee , known as bafa , final approval over all foreign sales .
according to the rules , such sales can only be completed after it is established that the weapons are n't intended for conflict zones or countries with poor human rights records . in a press release accompanying this year 's report , the government claimed 67 percent of 2003 exports were bound for eu or nato allies and permission for the remaining exports was only granted after a careful check and bafa review were carried out . critics take issue with report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german arms sales remain undetected in official reports , say critics .
but bernhart moltmann , chairman of the study group on german arms exports of the joint conference church and development -lrb- gkke -rrb- , which will issue its own report on german arms exports next wednesday , said the government report misrepresents the facts . " the numbers given are n't clear , " he told dw-world .
" they are directed to give a good impression . " he points to the fact that more arms are bound for so-called " developing countries " than the report indicates because the government used its own definition of a " developing country , " rather than the one generally agreed upon by the development assistance committee -lrb- dac -rrb- of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . " there are problems with the definitions used , " he said . loopholes remain in addition to finding fault with the definitions used , some experts also point to loopholes in the rules . siemon wezeman , the acting head of the arms transfers project at the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- , does not dispute the government 's claim that the majority of weapons defined as " arms , " according to the criteria used to compile the government report , are bound for the eu and nato allies . of greater concern , according to wezeman , are the individual components , such as engines , which are not counted in the report and are not subject to the approval of bafa .
they may be installed in , say , a french tank and ultimately end up in the middle east or elsewhere . " we only have the figures for the major weapons systems , but not for the smaller components , " he told dw-world .
" it 's a loophole and a way for german-made arms to end up pretty much anywhere in the world . " winfried nachtwei , a deputy parliamentary leader for the green party and claudia roth , head of the greens , issued a press release on the same day the government arms report was released promising to look into ways to close the loopholes and make all german arms - whether entire weapons systems or individual components - accountable to the same checks and restrictions . just political posturing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder has promised to help lift the arms embargo on china .
if chancellor schröder intends to pave the way for german companies to sell sophisticated weapons systems to china , he could have a tough fight on his hands .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.12.2004 german arms exports under fire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german made , south africa bound days after a report confirmed an increase in german arms exports , chancellor schröder promised to help end the eu embargo imposed on arms sales to china .
critics say germany is too eager to export to questionable buyers . last wednesday , the german government released its annual report documenting the number of german-made arms exported abroad .
the report confirmed an upward trend , with foreign sales reaching an all time high of € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- in 2003 , compared to € 318 million in 2002 and € 367 million in 2001 , firmly establishing germany as the world 's fourth largest arms producer . while the increase was partly explained by the sale of a few big ticket items , including a submarine worth € 210 million to south africa , arms control advocates say the german government is all too willing to allow the sale of arms and military hardware to countries engaged in conflict or with questionable human rights records .
they point to recent sales to nigeria and india . less than a week after the report was released , german chancellor gerhard schröder kicked off a trip to china , where he promised to lobby the international community to end an arms embargo imposed in the wake of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre .
he thereby signalled his government 's willingness to further liberalize germany 's arms export policies . with the global weapons trade worth more than € 521 billion -lrb- $ 700 billion -rrb- per year , it 's not surprising that schröder , struggling with a stagnant economy and high unemployment , wants to provide a boost to a highly profitable domestic business .
but arms control advocates - with the support of green party parliamentarians - have vowed to block his efforts . government says proper checks met bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german " leopard " tanks fetch top dollar .
following widespread pressure in the late 1990 's to impose more control on the international arms trade , the german governing coalition of social democrats and greens - who campaigned promising more transparency - issued the first annual report in 2000 documenting german arms exports . that same year , the government toughened laws governing arms exports and gave an oversight committee , known as bafa , final approval over all foreign sales .
according to the rules , such sales can only be completed after it is established that the weapons are n't intended for conflict zones or countries with poor human rights records . in a press release accompanying this year 's report , the government claimed 67 percent of 2003 exports were bound for eu or nato allies and permission for the remaining exports was only granted after a careful check and bafa review were carried out . critics take issue with report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german arms sales remain undetected in official reports , say critics .
but bernhart moltmann , chairman of the study group on german arms exports of the joint conference church and development -lrb- gkke -rrb- , which will issue its own report on german arms exports next wednesday , said the government report misrepresents the facts . " the numbers given are n't clear , " he told dw-world .
" they are directed to give a good impression . " he points to the fact that more arms are bound for so-called " developing countries " than the report indicates because the government used its own definition of a " developing country , " rather than the one generally agreed upon by the development assistance committee -lrb- dac -rrb- of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . " there are problems with the definitions used , " he said . loopholes remain in addition to finding fault with the definitions used , some experts also point to loopholes in the rules . siemon wezeman , the acting head of the arms transfers project at the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- , does not dispute the government 's claim that the majority of weapons defined as " arms , " according to the criteria used to compile the government report , are bound for the eu and nato allies . of greater concern , according to wezeman , are the individual components , such as engines , which are not counted in the report and are not subject to the approval of bafa .
they may be installed in , say , a french tank and ultimately end up in the middle east or elsewhere . " we only have the figures for the major weapons systems , but not for the smaller components , " he told dw-world .
" it 's a loophole and a way for german-made arms to end up pretty much anywhere in the world . " winfried nachtwei , a deputy parliamentary leader for the green party and claudia roth , head of the greens , issued a press release on the same day the government arms report was released promising to look into ways to close the loopholes and make all german arms - whether entire weapons systems or individual components - accountable to the same checks and restrictions . just political posturing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder has promised to help lift the arms embargo on china .
if chancellor schröder intends to pave the way for german companies to sell sophisticated weapons systems to china , he could have a tough fight on his hands .
five years ago , the green party successfully blocked the controversial sale of german-made tanks to turkey . wezeman , of sipri , suspects chancellor schröder 's effort to help convince the eu to end the chinese arms embargo is pure political posturing .
even if the eu agrees , the united states has made its intention to block weapons sales to china very clear and has promised not to do business with european countries that sell arms to beijing . " he wants to make german policy look china friendly to open the civilian market , not the arms market , " said wezeman . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany mulls tanks sale to turkey barely a week after the european commission recommended initiating membership talks with turkey , the german government is reportedly considering to deliver tanks to that country .

the three men had been under close surveillance by german intelligence following a tip-off from kurdish agents in northern iraq . the kurdish intelligence service had passed on the telephone numbers of the three iraqis .
the numbers were found in a notebook of a kurd suspected to be an important courier for ansar al islam .
german general prosecutor kay nehm said the arrest warrants were issued because the three men are accused of belonging to a terrorist network . he admitted , however , that house searches had failed to uncover any weapons or explosives which could have suggested that the suspects were planning to kill the iraqi prime minister . “ in germany , ansar-al-islam members are known to be involved in fund-raising campaigns , human trafficking and the forging of passports and other documents , ” nehm told reporters .
“ so far we have no record of them using force or carrying out assassinations here . ” on monday , a fourth suspect of lebanese origin was set free again after initial suspicions turned out to be groundless . high political profile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily interior minister otto schily has been trying to profit politically from the events surrounding allawi ’ s visit in berlin .

“ we will do whatever we feel is required to ensure the safety of a guest .
in the case of prime minister ayad allawi , we also took all the necessary precautions and didn ’ t leave anything to chance . ” “ terrorists should know that our intelligence services are well informed about their intentions at any given time , no matter where and how they plan to step into action , ” schily added . bavarian interior minister günter beckstein , a member of the conservative christian social union , acknowledged that german intelligence performed well in the run-up to the allawi visit . “ the good news is that the german intelligence services are able to keep such a tight check on potentially dangerous people so that they are not in a position to commit acts of terror here , ” he said .
“ it ’ s gratifying to know that the safety of mr. allawi was ensured throughout his visit to berlin .
this goes to show that cooperation between the various intelligence people at regional and national level leaves nothing to be desired . ” hidden criticism but beckstein ’ s praise was not without a bit of hidden criticism directed towards schily and the minister ’ s plans to reorganize the intelligence services . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's conservative state interior minister günther beckstein the bavarian politician ’ s reference to cooperation between security services was intended as a rebuke to otto schily , who had recently launched a campaign to centralize intelligence gathering at national level .

the three men had been under close surveillance by german intelligence following a tip-off from kurdish agents in northern iraq . the kurdish intelligence service had passed on the telephone numbers of the three iraqis .
the numbers were found in a notebook of a kurd suspected to be an important courier for ansar al islam .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.12.2004 beethoven in bits and bytes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven enters the 21st century in bonn born more than 200 years ago , ludwig van beethoven has now come of age in the digital era .
with a complete online archive , a multimedia exhibit and a virtual opera , the classical composer is paving the way to the future . even the most classical of composers eventually find their way into the contemporary stage of the internet .
for germany ’ s favorite musical son , ludwig van beethoven , the entry into the digital era was six years in the making , but the bonn beethoven house hopes the launch of a comprehensive online archive and research center will usher in the rebirth – or at least the revival – of a musical tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house in bonn , germany .
the world ’ s largest beehoven collection , housed in the composer ’ s birthplace in bonn , germany , has turned itself into a state-of-the-art musical complex drawing on the latest in digital technology and information science .
starting this week , beethoven fans around the world will have access to the collection ’ s huge library of musical notations , letters and other objects from the composer ’ s life as well as a virtual tour through the house ’ s exhibits and a forum for the exploration of music and new media . free access for music lovers according to the museum ’ s organizers the project is “ a unique example of how a cultural institution focusing on a composer can create a modern connection between the traditional approach to his works and the use of new media . ” for a cost of € 4.5 million -lrb- $ 6.03 million -rrb- , more than 26,000 historical documents and images were scanned , digitalized and catalogued in a giant database by the fraunhofer institute for media communication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's score for the ninth symphony until their internet debut , many of the first editions , manuscripts and pictures of the composer never appeared for viewing by the general public .
because of their extremely fragile nature and value , only researchers and beethoven interpreters were allowed access to them .
the internet site changes that by providing free access to fans any where in the world . it also provides audio samples of key works and reads letters out loud to visitors . “ the digital beethoven house enables us to preserve the original documents while still informing the world about our unique collection and introducing the composer to completely new audiences , ” said museum director andreas eckhardt . cultural bridges through the ages in the beethoven house itself , visitors can take part in a stage for music visualization , a forum where new media is used to interpret beethoven ’ s works in a visual way .
inaugurated with the performance of “ fidelio , 21st century , ” a musical performance that combines beethoven ’ s only opera with 3-d computer graphics and sounds and transfers it to abstract geometrical characters on a projected stage . the protagonists of beethoven ’ s “ fidelio ” – spirals , planes and fields of color – fly across the specially created stage in the basement of the composer ’ s birth house as visitors take joysticks in hand and manipulate them to the tones of the composition .
an integrated sound system allows the music to follow the figures through the room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven , born 1770 in bonn , died 1827 in vienna “ with this step into the digital world , we hope to reach out to young people especially , ” eckhardt said , justifying the investment in new and interactive media .
it is the first project of its kind bridging traditional music with futuristic elements and technology , he said . the museum director is convinced the digitalization of the beethoven house and the introduction of more experimental musical fields will go a long way in promoting not only the composer , but also lead to new interpretations of his work and further questioning about the connection between music and multimedia . on a more pragmatic side , eckhardt expects the project to attract more visitors to the brick-and-mortar exhibits . “ yearly we have about 90,000 to 100,000 visitors at the house in bonn , ” he said .
“ i think these numbers could jump by 20 to 30 percent now . ” dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beethoven enters the modern era in bonn classical music fans from around the world are descending on bonn , germany , for the annual beethoven festival .

with a complete online archive , a multimedia exhibit and a virtual opera , the classical composer is paving the way to the future . even the most classical of composers eventually find their way into the contemporary stage of the internet .
for germany ’ s favorite musical son , ludwig van beethoven , the entry into the digital era was six years in the making , but the bonn beethoven house hopes the launch of a comprehensive online archive and research center will usher in the rebirth – or at least the revival – of a musical tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house in bonn , germany .
the world ’ s largest beehoven collection , housed in the composer ’ s birthplace in bonn , germany , has turned itself into a state-of-the-art musical complex drawing on the latest in digital technology and information science .
starting this week , beethoven fans around the world will have access to the collection ’ s huge library of musical notations , letters and other objects from the composer ’ s life as well as a virtual tour through the house ’ s exhibits and a forum for the exploration of music and new media . free access for music lovers according to the museum ’ s organizers the project is “ a unique example of how a cultural institution focusing on a composer can create a modern connection between the traditional approach to his works and the use of new media . ” for a cost of € 4.5 million -lrb- $ 6.03 million -rrb- , more than 26,000 historical documents and images were scanned , digitalized and catalogued in a giant database by the fraunhofer institute for media communication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's score for the ninth symphony until their internet debut , many of the first editions , manuscripts and pictures of the composer never appeared for viewing by the general public .
because of their extremely fragile nature and value , only researchers and beethoven interpreters were allowed access to them .
the internet site changes that by providing free access to fans any where in the world . it also provides audio samples of key works and reads letters out loud to visitors . “ the digital beethoven house enables us to preserve the original documents while still informing the world about our unique collection and introducing the composer to completely new audiences , ” said museum director andreas eckhardt . cultural bridges through the ages in the beethoven house itself , visitors can take part in a stage for music visualization , a forum where new media is used to interpret beethoven ’ s works in a visual way .
inaugurated with the performance of “ fidelio , 21st century , ” a musical performance that combines beethoven ’ s only opera with 3-d computer graphics and sounds and transfers it to abstract geometrical characters on a projected stage . the protagonists of beethoven ’ s “ fidelio ” – spirals , planes and fields of color – fly across the specially created stage in the basement of the composer ’ s birth house as visitors take joysticks in hand and manipulate them to the tones of the composition .
an integrated sound system allows the music to follow the figures through the room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven , born 1770 in bonn , died 1827 in vienna “ with this step into the digital world , we hope to reach out to young people especially , ” eckhardt said , justifying the investment in new and interactive media .
it is the first project of its kind bridging traditional music with futuristic elements and technology , he said . the museum director is convinced the digitalization of the beethoven house and the introduction of more experimental musical fields will go a long way in promoting not only the composer , but also lead to new interpretations of his work and further questioning about the connection between music and multimedia . on a more pragmatic side , eckhardt expects the project to attract more visitors to the brick-and-mortar exhibits . “ yearly we have about 90,000 to 100,000 visitors at the house in bonn , ” he said .

the internet site changes that by providing free access to fans any where in the world . it also provides audio samples of key works and reads letters out loud to visitors . “ the digital beethoven house enables us to preserve the original documents while still informing the world about our unique collection and introducing the composer to completely new audiences , ” said museum director andreas eckhardt . cultural bridges through the ages in the beethoven house itself , visitors can take part in a stage for music visualization , a forum where new media is used to interpret beethoven ’ s works in a visual way .
inaugurated with the performance of “ fidelio , 21st century , ” a musical performance that combines beethoven ’ s only opera with 3-d computer graphics and sounds and transfers it to abstract geometrical characters on a projected stage . the protagonists of beethoven ’ s “ fidelio ” – spirals , planes and fields of color – fly across the specially created stage in the basement of the composer ’ s birth house as visitors take joysticks in hand and manipulate them to the tones of the composition .
an integrated sound system allows the music to follow the figures through the room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven , born 1770 in bonn , died 1827 in vienna “ with this step into the digital world , we hope to reach out to young people especially , ” eckhardt said , justifying the investment in new and interactive media .
it is the first project of its kind bridging traditional music with futuristic elements and technology , he said . the museum director is convinced the digitalization of the beethoven house and the introduction of more experimental musical fields will go a long way in promoting not only the composer , but also lead to new interpretations of his work and further questioning about the connection between music and multimedia . on a more pragmatic side , eckhardt expects the project to attract more visitors to the brick-and-mortar exhibits . “ yearly we have about 90,000 to 100,000 visitors at the house in bonn , ” he said .
“ i think these numbers could jump by 20 to 30 percent now . ” dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beethoven enters the modern era in bonn classical music fans from around the world are descending on bonn , germany , for the annual beethoven festival .

it 's part of the company 's strategy to get out of the economic blues largely brought on by low-cost carriers . german powerhouse lufthansa may be europe 's third-largest airline , but lately it has felt something like gulliver tied down by an onslaught of lilliputians in the guise of europe 's budget air carriers like ryanair or easyjet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang mayrhuber , ceo of lufthansa that 's why ceo wolfgang mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- has embarked on a campaign to slash costs at the airline , which at the end of last year found itself swimming in a sea of red ink and wondering about its long-term chances of survival in an era where early bookers can fly from germany to the uk for € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- on low-cost carriers . on monday , the company reached a pay deal with the union representing 4,400 pilots that included a wage freeze for 23 months .
the agreement will save the company more than € 30 million a year . the agreement , which will take retroactive effect to may 1 , 2004 and runs until march 31 , 2006 , includes lower starting pay for new pilots , requires an extra two hours a month flying time before overtime kicks in and generally makes working times more flexible . chief lufthansa negotiator stefan lauer said the agreement was " a milestone in concerted action to ensure competitive personnel costs . "
the pilots ' union vereinigung cockpit said the deal includes improvements in pension arrangements and brings the low-cost affiliate germanwings into the company 's collective bargaining agreement . turbulent few years in addition to cut-throat competition from the discount carriers , lufthansa has also been hit by a decline in air travel , attributed to the terrorist attacks in the united states on sept .

ceo mayrhuber , 57 , decided to take drastic action , which he first outlined in november 2003 . already familiar with slashing costs - he was placed in charge of cost-cutting in 1992 to save the carrier from bankruptcy - he announced a plan to turn lufthansa 's fortunes around in the next two years by cutting € 1.2 billion or some 20 percent .
he said 2,000 jobs would be eliminated by 2005 , following 3,600 that were cut due to a hiring freeze put into place last year . is it enough ? but some analysts wonder if lufthansa is flying fast enough to stay above insolvency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agreement is " nice to have , but it 's not a big step , " uwe weinreich , an analyst with hvb bank in munich told bloomberg .

nevertheless , it 's a good indication that they can reach a settlement with the other unions , " such as those representing the company 's 38,000 ground crew and 14,000 flight attendants . besides the cost cutting , lufthansa has been lowering fares and making ticketing more flexible in an attempt to attract customers .

the company 's cost-cutting plans combined with increased passenger numbers appear to be having an effect , and the carrier announced a third quarter profit of € 125 million , largely due to an increase in air traffic revenue of 10 percent . mayrhuber said cuts still needed to be deeper and problems of overcapacity addressed if the company is to stay healthy in the long run . " our current numbers should not hide the fact that we clearly need better operating earnings , in order to secure the future of the enterprise for the next generation , " he said last month . but after monday 's pay agreement , he was feeling somewhat better .

lufthansa airlines has reached an agreement with pilots to freeze pay and make hours more flexible .
it 's part of the company 's strategy to get out of the economic blues largely brought on by low-cost carriers . german powerhouse lufthansa may be europe 's third-largest airline , but lately it has felt something like gulliver tied down by an onslaught of lilliputians in the guise of europe 's budget air carriers like ryanair or easyjet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang mayrhuber , ceo of lufthansa that 's why ceo wolfgang mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- has embarked on a campaign to slash costs at the airline , which at the end of last year found itself swimming in a sea of red ink and wondering about its long-term chances of survival in an era where early bookers can fly from germany to the uk for € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- on low-cost carriers . on monday , the company reached a pay deal with the union representing 4,400 pilots that included a wage freeze for 23 months .
the agreement will save the company more than € 30 million a year . the agreement , which will take retroactive effect to may 1 , 2004 and runs until march 31 , 2006 , includes lower starting pay for new pilots , requires an extra two hours a month flying time before overtime kicks in and generally makes working times more flexible . chief lufthansa negotiator stefan lauer said the agreement was " a milestone in concerted action to ensure competitive personnel costs . "
the pilots ' union vereinigung cockpit said the deal includes improvements in pension arrangements and brings the low-cost affiliate germanwings into the company 's collective bargaining agreement . turbulent few years in addition to cut-throat competition from the discount carriers , lufthansa has also been hit by a decline in air travel , attributed to the terrorist attacks in the united states on sept .

according to pisa , german students lack essential educational skills .
but now they can benefit from some private tutoring courtesy of the finnish embassy 's new website , which has a few tips on how to catch up . after pisa , the program for international student assessment , once again awarded finland top marks in their latest study on monday , the nordic country is taking matters into its own hands and helping europe 's educational dunces improve its performance with a new web site . initiated by the finnish embassies in berlin , vienna and bern , it demonstrates the efficiency of the finnish school system with the help of a small , blue troll , who guides visitors through a day in the life of emilia , a finnish school girl . topping the poll which emphasizes knowledge and skills needed for participation in society rather than mastery of a curriculum , finland 's strong points are excellent pre-school care , literacy skills , overall proficiency and an absence of a gender gap . could do better while germany has improved slightly in the pisa ranking , the results of the oecd survey published monday still give the german school system a resounding " could do better " and suggest the country is failing to equip children with the life skills and basic abilities they need . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crucially , the study also suggests german schools are failing children from disadvantaged and immigrant families and confirms that family income and status play too great a role in educational success . in a zdf television interview , wilfried steinert , the president of the national parents ' association , called the situation a disgrace . " this broad gap that we have in our schools and the fact that kids from middle-class or lower-class families have much less of a chance to lead significant careers is a scandal in educational policy , " he said . shows improvement the study , which surveyed a quarter of a million 15-year-olds across 41 countries , does say that german high school students now do better than in the first such survey three years ago .
but on the whole they 're still way behind their counterparts in top-of-the-class countries like finland and south korea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at germany 's college prep schools , known as " gymnasien , " are doing better in the natural sciences than four years ago .
but their peers at germany 's other secondary education schools still perform poorly in both areas .
it 's a finding that has triggered fresh debate on germany 's three-tiered educational model , which disperses children from the age of 10 across its three school systems - unlike finland 's non-selective , non-grade oriented educational system . the polish example " considering the general conditions , countries like germany are not achieving what we would expect them to , " said andreas schleicher , pisa 's international coordinator .
he added that he believes only widespread reforms in the german school system will solve the problem . but other education experts caution that the results of reforms made over the past four years since the last pisa test will take a decade to do any good . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland , though , has proved that theory wrong .
polish high school students placed nearly last in reading and comprehension in the 2000 pisa study . now , after significant changes in its school system , poland has passed germany , with its students ranking above average in reading skills .
the pisa study says that at the end of their required schooling , one in five german students can at best do basic grammar school arithmetic and can not even understand simple reading texts . by the time the next oecd study is published , educational reforms in germany might have started to kick in .
but federal minister for family affairs renate schmidt is n't overly optimistic . " in the next five years , germany may have progressed five places forward , " she told broadcaster n24 . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german kindergartens fail to impress it 's more bad news for the german education system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.12.2004 beethoven in bits and bytes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven enters the 21st century in bonn born more than 200 years ago , ludwig van beethoven has now come of age in the digital era .
with a complete online archive , a multimedia exhibit and a virtual opera , the classical composer is paving the way to the future . even the most classical of composers eventually find their way into the contemporary stage of the internet .
for germany ’ s favorite musical son , ludwig van beethoven , the entry into the digital era was six years in the making , but the bonn beethoven house hopes the launch of a comprehensive online archive and research center will usher in the rebirth – or at least the revival – of a musical tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house in bonn , germany .
the world ’ s largest beehoven collection , housed in the composer ’ s birthplace in bonn , germany , has turned itself into a state-of-the-art musical complex drawing on the latest in digital technology and information science .
starting this week , beethoven fans around the world will have access to the collection ’ s huge library of musical notations , letters and other objects from the composer ’ s life as well as a virtual tour through the house ’ s exhibits and a forum for the exploration of music and new media . free access for music lovers according to the museum ’ s organizers the project is “ a unique example of how a cultural institution focusing on a composer can create a modern connection between the traditional approach to his works and the use of new media . ” for a cost of € 4.5 million -lrb- $ 6.03 million -rrb- , more than 26,000 historical documents and images were scanned , digitalized and catalogued in a giant database by the fraunhofer institute for media communication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's score for the ninth symphony until their internet debut , many of the first editions , manuscripts and pictures of the composer never appeared for viewing by the general public .
because of their extremely fragile nature and value , only researchers and beethoven interpreters were allowed access to them .
the internet site changes that by providing free access to fans any where in the world . it also provides audio samples of key works and reads letters out loud to visitors . “ the digital beethoven house enables us to preserve the original documents while still informing the world about our unique collection and introducing the composer to completely new audiences , ” said museum director andreas eckhardt . cultural bridges through the ages in the beethoven house itself , visitors can take part in a stage for music visualization , a forum where new media is used to interpret beethoven ’ s works in a visual way .
inaugurated with the performance of “ fidelio , 21st century , ” a musical performance that combines beethoven ’ s only opera with 3-d computer graphics and sounds and transfers it to abstract geometrical characters on a projected stage . the protagonists of beethoven ’ s “ fidelio ” – spirals , planes and fields of color – fly across the specially created stage in the basement of the composer ’ s birth house as visitors take joysticks in hand and manipulate them to the tones of the composition .
an integrated sound system allows the music to follow the figures through the room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven , born 1770 in bonn , died 1827 in vienna “ with this step into the digital world , we hope to reach out to young people especially , ” eckhardt said , justifying the investment in new and interactive media .
it is the first project of its kind bridging traditional music with futuristic elements and technology , he said . the museum director is convinced the digitalization of the beethoven house and the introduction of more experimental musical fields will go a long way in promoting not only the composer , but also lead to new interpretations of his work and further questioning about the connection between music and multimedia . on a more pragmatic side , eckhardt expects the project to attract more visitors to the brick-and-mortar exhibits . “ yearly we have about 90,000 to 100,000 visitors at the house in bonn , ” he said .
“ i think these numbers could jump by 20 to 30 percent now . ” dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beethoven enters the modern era in bonn classical music fans from around the world are descending on bonn , germany , for the annual beethoven festival .

lufthansa airlines has reached an agreement with pilots to freeze pay and make hours more flexible .
it 's part of the company 's strategy to get out of the economic blues largely brought on by low-cost carriers . german powerhouse lufthansa may be europe 's third-largest airline , but lately it has felt something like gulliver tied down by an onslaught of lilliputians in the guise of europe 's budget air carriers like ryanair or easyjet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang mayrhuber , ceo of lufthansa that 's why ceo wolfgang mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- has embarked on a campaign to slash costs at the airline , which at the end of last year found itself swimming in a sea of red ink and wondering about its long-term chances of survival in an era where early bookers can fly from germany to the uk for € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- on low-cost carriers . on monday , the company reached a pay deal with the union representing 4,400 pilots that included a wage freeze for 23 months .
the agreement will save the company more than € 30 million a year . the agreement , which will take retroactive effect to may 1 , 2004 and runs until march 31 , 2006 , includes lower starting pay for new pilots , requires an extra two hours a month flying time before overtime kicks in and generally makes working times more flexible . chief lufthansa negotiator stefan lauer said the agreement was " a milestone in concerted action to ensure competitive personnel costs . "
the pilots ' union vereinigung cockpit said the deal includes improvements in pension arrangements and brings the low-cost affiliate germanwings into the company 's collective bargaining agreement . turbulent few years in addition to cut-throat competition from the discount carriers , lufthansa has also been hit by a decline in air travel , attributed to the terrorist attacks in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 , and overall slower economic growth .
fuel price rises in recent months have also depressed profits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-cost carrier easyjet the carrier was not helped by the fact that germany has become continental europe 's most competitive travel market .
" the low-cost market in germany has absolutely exploded , " tim coombs , a managing director at aviation economics , told bloomberg . last year proved a low point , when the airline reported a record loss of € 980 million .
ceo mayrhuber , 57 , decided to take drastic action , which he first outlined in november 2003 . already familiar with slashing costs - he was placed in charge of cost-cutting in 1992 to save the carrier from bankruptcy - he announced a plan to turn lufthansa 's fortunes around in the next two years by cutting € 1.2 billion or some 20 percent .
he said 2,000 jobs would be eliminated by 2005 , following 3,600 that were cut due to a hiring freeze put into place last year . is it enough ? but some analysts wonder if lufthansa is flying fast enough to stay above insolvency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agreement is " nice to have , but it 's not a big step , " uwe weinreich , an analyst with hvb bank in munich told bloomberg .
" it 's only a € 30 million chunk out of € 4.6 billion in personnel costs every year .
nevertheless , it 's a good indication that they can reach a settlement with the other unions , " such as those representing the company 's 38,000 ground crew and 14,000 flight attendants . besides the cost cutting , lufthansa has been lowering fares and making ticketing more flexible in an attempt to attract customers .
even so , lufthansa 's fares on short-haul routes are still often triple those of low-cost competitors . still , things appear to be looking up .
the company 's cost-cutting plans combined with increased passenger numbers appear to be having an effect , and the carrier announced a third quarter profit of € 125 million , largely due to an increase in air traffic revenue of 10 percent . mayrhuber said cuts still needed to be deeper and problems of overcapacity addressed if the company is to stay healthy in the long run . " our current numbers should not hide the fact that we clearly need better operating earnings , in order to secure the future of the enterprise for the next generation , " he said last month . but after monday 's pay agreement , he was feeling somewhat better . " lufthansa now has the chance to grow in europe again , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lufthansa lures with luxury trying to set themselves apart from an increasing number of discount airlines , officials for germany 's lufthansa have started a luxury offensive to attract more customers .

critics say germany is too eager to export to questionable buyers . last wednesday , the german government released its annual report documenting the number of german-made arms exported abroad .
the report confirmed an upward trend , with foreign sales reaching an all time high of € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- in 2003 , compared to € 318 million in 2002 and € 367 million in 2001 , firmly establishing germany as the world 's fourth largest arms producer . while the increase was partly explained by the sale of a few big ticket items , including a submarine worth € 210 million to south africa , arms control advocates say the german government is all too willing to allow the sale of arms and military hardware to countries engaged in conflict or with questionable human rights records .
they point to recent sales to nigeria and india . less than a week after the report was released , german chancellor gerhard schröder kicked off a trip to china , where he promised to lobby the international community to end an arms embargo imposed in the wake of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre .
he thereby signalled his government 's willingness to further liberalize germany 's arms export policies . with the global weapons trade worth more than € 521 billion -lrb- $ 700 billion -rrb- per year , it 's not surprising that schröder , struggling with a stagnant economy and high unemployment , wants to provide a boost to a highly profitable domestic business .
but arms control advocates - with the support of green party parliamentarians - have vowed to block his efforts . government says proper checks met bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german " leopard " tanks fetch top dollar .
following widespread pressure in the late 1990 's to impose more control on the international arms trade , the german governing coalition of social democrats and greens - who campaigned promising more transparency - issued the first annual report in 2000 documenting german arms exports . that same year , the government toughened laws governing arms exports and gave an oversight committee , known as bafa , final approval over all foreign sales .
according to the rules , such sales can only be completed after it is established that the weapons are n't intended for conflict zones or countries with poor human rights records . in a press release accompanying this year 's report , the government claimed 67 percent of 2003 exports were bound for eu or nato allies and permission for the remaining exports was only granted after a careful check and bafa review were carried out . critics take issue with report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german arms sales remain undetected in official reports , say critics .
but bernhart moltmann , chairman of the study group on german arms exports of the joint conference church and development -lrb- gkke -rrb- , which will issue its own report on german arms exports next wednesday , said the government report misrepresents the facts . " the numbers given are n't clear , " he told dw-world .
" they are directed to give a good impression . " he points to the fact that more arms are bound for so-called " developing countries " than the report indicates because the government used its own definition of a " developing country , " rather than the one generally agreed upon by the development assistance committee -lrb- dac -rrb- of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . " there are problems with the definitions used , " he said . loopholes remain in addition to finding fault with the definitions used , some experts also point to loopholes in the rules . siemon wezeman , the acting head of the arms transfers project at the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- , does not dispute the government 's claim that the majority of weapons defined as " arms , " according to the criteria used to compile the government report , are bound for the eu and nato allies . of greater concern , according to wezeman , are the individual components , such as engines , which are not counted in the report and are not subject to the approval of bafa .
they may be installed in , say , a french tank and ultimately end up in the middle east or elsewhere . " we only have the figures for the major weapons systems , but not for the smaller components , " he told dw-world .
" it 's a loophole and a way for german-made arms to end up pretty much anywhere in the world . " winfried nachtwei , a deputy parliamentary leader for the green party and claudia roth , head of the greens , issued a press release on the same day the government arms report was released promising to look into ways to close the loopholes and make all german arms - whether entire weapons systems or individual components - accountable to the same checks and restrictions . just political posturing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder has promised to help lift the arms embargo on china .
if chancellor schröder intends to pave the way for german companies to sell sophisticated weapons systems to china , he could have a tough fight on his hands .
five years ago , the green party successfully blocked the controversial sale of german-made tanks to turkey . wezeman , of sipri , suspects chancellor schröder 's effort to help convince the eu to end the chinese arms embargo is pure political posturing .
even if the eu agrees , the united states has made its intention to block weapons sales to china very clear and has promised not to do business with european countries that sell arms to beijing .

with a complete online archive , a multimedia exhibit and a virtual opera , the classical composer is paving the way to the future . even the most classical of composers eventually find their way into the contemporary stage of the internet .
for germany ’ s favorite musical son , ludwig van beethoven , the entry into the digital era was six years in the making , but the bonn beethoven house hopes the launch of a comprehensive online archive and research center will usher in the rebirth – or at least the revival – of a musical tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house in bonn , germany .
the world ’ s largest beehoven collection , housed in the composer ’ s birthplace in bonn , germany , has turned itself into a state-of-the-art musical complex drawing on the latest in digital technology and information science .
starting this week , beethoven fans around the world will have access to the collection ’ s huge library of musical notations , letters and other objects from the composer ’ s life as well as a virtual tour through the house ’ s exhibits and a forum for the exploration of music and new media . free access for music lovers according to the museum ’ s organizers the project is “ a unique example of how a cultural institution focusing on a composer can create a modern connection between the traditional approach to his works and the use of new media . ” for a cost of € 4.5 million -lrb- $ 6.03 million -rrb- , more than 26,000 historical documents and images were scanned , digitalized and catalogued in a giant database by the fraunhofer institute for media communication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's score for the ninth symphony until their internet debut , many of the first editions , manuscripts and pictures of the composer never appeared for viewing by the general public .
because of their extremely fragile nature and value , only researchers and beethoven interpreters were allowed access to them .
the internet site changes that by providing free access to fans any where in the world . it also provides audio samples of key works and reads letters out loud to visitors . “ the digital beethoven house enables us to preserve the original documents while still informing the world about our unique collection and introducing the composer to completely new audiences , ” said museum director andreas eckhardt . cultural bridges through the ages in the beethoven house itself , visitors can take part in a stage for music visualization , a forum where new media is used to interpret beethoven ’ s works in a visual way .
inaugurated with the performance of “ fidelio , 21st century , ” a musical performance that combines beethoven ’ s only opera with 3-d computer graphics and sounds and transfers it to abstract geometrical characters on a projected stage . the protagonists of beethoven ’ s “ fidelio ” – spirals , planes and fields of color – fly across the specially created stage in the basement of the composer ’ s birth house as visitors take joysticks in hand and manipulate them to the tones of the composition .
an integrated sound system allows the music to follow the figures through the room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven , born 1770 in bonn , died 1827 in vienna “ with this step into the digital world , we hope to reach out to young people especially , ” eckhardt said , justifying the investment in new and interactive media .
it is the first project of its kind bridging traditional music with futuristic elements and technology , he said . the museum director is convinced the digitalization of the beethoven house and the introduction of more experimental musical fields will go a long way in promoting not only the composer , but also lead to new interpretations of his work and further questioning about the connection between music and multimedia . on a more pragmatic side , eckhardt expects the project to attract more visitors to the brick-and-mortar exhibits . “ yearly we have about 90,000 to 100,000 visitors at the house in bonn , ” he said .
“ i think these numbers could jump by 20 to 30 percent now . ” dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beethoven enters the modern era in bonn classical music fans from around the world are descending on bonn , germany , for the annual beethoven festival .

the resulting bans are something of a measure of last resort . banned from city centers occasionally banning diesel powered cars without particle filters from city centers would help keep the amount of microscopic particulate pollution , which a german federal environmental agency study showed contributed to the premature death of 14,000 people last year , within acceptable levels .
the particulate pollution has been linked to cancer and a host of other health problems . according to the council of german cities , the bans may start as soon as february , when weather conditions tend to increase the particulate pollution problem . " we assume that there will be driving bans in all the big german cities , in built-up areas and indeed several times a year depending on weather and traffic conditions , " jürgen resch of the duh , a german environmental organization , told reuters . the bans have also received the blessing of germany 's environment minister , jürgen trittin . filters to be introduced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of 2009 , filters will be installed in new diesel models in a few years ' time , diesel powered cars without filters will be less of an issue .
in july , after months of resistance , the german car industry agreed to start installing filters in all its new domestic diesel models by 2009 . previously , german car makers claimed that installing such filters would be too expensive , but they eventually conceded to their customers ' demands , many of whom wanted the filters .
if properly fitted , filters can reduce particulate emissions by up to 99 percent . though filters will be standard in all new models from 2009 onwards , that still leaves the matter of the many diesel cars which will be sold without filters over the next four years , and those already on the road .
diesel cars currently make up 40 percent of all new european sales . some german car parts makers , including hjs , have been manufacturing filters priced at around € 700 -lrb- $ 934 -rrb- , which can be installed in older model cars . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cars get diesel filters by 2009 after years of stalling on the issue , the german car industry has decided to introduce serial production of emission filters for diesel cars .
the announcement comes amidst mounting pressure from environmentalists .
-lrb- july 14 , 2004 -rrb- debate over diesel car filters heats up german car manufacturers and environmentalists are battling over diesel cars .
should they be fitted with filters , and should motorists who opt for so-called " clean diesel " models be given tax breaks ?

lufthansa airlines has reached an agreement with pilots to freeze pay and make hours more flexible .
it 's part of the company 's strategy to get out of the economic blues largely brought on by low-cost carriers . german powerhouse lufthansa may be europe 's third-largest airline , but lately it has felt something like gulliver tied down by an onslaught of lilliputians in the guise of europe 's budget air carriers like ryanair or easyjet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang mayrhuber , ceo of lufthansa that 's why ceo wolfgang mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- has embarked on a campaign to slash costs at the airline , which at the end of last year found itself swimming in a sea of red ink and wondering about its long-term chances of survival in an era where early bookers can fly from germany to the uk for € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- on low-cost carriers . on monday , the company reached a pay deal with the union representing 4,400 pilots that included a wage freeze for 23 months .
the agreement will save the company more than € 30 million a year . the agreement , which will take retroactive effect to may 1 , 2004 and runs until march 31 , 2006 , includes lower starting pay for new pilots , requires an extra two hours a month flying time before overtime kicks in and generally makes working times more flexible . chief lufthansa negotiator stefan lauer said the agreement was " a milestone in concerted action to ensure competitive personnel costs .

nevertheless , it 's a good indication that they can reach a settlement with the other unions , " such as those representing the company 's 38,000 ground crew and 14,000 flight attendants . besides the cost cutting , lufthansa has been lowering fares and making ticketing more flexible in an attempt to attract customers .

the company 's cost-cutting plans combined with increased passenger numbers appear to be having an effect , and the carrier announced a third quarter profit of € 125 million , largely due to an increase in air traffic revenue of 10 percent . mayrhuber said cuts still needed to be deeper and problems of overcapacity addressed if the company is to stay healthy in the long run .

with a complete online archive , a multimedia exhibit and a virtual opera , the classical composer is paving the way to the future . even the most classical of composers eventually find their way into the contemporary stage of the internet .
for germany ’ s favorite musical son , ludwig van beethoven , the entry into the digital era was six years in the making , but the bonn beethoven house hopes the launch of a comprehensive online archive and research center will usher in the rebirth – or at least the revival – of a musical tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house in bonn , germany .
the world ’ s largest beehoven collection , housed in the composer ’ s birthplace in bonn , germany , has turned itself into a state-of-the-art musical complex drawing on the latest in digital technology and information science .
starting this week , beethoven fans around the world will have access to the collection ’ s huge library of musical notations , letters and other objects from the composer ’ s life as well as a virtual tour through the house ’ s exhibits and a forum for the exploration of music and new media . free access for music lovers according to the museum ’ s organizers the project is “ a unique example of how a cultural institution focusing on a composer can create a modern connection between the traditional approach to his works and the use of new media . ” for a cost of € 4.5 million -lrb- $ 6.03 million -rrb- , more than 26,000 historical documents and images were scanned , digitalized and catalogued in a giant database by the fraunhofer institute for media communication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's score for the ninth symphony until their internet debut , many of the first editions , manuscripts and pictures of the composer never appeared for viewing by the general public .
because of their extremely fragile nature and value , only researchers and beethoven interpreters were allowed access to them .
the internet site changes that by providing free access to fans any where in the world . it also provides audio samples of key works and reads letters out loud to visitors . “ the digital beethoven house enables us to preserve the original documents while still informing the world about our unique collection and introducing the composer to completely new audiences , ” said museum director andreas eckhardt . cultural bridges through the ages in the beethoven house itself , visitors can take part in a stage for music visualization , a forum where new media is used to interpret beethoven ’ s works in a visual way .
inaugurated with the performance of “ fidelio , 21st century , ” a musical performance that combines beethoven ’ s only opera with 3-d computer graphics and sounds and transfers it to abstract geometrical characters on a projected stage . the protagonists of beethoven ’ s “ fidelio ” – spirals , planes and fields of color – fly across the specially created stage in the basement of the composer ’ s birth house as visitors take joysticks in hand and manipulate them to the tones of the composition .
an integrated sound system allows the music to follow the figures through the room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven , born 1770 in bonn , died 1827 in vienna “ with this step into the digital world , we hope to reach out to young people especially , ” eckhardt said , justifying the investment in new and interactive media .
it is the first project of its kind bridging traditional music with futuristic elements and technology , he said . the museum director is convinced the digitalization of the beethoven house and the introduction of more experimental musical fields will go a long way in promoting not only the composer , but also lead to new interpretations of his work and further questioning about the connection between music and multimedia . on a more pragmatic side , eckhardt expects the project to attract more visitors to the brick-and-mortar exhibits . “ yearly we have about 90,000 to 100,000 visitors at the house in bonn , ” he said .

the three men had been under close surveillance by german intelligence following a tip-off from kurdish agents in northern iraq . the kurdish intelligence service had passed on the telephone numbers of the three iraqis .
the numbers were found in a notebook of a kurd suspected to be an important courier for ansar al islam .
german general prosecutor kay nehm said the arrest warrants were issued because the three men are accused of belonging to a terrorist network . he admitted , however , that house searches had failed to uncover any weapons or explosives which could have suggested that the suspects were planning to kill the iraqi prime minister . “ in germany , ansar-al-islam members are known to be involved in fund-raising campaigns , human trafficking and the forging of passports and other documents , ” nehm told reporters .
“ so far we have no record of them using force or carrying out assassinations here . ” on monday , a fourth suspect of lebanese origin was set free again after initial suspicions turned out to be groundless . high political profile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily interior minister otto schily has been trying to profit politically from the events surrounding allawi ’ s visit in berlin .

schily had initiated the hard-hitting laws after the sept .

“ we will do whatever we feel is required to ensure the safety of a guest .
in the case of prime minister ayad allawi , we also took all the necessary precautions and didn ’ t leave anything to chance . ” “ terrorists should know that our intelligence services are well informed about their intentions at any given time , no matter where and how they plan to step into action , ” schily added . bavarian interior minister günter beckstein , a member of the conservative christian social union , acknowledged that german intelligence performed well in the run-up to the allawi visit . “ the good news is that the german intelligence services are able to keep such a tight check on potentially dangerous people so that they are not in a position to commit acts of terror here , ” he said .
“ it ’ s gratifying to know that the safety of mr. allawi was ensured throughout his visit to berlin .
this goes to show that cooperation between the various intelligence people at regional and national level leaves nothing to be desired . ” hidden criticism but beckstein ’ s praise was not without a bit of hidden criticism directed towards schily and the minister ’ s plans to reorganize the intelligence services . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's conservative state interior minister günther beckstein the bavarian politician ’ s reference to cooperation between security services was intended as a rebuke to otto schily , who had recently launched a campaign to centralize intelligence gathering at national level .
schily is known to be a staunch supporter of a proposed national clearing house in which intelligence from all the various regional departments would be collected , collated and made easily accessible to officials entitled to use it . for beckstein , the uncovering and thwarting of the attack against allawi demonstrated that the current structure of regional and national units is sufficient for the job and requires no reorganization . hardy graupner -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany probes militant group ; holds three suspects arrest warrants have been issued for three iraqis suspected of planning to attack visiting iraqi prime minister ayad allawi in berlin .

with a complete online archive , a multimedia exhibit and a virtual opera , the classical composer is paving the way to the future . even the most classical of composers eventually find their way into the contemporary stage of the internet .
for germany ’ s favorite musical son , ludwig van beethoven , the entry into the digital era was six years in the making , but the bonn beethoven house hopes the launch of a comprehensive online archive and research center will usher in the rebirth – or at least the revival – of a musical tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house in bonn , germany .
the world ’ s largest beehoven collection , housed in the composer ’ s birthplace in bonn , germany , has turned itself into a state-of-the-art musical complex drawing on the latest in digital technology and information science .
starting this week , beethoven fans around the world will have access to the collection ’ s huge library of musical notations , letters and other objects from the composer ’ s life as well as a virtual tour through the house ’ s exhibits and a forum for the exploration of music and new media . free access for music lovers according to the museum ’ s organizers the project is “ a unique example of how a cultural institution focusing on a composer can create a modern connection between the traditional approach to his works and the use of new media . ” for a cost of € 4.5 million -lrb- $ 6.03 million -rrb- , more than 26,000 historical documents and images were scanned , digitalized and catalogued in a giant database by the fraunhofer institute for media communication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's score for the ninth symphony until their internet debut , many of the first editions , manuscripts and pictures of the composer never appeared for viewing by the general public .
because of their extremely fragile nature and value , only researchers and beethoven interpreters were allowed access to them .
the internet site changes that by providing free access to fans any where in the world . it also provides audio samples of key works and reads letters out loud to visitors . “ the digital beethoven house enables us to preserve the original documents while still informing the world about our unique collection and introducing the composer to completely new audiences , ” said museum director andreas eckhardt . cultural bridges through the ages in the beethoven house itself , visitors can take part in a stage for music visualization , a forum where new media is used to interpret beethoven ’ s works in a visual way .
inaugurated with the performance of “ fidelio , 21st century , ” a musical performance that combines beethoven ’ s only opera with 3-d computer graphics and sounds and transfers it to abstract geometrical characters on a projected stage . the protagonists of beethoven ’ s “ fidelio ” – spirals , planes and fields of color – fly across the specially created stage in the basement of the composer ’ s birth house as visitors take joysticks in hand and manipulate them to the tones of the composition .
an integrated sound system allows the music to follow the figures through the room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven , born 1770 in bonn , died 1827 in vienna “ with this step into the digital world , we hope to reach out to young people especially , ” eckhardt said , justifying the investment in new and interactive media .
it is the first project of its kind bridging traditional music with futuristic elements and technology , he said . the museum director is convinced the digitalization of the beethoven house and the introduction of more experimental musical fields will go a long way in promoting not only the composer , but also lead to new interpretations of his work and further questioning about the connection between music and multimedia . on a more pragmatic side , eckhardt expects the project to attract more visitors to the brick-and-mortar exhibits . “ yearly we have about 90,000 to 100,000 visitors at the house in bonn , ” he said .

it is the first project of its kind bridging traditional music with futuristic elements and technology , he said . the museum director is convinced the digitalization of the beethoven house and the introduction of more experimental musical fields will go a long way in promoting not only the composer , but also lead to new interpretations of his work and further questioning about the connection between music and multimedia . on a more pragmatic side , eckhardt expects the project to attract more visitors to the brick-and-mortar exhibits . “ yearly we have about 90,000 to 100,000 visitors at the house in bonn , ” he said .

the three men had been under close surveillance by german intelligence following a tip-off from kurdish agents in northern iraq . the kurdish intelligence service had passed on the telephone numbers of the three iraqis .
the numbers were found in a notebook of a kurd suspected to be an important courier for ansar al islam .
german general prosecutor kay nehm said the arrest warrants were issued because the three men are accused of belonging to a terrorist network . he admitted , however , that house searches had failed to uncover any weapons or explosives which could have suggested that the suspects were planning to kill the iraqi prime minister . “ in germany , ansar-al-islam members are known to be involved in fund-raising campaigns , human trafficking and the forging of passports and other documents , ” nehm told reporters .
“ so far we have no record of them using force or carrying out assassinations here . ” on monday , a fourth suspect of lebanese origin was set free again after initial suspicions turned out to be groundless . high political profile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily interior minister otto schily has been trying to profit politically from the events surrounding allawi ’ s visit in berlin .
insisting that an assassination plot had been thwarted , he sought to highlight the efficiency of the domestic intelligence services and the positive impact of the country ’ s new anti-terror legislation .
schily had initiated the hard-hitting laws after the sept .
11 attacks on the united states . “ we ’ re responsible for the security of state leaders visiting us , ” he said .
“ we will do whatever we feel is required to ensure the safety of a guest .
in the case of prime minister ayad allawi , we also took all the necessary precautions and didn ’ t leave anything to chance . ” “ terrorists should know that our intelligence services are well informed about their intentions at any given time , no matter where and how they plan to step into action , ” schily added . bavarian interior minister günter beckstein , a member of the conservative christian social union , acknowledged that german intelligence performed well in the run-up to the allawi visit . “ the good news is that the german intelligence services are able to keep such a tight check on potentially dangerous people so that they are not in a position to commit acts of terror here , ” he said .
“ it ’ s gratifying to know that the safety of mr. allawi was ensured throughout his visit to berlin .
this goes to show that cooperation between the various intelligence people at regional and national level leaves nothing to be desired . ” hidden criticism but beckstein ’ s praise was not without a bit of hidden criticism directed towards schily and the minister ’ s plans to reorganize the intelligence services . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's conservative state interior minister günther beckstein the bavarian politician ’ s reference to cooperation between security services was intended as a rebuke to otto schily , who had recently launched a campaign to centralize intelligence gathering at national level .
schily is known to be a staunch supporter of a proposed national clearing house in which intelligence from all the various regional departments would be collected , collated and made easily accessible to officials entitled to use it . for beckstein , the uncovering and thwarting of the attack against allawi demonstrated that the current structure of regional and national units is sufficient for the job and requires no reorganization . hardy graupner -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany probes militant group ; holds three suspects arrest warrants have been issued for three iraqis suspected of planning to attack visiting iraqi prime minister ayad allawi in berlin .

chief among the issues was the tit-for-tat spat over government subsidies for europe ’ s airbus consortium and boeing . after the meeting , the men announced they would continue talking over the new few weeks to try to settle their differences by negotiation , but would retain the option of litigation through the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- . " if we are going to avoid litigation in pursuit of the cases that both of us have now entered , we are going to have to have some pretty serious discussions about the alternative to that litigation , " mandelson told reporters . " i am interested in seeing how we can resolve our differences through a proper set of negotiations , " he added . his us counterpart , zoellick , said that if negotiations did not succeed , " litigation is an option " and that the bush administration was prepared for that eventuality . fresh start mandelson , a close ally of british prime minister tony blair , had promised “ a fresh start ” in transatlantic negotiations which turned bad after the united states filed a complaint with the wto in october challenging european loans to help airbus develop aircraft , such as the new a380 super-jumbo jet .
the eu responded by filing its own case against the us government over aid for boeing . the filing of cases triggered a 60-day consultation period , which expired monday .
ordinarily the failure to reach a settlement by consensus would prompt one or both of the parties to ask the wto to settle the case by a special panel and ultimately result in punitive sanctions .
but on thursday a us official said washington would delay referring its complaint to the wto in order to allow mandelson time to review the matter . bumpy ride ? according to eu trade experts , boeing has received around $ 23 billion -lrb- € 17.1 billion -rrb- in governmental development aid since 1992 .

only in october were the two sides able to find a solution to a year-long row over sanctions the eu had applied as a response to us corporate tax breaks for companies with foreign operations . all clear for take off while the international trade dispute over aviation simmers , airbus developers in germany announced that the last obstacle to extending the runway at the hamburg production facility finkenwerder had been cleared . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus construction facility for the a318 , a319 , a321 and a380 in hamburg after months of negotiations with owners of property adjacent to the proposed runway , the city council on monday announced it had purchased four parcels of land from a fruit orchard owner , paving the way for the tarmac to be extended to the necessary length for the arrival of the new a380 super-jumbo jets . the construction of the runway and the production of the a380 had been delayed for 18 months due to a land dispute .
a local church parish , which owned property bordering the finkenwerder facility , had refused to sell to land the city for the purpose of extending the airbus tarmac .

critics say germany is too eager to export to questionable buyers . last wednesday , the german government released its annual report documenting the number of german-made arms exported abroad .
the report confirmed an upward trend , with foreign sales reaching an all time high of € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- in 2003 , compared to € 318 million in 2002 and € 367 million in 2001 , firmly establishing germany as the world 's fourth largest arms producer . while the increase was partly explained by the sale of a few big ticket items , including a submarine worth € 210 million to south africa , arms control advocates say the german government is all too willing to allow the sale of arms and military hardware to countries engaged in conflict or with questionable human rights records .
they point to recent sales to nigeria and india . less than a week after the report was released , german chancellor gerhard schröder kicked off a trip to china , where he promised to lobby the international community to end an arms embargo imposed in the wake of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre .
he thereby signalled his government 's willingness to further liberalize germany 's arms export policies . with the global weapons trade worth more than € 521 billion -lrb- $ 700 billion -rrb- per year , it 's not surprising that schröder , struggling with a stagnant economy and high unemployment , wants to provide a boost to a highly profitable domestic business .
but arms control advocates - with the support of green party parliamentarians - have vowed to block his efforts . government says proper checks met bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german " leopard " tanks fetch top dollar .
following widespread pressure in the late 1990 's to impose more control on the international arms trade , the german governing coalition of social democrats and greens - who campaigned promising more transparency - issued the first annual report in 2000 documenting german arms exports . that same year , the government toughened laws governing arms exports and gave an oversight committee , known as bafa , final approval over all foreign sales .
according to the rules , such sales can only be completed after it is established that the weapons are n't intended for conflict zones or countries with poor human rights records . in a press release accompanying this year 's report , the government claimed 67 percent of 2003 exports were bound for eu or nato allies and permission for the remaining exports was only granted after a careful check and bafa review were carried out . critics take issue with report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german arms sales remain undetected in official reports , say critics .
but bernhart moltmann , chairman of the study group on german arms exports of the joint conference church and development -lrb- gkke -rrb- , which will issue its own report on german arms exports next wednesday , said the government report misrepresents the facts . " the numbers given are n't clear , " he told dw-world .
" they are directed to give a good impression . " he points to the fact that more arms are bound for so-called " developing countries " than the report indicates because the government used its own definition of a " developing country , " rather than the one generally agreed upon by the development assistance committee -lrb- dac -rrb- of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . " there are problems with the definitions used , " he said . loopholes remain in addition to finding fault with the definitions used , some experts also point to loopholes in the rules . siemon wezeman , the acting head of the arms transfers project at the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- , does not dispute the government 's claim that the majority of weapons defined as " arms , " according to the criteria used to compile the government report , are bound for the eu and nato allies . of greater concern , according to wezeman , are the individual components , such as engines , which are not counted in the report and are not subject to the approval of bafa .
they may be installed in , say , a french tank and ultimately end up in the middle east or elsewhere . " we only have the figures for the major weapons systems , but not for the smaller components , " he told dw-world .
" it 's a loophole and a way for german-made arms to end up pretty much anywhere in the world . " winfried nachtwei , a deputy parliamentary leader for the green party and claudia roth , head of the greens , issued a press release on the same day the government arms report was released promising to look into ways to close the loopholes and make all german arms - whether entire weapons systems or individual components - accountable to the same checks and restrictions . just political posturing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder has promised to help lift the arms embargo on china .
if chancellor schröder intends to pave the way for german companies to sell sophisticated weapons systems to china , he could have a tough fight on his hands .
five years ago , the green party successfully blocked the controversial sale of german-made tanks to turkey . wezeman , of sipri , suspects chancellor schröder 's effort to help convince the eu to end the chinese arms embargo is pure political posturing .
even if the eu agrees , the united states has made its intention to block weapons sales to china very clear and has promised not to do business with european countries that sell arms to beijing . " he wants to make german policy look china friendly to open the civilian market , not the arms market , " said wezeman . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany mulls tanks sale to turkey barely a week after the european commission recommended initiating membership talks with turkey , the german government is reportedly considering to deliver tanks to that country .

schily had initiated the hard-hitting laws after the sept .

“ we will do whatever we feel is required to ensure the safety of a guest .
in the case of prime minister ayad allawi , we also took all the necessary precautions and didn ’ t leave anything to chance . ” “ terrorists should know that our intelligence services are well informed about their intentions at any given time , no matter where and how they plan to step into action , ” schily added . bavarian interior minister günter beckstein , a member of the conservative christian social union , acknowledged that german intelligence performed well in the run-up to the allawi visit . “ the good news is that the german intelligence services are able to keep such a tight check on potentially dangerous people so that they are not in a position to commit acts of terror here , ” he said .
“ it ’ s gratifying to know that the safety of mr. allawi was ensured throughout his visit to berlin .
this goes to show that cooperation between the various intelligence people at regional and national level leaves nothing to be desired . ” hidden criticism but beckstein ’ s praise was not without a bit of hidden criticism directed towards schily and the minister ’ s plans to reorganize the intelligence services . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's conservative state interior minister günther beckstein the bavarian politician ’ s reference to cooperation between security services was intended as a rebuke to otto schily , who had recently launched a campaign to centralize intelligence gathering at national level .
schily is known to be a staunch supporter of a proposed national clearing house in which intelligence from all the various regional departments would be collected , collated and made easily accessible to officials entitled to use it . for beckstein , the uncovering and thwarting of the attack against allawi demonstrated that the current structure of regional and national units is sufficient for the job and requires no reorganization . hardy graupner -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany probes militant group ; holds three suspects arrest warrants have been issued for three iraqis suspected of planning to attack visiting iraqi prime minister ayad allawi in berlin .

critics say germany is too eager to export to questionable buyers . last wednesday , the german government released its annual report documenting the number of german-made arms exported abroad .
the report confirmed an upward trend , with foreign sales reaching an all time high of € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- in 2003 , compared to € 318 million in 2002 and € 367 million in 2001 , firmly establishing germany as the world 's fourth largest arms producer . while the increase was partly explained by the sale of a few big ticket items , including a submarine worth € 210 million to south africa , arms control advocates say the german government is all too willing to allow the sale of arms and military hardware to countries engaged in conflict or with questionable human rights records .
they point to recent sales to nigeria and india . less than a week after the report was released , german chancellor gerhard schröder kicked off a trip to china , where he promised to lobby the international community to end an arms embargo imposed in the wake of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre .
he thereby signalled his government 's willingness to further liberalize germany 's arms export policies . with the global weapons trade worth more than € 521 billion -lrb- $ 700 billion -rrb- per year , it 's not surprising that schröder , struggling with a stagnant economy and high unemployment , wants to provide a boost to a highly profitable domestic business .
but arms control advocates - with the support of green party parliamentarians - have vowed to block his efforts . government says proper checks met bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german " leopard " tanks fetch top dollar .
following widespread pressure in the late 1990 's to impose more control on the international arms trade , the german governing coalition of social democrats and greens - who campaigned promising more transparency - issued the first annual report in 2000 documenting german arms exports . that same year , the government toughened laws governing arms exports and gave an oversight committee , known as bafa , final approval over all foreign sales .
according to the rules , such sales can only be completed after it is established that the weapons are n't intended for conflict zones or countries with poor human rights records . in a press release accompanying this year 's report , the government claimed 67 percent of 2003 exports were bound for eu or nato allies and permission for the remaining exports was only granted after a careful check and bafa review were carried out . critics take issue with report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german arms sales remain undetected in official reports , say critics .
but bernhart moltmann , chairman of the study group on german arms exports of the joint conference church and development -lrb- gkke -rrb- , which will issue its own report on german arms exports next wednesday , said the government report misrepresents the facts . " the numbers given are n't clear , " he told dw-world .
" they are directed to give a good impression . " he points to the fact that more arms are bound for so-called " developing countries " than the report indicates because the government used its own definition of a " developing country , " rather than the one generally agreed upon by the development assistance committee -lrb- dac -rrb- of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . " there are problems with the definitions used , " he said . loopholes remain in addition to finding fault with the definitions used , some experts also point to loopholes in the rules . siemon wezeman , the acting head of the arms transfers project at the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- , does not dispute the government 's claim that the majority of weapons defined as " arms , " according to the criteria used to compile the government report , are bound for the eu and nato allies . of greater concern , according to wezeman , are the individual components , such as engines , which are not counted in the report and are not subject to the approval of bafa .
they may be installed in , say , a french tank and ultimately end up in the middle east or elsewhere . " we only have the figures for the major weapons systems , but not for the smaller components , " he told dw-world .
" it 's a loophole and a way for german-made arms to end up pretty much anywhere in the world . " winfried nachtwei , a deputy parliamentary leader for the green party and claudia roth , head of the greens , issued a press release on the same day the government arms report was released promising to look into ways to close the loopholes and make all german arms - whether entire weapons systems or individual components - accountable to the same checks and restrictions . just political posturing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder has promised to help lift the arms embargo on china .
if chancellor schröder intends to pave the way for german companies to sell sophisticated weapons systems to china , he could have a tough fight on his hands .
five years ago , the green party successfully blocked the controversial sale of german-made tanks to turkey . wezeman , of sipri , suspects chancellor schröder 's effort to help convince the eu to end the chinese arms embargo is pure political posturing .
even if the eu agrees , the united states has made its intention to block weapons sales to china very clear and has promised not to do business with european countries that sell arms to beijing . " he wants to make german policy look china friendly to open the civilian market , not the arms market , " said wezeman . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany mulls tanks sale to turkey barely a week after the european commission recommended initiating membership talks with turkey , the german government is reportedly considering to deliver tanks to that country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.12.2004 german arms exports under fire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german made , south africa bound days after a report confirmed an increase in german arms exports , chancellor schröder promised to help end the eu embargo imposed on arms sales to china .
critics say germany is too eager to export to questionable buyers . last wednesday , the german government released its annual report documenting the number of german-made arms exported abroad .
the report confirmed an upward trend , with foreign sales reaching an all time high of € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- in 2003 , compared to € 318 million in 2002 and € 367 million in 2001 , firmly establishing germany as the world 's fourth largest arms producer . while the increase was partly explained by the sale of a few big ticket items , including a submarine worth € 210 million to south africa , arms control advocates say the german government is all too willing to allow the sale of arms and military hardware to countries engaged in conflict or with questionable human rights records .
they point to recent sales to nigeria and india . less than a week after the report was released , german chancellor gerhard schröder kicked off a trip to china , where he promised to lobby the international community to end an arms embargo imposed in the wake of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre .
he thereby signalled his government 's willingness to further liberalize germany 's arms export policies . with the global weapons trade worth more than € 521 billion -lrb- $ 700 billion -rrb- per year , it 's not surprising that schröder , struggling with a stagnant economy and high unemployment , wants to provide a boost to a highly profitable domestic business .
but arms control advocates - with the support of green party parliamentarians - have vowed to block his efforts . government says proper checks met bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german " leopard " tanks fetch top dollar .
following widespread pressure in the late 1990 's to impose more control on the international arms trade , the german governing coalition of social democrats and greens - who campaigned promising more transparency - issued the first annual report in 2000 documenting german arms exports . that same year , the government toughened laws governing arms exports and gave an oversight committee , known as bafa , final approval over all foreign sales .
according to the rules , such sales can only be completed after it is established that the weapons are n't intended for conflict zones or countries with poor human rights records . in a press release accompanying this year 's report , the government claimed 67 percent of 2003 exports were bound for eu or nato allies and permission for the remaining exports was only granted after a careful check and bafa review were carried out . critics take issue with report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german arms sales remain undetected in official reports , say critics .
but bernhart moltmann , chairman of the study group on german arms exports of the joint conference church and development -lrb- gkke -rrb- , which will issue its own report on german arms exports next wednesday , said the government report misrepresents the facts . " the numbers given are n't clear , " he told dw-world .
" they are directed to give a good impression . " he points to the fact that more arms are bound for so-called " developing countries " than the report indicates because the government used its own definition of a " developing country , " rather than the one generally agreed upon by the development assistance committee -lrb- dac -rrb- of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . " there are problems with the definitions used , " he said . loopholes remain in addition to finding fault with the definitions used , some experts also point to loopholes in the rules . siemon wezeman , the acting head of the arms transfers project at the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- , does not dispute the government 's claim that the majority of weapons defined as " arms , " according to the criteria used to compile the government report , are bound for the eu and nato allies . of greater concern , according to wezeman , are the individual components , such as engines , which are not counted in the report and are not subject to the approval of bafa .
they may be installed in , say , a french tank and ultimately end up in the middle east or elsewhere . " we only have the figures for the major weapons systems , but not for the smaller components , " he told dw-world .
" it 's a loophole and a way for german-made arms to end up pretty much anywhere in the world . " winfried nachtwei , a deputy parliamentary leader for the green party and claudia roth , head of the greens , issued a press release on the same day the government arms report was released promising to look into ways to close the loopholes and make all german arms - whether entire weapons systems or individual components - accountable to the same checks and restrictions . just political posturing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder has promised to help lift the arms embargo on china .
if chancellor schröder intends to pave the way for german companies to sell sophisticated weapons systems to china , he could have a tough fight on his hands .
five years ago , the green party successfully blocked the controversial sale of german-made tanks to turkey . wezeman , of sipri , suspects chancellor schröder 's effort to help convince the eu to end the chinese arms embargo is pure political posturing .
even if the eu agrees , the united states has made its intention to block weapons sales to china very clear and has promised not to do business with european countries that sell arms to beijing . " he wants to make german policy look china friendly to open the civilian market , not the arms market , " said wezeman . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany mulls tanks sale to turkey barely a week after the european commission recommended initiating membership talks with turkey , the german government is reportedly considering to deliver tanks to that country .

chief among the issues was the tit-for-tat spat over government subsidies for europe ’ s airbus consortium and boeing . after the meeting , the men announced they would continue talking over the new few weeks to try to settle their differences by negotiation , but would retain the option of litigation through the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- . " if we are going to avoid litigation in pursuit of the cases that both of us have now entered , we are going to have to have some pretty serious discussions about the alternative to that litigation , " mandelson told reporters . " i am interested in seeing how we can resolve our differences through a proper set of negotiations , " he added . his us counterpart , zoellick , said that if negotiations did not succeed , " litigation is an option " and that the bush administration was prepared for that eventuality . fresh start mandelson , a close ally of british prime minister tony blair , had promised “ a fresh start ” in transatlantic negotiations which turned bad after the united states filed a complaint with the wto in october challenging european loans to help airbus develop aircraft , such as the new a380 super-jumbo jet .
the eu responded by filing its own case against the us government over aid for boeing . the filing of cases triggered a 60-day consultation period , which expired monday .
ordinarily the failure to reach a settlement by consensus would prompt one or both of the parties to ask the wto to settle the case by a special panel and ultimately result in punitive sanctions .
but on thursday a us official said washington would delay referring its complaint to the wto in order to allow mandelson time to review the matter . bumpy ride ? according to eu trade experts , boeing has received around $ 23 billion -lrb- € 17.1 billion -rrb- in governmental development aid since 1992 .

only in october were the two sides able to find a solution to a year-long row over sanctions the eu had applied as a response to us corporate tax breaks for companies with foreign operations . all clear for take off while the international trade dispute over aviation simmers , airbus developers in germany announced that the last obstacle to extending the runway at the hamburg production facility finkenwerder had been cleared . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus construction facility for the a318 , a319 , a321 and a380 in hamburg after months of negotiations with owners of property adjacent to the proposed runway , the city council on monday announced it had purchased four parcels of land from a fruit orchard owner , paving the way for the tarmac to be extended to the necessary length for the arrival of the new a380 super-jumbo jets . the construction of the runway and the production of the a380 had been delayed for 18 months due to a land dispute .
a local church parish , which owned property bordering the finkenwerder facility , had refused to sell to land the city for the purpose of extending the airbus tarmac .
without a longer runway , the plant could not have built the super-size aircraft .

" i am interested in seeing how we can resolve our differences through a proper set of negotiations , " he added . his us counterpart , zoellick , said that if negotiations did not succeed , " litigation is an option " and that the bush administration was prepared for that eventuality . fresh start mandelson , a close ally of british prime minister tony blair , had promised “ a fresh start ” in transatlantic negotiations which turned bad after the united states filed a complaint with the wto in october challenging european loans to help airbus develop aircraft , such as the new a380 super-jumbo jet .
the eu responded by filing its own case against the us government over aid for boeing . the filing of cases triggered a 60-day consultation period , which expired monday .
ordinarily the failure to reach a settlement by consensus would prompt one or both of the parties to ask the wto to settle the case by a special panel and ultimately result in punitive sanctions .
but on thursday a us official said washington would delay referring its complaint to the wto in order to allow mandelson time to review the matter . bumpy ride ? according to eu trade experts , boeing has received around $ 23 billion -lrb- € 17.1 billion -rrb- in governmental development aid since 1992 .
the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- – the major owner in the airbus conglomerate – has taken the american competitor to task for profiting from us defense department subsidies for research in aviation and space science and nasa projects . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus a318 the us accuses the eu of handing out “ unfair subsidies amounting to billions of dollars ” for the development of airbus , a four-country consortium designed to rival the market leader boeing in building giant commercial aircraft . the aviation dispute is only the latest in a series of trade rivalries between the european union and the us .
only in october were the two sides able to find a solution to a year-long row over sanctions the eu had applied as a response to us corporate tax breaks for companies with foreign operations . all clear for take off while the international trade dispute over aviation simmers , airbus developers in germany announced that the last obstacle to extending the runway at the hamburg production facility finkenwerder had been cleared . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus construction facility for the a318 , a319 , a321 and a380 in hamburg after months of negotiations with owners of property adjacent to the proposed runway , the city council on monday announced it had purchased four parcels of land from a fruit orchard owner , paving the way for the tarmac to be extended to the necessary length for the arrival of the new a380 super-jumbo jets . the construction of the runway and the production of the a380 had been delayed for 18 months due to a land dispute .
a local church parish , which owned property bordering the finkenwerder facility , had refused to sell to land the city for the purpose of extending the airbus tarmac .
without a longer runway , the plant could not have built the super-size aircraft .
hamburg risked losing the lucrative contract and put 2,500 to 4,000 jobs in peril . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus sees light at the end of the runway the hamburg senate on thursday brought the two sides of the airbus hamburg runway dispute together and brokered an agreement that would see property sold to the aviation plant for expansion purposes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.12.2004 lufthansa forges ahead with cost-cutting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on an upwards trajectory again ?
lufthansa airlines has reached an agreement with pilots to freeze pay and make hours more flexible .
it 's part of the company 's strategy to get out of the economic blues largely brought on by low-cost carriers . german powerhouse lufthansa may be europe 's third-largest airline , but lately it has felt something like gulliver tied down by an onslaught of lilliputians in the guise of europe 's budget air carriers like ryanair or easyjet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang mayrhuber , ceo of lufthansa that 's why ceo wolfgang mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- has embarked on a campaign to slash costs at the airline , which at the end of last year found itself swimming in a sea of red ink and wondering about its long-term chances of survival in an era where early bookers can fly from germany to the uk for € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- on low-cost carriers . on monday , the company reached a pay deal with the union representing 4,400 pilots that included a wage freeze for 23 months .
the agreement will save the company more than € 30 million a year . the agreement , which will take retroactive effect to may 1 , 2004 and runs until march 31 , 2006 , includes lower starting pay for new pilots , requires an extra two hours a month flying time before overtime kicks in and generally makes working times more flexible . chief lufthansa negotiator stefan lauer said the agreement was " a milestone in concerted action to ensure competitive personnel costs . "
the pilots ' union vereinigung cockpit said the deal includes improvements in pension arrangements and brings the low-cost affiliate germanwings into the company 's collective bargaining agreement . turbulent few years in addition to cut-throat competition from the discount carriers , lufthansa has also been hit by a decline in air travel , attributed to the terrorist attacks in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 , and overall slower economic growth .
fuel price rises in recent months have also depressed profits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-cost carrier easyjet the carrier was not helped by the fact that germany has become continental europe 's most competitive travel market .
" the low-cost market in germany has absolutely exploded , " tim coombs , a managing director at aviation economics , told bloomberg . last year proved a low point , when the airline reported a record loss of € 980 million .
ceo mayrhuber , 57 , decided to take drastic action , which he first outlined in november 2003 . already familiar with slashing costs - he was placed in charge of cost-cutting in 1992 to save the carrier from bankruptcy - he announced a plan to turn lufthansa 's fortunes around in the next two years by cutting € 1.2 billion or some 20 percent .
he said 2,000 jobs would be eliminated by 2005 , following 3,600 that were cut due to a hiring freeze put into place last year . is it enough ? but some analysts wonder if lufthansa is flying fast enough to stay above insolvency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agreement is " nice to have , but it 's not a big step , " uwe weinreich , an analyst with hvb bank in munich told bloomberg .
" it 's only a € 30 million chunk out of € 4.6 billion in personnel costs every year .
nevertheless , it 's a good indication that they can reach a settlement with the other unions , " such as those representing the company 's 38,000 ground crew and 14,000 flight attendants . besides the cost cutting , lufthansa has been lowering fares and making ticketing more flexible in an attempt to attract customers .
even so , lufthansa 's fares on short-haul routes are still often triple those of low-cost competitors . still , things appear to be looking up .
the company 's cost-cutting plans combined with increased passenger numbers appear to be having an effect , and the carrier announced a third quarter profit of € 125 million , largely due to an increase in air traffic revenue of 10 percent . mayrhuber said cuts still needed to be deeper and problems of overcapacity addressed if the company is to stay healthy in the long run . " our current numbers should not hide the fact that we clearly need better operating earnings , in order to secure the future of the enterprise for the next generation , " he said last month . but after monday 's pay agreement , he was feeling somewhat better .

lufthansa airlines has reached an agreement with pilots to freeze pay and make hours more flexible .
it 's part of the company 's strategy to get out of the economic blues largely brought on by low-cost carriers . german powerhouse lufthansa may be europe 's third-largest airline , but lately it has felt something like gulliver tied down by an onslaught of lilliputians in the guise of europe 's budget air carriers like ryanair or easyjet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang mayrhuber , ceo of lufthansa that 's why ceo wolfgang mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- has embarked on a campaign to slash costs at the airline , which at the end of last year found itself swimming in a sea of red ink and wondering about its long-term chances of survival in an era where early bookers can fly from germany to the uk for € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- on low-cost carriers . on monday , the company reached a pay deal with the union representing 4,400 pilots that included a wage freeze for 23 months .
the agreement will save the company more than € 30 million a year . the agreement , which will take retroactive effect to may 1 , 2004 and runs until march 31 , 2006 , includes lower starting pay for new pilots , requires an extra two hours a month flying time before overtime kicks in and generally makes working times more flexible . chief lufthansa negotiator stefan lauer said the agreement was " a milestone in concerted action to ensure competitive personnel costs . "
the pilots ' union vereinigung cockpit said the deal includes improvements in pension arrangements and brings the low-cost affiliate germanwings into the company 's collective bargaining agreement . turbulent few years in addition to cut-throat competition from the discount carriers , lufthansa has also been hit by a decline in air travel , attributed to the terrorist attacks in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 , and overall slower economic growth .
fuel price rises in recent months have also depressed profits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-cost carrier easyjet the carrier was not helped by the fact that germany has become continental europe 's most competitive travel market .
" the low-cost market in germany has absolutely exploded , " tim coombs , a managing director at aviation economics , told bloomberg . last year proved a low point , when the airline reported a record loss of € 980 million .
ceo mayrhuber , 57 , decided to take drastic action , which he first outlined in november 2003 . already familiar with slashing costs - he was placed in charge of cost-cutting in 1992 to save the carrier from bankruptcy - he announced a plan to turn lufthansa 's fortunes around in the next two years by cutting € 1.2 billion or some 20 percent .
he said 2,000 jobs would be eliminated by 2005 , following 3,600 that were cut due to a hiring freeze put into place last year . is it enough ? but some analysts wonder if lufthansa is flying fast enough to stay above insolvency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agreement is " nice to have , but it 's not a big step , " uwe weinreich , an analyst with hvb bank in munich told bloomberg .
" it 's only a € 30 million chunk out of € 4.6 billion in personnel costs every year .
nevertheless , it 's a good indication that they can reach a settlement with the other unions , " such as those representing the company 's 38,000 ground crew and 14,000 flight attendants . besides the cost cutting , lufthansa has been lowering fares and making ticketing more flexible in an attempt to attract customers .
even so , lufthansa 's fares on short-haul routes are still often triple those of low-cost competitors . still , things appear to be looking up .
the company 's cost-cutting plans combined with increased passenger numbers appear to be having an effect , and the carrier announced a third quarter profit of € 125 million , largely due to an increase in air traffic revenue of 10 percent . mayrhuber said cuts still needed to be deeper and problems of overcapacity addressed if the company is to stay healthy in the long run . " our current numbers should not hide the fact that we clearly need better operating earnings , in order to secure the future of the enterprise for the next generation , " he said last month . but after monday 's pay agreement , he was feeling somewhat better .

with a complete online archive , a multimedia exhibit and a virtual opera , the classical composer is paving the way to the future . even the most classical of composers eventually find their way into the contemporary stage of the internet .
for germany ’ s favorite musical son , ludwig van beethoven , the entry into the digital era was six years in the making , but the bonn beethoven house hopes the launch of a comprehensive online archive and research center will usher in the rebirth – or at least the revival – of a musical tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house in bonn , germany .
the world ’ s largest beehoven collection , housed in the composer ’ s birthplace in bonn , germany , has turned itself into a state-of-the-art musical complex drawing on the latest in digital technology and information science .
starting this week , beethoven fans around the world will have access to the collection ’ s huge library of musical notations , letters and other objects from the composer ’ s life as well as a virtual tour through the house ’ s exhibits and a forum for the exploration of music and new media . free access for music lovers according to the museum ’ s organizers the project is “ a unique example of how a cultural institution focusing on a composer can create a modern connection between the traditional approach to his works and the use of new media . ” for a cost of € 4.5 million -lrb- $ 6.03 million -rrb- , more than 26,000 historical documents and images were scanned , digitalized and catalogued in a giant database by the fraunhofer institute for media communication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's score for the ninth symphony until their internet debut , many of the first editions , manuscripts and pictures of the composer never appeared for viewing by the general public .
because of their extremely fragile nature and value , only researchers and beethoven interpreters were allowed access to them .
the internet site changes that by providing free access to fans any where in the world . it also provides audio samples of key works and reads letters out loud to visitors . “ the digital beethoven house enables us to preserve the original documents while still informing the world about our unique collection and introducing the composer to completely new audiences , ” said museum director andreas eckhardt . cultural bridges through the ages in the beethoven house itself , visitors can take part in a stage for music visualization , a forum where new media is used to interpret beethoven ’ s works in a visual way .
inaugurated with the performance of “ fidelio , 21st century , ” a musical performance that combines beethoven ’ s only opera with 3-d computer graphics and sounds and transfers it to abstract geometrical characters on a projected stage . the protagonists of beethoven ’ s “ fidelio ” – spirals , planes and fields of color – fly across the specially created stage in the basement of the composer ’ s birth house as visitors take joysticks in hand and manipulate them to the tones of the composition .
an integrated sound system allows the music to follow the figures through the room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven , born 1770 in bonn , died 1827 in vienna “ with this step into the digital world , we hope to reach out to young people especially , ” eckhardt said , justifying the investment in new and interactive media .
it is the first project of its kind bridging traditional music with futuristic elements and technology , he said . the museum director is convinced the digitalization of the beethoven house and the introduction of more experimental musical fields will go a long way in promoting not only the composer , but also lead to new interpretations of his work and further questioning about the connection between music and multimedia . on a more pragmatic side , eckhardt expects the project to attract more visitors to the brick-and-mortar exhibits . “ yearly we have about 90,000 to 100,000 visitors at the house in bonn , ” he said .
“ i think these numbers could jump by 20 to 30 percent now . ” dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beethoven enters the modern era in bonn classical music fans from around the world are descending on bonn , germany , for the annual beethoven festival .

the three men had been under close surveillance by german intelligence following a tip-off from kurdish agents in northern iraq . the kurdish intelligence service had passed on the telephone numbers of the three iraqis .
the numbers were found in a notebook of a kurd suspected to be an important courier for ansar al islam .
german general prosecutor kay nehm said the arrest warrants were issued because the three men are accused of belonging to a terrorist network . he admitted , however , that house searches had failed to uncover any weapons or explosives which could have suggested that the suspects were planning to kill the iraqi prime minister . “ in germany , ansar-al-islam members are known to be involved in fund-raising campaigns , human trafficking and the forging of passports and other documents , ” nehm told reporters .
“ so far we have no record of them using force or carrying out assassinations here . ” on monday , a fourth suspect of lebanese origin was set free again after initial suspicions turned out to be groundless . high political profile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily interior minister otto schily has been trying to profit politically from the events surrounding allawi ’ s visit in berlin .
insisting that an assassination plot had been thwarted , he sought to highlight the efficiency of the domestic intelligence services and the positive impact of the country ’ s new anti-terror legislation .
schily had initiated the hard-hitting laws after the sept .
11 attacks on the united states . “ we ’ re responsible for the security of state leaders visiting us , ” he said .
“ we will do whatever we feel is required to ensure the safety of a guest .
in the case of prime minister ayad allawi , we also took all the necessary precautions and didn ’ t leave anything to chance . ” “ terrorists should know that our intelligence services are well informed about their intentions at any given time , no matter where and how they plan to step into action , ” schily added . bavarian interior minister günter beckstein , a member of the conservative christian social union , acknowledged that german intelligence performed well in the run-up to the allawi visit . “ the good news is that the german intelligence services are able to keep such a tight check on potentially dangerous people so that they are not in a position to commit acts of terror here , ” he said .
“ it ’ s gratifying to know that the safety of mr. allawi was ensured throughout his visit to berlin .
this goes to show that cooperation between the various intelligence people at regional and national level leaves nothing to be desired . ” hidden criticism but beckstein ’ s praise was not without a bit of hidden criticism directed towards schily and the minister ’ s plans to reorganize the intelligence services . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's conservative state interior minister günther beckstein the bavarian politician ’ s reference to cooperation between security services was intended as a rebuke to otto schily , who had recently launched a campaign to centralize intelligence gathering at national level .
schily is known to be a staunch supporter of a proposed national clearing house in which intelligence from all the various regional departments would be collected , collated and made easily accessible to officials entitled to use it . for beckstein , the uncovering and thwarting of the attack against allawi demonstrated that the current structure of regional and national units is sufficient for the job and requires no reorganization . hardy graupner -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany probes militant group ; holds three suspects arrest warrants have been issued for three iraqis suspected of planning to attack visiting iraqi prime minister ayad allawi in berlin .

the three men had been under close surveillance by german intelligence following a tip-off from kurdish agents in northern iraq . the kurdish intelligence service had passed on the telephone numbers of the three iraqis .
the numbers were found in a notebook of a kurd suspected to be an important courier for ansar al islam .
german general prosecutor kay nehm said the arrest warrants were issued because the three men are accused of belonging to a terrorist network . he admitted , however , that house searches had failed to uncover any weapons or explosives which could have suggested that the suspects were planning to kill the iraqi prime minister . “ in germany , ansar-al-islam members are known to be involved in fund-raising campaigns , human trafficking and the forging of passports and other documents , ” nehm told reporters .

in the case of prime minister ayad allawi , we also took all the necessary precautions and didn ’ t leave anything to chance . ” “ terrorists should know that our intelligence services are well informed about their intentions at any given time , no matter where and how they plan to step into action , ” schily added . bavarian interior minister günter beckstein , a member of the conservative christian social union , acknowledged that german intelligence performed well in the run-up to the allawi visit . “ the good news is that the german intelligence services are able to keep such a tight check on potentially dangerous people so that they are not in a position to commit acts of terror here , ” he said .
“ it ’ s gratifying to know that the safety of mr. allawi was ensured throughout his visit to berlin .

schily is known to be a staunch supporter of a proposed national clearing house in which intelligence from all the various regional departments would be collected , collated and made easily accessible to officials entitled to use it . for beckstein , the uncovering and thwarting of the attack against allawi demonstrated that the current structure of regional and national units is sufficient for the job and requires no reorganization . hardy graupner -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany probes militant group ; holds three suspects arrest warrants have been issued for three iraqis suspected of planning to attack visiting iraqi prime minister ayad allawi in berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.12.2004 germany examines allawi assassination plot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorists had iraqi prime minister allawi -lrb- left -rrb- in their sights prosecutors have issued arrest warrants for three iraqis belonging to the fundamentalist ansar al islam network suspected of planning an attack on iraqi interim prime minister ayad allawi last friday in germany . following warnings from german intelligence agencies that three iraqis living in germany could be planning to assassinate ayad allawi while in berlin , the prime minister ’ s agenda was changed immediately to heighten security . arrest warrants were issued over the weekend for the three members of the fundamentalist ansar al islam group who were residing in berlin , stuttgart and augsburg respectively .
the three men had been under close surveillance by german intelligence following a tip-off from kurdish agents in northern iraq . the kurdish intelligence service had passed on the telephone numbers of the three iraqis .
the numbers were found in a notebook of a kurd suspected to be an important courier for ansar al islam .
german general prosecutor kay nehm said the arrest warrants were issued because the three men are accused of belonging to a terrorist network . he admitted , however , that house searches had failed to uncover any weapons or explosives which could have suggested that the suspects were planning to kill the iraqi prime minister . “ in germany , ansar-al-islam members are known to be involved in fund-raising campaigns , human trafficking and the forging of passports and other documents , ” nehm told reporters .
“ so far we have no record of them using force or carrying out assassinations here . ” on monday , a fourth suspect of lebanese origin was set free again after initial suspicions turned out to be groundless . high political profile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily interior minister otto schily has been trying to profit politically from the events surrounding allawi ’ s visit in berlin .
insisting that an assassination plot had been thwarted , he sought to highlight the efficiency of the domestic intelligence services and the positive impact of the country ’ s new anti-terror legislation .
schily had initiated the hard-hitting laws after the sept .
11 attacks on the united states . “ we ’ re responsible for the security of state leaders visiting us , ” he said .
“ we will do whatever we feel is required to ensure the safety of a guest .
in the case of prime minister ayad allawi , we also took all the necessary precautions and didn ’ t leave anything to chance . ” “ terrorists should know that our intelligence services are well informed about their intentions at any given time , no matter where and how they plan to step into action , ” schily added . bavarian interior minister günter beckstein , a member of the conservative christian social union , acknowledged that german intelligence performed well in the run-up to the allawi visit . “ the good news is that the german intelligence services are able to keep such a tight check on potentially dangerous people so that they are not in a position to commit acts of terror here , ” he said .
“ it ’ s gratifying to know that the safety of mr. allawi was ensured throughout his visit to berlin .
this goes to show that cooperation between the various intelligence people at regional and national level leaves nothing to be desired . ” hidden criticism but beckstein ’ s praise was not without a bit of hidden criticism directed towards schily and the minister ’ s plans to reorganize the intelligence services . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's conservative state interior minister günther beckstein the bavarian politician ’ s reference to cooperation between security services was intended as a rebuke to otto schily , who had recently launched a campaign to centralize intelligence gathering at national level .
schily is known to be a staunch supporter of a proposed national clearing house in which intelligence from all the various regional departments would be collected , collated and made easily accessible to officials entitled to use it . for beckstein , the uncovering and thwarting of the attack against allawi demonstrated that the current structure of regional and national units is sufficient for the job and requires no reorganization . hardy graupner -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany probes militant group ; holds three suspects arrest warrants have been issued for three iraqis suspected of planning to attack visiting iraqi prime minister ayad allawi in berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.12.2004 less turbulence for airbus , boeing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boeing-airbus subsidy row has sailed into somewhat calmer skies eu trade commissioner peter mandelson and his us counterpart , robert zoellick , have decided to allow more time for talks to settle a transatlantic row over government aid for aviation rivals boeing and airbus . it was the first time since taking up office that the eu ’ s new trade chief met with his american colleague in paris on monday against the backdrop of reinvigorating the stalled global trade talks .
chief among the issues was the tit-for-tat spat over government subsidies for europe ’ s airbus consortium and boeing . after the meeting , the men announced they would continue talking over the new few weeks to try to settle their differences by negotiation , but would retain the option of litigation through the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- . " if we are going to avoid litigation in pursuit of the cases that both of us have now entered , we are going to have to have some pretty serious discussions about the alternative to that litigation , " mandelson told reporters . " i am interested in seeing how we can resolve our differences through a proper set of negotiations , " he added . his us counterpart , zoellick , said that if negotiations did not succeed , " litigation is an option " and that the bush administration was prepared for that eventuality . fresh start mandelson , a close ally of british prime minister tony blair , had promised “ a fresh start ” in transatlantic negotiations which turned bad after the united states filed a complaint with the wto in october challenging european loans to help airbus develop aircraft , such as the new a380 super-jumbo jet .
the eu responded by filing its own case against the us government over aid for boeing . the filing of cases triggered a 60-day consultation period , which expired monday .
ordinarily the failure to reach a settlement by consensus would prompt one or both of the parties to ask the wto to settle the case by a special panel and ultimately result in punitive sanctions .
but on thursday a us official said washington would delay referring its complaint to the wto in order to allow mandelson time to review the matter . bumpy ride ? according to eu trade experts , boeing has received around $ 23 billion -lrb- € 17.1 billion -rrb- in governmental development aid since 1992 .
the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- – the major owner in the airbus conglomerate – has taken the american competitor to task for profiting from us defense department subsidies for research in aviation and space science and nasa projects . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus a318 the us accuses the eu of handing out “ unfair subsidies amounting to billions of dollars ” for the development of airbus , a four-country consortium designed to rival the market leader boeing in building giant commercial aircraft . the aviation dispute is only the latest in a series of trade rivalries between the european union and the us .
only in october were the two sides able to find a solution to a year-long row over sanctions the eu had applied as a response to us corporate tax breaks for companies with foreign operations . all clear for take off while the international trade dispute over aviation simmers , airbus developers in germany announced that the last obstacle to extending the runway at the hamburg production facility finkenwerder had been cleared . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus construction facility for the a318 , a319 , a321 and a380 in hamburg after months of negotiations with owners of property adjacent to the proposed runway , the city council on monday announced it had purchased four parcels of land from a fruit orchard owner , paving the way for the tarmac to be extended to the necessary length for the arrival of the new a380 super-jumbo jets . the construction of the runway and the production of the a380 had been delayed for 18 months due to a land dispute .
a local church parish , which owned property bordering the finkenwerder facility , had refused to sell to land the city for the purpose of extending the airbus tarmac .
without a longer runway , the plant could not have built the super-size aircraft .
hamburg risked losing the lucrative contract and put 2,500 to 4,000 jobs in peril . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus sees light at the end of the runway the hamburg senate on thursday brought the two sides of the airbus hamburg runway dispute together and brokered an agreement that would see property sold to the aviation plant for expansion purposes .

lufthansa airlines has reached an agreement with pilots to freeze pay and make hours more flexible .
it 's part of the company 's strategy to get out of the economic blues largely brought on by low-cost carriers . german powerhouse lufthansa may be europe 's third-largest airline , but lately it has felt something like gulliver tied down by an onslaught of lilliputians in the guise of europe 's budget air carriers like ryanair or easyjet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang mayrhuber , ceo of lufthansa that 's why ceo wolfgang mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- has embarked on a campaign to slash costs at the airline , which at the end of last year found itself swimming in a sea of red ink and wondering about its long-term chances of survival in an era where early bookers can fly from germany to the uk for € 15 -lrb- $ 20 -rrb- on low-cost carriers . on monday , the company reached a pay deal with the union representing 4,400 pilots that included a wage freeze for 23 months .
the agreement will save the company more than € 30 million a year . the agreement , which will take retroactive effect to may 1 , 2004 and runs until march 31 , 2006 , includes lower starting pay for new pilots , requires an extra two hours a month flying time before overtime kicks in and generally makes working times more flexible . chief lufthansa negotiator stefan lauer said the agreement was " a milestone in concerted action to ensure competitive personnel costs . "
the pilots ' union vereinigung cockpit said the deal includes improvements in pension arrangements and brings the low-cost affiliate germanwings into the company 's collective bargaining agreement . turbulent few years in addition to cut-throat competition from the discount carriers , lufthansa has also been hit by a decline in air travel , attributed to the terrorist attacks in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 , and overall slower economic growth .
fuel price rises in recent months have also depressed profits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-cost carrier easyjet the carrier was not helped by the fact that germany has become continental europe 's most competitive travel market .
" the low-cost market in germany has absolutely exploded , " tim coombs , a managing director at aviation economics , told bloomberg . last year proved a low point , when the airline reported a record loss of € 980 million .
ceo mayrhuber , 57 , decided to take drastic action , which he first outlined in november 2003 . already familiar with slashing costs - he was placed in charge of cost-cutting in 1992 to save the carrier from bankruptcy - he announced a plan to turn lufthansa 's fortunes around in the next two years by cutting € 1.2 billion or some 20 percent .
he said 2,000 jobs would be eliminated by 2005 , following 3,600 that were cut due to a hiring freeze put into place last year . is it enough ? but some analysts wonder if lufthansa is flying fast enough to stay above insolvency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agreement is " nice to have , but it 's not a big step , " uwe weinreich , an analyst with hvb bank in munich told bloomberg .
" it 's only a € 30 million chunk out of € 4.6 billion in personnel costs every year .
nevertheless , it 's a good indication that they can reach a settlement with the other unions , " such as those representing the company 's 38,000 ground crew and 14,000 flight attendants . besides the cost cutting , lufthansa has been lowering fares and making ticketing more flexible in an attempt to attract customers .
even so , lufthansa 's fares on short-haul routes are still often triple those of low-cost competitors . still , things appear to be looking up .
the company 's cost-cutting plans combined with increased passenger numbers appear to be having an effect , and the carrier announced a third quarter profit of € 125 million , largely due to an increase in air traffic revenue of 10 percent . mayrhuber said cuts still needed to be deeper and problems of overcapacity addressed if the company is to stay healthy in the long run . " our current numbers should not hide the fact that we clearly need better operating earnings , in order to secure the future of the enterprise for the next generation , " he said last month . but after monday 's pay agreement , he was feeling somewhat better .

the agreement will save the company more than € 30 million a year . the agreement , which will take retroactive effect to may 1 , 2004 and runs until march 31 , 2006 , includes lower starting pay for new pilots , requires an extra two hours a month flying time before overtime kicks in and generally makes working times more flexible . chief lufthansa negotiator stefan lauer said the agreement was " a milestone in concerted action to ensure competitive personnel costs .

if properly fitted , filters can reduce particulate emissions by up to 99 percent . though filters will be standard in all new models from 2009 onwards , that still leaves the matter of the many diesel cars which will be sold without filters over the next four years , and those already on the road .

the resulting bans are something of a measure of last resort . banned from city centers occasionally banning diesel powered cars without particle filters from city centers would help keep the amount of microscopic particulate pollution , which a german federal environmental agency study showed contributed to the premature death of 14,000 people last year , within acceptable levels .
the particulate pollution has been linked to cancer and a host of other health problems . according to the council of german cities , the bans may start as soon as february , when weather conditions tend to increase the particulate pollution problem . " we assume that there will be driving bans in all the big german cities , in built-up areas and indeed several times a year depending on weather and traffic conditions , " jürgen resch of the duh , a german environmental organization , told reuters . the bans have also received the blessing of germany 's environment minister , jürgen trittin . filters to be introduced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of 2009 , filters will be installed in new diesel models in a few years ' time , diesel powered cars without filters will be less of an issue .
in july , after months of resistance , the german car industry agreed to start installing filters in all its new domestic diesel models by 2009 . previously , german car makers claimed that installing such filters would be too expensive , but they eventually conceded to their customers ' demands , many of whom wanted the filters .
if properly fitted , filters can reduce particulate emissions by up to 99 percent . though filters will be standard in all new models from 2009 onwards , that still leaves the matter of the many diesel cars which will be sold without filters over the next four years , and those already on the road .
diesel cars currently make up 40 percent of all new european sales . some german car parts makers , including hjs , have been manufacturing filters priced at around € 700 -lrb- $ 934 -rrb- , which can be installed in older model cars . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cars get diesel filters by 2009 after years of stalling on the issue , the german car industry has decided to introduce serial production of emission filters for diesel cars .
the announcement comes amidst mounting pressure from environmentalists .
-lrb- july 14 , 2004 -rrb- debate over diesel car filters heats up german car manufacturers and environmentalists are battling over diesel cars .
should they be fitted with filters , and should motorists who opt for so-called " clean diesel " models be given tax breaks ?

he declined to reveal allianz 's total exposure to the attacks , but insisted that the additional charge would not have a negative impact on allianz 's overall group earnings .
munich re , the world 's biggest reinsurer , also said the ruling " will not have any effect on earnings " and " will not lead us to make any additional provisions on our balance sheet . "
overall , munich re estimated that its total exposure to the attacks amounted to € 2.6 billion . dw-world.de allianz probed in us insurance scandal german insurance giant allianz revealed thursday that it , too , is being investigated in connection with the huge bid-rigging scandal between insurance brokers and insurance companies in the united states . -lrb- nov .

the zew economic research institute 's economic expectations index , based on a poll of 300 analysts and institutional investors , rose by 0.5 points to plus 14.4 points after falling sharply in the preceding four months , zew said in a statement .
the slight increase was unexpected : analysts had been pencilling in a further decline of some 2.9 points in the december index .
" positive and negative economic data are more or less balancing each other out , " zew president wolfgang franz said .
" on the one hand , the decline in the value of the dollar is continuing to be source of concern , since it could jeopardize the competitiveness of german exports .
on the other hand , the sharp drop in the price of oil is making the analysts who took part in the poll more confident . "
while strong swings in exchange rates and oil prices still represent risks to the recovery scenario , " there is no reason to alter our projection for a slight recovery next year , " franz said . dw-world.de oil price dampens investor confidence investor confidence in germany dropped in august as record oil prices could dampen the country 's economic recovery , according to experts . -lrb- aug .

critics say germany is too eager to export to questionable buyers . last wednesday , the german government released its annual report documenting the number of german-made arms exported abroad .
the report confirmed an upward trend , with foreign sales reaching an all time high of € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- in 2003 , compared to € 318 million in 2002 and € 367 million in 2001 , firmly establishing germany as the world 's fourth largest arms producer . while the increase was partly explained by the sale of a few big ticket items , including a submarine worth € 210 million to south africa , arms control advocates say the german government is all too willing to allow the sale of arms and military hardware to countries engaged in conflict or with questionable human rights records .
they point to recent sales to nigeria and india . less than a week after the report was released , german chancellor gerhard schröder kicked off a trip to china , where he promised to lobby the international community to end an arms embargo imposed in the wake of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre .
he thereby signalled his government 's willingness to further liberalize germany 's arms export policies . with the global weapons trade worth more than € 521 billion -lrb- $ 700 billion -rrb- per year , it 's not surprising that schröder , struggling with a stagnant economy and high unemployment , wants to provide a boost to a highly profitable domestic business .
but arms control advocates - with the support of green party parliamentarians - have vowed to block his efforts . government says proper checks met bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german " leopard " tanks fetch top dollar .
following widespread pressure in the late 1990 's to impose more control on the international arms trade , the german governing coalition of social democrats and greens - who campaigned promising more transparency - issued the first annual report in 2000 documenting german arms exports . that same year , the government toughened laws governing arms exports and gave an oversight committee , known as bafa , final approval over all foreign sales .
according to the rules , such sales can only be completed after it is established that the weapons are n't intended for conflict zones or countries with poor human rights records . in a press release accompanying this year 's report , the government claimed 67 percent of 2003 exports were bound for eu or nato allies and permission for the remaining exports was only granted after a careful check and bafa review were carried out . critics take issue with report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german arms sales remain undetected in official reports , say critics .
but bernhart moltmann , chairman of the study group on german arms exports of the joint conference church and development -lrb- gkke -rrb- , which will issue its own report on german arms exports next wednesday , said the government report misrepresents the facts . " the numbers given are n't clear , " he told dw-world .
" they are directed to give a good impression . " he points to the fact that more arms are bound for so-called " developing countries " than the report indicates because the government used its own definition of a " developing country , " rather than the one generally agreed upon by the development assistance committee -lrb- dac -rrb- of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . " there are problems with the definitions used , " he said . loopholes remain in addition to finding fault with the definitions used , some experts also point to loopholes in the rules . siemon wezeman , the acting head of the arms transfers project at the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- , does not dispute the government 's claim that the majority of weapons defined as " arms , " according to the criteria used to compile the government report , are bound for the eu and nato allies . of greater concern , according to wezeman , are the individual components , such as engines , which are not counted in the report and are not subject to the approval of bafa .
they may be installed in , say , a french tank and ultimately end up in the middle east or elsewhere . " we only have the figures for the major weapons systems , but not for the smaller components , " he told dw-world .
" it 's a loophole and a way for german-made arms to end up pretty much anywhere in the world . " winfried nachtwei , a deputy parliamentary leader for the green party and claudia roth , head of the greens , issued a press release on the same day the government arms report was released promising to look into ways to close the loopholes and make all german arms - whether entire weapons systems or individual components - accountable to the same checks and restrictions . just political posturing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder has promised to help lift the arms embargo on china .
if chancellor schröder intends to pave the way for german companies to sell sophisticated weapons systems to china , he could have a tough fight on his hands .
five years ago , the green party successfully blocked the controversial sale of german-made tanks to turkey . wezeman , of sipri , suspects chancellor schröder 's effort to help convince the eu to end the chinese arms embargo is pure political posturing .
even if the eu agrees , the united states has made its intention to block weapons sales to china very clear and has promised not to do business with european countries that sell arms to beijing .

critics say germany is too eager to export to questionable buyers . last wednesday , the german government released its annual report documenting the number of german-made arms exported abroad .
the report confirmed an upward trend , with foreign sales reaching an all time high of € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- in 2003 , compared to € 318 million in 2002 and € 367 million in 2001 , firmly establishing germany as the world 's fourth largest arms producer . while the increase was partly explained by the sale of a few big ticket items , including a submarine worth € 210 million to south africa , arms control advocates say the german government is all too willing to allow the sale of arms and military hardware to countries engaged in conflict or with questionable human rights records .
they point to recent sales to nigeria and india . less than a week after the report was released , german chancellor gerhard schröder kicked off a trip to china , where he promised to lobby the international community to end an arms embargo imposed in the wake of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre .
he thereby signalled his government 's willingness to further liberalize germany 's arms export policies . with the global weapons trade worth more than € 521 billion -lrb- $ 700 billion -rrb- per year , it 's not surprising that schröder , struggling with a stagnant economy and high unemployment , wants to provide a boost to a highly profitable domestic business .
but arms control advocates - with the support of green party parliamentarians - have vowed to block his efforts . government says proper checks met bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german " leopard " tanks fetch top dollar .
following widespread pressure in the late 1990 's to impose more control on the international arms trade , the german governing coalition of social democrats and greens - who campaigned promising more transparency - issued the first annual report in 2000 documenting german arms exports . that same year , the government toughened laws governing arms exports and gave an oversight committee , known as bafa , final approval over all foreign sales .
according to the rules , such sales can only be completed after it is established that the weapons are n't intended for conflict zones or countries with poor human rights records . in a press release accompanying this year 's report , the government claimed 67 percent of 2003 exports were bound for eu or nato allies and permission for the remaining exports was only granted after a careful check and bafa review were carried out . critics take issue with report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german arms sales remain undetected in official reports , say critics .
but bernhart moltmann , chairman of the study group on german arms exports of the joint conference church and development -lrb- gkke -rrb- , which will issue its own report on german arms exports next wednesday , said the government report misrepresents the facts . " the numbers given are n't clear , " he told dw-world .
" they are directed to give a good impression . " he points to the fact that more arms are bound for so-called " developing countries " than the report indicates because the government used its own definition of a " developing country , " rather than the one generally agreed upon by the development assistance committee -lrb- dac -rrb- of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . " there are problems with the definitions used , " he said . loopholes remain in addition to finding fault with the definitions used , some experts also point to loopholes in the rules . siemon wezeman , the acting head of the arms transfers project at the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- , does not dispute the government 's claim that the majority of weapons defined as " arms , " according to the criteria used to compile the government report , are bound for the eu and nato allies . of greater concern , according to wezeman , are the individual components , such as engines , which are not counted in the report and are not subject to the approval of bafa .
they may be installed in , say , a french tank and ultimately end up in the middle east or elsewhere . " we only have the figures for the major weapons systems , but not for the smaller components , " he told dw-world .
" it 's a loophole and a way for german-made arms to end up pretty much anywhere in the world . " winfried nachtwei , a deputy parliamentary leader for the green party and claudia roth , head of the greens , issued a press release on the same day the government arms report was released promising to look into ways to close the loopholes and make all german arms - whether entire weapons systems or individual components - accountable to the same checks and restrictions . just political posturing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder has promised to help lift the arms embargo on china .
if chancellor schröder intends to pave the way for german companies to sell sophisticated weapons systems to china , he could have a tough fight on his hands .

critics say germany is too eager to export to questionable buyers . last wednesday , the german government released its annual report documenting the number of german-made arms exported abroad .
the report confirmed an upward trend , with foreign sales reaching an all time high of € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- in 2003 , compared to € 318 million in 2002 and € 367 million in 2001 , firmly establishing germany as the world 's fourth largest arms producer . while the increase was partly explained by the sale of a few big ticket items , including a submarine worth € 210 million to south africa , arms control advocates say the german government is all too willing to allow the sale of arms and military hardware to countries engaged in conflict or with questionable human rights records .
they point to recent sales to nigeria and india . less than a week after the report was released , german chancellor gerhard schröder kicked off a trip to china , where he promised to lobby the international community to end an arms embargo imposed in the wake of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre .
he thereby signalled his government 's willingness to further liberalize germany 's arms export policies . with the global weapons trade worth more than € 521 billion -lrb- $ 700 billion -rrb- per year , it 's not surprising that schröder , struggling with a stagnant economy and high unemployment , wants to provide a boost to a highly profitable domestic business .
but arms control advocates - with the support of green party parliamentarians - have vowed to block his efforts . government says proper checks met bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german " leopard " tanks fetch top dollar .
following widespread pressure in the late 1990 's to impose more control on the international arms trade , the german governing coalition of social democrats and greens - who campaigned promising more transparency - issued the first annual report in 2000 documenting german arms exports . that same year , the government toughened laws governing arms exports and gave an oversight committee , known as bafa , final approval over all foreign sales .
according to the rules , such sales can only be completed after it is established that the weapons are n't intended for conflict zones or countries with poor human rights records . in a press release accompanying this year 's report , the government claimed 67 percent of 2003 exports were bound for eu or nato allies and permission for the remaining exports was only granted after a careful check and bafa review were carried out . critics take issue with report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german arms sales remain undetected in official reports , say critics .
but bernhart moltmann , chairman of the study group on german arms exports of the joint conference church and development -lrb- gkke -rrb- , which will issue its own report on german arms exports next wednesday , said the government report misrepresents the facts . " the numbers given are n't clear , " he told dw-world .
" they are directed to give a good impression . " he points to the fact that more arms are bound for so-called " developing countries " than the report indicates because the government used its own definition of a " developing country , " rather than the one generally agreed upon by the development assistance committee -lrb- dac -rrb- of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . " there are problems with the definitions used , " he said . loopholes remain in addition to finding fault with the definitions used , some experts also point to loopholes in the rules . siemon wezeman , the acting head of the arms transfers project at the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- , does not dispute the government 's claim that the majority of weapons defined as " arms , " according to the criteria used to compile the government report , are bound for the eu and nato allies . of greater concern , according to wezeman , are the individual components , such as engines , which are not counted in the report and are not subject to the approval of bafa .
they may be installed in , say , a french tank and ultimately end up in the middle east or elsewhere . " we only have the figures for the major weapons systems , but not for the smaller components , " he told dw-world .
" it 's a loophole and a way for german-made arms to end up pretty much anywhere in the world . " winfried nachtwei , a deputy parliamentary leader for the green party and claudia roth , head of the greens , issued a press release on the same day the government arms report was released promising to look into ways to close the loopholes and make all german arms - whether entire weapons systems or individual components - accountable to the same checks and restrictions . just political posturing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder has promised to help lift the arms embargo on china .
if chancellor schröder intends to pave the way for german companies to sell sophisticated weapons systems to china , he could have a tough fight on his hands .
five years ago , the green party successfully blocked the controversial sale of german-made tanks to turkey . wezeman , of sipri , suspects chancellor schröder 's effort to help convince the eu to end the chinese arms embargo is pure political posturing .
even if the eu agrees , the united states has made its intention to block weapons sales to china very clear and has promised not to do business with european countries that sell arms to beijing .

with a complete online archive , a multimedia exhibit and a virtual opera , the classical composer is paving the way to the future . even the most classical of composers eventually find their way into the contemporary stage of the internet .
for germany ’ s favorite musical son , ludwig van beethoven , the entry into the digital era was six years in the making , but the bonn beethoven house hopes the launch of a comprehensive online archive and research center will usher in the rebirth – or at least the revival – of a musical tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house in bonn , germany .
the world ’ s largest beehoven collection , housed in the composer ’ s birthplace in bonn , germany , has turned itself into a state-of-the-art musical complex drawing on the latest in digital technology and information science .
starting this week , beethoven fans around the world will have access to the collection ’ s huge library of musical notations , letters and other objects from the composer ’ s life as well as a virtual tour through the house ’ s exhibits and a forum for the exploration of music and new media . free access for music lovers according to the museum ’ s organizers the project is “ a unique example of how a cultural institution focusing on a composer can create a modern connection between the traditional approach to his works and the use of new media . ” for a cost of € 4.5 million -lrb- $ 6.03 million -rrb- , more than 26,000 historical documents and images were scanned , digitalized and catalogued in a giant database by the fraunhofer institute for media communication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's score for the ninth symphony until their internet debut , many of the first editions , manuscripts and pictures of the composer never appeared for viewing by the general public .
because of their extremely fragile nature and value , only researchers and beethoven interpreters were allowed access to them .
the internet site changes that by providing free access to fans any where in the world . it also provides audio samples of key works and reads letters out loud to visitors . “ the digital beethoven house enables us to preserve the original documents while still informing the world about our unique collection and introducing the composer to completely new audiences , ” said museum director andreas eckhardt . cultural bridges through the ages in the beethoven house itself , visitors can take part in a stage for music visualization , a forum where new media is used to interpret beethoven ’ s works in a visual way .
inaugurated with the performance of “ fidelio , 21st century , ” a musical performance that combines beethoven ’ s only opera with 3-d computer graphics and sounds and transfers it to abstract geometrical characters on a projected stage . the protagonists of beethoven ’ s “ fidelio ” – spirals , planes and fields of color – fly across the specially created stage in the basement of the composer ’ s birth house as visitors take joysticks in hand and manipulate them to the tones of the composition .
an integrated sound system allows the music to follow the figures through the room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven , born 1770 in bonn , died 1827 in vienna “ with this step into the digital world , we hope to reach out to young people especially , ” eckhardt said , justifying the investment in new and interactive media .
it is the first project of its kind bridging traditional music with futuristic elements and technology , he said . the museum director is convinced the digitalization of the beethoven house and the introduction of more experimental musical fields will go a long way in promoting not only the composer , but also lead to new interpretations of his work and further questioning about the connection between music and multimedia . on a more pragmatic side , eckhardt expects the project to attract more visitors to the brick-and-mortar exhibits . “ yearly we have about 90,000 to 100,000 visitors at the house in bonn , ” he said .

with a complete online archive , a multimedia exhibit and a virtual opera , the classical composer is paving the way to the future . even the most classical of composers eventually find their way into the contemporary stage of the internet .
for germany ’ s favorite musical son , ludwig van beethoven , the entry into the digital era was six years in the making , but the bonn beethoven house hopes the launch of a comprehensive online archive and research center will usher in the rebirth – or at least the revival – of a musical tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house in bonn , germany .
the world ’ s largest beehoven collection , housed in the composer ’ s birthplace in bonn , germany , has turned itself into a state-of-the-art musical complex drawing on the latest in digital technology and information science .
starting this week , beethoven fans around the world will have access to the collection ’ s huge library of musical notations , letters and other objects from the composer ’ s life as well as a virtual tour through the house ’ s exhibits and a forum for the exploration of music and new media . free access for music lovers according to the museum ’ s organizers the project is “ a unique example of how a cultural institution focusing on a composer can create a modern connection between the traditional approach to his works and the use of new media . ” for a cost of € 4.5 million -lrb- $ 6.03 million -rrb- , more than 26,000 historical documents and images were scanned , digitalized and catalogued in a giant database by the fraunhofer institute for media communication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's score for the ninth symphony until their internet debut , many of the first editions , manuscripts and pictures of the composer never appeared for viewing by the general public .
because of their extremely fragile nature and value , only researchers and beethoven interpreters were allowed access to them .
the internet site changes that by providing free access to fans any where in the world . it also provides audio samples of key works and reads letters out loud to visitors . “ the digital beethoven house enables us to preserve the original documents while still informing the world about our unique collection and introducing the composer to completely new audiences , ” said museum director andreas eckhardt . cultural bridges through the ages in the beethoven house itself , visitors can take part in a stage for music visualization , a forum where new media is used to interpret beethoven ’ s works in a visual way .
inaugurated with the performance of “ fidelio , 21st century , ” a musical performance that combines beethoven ’ s only opera with 3-d computer graphics and sounds and transfers it to abstract geometrical characters on a projected stage . the protagonists of beethoven ’ s “ fidelio ” – spirals , planes and fields of color – fly across the specially created stage in the basement of the composer ’ s birth house as visitors take joysticks in hand and manipulate them to the tones of the composition .
an integrated sound system allows the music to follow the figures through the room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven , born 1770 in bonn , died 1827 in vienna “ with this step into the digital world , we hope to reach out to young people especially , ” eckhardt said , justifying the investment in new and interactive media .
it is the first project of its kind bridging traditional music with futuristic elements and technology , he said . the museum director is convinced the digitalization of the beethoven house and the introduction of more experimental musical fields will go a long way in promoting not only the composer , but also lead to new interpretations of his work and further questioning about the connection between music and multimedia . on a more pragmatic side , eckhardt expects the project to attract more visitors to the brick-and-mortar exhibits . “ yearly we have about 90,000 to 100,000 visitors at the house in bonn , ” he said .
“ i think these numbers could jump by 20 to 30 percent now . ” dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beethoven enters the modern era in bonn classical music fans from around the world are descending on bonn , germany , for the annual beethoven festival .

five non-us staff and four attackers were killed when gunmen used explosives to break into the compound .
the saudi cabinet condemned the attack and reaffirmed its pledge to " fight terrorism in all its aspects " .
a group claiming to be the saudi wing of al-qaeda said it carried out monday 's attack .
the group " al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula " said in a statement posted on a militant website that the operation had been dubbed " the blessed falluja battle " .
the iraqi city of falluja was recently the scene of a large-scale assault against insurgents by us-led forces .
three of the attackers were killed at the scene , and one died later in hospital .
a fifth gunmen was arrested .
the five consular staff who died were from a range of asian and arab nations , although exact details remain unclear .
in riyadh , us embassy spokeswoman carol kalin said four of the five held administrative jobs , and one was a private contract guard on the consulate 's payroll . "
smoke could be seen rising from the compound " ben abu ismail , jeddah your views : consulate attack eyewitness : attack in jeddah all americans who were at the consulate have been reported to be safe .
us president george w bush said the attack showed " terrorists are still on the move " , trying to force the us to withdraw from saudi arabia and iraq .
" they want us to grow timid and weary in the face of their willingness to kill randomly , " he said .
us secretary of state colin powell said the us would not be deterred from its fight against terrorism .
in a statement , the saudi cabinet promised to " hunt down its -lsb- terrorism 's -rsb- perpetrators until they are rooted out and society is cleaned of them " .
a saudi security source told reuters news agency that heavy security had prevented the militants from getting into the consulate by car .
they instead fought their way in using grenades and automatic weapons .
the compound was then stormed by the security forces .
saudi security officials initially said four saudi guards were killed and two others wounded in the clash .
but adel al-jubeir , foreign affairs adviser to saudi crown prince abdullah , later said that no saudi troops had died .

" we could hear the gunshots outside , but we did n't know what was going on , " the employee said .
correspondents say security around the consulate has been extremely tight since a series of bombings by islamic militants in saudi arabia began in 2003 , mainly targeting buildings that house foreigners .
previous operations targeting western interests have been blamed on groups inspired by osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network , which wants to drive all non-muslims out of the kingdom .
the last major attack was in may , when gunmen attacked oil companies and a housing compound in the eastern city of khobar , killing about 30 people .

figures show that one in five children in scotland aged 12 is clinically obese .
deputy health minister rhona brankin said education was key in raising awareness among youngsters over the ticking health time bomb .
the scottish national party urged the executive to set obesity targets .
public , voluntary and health figures are gathering in edinburgh for a conference to discuss the issue .
earlier this year , the executive launched a campaign to improve children 's diets and promote physical activity .
it included nutritional standards for school meals , including set levels for fat , salt and sugar and funding free fruit for pupils in primary 1 and 2 . "
scotland 's children are our future and we must offer the building blocks that will help them make healthier choices " rhona brankin deputy health minister the world health organisation endorsed the strategy as an example for other countries to follow .
ms brankin described figures suggesting one in five children aged 12 is clinically obese and every third child is overweight , as " truly frightening " .
she said : " we can not sit back and do nothing in the face of this health time bomb .
" scotland 's children are our future and we must offer the building blocks that will help them make healthier choices .
" a lot of the work we are taking forward is based on education and raising awareness .
i firmly believe this is the best approach .
' strong words ' " with comprehension comes informed choice and co-operation .
everyone has a part to play in encouraging children to become more active and eat more healthily . "
nationalists are proposing a bill to ban print , cinema and billboard junk food adverts and the introduction of a " traffic light " labelling system .
snp health spokeswoman shona robison said the executive should introduce targets to reduce childhood obesity .
she said : " we have already grasped the nettle in terms of smoking in public places and we must do the same to counteract our poor record on other areas of public health .
" but while the executive has strong words on the matter , it has yet to even set a target for reducing obscenely high levels of obesity in scotland . "
the uk government is considering whether it should ban junk food television advertising during the day .

deputy health minister rhona brankin said education was key in raising awareness among youngsters over the ticking health time bomb .
the scottish national party urged the executive to set obesity targets .
public , voluntary and health figures are gathering in edinburgh for a conference to discuss the issue .
earlier this year , the executive launched a campaign to improve children 's diets and promote physical activity .
it included nutritional standards for school meals , including set levels for fat , salt and sugar and funding free fruit for pupils in primary 1 and 2 .
scotland 's children are our future and we must offer the building blocks that will help them make healthier choices rhona brankin deputy health minister the world health organisation endorsed the strategy as an example for other countries to follow .
ms brankin described figures suggesting one in five children aged 12 is clinically obese and every third child is overweight , as " truly frightening " .
she said : " we can not sit back and do nothing in the face of this health time bomb .
" scotland 's children are our future and we must offer the building blocks that will help them make healthier choices .
" a lot of the work we are taking forward is based on education and raising awareness .
i firmly believe this is the best approach .
' strong words ' " with comprehension comes informed choice and co-operation .
everyone has a part to play in encouraging children to become more active and eat more healthily . "
nationalists are proposing a bill to ban print , cinema and billboard junk food adverts and the introduction of a " traffic light " labelling system .
snp health spokeswoman shona robison said the executive should introduce targets to reduce childhood obesity .
she said : " we have already grasped the nettle in terms of smoking in public places and we must do the same to counteract our poor record on other areas of public health .
" but while the executive has strong words on the matter , it has yet to even set a target for reducing obscenely high levels of obesity in scotland . "
the uk government is considering whether it should ban junk food television advertising during the day .

it found that people who habitually slept for five hours had 15 % more ghrelin , a hormone which increases feelings of hunger , than those who slept for eight hours .
those who slept for less time were also found to have 15 % less leptin , a hormone which suppresses appetite .
" these differences are likely to increase appetite and , in societies where food is readily available , this may contribute to obesity , " dr taheri said .
" it is important for people to realise there is more to obesity than just stuffing your face . "
sleep is important dr taheri , whose work is published in the journal public library of science medicine , said there was evidence that children as young as two years old might be in danger of becoming obese if they lost a lot of sleep .
" we have to realise that sleeping is not a waste of time , we have to recognise that it impacts on our health . "
the results of the study were replicated in a second piece of research , led by the university of chicago .
this study found people who slept for only four hours a night for two nights had an 18 % reduction in leptin , anda 28 % increase in ghrelin .
the young men in the study also tended to eat more sweet and starchy foods when sleep was cut short .
a third recent study , by columbia university , also found found people who slept four hours or less per night were 73 % more likely to be obese .
dr neil stanley , of the british sleep society , said not everybody needs a lot of sleep .
" there have been a number of people who have been famous for being short sleepers , most famously in our time margaret thatcher , who was renowned for only four hours , and before that people like napoleon and hitler .
" none of those was particularly large .
but on the other side is winston churchill , who famously had his two hour nap in the afternoon , but also did not sleep very much during the evening , and can not be said to have been a slender gentleman . "

deller , best-known for orchestrating social events , scooped the £ 25,000 modern art award in london on monday .
he won for memory bucket , a documentary exploring crawford , texas , and the branch davidian siege in nearby waco .
video art dominated the 2004 shortlist , with kutlug ataman , langlands & bell and yinka shonibare also nominated .
accepting the award , deller dedicated it to " everyone who cycles in london , everyone who looks after wildlife and bats , the quaker movement and everyone i 've worked with " .
a jeremy deller mural linked acid house music with brass bands he said the award process was " a not unenjoyable experience " and it was " a strange event " .
deller is also known for recreating the battle of orgreave , one of the most violent clashes of the 1980s miners ' strike , using veteran miners and historical re-enactment societies .
deller 's work includes a giant piece of graffiti that connects a selection of words to demonstrate how " acid house " is linked to " brass bands " .
he enlisted brass bands to cover acid house songs and organised a parade in san sebastian , spain , to celebrate its diversity .
his social parade video follows low-profile social groups in the city while five memorials is a photographic tribute to striking miners , immigrants and a cyclist killed by a drunk driver .
introducing the award , turner chairman and tate gallery director sir nicholas serota attacked the uk media for taking delight in a warehouse fire that destroyed many works of modern art earlier this year .
kutlug ataman 's 12 features six stories of reincarnation " the response of some sections of the press , who saw this as a moment of catharsis or even celebration , was in some ways reminiscent of the response to the book burnings in nazi germany in the 1930s , " he said .
his comment was met with muted applause at the ceremony at tate britain .
he continued : " and it tells us just how far behind the british public lags the british press , or at least some sections of the british press . "
public interest in the turner prize had " never been higher " , he added .
the jury said they wanted to stress the strength of the shortlist and said all four nominees produced " outstanding presentations " .
' political change ' sir nicholas said : " we live in a moment of big political change .
the judges felt that deller 's work reflects that .
" he orchestrates creativity out of other people rather than necessarily himself . "
last year 's winner , grayson perry , said of deller : " he 's the most creative artist of all the nominees .
nobody was surprised he won . "
a previous nominee tracey emin said : " deller 's work is very nice .

deller , best-known for orchestrating social events , scooped the £ 25,000 modern art award in london on monday .
he won for memory bucket , a documentary exploring crawford , texas , and the branch davidian siege in nearby waco .
video art dominated the 2004 shortlist , with kutlug ataman , langlands & bell and yinka shonibare also nominated .
accepting the award , deller dedicated it to " everyone who cycles in london , everyone who looks after wildlife and bats , the quaker movement and everyone i 've worked with " .
a jeremy deller mural linked acid house music with brass bands he said the award process was " a not unenjoyable experience " and it was " a strange event " .
deller is also known for recreating the battle of orgreave , one of the most violent clashes of the 1980s miners ' strike , using veteran miners and historical re-enactment societies .
deller 's work includes a giant piece of graffiti that connects a selection of words to demonstrate how " acid house " is linked to " brass bands " .
he enlisted brass bands to cover acid house songs and organised a parade in san sebastian , spain , to celebrate its diversity .
his social parade video follows low-profile social groups in the city while five memorials is a photographic tribute to striking miners , immigrants and a cyclist killed by a drunk driver .
introducing the award , turner chairman and tate gallery director sir nicholas serota attacked the uk media for taking delight in a warehouse fire that destroyed many works of modern art earlier this year .
kutlug ataman 's 12 features six stories of reincarnation " the response of some sections of the press , who saw this as a moment of catharsis or even celebration , was in some ways reminiscent of the response to the book burnings in nazi germany in the 1930s , " he said .
his comment was met with muted applause at the ceremony at tate britain .
he continued : " and it tells us just how far behind the british public lags the british press , or at least some sections of the british press . "
public interest in the turner prize had " never been higher " , he added .
the jury said they wanted to stress the strength of the shortlist and said all four nominees produced " outstanding presentations " .
' political change ' sir nicholas said : " we live in a moment of big political change .
the judges felt that deller 's work reflects that .
" he orchestrates creativity out of other people rather than necessarily himself . "
last year 's winner , grayson perry , said of deller : " he 's the most creative artist of all the nominees .
nobody was surprised he won . "
a previous nominee tracey emin said : " deller 's work is very nice .
i liked them all . "
