deutsche welle met up with the new director . since weimar 's glory days as european city of culture in 1999 , johann wolfgang von goethe 's home town has been struggling to maintain the international flair it gained five years ago . but now there 's a new girl in town - and she means business . under nike wagner , once tipped as a possible new director of the bayreuth festival but pipped at the post by her younger cousin katharina , the 2004 weimar arts festival marks a new departure for a city that 's trying hard to shake off its conservative image .
the revamped event has been hailed as a forum for contemporary arts , including music , art , literature and dance . the weimar mythology in a city as steeped in history as weimar , the task of re-energizing the local arts festival while upholding the city 's formidable legacy is far from an easy one .
but wagner stresses that the city 's unique past is what makes her post so challenging . " weimar has always had a certain mythology for me , " she says .
" i 'm west german through and through , but when i studied german at university , weimar really captured my imagination . " vokhard knigge , director of the weimar klassik foundation which organizes the festival , described her appointment as an " extraordinary opportunity . "
when the former culture minister in the hamburg regional government agreed to take over , a funding crisis meant it was n't even certain the event had a future .
and wagner admitted she had her work cut out for her .
" my generation never gave any thought to the eastern half of germany , which is something i deeply regret , " she says .
" but i was thrilled when i was asked to take over the festival . "
last but not liszt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe und schiller in weimar : gone but not forgotten in the past , the festival has highlighted the city 's literary heritage .
not only home to goethe and schiller , weimar 's other famous sons include herder and nietzsche .
but this year , wagner - not one to shy away from controversy - has chosen to highlight the hungarian composer franz lizst , who spent several decades in the city and who also happens to be her great , great grandfather . " this city is more or less off the beaten tourist track , and i wanted to find a way of making it more attractive , " she explains .
" i felt that music did this more than literature , so i decided to organize a music festival - and who do i come across ?
franz lizst . " moreover , wagner renamed the new-look festival pèlerinage , a title inspired by liszt 's piano cycle " années de pèlerinage " .
the pilgrimage theme is central to this year 's event , which has " heimweh " -lrb- homesickness -rrb- as its motto . " to me , art is something that has nothing to do with anything stationary , " wagner says .
" art is restless , it 's always looking for new departures , new shores , new utopias . " in 2004 , the increased post-enlargement east european presence at the festival gives this theme added relevance .
" nietzsche 's philosophy , for example , described the status and sensibility of new-age man as nomadic , " points out wagner .
" that 's the trademark of the modern age - in a philosophical sense , we no longer have a home . " commemorating the past this year 's festival also features plenty of modern music , including work by béla bartok and contemporary composers such as györgy kurtág , steffen schleiermacher and heiner goebbels .
wagner is aware that her detractors might find her program a little too challenging for classicist weimar .
but she firmly believes that the festival 's juxtaposition of old and new can only be good for a city whose history is both a boon and a burden . " modernist movements tended to fail here , they were often banished , " she observes .
" take the bauhaus artists , who left to go to dessau .
modernist movements have always been given a hard time in weimar , but it has to be pointed out that no other city needs modernism more than this one . " " it has a surplus of everything else , " she adds .
" its museum collections and archives are phenomenal , and obviously , they need to be preserved very carefully .
but you have to get around traditions , you have to see them as a challenge ! " another of her innovations has been to usher in a new tradition : every year the weimar festival will open with a concert in memory of buchenwald , the nearby nazi concentration camp . " it 's a memorial concert , but it wo n't be held in buchenwald , which would exploit the horrific past of the location , " she stresses .
" it 's just a thoughtful , beautiful orchestral performance … .. there are few ways of commemorating the past appropriately , and this is one possible solution .

instead they have become the pleasure of an alarming percentage of the nation 's youth . when it comes to alcohol and tobacco consumption , germany is ailing .
with 16.7 million smokers and 1.6 million alcoholics , smoking and drinking have become so embedded in the fabric of society that it is hard to conceive of how younger generations can avoid falling prey to their addictive clutch .
truth is , tens of thousands can not . the staggering climb in both alcohol and tobacco use amongst youth groups was overlooked for too long , and although there are now some measures in place to both correct the damage already done and to prevent its continuation , there is a long way to go in protecting children from these essentially adult vices .
over the past ten years , tobacco consumption among 12-15 year-olds has almost doubled , with some 21 percent of girls and 18 percent of boys in the age group smoking regularly .
for 16-19 year-olds , the figure is 45 percent .
they 're alarming statistics , not least because smoking in germany is not actually legal until the age of 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alcopops but the country is a smokers ' paradise , with cheap cigarettes which kids can buy from machines on street corners and very few restrictions as to where it is or is not acceptable to light up .
in fact , the state of berlin broke new ground this year in implementing a ban on smoking in its schools .
it 's a move which other states are likely to follow , but for the time being children over the age of 16 can smoke in designated areas on school premises provided they present a letter of consent from their parents .
complex issues the biggest question is , if smoking is no more socially acceptable now than it was ten years ago - which it is not - why the massive rise ?
marita völker-albert , press officer for the federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- said the reasons are manifold .
" it 's different for boys and girls .
boys see it as a way of being cool , it makes them feel older and more masculine , whereas girls tend to succumb to peer-pressure and use smoking as a way of staying thin , " völker-albert told dw-world . jörg richert , managing director of karuna , an organization which helps children and young people with potential or existing addiction problems , believes there are more critical factors at play .
" social pressures created by the continual drop in living standards in germany lead to children and young adults not receiving the attention they need . when kids feel their parents are neglecting them , they try to get their attention by taking up smoking or drinking , " richert told dw-world . but he also cites another important issue as the desire of children to grow up against the backdrop of adults trying to stay young . " it is much more difficult for kids to become adults because we wear the same clothes as them , we listen to the same music , go to the same concerts - in short , we steal their identity , " richert said . so much for the reasons behind the trend , but what of the solutions ?
völker-albert believes it is crucial to get the young smokers and drinkers to discuss the potential dangers of what they are doing to their bodies .
" until they start talking to each other , there can be no critical reflection , " she said .
amongst others , the bzga already runs a campaign of sending young people to educate their contemporaries on germany 's beaches . nipping danger in the bud richert welcomes such measures .
as far as he is concerned , the only real way to the heart of the matter is to intervene in a preventative role at a very early stage , not least because of the snowball effect of early tobacco addiction .
" we now know that people who start smoking at an early age are much more likely to move on to alcohol or other addictive substances , " richert said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youngsters to talk to their contempoaries on german beaches and therein lies another problem .
although the consumption of wine and beer among youth groups has tailed off over the past years , the emergence of alcopops has had a truly explosive impact on child and youth drinking habits .
statistics from the bzga show that in 2003 almost 50 percent of young people between the ages of 14-17 were drinking alcopops at least once a month - six times more than in 1998 .
" alcopops even appeal to very young teenagers .
girls used to go out and drink coke , now they drink alcopops instead , but they do n't notice the alcohol .
young people do n't actually like alcohol , but they are seduced into liking it , " völker-albert said .
the crux of the matter last month the government introduced sweeping legislation to put up the tax on these liquor-laced , sickly sweet sodas , increasing the price of a bottle by around € 0.80 -lrb- $ 0.96 -rrb- , but whether it will actually have the desired effect remains to be seen .
" the fact that the prices have gone up wo n't change anything , except that i wo n't buy it myself , i 'll let other people buy them for me , " 16-year-old marietta told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youths drinking alcopops but the alcohol issue does not stand and fall with alcoholic soda .
although he welcomes the price hike , jörg richert believes the whole issue detracts from the real and much more existential core of the problem , which he sees as inextricably linked to declining social standards in germany , " the discussion surrounding alcopops is a distraction .
politicians should be looking at the employment market .
from january onwards , there will be 500,000 more children living from welfare benefit and the consequence will be the exorbitant increase in drug use , " he said . it 's a sombre prediction , but richert claims there is an undeniable connection between poverty and drinking , smoking and drugs .

instead they have become the pleasure of an alarming percentage of the nation 's youth . when it comes to alcohol and tobacco consumption , germany is ailing .
with 16.7 million smokers and 1.6 million alcoholics , smoking and drinking have become so embedded in the fabric of society that it is hard to conceive of how younger generations can avoid falling prey to their addictive clutch .
truth is , tens of thousands can not . the staggering climb in both alcohol and tobacco use amongst youth groups was overlooked for too long , and although there are now some measures in place to both correct the damage already done and to prevent its continuation , there is a long way to go in protecting children from these essentially adult vices .
over the past ten years , tobacco consumption among 12-15 year-olds has almost doubled , with some 21 percent of girls and 18 percent of boys in the age group smoking regularly .
for 16-19 year-olds , the figure is 45 percent .
they 're alarming statistics , not least because smoking in germany is not actually legal until the age of 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alcopops but the country is a smokers ' paradise , with cheap cigarettes which kids can buy from machines on street corners and very few restrictions as to where it is or is not acceptable to light up .
in fact , the state of berlin broke new ground this year in implementing a ban on smoking in its schools .
it 's a move which other states are likely to follow , but for the time being children over the age of 16 can smoke in designated areas on school premises provided they present a letter of consent from their parents .
complex issues the biggest question is , if smoking is no more socially acceptable now than it was ten years ago - which it is not - why the massive rise ?
marita völker-albert , press officer for the federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- said the reasons are manifold .
" it 's different for boys and girls .
boys see it as a way of being cool , it makes them feel older and more masculine , whereas girls tend to succumb to peer-pressure and use smoking as a way of staying thin , " völker-albert told dw-world . jörg richert , managing director of karuna , an organization which helps children and young people with potential or existing addiction problems , believes there are more critical factors at play .
" social pressures created by the continual drop in living standards in germany lead to children and young adults not receiving the attention they need . when kids feel their parents are neglecting them , they try to get their attention by taking up smoking or drinking , " richert told dw-world . but he also cites another important issue as the desire of children to grow up against the backdrop of adults trying to stay young . " it is much more difficult for kids to become adults because we wear the same clothes as them , we listen to the same music , go to the same concerts - in short , we steal their identity , " richert said . so much for the reasons behind the trend , but what of the solutions ?
völker-albert believes it is crucial to get the young smokers and drinkers to discuss the potential dangers of what they are doing to their bodies .
" until they start talking to each other , there can be no critical reflection , " she said .
amongst others , the bzga already runs a campaign of sending young people to educate their contemporaries on germany 's beaches . nipping danger in the bud richert welcomes such measures .
as far as he is concerned , the only real way to the heart of the matter is to intervene in a preventative role at a very early stage , not least because of the snowball effect of early tobacco addiction .
" we now know that people who start smoking at an early age are much more likely to move on to alcohol or other addictive substances , " richert said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youngsters to talk to their contempoaries on german beaches and therein lies another problem .
although the consumption of wine and beer among youth groups has tailed off over the past years , the emergence of alcopops has had a truly explosive impact on child and youth drinking habits .
statistics from the bzga show that in 2003 almost 50 percent of young people between the ages of 14-17 were drinking alcopops at least once a month - six times more than in 1998 .
" alcopops even appeal to very young teenagers .
girls used to go out and drink coke , now they drink alcopops instead , but they do n't notice the alcohol .
young people do n't actually like alcohol , but they are seduced into liking it , " völker-albert said .
the crux of the matter last month the government introduced sweeping legislation to put up the tax on these liquor-laced , sickly sweet sodas , increasing the price of a bottle by around € 0.80 -lrb- $ 0.96 -rrb- , but whether it will actually have the desired effect remains to be seen .
" the fact that the prices have gone up wo n't change anything , except that i wo n't buy it myself , i 'll let other people buy them for me , " 16-year-old marietta told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youths drinking alcopops but the alcohol issue does not stand and fall with alcoholic soda .
although he welcomes the price hike , jörg richert believes the whole issue detracts from the real and much more existential core of the problem , which he sees as inextricably linked to declining social standards in germany , " the discussion surrounding alcopops is a distraction .
politicians should be looking at the employment market .
from january onwards , there will be 500,000 more children living from welfare benefit and the consequence will be the exorbitant increase in drug use , " he said . it 's a sombre prediction , but richert claims there is an undeniable connection between poverty and drinking , smoking and drugs .

16 . eichinger and director oliver hirschbiegel drew on a best-selling hitler biography by joachim fest , an award-winning historian , and the memoirs of the late traudl junge , hitler 's last personal secretary . junge 's book , published just days before she died in late 2002 , offers hitherto unknown insights into life in the bunker in the spring of 1945 . last 12 days of hitler 's life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " downfall " the two and a half hour film describes the period from april 20 , hitler 's last birthday , until may 2 , 1945 .
the soviet red army was fighting at the city gates to gain victory over the nazi regime while the führer and his closest followers battled against fear of the third reich 's collapse in their bunker . the film shows hitler on his last birthday as a bent , ashen-faced man holding a garbled speech in the garden of the old imperial chancellory and a rare public kiss with eva braun , his girlfriend , after she insists on staying by his side until the end . though the film is based on historical fact and eyewitness accounts , some scenes and dialogues have been invented . " time is ripe for such a film " what sets the film apart from past attempts at screen portrayals of hitler 's last days is eichinger 's candid depiction of the nazi leader as not just a monster , but a tragic human being , marking a more relaxed approach to germany 's past . " the time is ripe for such a film , " eichinger said during a media screening in berlin this week .
" it 's important not just to shed light on one 's own history superficially , but rather to tell it from within , " he said . eichinger stressed that emotions should be consciously allowed when in coming to terms with hitler from a german perspective .
" if you had overall sympathy for hitler , then the film has failed in its intention .
but to show sympathy in certain moments is , i believe , quite fine , " eichinger said . a more human hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz as hitler in " downfall " veteran swiss actor bruno ganz , who plays hitler in the film , explained that the führer was a person who had earned the least sympathy .
" but i 'm not ashamed of the fact that i could feel sympathy for him during fleeting seconds , " ganz said in berlin . historian fest , who was consulted closely by eichinger during the making of the film , said , " ganz is really hitler : when you look at him you feel a chill down your spine . " in the film , ganz barks out orders far removed from reality - ordering nonexistent units into battle - during the last days in the bunker .
his shaking hand concealed behind his back , he holds hate-filled monologues about the jews , alleged betrayers and victory that is assured in any case . his angry outbursts at the inability of his army to stave off the soviet attack are interspersed with moments of friendliness towards his female staff and towards eva braun , who he marries just a day before their joint suicide . " a real face to the drama " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justus von dohnanyi as general burgdorf , left , and bruno ganz as adolf hitler in the film " downfall " there is little doubt that eichinger is treading controversial ground with his more humane treatment of hitler in a country where displaying nazi emblems is banned and germans are long used to be constantly reminded in movies and books that hitler was the 20th century 's worst war criminal . the film has already generated hot debate in the german press , with some critics fearing it could pander to neo-nazis .
" -lrb- ' downfall ' -rrb- prompts the question whether one should be allowed to feel sympathy for hitler , " the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekly wrote . others have taken a more favorable view .
der spiegel newsmagazine , which devoted its cover story to the film this week , wrote that eichinger had managed what no one had before : " to give the absurd drama in the bunker a real face .

bayer face munich in the bundesliga on saturday - and maybe in europe in the future . bayer leverkusen entertains bayern munich on saturday in the " play of the day " in the bundesliga with more than just the quest for three points and ultimately a championship title in common . on wednesday , despite losing 2-1 to banik ostrava on the night , leverkusen reached the group stage of the european champions league with a 6-2 aggregate victory and became the third german team to enter the draw on thursday along with their opponents at the weekend and current bundesliga title holders werder bremen . it has been a long road for bayer leverkusen back to the continent 's premier cup competition .
after reaching the 2002 final , where they lost 2-1 to real madrid , the team buckled under the crushing disappointment of losing narrowly out on a domestic league , cup and european treble and a little under 15 months ago were almost relegated to the second division . manager klaus augenthaler has since rebuilt the club and has now guided it back into the champions league with a new-look team stripped of stars such as michael ballack , lucio and ze roberto , all now preparing to meet their former employer on saturday as part of the bayern munich team . insummountable task for czechs in reality , it looked a dead cert that bayer would reach the champions league this year after the initial game against banik ostrava .
it would have taken a monumental effort from the czech side to overcome bayer 's 5-0 first-leg win but this did not stop them attempting it .
banik went ahead seven minutes before half-time after michal papadopulos had slipped the leverkusen defense to put his shot beyond the despairing hans-jörg butt . despite early efforts from dimitar berbatov , leverkusen looked to be coasting through the second leg in the czech republic , with the hard work already achieved in the home leg in germany .
their intent was clear from the start as leverkusen coach klaus augenthaler fielded a young side including only four of the team who so comprehensively eclipsed banik in the bayarena a week before . banik pushes young bayer side the onus was on the home side to push the visitors as they looked for an equally impressive display to overcome the lead leverkusen brought with them .
miroslav matusovic and mario licka worked well to create first half openings for banik but they could not find a way past leverkusen 's butt .
robson ponte also had a decent opportunity to put the czechs ahead but the relatively inexperienced side the germans were fielding continued to stand firm . the breakthrough came on 38 minutes when leverkusen goalkeeper butt failed to cut out a ball on the six-yard box , which was retrieved by mario licka who in turn fed papadopoulos , who found the back of the net . parity gained and lost in minutes it was n't until the 83rd minute that leverkusen achieved parity .
berbatov hauled leverkusen level after banik tried to play the bulgarian striker offside but their appeals were in vain and berbatov slotted home for the equalizer .
but the balance only remained in place for six minutes .
martin cizek 's cross for the home side found an unmarked libor zurek who notched the winner .
zurek , apparently forgetting the still huge deficit and the imminent defeat that faced his side , ripped off his shirt in celebration only to be booked by the referee for his enthusiastic display . but in the end , it was bayer leverkusen who earned the right to party .

bayer face munich in the bundesliga on saturday - and maybe in europe in the future . bayer leverkusen entertains bayern munich on saturday in the " play of the day " in the bundesliga with more than just the quest for three points and ultimately a championship title in common . on wednesday , despite losing 2-1 to banik ostrava on the night , leverkusen reached the group stage of the european champions league with a 6-2 aggregate victory and became the third german team to enter the draw on thursday along with their opponents at the weekend and current bundesliga title holders werder bremen . it has been a long road for bayer leverkusen back to the continent 's premier cup competition .
after reaching the 2002 final , where they lost 2-1 to real madrid , the team buckled under the crushing disappointment of losing narrowly out on a domestic league , cup and european treble and a little under 15 months ago were almost relegated to the second division . manager klaus augenthaler has since rebuilt the club and has now guided it back into the champions league with a new-look team stripped of stars such as michael ballack , lucio and ze roberto , all now preparing to meet their former employer on saturday as part of the bayern munich team . insummountable task for czechs in reality , it looked a dead cert that bayer would reach the champions league this year after the initial game against banik ostrava .
it would have taken a monumental effort from the czech side to overcome bayer 's 5-0 first-leg win but this did not stop them attempting it .
banik went ahead seven minutes before half-time after michal papadopulos had slipped the leverkusen defense to put his shot beyond the despairing hans-jörg butt . despite early efforts from dimitar berbatov , leverkusen looked to be coasting through the second leg in the czech republic , with the hard work already achieved in the home leg in germany .
their intent was clear from the start as leverkusen coach klaus augenthaler fielded a young side including only four of the team who so comprehensively eclipsed banik in the bayarena a week before . banik pushes young bayer side the onus was on the home side to push the visitors as they looked for an equally impressive display to overcome the lead leverkusen brought with them .
miroslav matusovic and mario licka worked well to create first half openings for banik but they could not find a way past leverkusen 's butt .
robson ponte also had a decent opportunity to put the czechs ahead but the relatively inexperienced side the germans were fielding continued to stand firm . the breakthrough came on 38 minutes when leverkusen goalkeeper butt failed to cut out a ball on the six-yard box , which was retrieved by mario licka who in turn fed papadopoulos , who found the back of the net . parity gained and lost in minutes it was n't until the 83rd minute that leverkusen achieved parity .
berbatov hauled leverkusen level after banik tried to play the bulgarian striker offside but their appeals were in vain and berbatov slotted home for the equalizer .
but the balance only remained in place for six minutes .
martin cizek 's cross for the home side found an unmarked libor zurek who notched the winner .
zurek , apparently forgetting the still huge deficit and the imminent defeat that faced his side , ripped off his shirt in celebration only to be booked by the referee for his enthusiastic display . but in the end , it was bayer leverkusen who earned the right to party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.08.2004 revival of trade ties remains tricky in cyprus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the island of cyprus is still marked by borders and separations new eu regulations introduced this week allow ethnically divided greeks and turks in cyprus to resume trade ties .
but implementation promises to be far from easy . the new regulations , adopted by the european commission in july and which came into effect on monday this week , are meant to revive trade ties between the turkish and cypriot part of the divided island .
trading between the two sides came to a standstill following the division of cyprus in 1974 and has been non-existent until now . according to the eu regulations , turkish entrepreneurs in the northern part of the island can for the first time sell their products in the greek south .
from there the goods can also be exported to other eu countries without further checks and bureaucratic hurdles . the rules dictate that the goods have to comply with eu standards on food safety and plant health .
further , the turkish cypriot chamber of commerce will have to ensure that products must actually originate from northern cyprus and not turkey . the move is part of an eu package to rebuild the north 's economy and end the isolation of turkish cypriots after they voted in favour of reunification of the island in an april referendum .
however greek cypriots rejected the peace plan , allowing only the greek part of the island to join the european union . rules not free of hurdles but despite the good intentions , implementing the trade regulation will turn out to be tougher than it appears on paper . for one , all animal and agricultural products - goods with probably the most significant export potential - are excluded from the regulation as are goods originating from turkey . this week just a day after the regulation came into effect , greek cypriots sent back a turkish truckload of fish , which fell foul of the law . adrian van der meer , the eu 's representative in cyprus said the rejection of the fish by greek cypriot veterinary authorities was a regrettable necessity . " from a legal point of view the certificate of origin issued was correct because the fish originated in the northern part of cyprus , but the second clause says that no animal produce is allowed to cross , and we take a zero tolerance on this , " he told reuters . mutual trust needed in addition , turkish cypriot businessmen need a greek cypriot partner who will buy their products and sell them .
given the island 's division and troubled past , few believe it will be an easy task . " goods , whose origin is difficult to conceal such as consumer goods , will be difficult to sell in the south , " heinz kramer , cyprus expert at the science and politics foundation told dw-world . it also seems likely that greek cypriot businessmen would watch out for their interests and be wary of opening the door to possible competitors from the other end of the island . kramer said building materials and textile products count among the few goods that have a chance of being sold in the southern market .
" it will probably hardly interest anyone where his bricks are coming from , " kramer said . symbolism rather than real benefits as far as economic benefits go , hardly anyone expects the regulation to have a major impact .
flourishing trade between the two parts of the island remains an unrealistic hope . " i believe that the move is highly politically symbolic , one that 's meant to show that the north should n't be isolated .
but , its economic significance is very minimal , " kramer said . a real breakthrough in trade relations between the two parts of the divided island might instead come from a proposal that 's currently making the rounds in the eu council of ministers .
according to it , turkish cypriot products will be directly exported to the eu without a diversion via the southern greek cypriot part of the island . but it remains unclear whether the proposal will actually see the light of day .
greece and new eu member cyprus , which represents the greek part of the island , have already indicated that they are against full free trade for the north . michael knigge -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cyprus celebrates a dubious birthday thirty years after turkey invaded it , cyprus remains a divided island .

but implementation promises to be far from easy . the new regulations , adopted by the european commission in july and which came into effect on monday this week , are meant to revive trade ties between the turkish and cypriot part of the divided island .
trading between the two sides came to a standstill following the division of cyprus in 1974 and has been non-existent until now . according to the eu regulations , turkish entrepreneurs in the northern part of the island can for the first time sell their products in the greek south .
from there the goods can also be exported to other eu countries without further checks and bureaucratic hurdles . the rules dictate that the goods have to comply with eu standards on food safety and plant health .
further , the turkish cypriot chamber of commerce will have to ensure that products must actually originate from northern cyprus and not turkey . the move is part of an eu package to rebuild the north 's economy and end the isolation of turkish cypriots after they voted in favour of reunification of the island in an april referendum .
however greek cypriots rejected the peace plan , allowing only the greek part of the island to join the european union . rules not free of hurdles but despite the good intentions , implementing the trade regulation will turn out to be tougher than it appears on paper . for one , all animal and agricultural products - goods with probably the most significant export potential - are excluded from the regulation as are goods originating from turkey . this week just a day after the regulation came into effect , greek cypriots sent back a turkish truckload of fish , which fell foul of the law . adrian van der meer , the eu 's representative in cyprus said the rejection of the fish by greek cypriot veterinary authorities was a regrettable necessity . " from a legal point of view the certificate of origin issued was correct because the fish originated in the northern part of cyprus , but the second clause says that no animal produce is allowed to cross , and we take a zero tolerance on this , " he told reuters . mutual trust needed in addition , turkish cypriot businessmen need a greek cypriot partner who will buy their products and sell them .
given the island 's division and troubled past , few believe it will be an easy task . " goods , whose origin is difficult to conceal such as consumer goods , will be difficult to sell in the south , " heinz kramer , cyprus expert at the science and politics foundation told dw-world . it also seems likely that greek cypriot businessmen would watch out for their interests and be wary of opening the door to possible competitors from the other end of the island . kramer said building materials and textile products count among the few goods that have a chance of being sold in the southern market .
" it will probably hardly interest anyone where his bricks are coming from , " kramer said . symbolism rather than real benefits as far as economic benefits go , hardly anyone expects the regulation to have a major impact .
flourishing trade between the two parts of the island remains an unrealistic hope . " i believe that the move is highly politically symbolic , one that 's meant to show that the north should n't be isolated .
but , its economic significance is very minimal , " kramer said . a real breakthrough in trade relations between the two parts of the divided island might instead come from a proposal that 's currently making the rounds in the eu council of ministers .
according to it , turkish cypriot products will be directly exported to the eu without a diversion via the southern greek cypriot part of the island . but it remains unclear whether the proposal will actually see the light of day .
greece and new eu member cyprus , which represents the greek part of the island , have already indicated that they are against full free trade for the north . michael knigge -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cyprus celebrates a dubious birthday thirty years after turkey invaded it , cyprus remains a divided island .

but implementation promises to be far from easy . the new regulations , adopted by the european commission in july and which came into effect on monday this week , are meant to revive trade ties between the turkish and cypriot part of the divided island .
trading between the two sides came to a standstill following the division of cyprus in 1974 and has been non-existent until now . according to the eu regulations , turkish entrepreneurs in the northern part of the island can for the first time sell their products in the greek south .
from there the goods can also be exported to other eu countries without further checks and bureaucratic hurdles . the rules dictate that the goods have to comply with eu standards on food safety and plant health .
further , the turkish cypriot chamber of commerce will have to ensure that products must actually originate from northern cyprus and not turkey . the move is part of an eu package to rebuild the north 's economy and end the isolation of turkish cypriots after they voted in favour of reunification of the island in an april referendum .
however greek cypriots rejected the peace plan , allowing only the greek part of the island to join the european union . rules not free of hurdles but despite the good intentions , implementing the trade regulation will turn out to be tougher than it appears on paper . for one , all animal and agricultural products - goods with probably the most significant export potential - are excluded from the regulation as are goods originating from turkey . this week just a day after the regulation came into effect , greek cypriots sent back a turkish truckload of fish , which fell foul of the law . adrian van der meer , the eu 's representative in cyprus said the rejection of the fish by greek cypriot veterinary authorities was a regrettable necessity . " from a legal point of view the certificate of origin issued was correct because the fish originated in the northern part of cyprus , but the second clause says that no animal produce is allowed to cross , and we take a zero tolerance on this , " he told reuters . mutual trust needed in addition , turkish cypriot businessmen need a greek cypriot partner who will buy their products and sell them .
given the island 's division and troubled past , few believe it will be an easy task . " goods , whose origin is difficult to conceal such as consumer goods , will be difficult to sell in the south , " heinz kramer , cyprus expert at the science and politics foundation told dw-world . it also seems likely that greek cypriot businessmen would watch out for their interests and be wary of opening the door to possible competitors from the other end of the island . kramer said building materials and textile products count among the few goods that have a chance of being sold in the southern market .
" it will probably hardly interest anyone where his bricks are coming from , " kramer said . symbolism rather than real benefits as far as economic benefits go , hardly anyone expects the regulation to have a major impact .
flourishing trade between the two parts of the island remains an unrealistic hope . " i believe that the move is highly politically symbolic , one that 's meant to show that the north should n't be isolated .
but , its economic significance is very minimal , " kramer said . a real breakthrough in trade relations between the two parts of the divided island might instead come from a proposal that 's currently making the rounds in the eu council of ministers .
according to it , turkish cypriot products will be directly exported to the eu without a diversion via the southern greek cypriot part of the island . but it remains unclear whether the proposal will actually see the light of day .
greece and new eu member cyprus , which represents the greek part of the island , have already indicated that they are against full free trade for the north . michael knigge -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cyprus celebrates a dubious birthday thirty years after turkey invaded it , cyprus remains a divided island .

deutsche welle met up with the new director . since weimar 's glory days as european city of culture in 1999 , johann wolfgang von goethe 's home town has been struggling to maintain the international flair it gained five years ago . but now there 's a new girl in town - and she means business . under nike wagner , once tipped as a possible new director of the bayreuth festival but pipped at the post by her younger cousin katharina , the 2004 weimar arts festival marks a new departure for a city that 's trying hard to shake off its conservative image .
the revamped event has been hailed as a forum for contemporary arts , including music , art , literature and dance . the weimar mythology in a city as steeped in history as weimar , the task of re-energizing the local arts festival while upholding the city 's formidable legacy is far from an easy one .
but wagner stresses that the city 's unique past is what makes her post so challenging . " weimar has always had a certain mythology for me , " she says .
" i 'm west german through and through , but when i studied german at university , weimar really captured my imagination . " vokhard knigge , director of the weimar klassik foundation which organizes the festival , described her appointment as an " extraordinary opportunity . "
when the former culture minister in the hamburg regional government agreed to take over , a funding crisis meant it was n't even certain the event had a future .
and wagner admitted she had her work cut out for her .
" my generation never gave any thought to the eastern half of germany , which is something i deeply regret , " she says .
" but i was thrilled when i was asked to take over the festival . "
last but not liszt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe und schiller in weimar : gone but not forgotten in the past , the festival has highlighted the city 's literary heritage .
not only home to goethe and schiller , weimar 's other famous sons include herder and nietzsche .
but this year , wagner - not one to shy away from controversy - has chosen to highlight the hungarian composer franz lizst , who spent several decades in the city and who also happens to be her great , great grandfather . " this city is more or less off the beaten tourist track , and i wanted to find a way of making it more attractive , " she explains .
" i felt that music did this more than literature , so i decided to organize a music festival - and who do i come across ?
franz lizst . " moreover , wagner renamed the new-look festival pèlerinage , a title inspired by liszt 's piano cycle " années de pèlerinage " .
the pilgrimage theme is central to this year 's event , which has " heimweh " -lrb- homesickness -rrb- as its motto . " to me , art is something that has nothing to do with anything stationary , " wagner says .
" art is restless , it 's always looking for new departures , new shores , new utopias . " in 2004 , the increased post-enlargement east european presence at the festival gives this theme added relevance .
" nietzsche 's philosophy , for example , described the status and sensibility of new-age man as nomadic , " points out wagner .
" that 's the trademark of the modern age - in a philosophical sense , we no longer have a home . " commemorating the past this year 's festival also features plenty of modern music , including work by béla bartok and contemporary composers such as györgy kurtág , steffen schleiermacher and heiner goebbels .
wagner is aware that her detractors might find her program a little too challenging for classicist weimar .
but she firmly believes that the festival 's juxtaposition of old and new can only be good for a city whose history is both a boon and a burden . " modernist movements tended to fail here , they were often banished , " she observes .
" take the bauhaus artists , who left to go to dessau .
modernist movements have always been given a hard time in weimar , but it has to be pointed out that no other city needs modernism more than this one . " " it has a surplus of everything else , " she adds .
" its museum collections and archives are phenomenal , and obviously , they need to be preserved very carefully .
but you have to get around traditions , you have to see them as a challenge ! " another of her innovations has been to usher in a new tradition : every year the weimar festival will open with a concert in memory of buchenwald , the nearby nazi concentration camp . " it 's a memorial concert , but it wo n't be held in buchenwald , which would exploit the horrific past of the location , " she stresses .

deutsche welle met up with the new director . since weimar 's glory days as european city of culture in 1999 , johann wolfgang von goethe 's home town has been struggling to maintain the international flair it gained five years ago . but now there 's a new girl in town - and she means business . under nike wagner , once tipped as a possible new director of the bayreuth festival but pipped at the post by her younger cousin katharina , the 2004 weimar arts festival marks a new departure for a city that 's trying hard to shake off its conservative image .
the revamped event has been hailed as a forum for contemporary arts , including music , art , literature and dance . the weimar mythology in a city as steeped in history as weimar , the task of re-energizing the local arts festival while upholding the city 's formidable legacy is far from an easy one .
but wagner stresses that the city 's unique past is what makes her post so challenging . " weimar has always had a certain mythology for me , " she says .
" i 'm west german through and through , but when i studied german at university , weimar really captured my imagination . " vokhard knigge , director of the weimar klassik foundation which organizes the festival , described her appointment as an " extraordinary opportunity . "

the pilgrimage theme is central to this year 's event , which has " heimweh " -lrb- homesickness -rrb- as its motto . " to me , art is something that has nothing to do with anything stationary , " wagner says .
" art is restless , it 's always looking for new departures , new shores , new utopias . " in 2004 , the increased post-enlargement east european presence at the festival gives this theme added relevance .

wagner is aware that her detractors might find her program a little too challenging for classicist weimar .

but apart from a successful egovernment project in bremen , germany still lags behind on an eu level . getting your own birth certificate in germany usually entails a bureaucratic nightmare lasting several weeks .
but a new high-tech project in bremen has reduced the process to literally a couple of clicks . all you have to do is order the certificate online from the registry office , you even sign the form right away on your computer .
within a couple of days , the certificate will be in the mail . kerstin sprock who works for a private company that maintains online services for the city of bremen is proud that the city leads the way when it comes to egovernment in germany . " we realized very early that it 's not just about information , but people also want to accomplish things .
and bremen stands out in the field , it has over 100 services that citizens can sign for with an electronic signature , " sprock told dw-radio . whether it 's informing authorities about a change in address , applying for a car license plate or filling out a form for dog taxes , it 's all possible via the internet in bremen , 24 hours a day and without spending time in long waiting lines at offices . electronic signature the show stealer the chief attraction is the electronic signature which works a bit like withdrawing money from a cash machine .
the user needs a chip card , an own scanner and a secret code . sprock says security is the main priority .
" according to current technology , the electronic signature ca n't be cracked , " she said .
" actually , the biggest security risk is at offices , in families and among friends .
but one needs to go to great criminal lengths to even get close technologically to such a signature . " but there remains little doubt that the electronic signature is n't foolproof .
security concerns over egovernment and other online services involving personal data have driven the european commission - which is pushing eu governments to make their bureaucracy more efficient , high-tech and user-friendly - to set up a european agency for network and information security called enisa .
its chief aim is to ensure that data protection guidelines are obeyed and that security standards of computers are constantly upgraded . bremen still has n't witnessed any misuse of its electronic signature , but then few citizens of the northern german city have been making use of the online services .
one of the chief reasons is that the card scanner and the chip card cost citizens around € 50 a year . but sprock said the project was still a success among corporate users .
" several people from business and industry have told us that they usually have an own office to deal with bureaucracy - now , naturally they can do away with it and save money . " germany lags behind the egovernment project is underway in bremen , esslingen and nuremberg .
the three cities are supported by the german government with funds and know-how with the framework of a pilot project .
but it 's clear that bremen is the trailblazer .
last year , it even won an award for its egovernment project from the european commission . but , apart from the cities involved in the online pilot project , the rest of germany 's cities and towns remain far behind on the information highway .
though citizens can download official forms on the internet almost everywhere , they still have to sign them by hand and then take the application to an office or at least to a mailbox . that makes germany a bit of a laggard on the european level when it comes to egovernment .
leading the way are the scandinavian countries where on an average , citizens can accomplish over 80 percent of official services sitting at their computers within the comfort of their homes .
as compared to that , germans can wrap up just about 50 percent of official services at home , taking it to third place in europe and only slightly better than belgium and luxembourg . despite the rising popularity and simplicity of egovernment , kerstin sprock does n't believe they 'll ever completely replace government officials . " for instance marriage : that 's the most beautiful day of your life - who would want to spend it in front of the computer ? " irene haider -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany celebrates 20 years of e-mail when a group of computer scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent germany 's first e-mail 20 years ago , they had no idea they were heralding in the digital age .

but apart from a successful egovernment project in bremen , germany still lags behind on an eu level . getting your own birth certificate in germany usually entails a bureaucratic nightmare lasting several weeks .
but a new high-tech project in bremen has reduced the process to literally a couple of clicks . all you have to do is order the certificate online from the registry office , you even sign the form right away on your computer .
within a couple of days , the certificate will be in the mail . kerstin sprock who works for a private company that maintains online services for the city of bremen is proud that the city leads the way when it comes to egovernment in germany . " we realized very early that it 's not just about information , but people also want to accomplish things .
and bremen stands out in the field , it has over 100 services that citizens can sign for with an electronic signature , " sprock told dw-radio . whether it 's informing authorities about a change in address , applying for a car license plate or filling out a form for dog taxes , it 's all possible via the internet in bremen , 24 hours a day and without spending time in long waiting lines at offices . electronic signature the show stealer the chief attraction is the electronic signature which works a bit like withdrawing money from a cash machine .
the user needs a chip card , an own scanner and a secret code . sprock says security is the main priority .
" according to current technology , the electronic signature ca n't be cracked , " she said .
" actually , the biggest security risk is at offices , in families and among friends .
but one needs to go to great criminal lengths to even get close technologically to such a signature . " but there remains little doubt that the electronic signature is n't foolproof .
security concerns over egovernment and other online services involving personal data have driven the european commission - which is pushing eu governments to make their bureaucracy more efficient , high-tech and user-friendly - to set up a european agency for network and information security called enisa .
its chief aim is to ensure that data protection guidelines are obeyed and that security standards of computers are constantly upgraded . bremen still has n't witnessed any misuse of its electronic signature , but then few citizens of the northern german city have been making use of the online services .
one of the chief reasons is that the card scanner and the chip card cost citizens around € 50 a year . but sprock said the project was still a success among corporate users .
" several people from business and industry have told us that they usually have an own office to deal with bureaucracy - now , naturally they can do away with it and save money . " germany lags behind the egovernment project is underway in bremen , esslingen and nuremberg .
the three cities are supported by the german government with funds and know-how with the framework of a pilot project .
but it 's clear that bremen is the trailblazer .
last year , it even won an award for its egovernment project from the european commission . but , apart from the cities involved in the online pilot project , the rest of germany 's cities and towns remain far behind on the information highway .
though citizens can download official forms on the internet almost everywhere , they still have to sign them by hand and then take the application to an office or at least to a mailbox . that makes germany a bit of a laggard on the european level when it comes to egovernment .
leading the way are the scandinavian countries where on an average , citizens can accomplish over 80 percent of official services sitting at their computers within the comfort of their homes .
as compared to that , germans can wrap up just about 50 percent of official services at home , taking it to third place in europe and only slightly better than belgium and luxembourg . despite the rising popularity and simplicity of egovernment , kerstin sprock does n't believe they 'll ever completely replace government officials .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.08.2004 german egovernment initiative off to a slow start großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this should be the future when it comes to dealing with bureacracy the eu would like its citizens to use personal computers to do taxes and complete bureacratic formalities .
but apart from a successful egovernment project in bremen , germany still lags behind on an eu level . getting your own birth certificate in germany usually entails a bureaucratic nightmare lasting several weeks .
but a new high-tech project in bremen has reduced the process to literally a couple of clicks . all you have to do is order the certificate online from the registry office , you even sign the form right away on your computer .
within a couple of days , the certificate will be in the mail . kerstin sprock who works for a private company that maintains online services for the city of bremen is proud that the city leads the way when it comes to egovernment in germany . " we realized very early that it 's not just about information , but people also want to accomplish things .
and bremen stands out in the field , it has over 100 services that citizens can sign for with an electronic signature , " sprock told dw-radio . whether it 's informing authorities about a change in address , applying for a car license plate or filling out a form for dog taxes , it 's all possible via the internet in bremen , 24 hours a day and without spending time in long waiting lines at offices . electronic signature the show stealer the chief attraction is the electronic signature which works a bit like withdrawing money from a cash machine .
the user needs a chip card , an own scanner and a secret code . sprock says security is the main priority .
" according to current technology , the electronic signature ca n't be cracked , " she said .
" actually , the biggest security risk is at offices , in families and among friends .
but one needs to go to great criminal lengths to even get close technologically to such a signature . " but there remains little doubt that the electronic signature is n't foolproof .
security concerns over egovernment and other online services involving personal data have driven the european commission - which is pushing eu governments to make their bureaucracy more efficient , high-tech and user-friendly - to set up a european agency for network and information security called enisa .
its chief aim is to ensure that data protection guidelines are obeyed and that security standards of computers are constantly upgraded . bremen still has n't witnessed any misuse of its electronic signature , but then few citizens of the northern german city have been making use of the online services .
one of the chief reasons is that the card scanner and the chip card cost citizens around € 50 a year . but sprock said the project was still a success among corporate users .
" several people from business and industry have told us that they usually have an own office to deal with bureaucracy - now , naturally they can do away with it and save money . " germany lags behind the egovernment project is underway in bremen , esslingen and nuremberg .
the three cities are supported by the german government with funds and know-how with the framework of a pilot project .
but it 's clear that bremen is the trailblazer .
last year , it even won an award for its egovernment project from the european commission . but , apart from the cities involved in the online pilot project , the rest of germany 's cities and towns remain far behind on the information highway .
though citizens can download official forms on the internet almost everywhere , they still have to sign them by hand and then take the application to an office or at least to a mailbox . that makes germany a bit of a laggard on the european level when it comes to egovernment .
leading the way are the scandinavian countries where on an average , citizens can accomplish over 80 percent of official services sitting at their computers within the comfort of their homes .
as compared to that , germans can wrap up just about 50 percent of official services at home , taking it to third place in europe and only slightly better than belgium and luxembourg . despite the rising popularity and simplicity of egovernment , kerstin sprock does n't believe they 'll ever completely replace government officials . " for instance marriage : that 's the most beautiful day of your life - who would want to spend it in front of the computer ? " irene haider -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany celebrates 20 years of e-mail when a group of computer scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent germany 's first e-mail 20 years ago , they had no idea they were heralding in the digital age .

but apart from a successful egovernment project in bremen , germany still lags behind on an eu level . getting your own birth certificate in germany usually entails a bureaucratic nightmare lasting several weeks .
but a new high-tech project in bremen has reduced the process to literally a couple of clicks . all you have to do is order the certificate online from the registry office , you even sign the form right away on your computer .
within a couple of days , the certificate will be in the mail . kerstin sprock who works for a private company that maintains online services for the city of bremen is proud that the city leads the way when it comes to egovernment in germany . " we realized very early that it 's not just about information , but people also want to accomplish things .
and bremen stands out in the field , it has over 100 services that citizens can sign for with an electronic signature , " sprock told dw-radio . whether it 's informing authorities about a change in address , applying for a car license plate or filling out a form for dog taxes , it 's all possible via the internet in bremen , 24 hours a day and without spending time in long waiting lines at offices . electronic signature the show stealer the chief attraction is the electronic signature which works a bit like withdrawing money from a cash machine .
the user needs a chip card , an own scanner and a secret code . sprock says security is the main priority .
" according to current technology , the electronic signature ca n't be cracked , " she said .
" actually , the biggest security risk is at offices , in families and among friends .
but one needs to go to great criminal lengths to even get close technologically to such a signature . " but there remains little doubt that the electronic signature is n't foolproof .
security concerns over egovernment and other online services involving personal data have driven the european commission - which is pushing eu governments to make their bureaucracy more efficient , high-tech and user-friendly - to set up a european agency for network and information security called enisa .
its chief aim is to ensure that data protection guidelines are obeyed and that security standards of computers are constantly upgraded . bremen still has n't witnessed any misuse of its electronic signature , but then few citizens of the northern german city have been making use of the online services .
one of the chief reasons is that the card scanner and the chip card cost citizens around € 50 a year . but sprock said the project was still a success among corporate users .
" several people from business and industry have told us that they usually have an own office to deal with bureaucracy - now , naturally they can do away with it and save money . " germany lags behind the egovernment project is underway in bremen , esslingen and nuremberg .
the three cities are supported by the german government with funds and know-how with the framework of a pilot project .
but it 's clear that bremen is the trailblazer .
last year , it even won an award for its egovernment project from the european commission . but , apart from the cities involved in the online pilot project , the rest of germany 's cities and towns remain far behind on the information highway .
though citizens can download official forms on the internet almost everywhere , they still have to sign them by hand and then take the application to an office or at least to a mailbox . that makes germany a bit of a laggard on the european level when it comes to egovernment .
leading the way are the scandinavian countries where on an average , citizens can accomplish over 80 percent of official services sitting at their computers within the comfort of their homes .
as compared to that , germans can wrap up just about 50 percent of official services at home , taking it to third place in europe and only slightly better than belgium and luxembourg . despite the rising popularity and simplicity of egovernment , kerstin sprock does n't believe they 'll ever completely replace government officials .

" we realized very early that it 's not just about information , but people also want to accomplish things .
and bremen stands out in the field , it has over 100 services that citizens can sign for with an electronic signature , " sprock told dw-radio . whether it 's informing authorities about a change in address , applying for a car license plate or filling out a form for dog taxes , it 's all possible via the internet in bremen , 24 hours a day and without spending time in long waiting lines at offices . electronic signature the show stealer the chief attraction is the electronic signature which works a bit like withdrawing money from a cash machine .
the user needs a chip card , an own scanner and a secret code . sprock says security is the main priority .
" according to current technology , the electronic signature ca n't be cracked , " she said .
" actually , the biggest security risk is at offices , in families and among friends .
but one needs to go to great criminal lengths to even get close technologically to such a signature . " but there remains little doubt that the electronic signature is n't foolproof .
security concerns over egovernment and other online services involving personal data have driven the european commission - which is pushing eu governments to make their bureaucracy more efficient , high-tech and user-friendly - to set up a european agency for network and information security called enisa .
its chief aim is to ensure that data protection guidelines are obeyed and that security standards of computers are constantly upgraded . bremen still has n't witnessed any misuse of its electronic signature , but then few citizens of the northern german city have been making use of the online services .
one of the chief reasons is that the card scanner and the chip card cost citizens around € 50 a year . but sprock said the project was still a success among corporate users .
" several people from business and industry have told us that they usually have an own office to deal with bureaucracy - now , naturally they can do away with it and save money . " germany lags behind the egovernment project is underway in bremen , esslingen and nuremberg .
the three cities are supported by the german government with funds and know-how with the framework of a pilot project .
but it 's clear that bremen is the trailblazer .
last year , it even won an award for its egovernment project from the european commission . but , apart from the cities involved in the online pilot project , the rest of germany 's cities and towns remain far behind on the information highway .
though citizens can download official forms on the internet almost everywhere , they still have to sign them by hand and then take the application to an office or at least to a mailbox . that makes germany a bit of a laggard on the european level when it comes to egovernment .
leading the way are the scandinavian countries where on an average , citizens can accomplish over 80 percent of official services sitting at their computers within the comfort of their homes .
as compared to that , germans can wrap up just about 50 percent of official services at home , taking it to third place in europe and only slightly better than belgium and luxembourg . despite the rising popularity and simplicity of egovernment , kerstin sprock does n't believe they 'll ever completely replace government officials .

but implementation promises to be far from easy . the new regulations , adopted by the european commission in july and which came into effect on monday this week , are meant to revive trade ties between the turkish and cypriot part of the divided island .
trading between the two sides came to a standstill following the division of cyprus in 1974 and has been non-existent until now . according to the eu regulations , turkish entrepreneurs in the northern part of the island can for the first time sell their products in the greek south .
from there the goods can also be exported to other eu countries without further checks and bureaucratic hurdles . the rules dictate that the goods have to comply with eu standards on food safety and plant health .
further , the turkish cypriot chamber of commerce will have to ensure that products must actually originate from northern cyprus and not turkey . the move is part of an eu package to rebuild the north 's economy and end the isolation of turkish cypriots after they voted in favour of reunification of the island in an april referendum .
however greek cypriots rejected the peace plan , allowing only the greek part of the island to join the european union . rules not free of hurdles but despite the good intentions , implementing the trade regulation will turn out to be tougher than it appears on paper . for one , all animal and agricultural products - goods with probably the most significant export potential - are excluded from the regulation as are goods originating from turkey . this week just a day after the regulation came into effect , greek cypriots sent back a turkish truckload of fish , which fell foul of the law . adrian van der meer , the eu 's representative in cyprus said the rejection of the fish by greek cypriot veterinary authorities was a regrettable necessity . " from a legal point of view the certificate of origin issued was correct because the fish originated in the northern part of cyprus , but the second clause says that no animal produce is allowed to cross , and we take a zero tolerance on this , " he told reuters . mutual trust needed in addition , turkish cypriot businessmen need a greek cypriot partner who will buy their products and sell them .
given the island 's division and troubled past , few believe it will be an easy task . " goods , whose origin is difficult to conceal such as consumer goods , will be difficult to sell in the south , " heinz kramer , cyprus expert at the science and politics foundation told dw-world . it also seems likely that greek cypriot businessmen would watch out for their interests and be wary of opening the door to possible competitors from the other end of the island . kramer said building materials and textile products count among the few goods that have a chance of being sold in the southern market .
" it will probably hardly interest anyone where his bricks are coming from , " kramer said . symbolism rather than real benefits as far as economic benefits go , hardly anyone expects the regulation to have a major impact .
flourishing trade between the two parts of the island remains an unrealistic hope . " i believe that the move is highly politically symbolic , one that 's meant to show that the north should n't be isolated .
but , its economic significance is very minimal , " kramer said . a real breakthrough in trade relations between the two parts of the divided island might instead come from a proposal that 's currently making the rounds in the eu council of ministers .
according to it , turkish cypriot products will be directly exported to the eu without a diversion via the southern greek cypriot part of the island . but it remains unclear whether the proposal will actually see the light of day .

deutsche welle met up with the new director . since weimar 's glory days as european city of culture in 1999 , johann wolfgang von goethe 's home town has been struggling to maintain the international flair it gained five years ago . but now there 's a new girl in town - and she means business . under nike wagner , once tipped as a possible new director of the bayreuth festival but pipped at the post by her younger cousin katharina , the 2004 weimar arts festival marks a new departure for a city that 's trying hard to shake off its conservative image .
the revamped event has been hailed as a forum for contemporary arts , including music , art , literature and dance . the weimar mythology in a city as steeped in history as weimar , the task of re-energizing the local arts festival while upholding the city 's formidable legacy is far from an easy one .
but wagner stresses that the city 's unique past is what makes her post so challenging . " weimar has always had a certain mythology for me , " she says .
" i 'm west german through and through , but when i studied german at university , weimar really captured my imagination . " vokhard knigge , director of the weimar klassik foundation which organizes the festival , described her appointment as an " extraordinary opportunity . "
when the former culture minister in the hamburg regional government agreed to take over , a funding crisis meant it was n't even certain the event had a future .
and wagner admitted she had her work cut out for her .
" my generation never gave any thought to the eastern half of germany , which is something i deeply regret , " she says .

not only home to goethe and schiller , weimar 's other famous sons include herder and nietzsche .
but this year , wagner - not one to shy away from controversy - has chosen to highlight the hungarian composer franz lizst , who spent several decades in the city and who also happens to be her great , great grandfather . " this city is more or less off the beaten tourist track , and i wanted to find a way of making it more attractive , " she explains .
" i felt that music did this more than literature , so i decided to organize a music festival - and who do i come across ?
franz lizst . " moreover , wagner renamed the new-look festival pèlerinage , a title inspired by liszt 's piano cycle " années de pèlerinage " .
the pilgrimage theme is central to this year 's event , which has " heimweh " -lrb- homesickness -rrb- as its motto . " to me , art is something that has nothing to do with anything stationary , " wagner says .
" art is restless , it 's always looking for new departures , new shores , new utopias . " in 2004 , the increased post-enlargement east european presence at the festival gives this theme added relevance .
" nietzsche 's philosophy , for example , described the status and sensibility of new-age man as nomadic , " points out wagner .
" that 's the trademark of the modern age - in a philosophical sense , we no longer have a home . " commemorating the past this year 's festival also features plenty of modern music , including work by béla bartok and contemporary composers such as györgy kurtág , steffen schleiermacher and heiner goebbels .
wagner is aware that her detractors might find her program a little too challenging for classicist weimar .
but she firmly believes that the festival 's juxtaposition of old and new can only be good for a city whose history is both a boon and a burden . " modernist movements tended to fail here , they were often banished , " she observes .
" take the bauhaus artists , who left to go to dessau .

deutsche welle met up with the new director . since weimar 's glory days as european city of culture in 1999 , johann wolfgang von goethe 's home town has been struggling to maintain the international flair it gained five years ago . but now there 's a new girl in town - and she means business . under nike wagner , once tipped as a possible new director of the bayreuth festival but pipped at the post by her younger cousin katharina , the 2004 weimar arts festival marks a new departure for a city that 's trying hard to shake off its conservative image .
the revamped event has been hailed as a forum for contemporary arts , including music , art , literature and dance . the weimar mythology in a city as steeped in history as weimar , the task of re-energizing the local arts festival while upholding the city 's formidable legacy is far from an easy one .
but wagner stresses that the city 's unique past is what makes her post so challenging . " weimar has always had a certain mythology for me , " she says .
" i 'm west german through and through , but when i studied german at university , weimar really captured my imagination . " vokhard knigge , director of the weimar klassik foundation which organizes the festival , described her appointment as an " extraordinary opportunity . "
when the former culture minister in the hamburg regional government agreed to take over , a funding crisis meant it was n't even certain the event had a future .
and wagner admitted she had her work cut out for her .
" my generation never gave any thought to the eastern half of germany , which is something i deeply regret , " she says .
" but i was thrilled when i was asked to take over the festival . "
last but not liszt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe und schiller in weimar : gone but not forgotten in the past , the festival has highlighted the city 's literary heritage .
not only home to goethe and schiller , weimar 's other famous sons include herder and nietzsche .
but this year , wagner - not one to shy away from controversy - has chosen to highlight the hungarian composer franz lizst , who spent several decades in the city and who also happens to be her great , great grandfather . " this city is more or less off the beaten tourist track , and i wanted to find a way of making it more attractive , " she explains .
" i felt that music did this more than literature , so i decided to organize a music festival - and who do i come across ?
franz lizst . " moreover , wagner renamed the new-look festival pèlerinage , a title inspired by liszt 's piano cycle " années de pèlerinage " .
the pilgrimage theme is central to this year 's event , which has " heimweh " -lrb- homesickness -rrb- as its motto . " to me , art is something that has nothing to do with anything stationary , " wagner says .
" art is restless , it 's always looking for new departures , new shores , new utopias . " in 2004 , the increased post-enlargement east european presence at the festival gives this theme added relevance .
" nietzsche 's philosophy , for example , described the status and sensibility of new-age man as nomadic , " points out wagner .
" that 's the trademark of the modern age - in a philosophical sense , we no longer have a home . " commemorating the past this year 's festival also features plenty of modern music , including work by béla bartok and contemporary composers such as györgy kurtág , steffen schleiermacher and heiner goebbels .
wagner is aware that her detractors might find her program a little too challenging for classicist weimar .
but she firmly believes that the festival 's juxtaposition of old and new can only be good for a city whose history is both a boon and a burden . " modernist movements tended to fail here , they were often banished , " she observes .
" take the bauhaus artists , who left to go to dessau .
modernist movements have always been given a hard time in weimar , but it has to be pointed out that no other city needs modernism more than this one . " " it has a surplus of everything else , " she adds .

but apart from a successful egovernment project in bremen , germany still lags behind on an eu level . getting your own birth certificate in germany usually entails a bureaucratic nightmare lasting several weeks .
but a new high-tech project in bremen has reduced the process to literally a couple of clicks . all you have to do is order the certificate online from the registry office , you even sign the form right away on your computer .
within a couple of days , the certificate will be in the mail . kerstin sprock who works for a private company that maintains online services for the city of bremen is proud that the city leads the way when it comes to egovernment in germany . " we realized very early that it 's not just about information , but people also want to accomplish things .
and bremen stands out in the field , it has over 100 services that citizens can sign for with an electronic signature , " sprock told dw-radio . whether it 's informing authorities about a change in address , applying for a car license plate or filling out a form for dog taxes , it 's all possible via the internet in bremen , 24 hours a day and without spending time in long waiting lines at offices . electronic signature the show stealer the chief attraction is the electronic signature which works a bit like withdrawing money from a cash machine .
the user needs a chip card , an own scanner and a secret code . sprock says security is the main priority .
" according to current technology , the electronic signature ca n't be cracked , " she said .
" actually , the biggest security risk is at offices , in families and among friends .
but one needs to go to great criminal lengths to even get close technologically to such a signature . " but there remains little doubt that the electronic signature is n't foolproof .
security concerns over egovernment and other online services involving personal data have driven the european commission - which is pushing eu governments to make their bureaucracy more efficient , high-tech and user-friendly - to set up a european agency for network and information security called enisa .
its chief aim is to ensure that data protection guidelines are obeyed and that security standards of computers are constantly upgraded . bremen still has n't witnessed any misuse of its electronic signature , but then few citizens of the northern german city have been making use of the online services .
one of the chief reasons is that the card scanner and the chip card cost citizens around € 50 a year . but sprock said the project was still a success among corporate users .
" several people from business and industry have told us that they usually have an own office to deal with bureaucracy - now , naturally they can do away with it and save money . " germany lags behind the egovernment project is underway in bremen , esslingen and nuremberg .
the three cities are supported by the german government with funds and know-how with the framework of a pilot project .
but it 's clear that bremen is the trailblazer .
last year , it even won an award for its egovernment project from the european commission . but , apart from the cities involved in the online pilot project , the rest of germany 's cities and towns remain far behind on the information highway .
though citizens can download official forms on the internet almost everywhere , they still have to sign them by hand and then take the application to an office or at least to a mailbox . that makes germany a bit of a laggard on the european level when it comes to egovernment .
leading the way are the scandinavian countries where on an average , citizens can accomplish over 80 percent of official services sitting at their computers within the comfort of their homes .
as compared to that , germans can wrap up just about 50 percent of official services at home , taking it to third place in europe and only slightly better than belgium and luxembourg . despite the rising popularity and simplicity of egovernment , kerstin sprock does n't believe they 'll ever completely replace government officials . " for instance marriage : that 's the most beautiful day of your life - who would want to spend it in front of the computer ?

but apart from a successful egovernment project in bremen , germany still lags behind on an eu level . getting your own birth certificate in germany usually entails a bureaucratic nightmare lasting several weeks .
but a new high-tech project in bremen has reduced the process to literally a couple of clicks . all you have to do is order the certificate online from the registry office , you even sign the form right away on your computer .
within a couple of days , the certificate will be in the mail . kerstin sprock who works for a private company that maintains online services for the city of bremen is proud that the city leads the way when it comes to egovernment in germany . " we realized very early that it 's not just about information , but people also want to accomplish things .
and bremen stands out in the field , it has over 100 services that citizens can sign for with an electronic signature , " sprock told dw-radio . whether it 's informing authorities about a change in address , applying for a car license plate or filling out a form for dog taxes , it 's all possible via the internet in bremen , 24 hours a day and without spending time in long waiting lines at offices . electronic signature the show stealer the chief attraction is the electronic signature which works a bit like withdrawing money from a cash machine .
the user needs a chip card , an own scanner and a secret code . sprock says security is the main priority .
" according to current technology , the electronic signature ca n't be cracked , " she said .
" actually , the biggest security risk is at offices , in families and among friends .
but one needs to go to great criminal lengths to even get close technologically to such a signature . " but there remains little doubt that the electronic signature is n't foolproof .
security concerns over egovernment and other online services involving personal data have driven the european commission - which is pushing eu governments to make their bureaucracy more efficient , high-tech and user-friendly - to set up a european agency for network and information security called enisa .
its chief aim is to ensure that data protection guidelines are obeyed and that security standards of computers are constantly upgraded . bremen still has n't witnessed any misuse of its electronic signature , but then few citizens of the northern german city have been making use of the online services .
one of the chief reasons is that the card scanner and the chip card cost citizens around € 50 a year . but sprock said the project was still a success among corporate users .
" several people from business and industry have told us that they usually have an own office to deal with bureaucracy - now , naturally they can do away with it and save money . " germany lags behind the egovernment project is underway in bremen , esslingen and nuremberg .
the three cities are supported by the german government with funds and know-how with the framework of a pilot project .
but it 's clear that bremen is the trailblazer .
last year , it even won an award for its egovernment project from the european commission . but , apart from the cities involved in the online pilot project , the rest of germany 's cities and towns remain far behind on the information highway .
though citizens can download official forms on the internet almost everywhere , they still have to sign them by hand and then take the application to an office or at least to a mailbox . that makes germany a bit of a laggard on the european level when it comes to egovernment .
leading the way are the scandinavian countries where on an average , citizens can accomplish over 80 percent of official services sitting at their computers within the comfort of their homes .
as compared to that , germans can wrap up just about 50 percent of official services at home , taking it to third place in europe and only slightly better than belgium and luxembourg . despite the rising popularity and simplicity of egovernment , kerstin sprock does n't believe they 'll ever completely replace government officials .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.08.2004 italy and libya tackle illegal immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colonel gadhafi continues to fight his long-standing pariah status italian prime minister silvio berlusconi met libyan leader moammar gadhafi on wednesday for talks on stemming the tide of illegal immigrants using the north african country as a transit point . one day earlier , some 275 people trying to enter italy illegally landed on lampedusa , a small island off sicily .
authorities said they believe the ship set sail from a libyan port .
it 's an all-too-familiar scenario .
italian officials estimate some two million people are currently waiting to cross the mediterranean from libya , which attracts a steady flow of illegal immigrants from africa and asia .
to many , italy represents a passageway to the rest of europe .
co-operation needed during his talks with colonel gadhafi , berlusconi stressed the problem was neither libyan nor italian only , but needed the co-operation of both europe and africa . in early august , italy agreed to train libyan police with a long-term view to launching joint air , sea and land patrols .
italy also recently called on the eu to help in the effort to battle illegal immigration by relaxing the embargo against libya so that it could buy military equipment to help clamp down on the problem of human smuggling by increasing patrols along its borders . gadhafi 's rehabilitation gadhafi , a pariah for much of his 34-year rule because of his links to international terrorism , has won back much credibility after announcing in 2003 that he would abandon the pursuit of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons . berlusconi was the first western leader to meet gadhafi after the announcement .
since then , the leader has undergone a surprise rehabilitation among countries that cold-shouldered his government for years , welcoming british prime minister tony blair in march this year and embarking on an historic visit to brussels several weeks later .
the same month , the us lifted sanctions , making the opec member once again a lucrative destination for western energy companies . a close relationship as libya 's main trading partner , italy has played a key role in re-integrating the north african state into the international community . italy occupied the oil-rich country from 1911 to 1943 and suffered a bloody uprising in 1915 in the port city of sirte , gadhafi 's home-town , 500 km east of the capital tripoli .
wednesday 's talks also included discussion of libya 's long-standing request for italian reparations for decades of occupation . the trip was not without controversy .
the italian prime minister ignored militant threats to unleash a " jihad " on the north african state if his trip went ahead .
other islamist groups also recently threatened to attack italy in retaliation for its presence in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libyan leader pitches tent in brussels meeting with eu leaders tuesday , moammar gadhafi makes his first visit to europe in 15 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.08.2004 italy and libya tackle illegal immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colonel gadhafi continues to fight his long-standing pariah status italian prime minister silvio berlusconi met libyan leader moammar gadhafi on wednesday for talks on stemming the tide of illegal immigrants using the north african country as a transit point . one day earlier , some 275 people trying to enter italy illegally landed on lampedusa , a small island off sicily .
authorities said they believe the ship set sail from a libyan port .
it 's an all-too-familiar scenario .
italian officials estimate some two million people are currently waiting to cross the mediterranean from libya , which attracts a steady flow of illegal immigrants from africa and asia .
to many , italy represents a passageway to the rest of europe .

authorities said they believe the ship set sail from a libyan port .
it 's an all-too-familiar scenario .
italian officials estimate some two million people are currently waiting to cross the mediterranean from libya , which attracts a steady flow of illegal immigrants from africa and asia .
to many , italy represents a passageway to the rest of europe .
co-operation needed during his talks with colonel gadhafi , berlusconi stressed the problem was neither libyan nor italian only , but needed the co-operation of both europe and africa . in early august , italy agreed to train libyan police with a long-term view to launching joint air , sea and land patrols .
italy also recently called on the eu to help in the effort to battle illegal immigration by relaxing the embargo against libya so that it could buy military equipment to help clamp down on the problem of human smuggling by increasing patrols along its borders . gadhafi 's rehabilitation gadhafi , a pariah for much of his 34-year rule because of his links to international terrorism , has won back much credibility after announcing in 2003 that he would abandon the pursuit of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons . berlusconi was the first western leader to meet gadhafi after the announcement .
since then , the leader has undergone a surprise rehabilitation among countries that cold-shouldered his government for years , welcoming british prime minister tony blair in march this year and embarking on an historic visit to brussels several weeks later .
the same month , the us lifted sanctions , making the opec member once again a lucrative destination for western energy companies . a close relationship as libya 's main trading partner , italy has played a key role in re-integrating the north african state into the international community . italy occupied the oil-rich country from 1911 to 1943 and suffered a bloody uprising in 1915 in the port city of sirte , gadhafi 's home-town , 500 km east of the capital tripoli .
wednesday 's talks also included discussion of libya 's long-standing request for italian reparations for decades of occupation . the trip was not without controversy .
the italian prime minister ignored militant threats to unleash a " jihad " on the north african state if his trip went ahead .

a new german film captures the madness of his last days and resurrects the führer as never before . he may be the subject of countless books and works around the world , but there is little doubt that no other phase of hitler 's life arouses as much morbid fascination as the final one . housed within the thick walls of his underground bunker in berlin 's wilhelm strasse for the last two months of his life , the nazi leader lived what appears to be an unreal life marked by parties , protocol and grandiose war plans even as the city 's civilian population battled for their lives above the ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juliane köhler -lrb- left -rrb- who plays eva braun , hitler 's lover , bruno ganz as adolf hitler -lrb- center -rrb- and heino ferch as architect albert speer in a scene from " downfall " the bizarre period is now the theme of a startlingly convincing new film by german star producer bernd eichinger .

16 . eichinger and director oliver hirschbiegel drew on a best-selling hitler biography by joachim fest , an award-winning historian , and the memoirs of the late traudl junge , hitler 's last personal secretary . junge 's book , published just days before she died in late 2002 , offers hitherto unknown insights into life in the bunker in the spring of 1945 . last 12 days of hitler 's life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " downfall " the two and a half hour film describes the period from april 20 , hitler 's last birthday , until may 2 , 1945 .
the soviet red army was fighting at the city gates to gain victory over the nazi regime while the führer and his closest followers battled against fear of the third reich 's collapse in their bunker . the film shows hitler on his last birthday as a bent , ashen-faced man holding a garbled speech in the garden of the old imperial chancellory and a rare public kiss with eva braun , his girlfriend , after she insists on staying by his side until the end . though the film is based on historical fact and eyewitness accounts , some scenes and dialogues have been invented . " time is ripe for such a film " what sets the film apart from past attempts at screen portrayals of hitler 's last days is eichinger 's candid depiction of the nazi leader as not just a monster , but a tragic human being , marking a more relaxed approach to germany 's past . " the time is ripe for such a film , " eichinger said during a media screening in berlin this week .
" it 's important not just to shed light on one 's own history superficially , but rather to tell it from within , " he said . eichinger stressed that emotions should be consciously allowed when in coming to terms with hitler from a german perspective .

" in the film , ganz barks out orders far removed from reality - ordering nonexistent units into battle - during the last days in the bunker .
his shaking hand concealed behind his back , he holds hate-filled monologues about the jews , alleged betrayers and victory that is assured in any case . his angry outbursts at the inability of his army to stave off the soviet attack are interspersed with moments of friendliness towards his female staff and towards eva braun , who he marries just a day before their joint suicide . " a real face to the drama " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justus von dohnanyi as general burgdorf , left , and bruno ganz as adolf hitler in the film " downfall " there is little doubt that eichinger is treading controversial ground with his more humane treatment of hitler in a country where displaying nazi emblems is banned and germans are long used to be constantly reminded in movies and books that hitler was the 20th century 's worst war criminal . the film has already generated hot debate in the german press , with some critics fearing it could pander to neo-nazis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.08.2004 young germans and their vices großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young smokers are a common sight in germany the traditional german pastimes of boozing and smoking are no longer just the preserve of the working man .
instead they have become the pleasure of an alarming percentage of the nation 's youth . when it comes to alcohol and tobacco consumption , germany is ailing .
with 16.7 million smokers and 1.6 million alcoholics , smoking and drinking have become so embedded in the fabric of society that it is hard to conceive of how younger generations can avoid falling prey to their addictive clutch .
truth is , tens of thousands can not . the staggering climb in both alcohol and tobacco use amongst youth groups was overlooked for too long , and although there are now some measures in place to both correct the damage already done and to prevent its continuation , there is a long way to go in protecting children from these essentially adult vices .
over the past ten years , tobacco consumption among 12-15 year-olds has almost doubled , with some 21 percent of girls and 18 percent of boys in the age group smoking regularly .
for 16-19 year-olds , the figure is 45 percent .
they 're alarming statistics , not least because smoking in germany is not actually legal until the age of 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alcopops but the country is a smokers ' paradise , with cheap cigarettes which kids can buy from machines on street corners and very few restrictions as to where it is or is not acceptable to light up .
in fact , the state of berlin broke new ground this year in implementing a ban on smoking in its schools .
it 's a move which other states are likely to follow , but for the time being children over the age of 16 can smoke in designated areas on school premises provided they present a letter of consent from their parents .
complex issues the biggest question is , if smoking is no more socially acceptable now than it was ten years ago - which it is not - why the massive rise ?
marita völker-albert , press officer for the federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- said the reasons are manifold .
" it 's different for boys and girls .
boys see it as a way of being cool , it makes them feel older and more masculine , whereas girls tend to succumb to peer-pressure and use smoking as a way of staying thin , " völker-albert told dw-world . jörg richert , managing director of karuna , an organization which helps children and young people with potential or existing addiction problems , believes there are more critical factors at play .
" social pressures created by the continual drop in living standards in germany lead to children and young adults not receiving the attention they need . when kids feel their parents are neglecting them , they try to get their attention by taking up smoking or drinking , " richert told dw-world . but he also cites another important issue as the desire of children to grow up against the backdrop of adults trying to stay young . " it is much more difficult for kids to become adults because we wear the same clothes as them , we listen to the same music , go to the same concerts - in short , we steal their identity , " richert said . so much for the reasons behind the trend , but what of the solutions ?
völker-albert believes it is crucial to get the young smokers and drinkers to discuss the potential dangers of what they are doing to their bodies .
" until they start talking to each other , there can be no critical reflection , " she said .
amongst others , the bzga already runs a campaign of sending young people to educate their contemporaries on germany 's beaches . nipping danger in the bud richert welcomes such measures .
as far as he is concerned , the only real way to the heart of the matter is to intervene in a preventative role at a very early stage , not least because of the snowball effect of early tobacco addiction .
" we now know that people who start smoking at an early age are much more likely to move on to alcohol or other addictive substances , " richert said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youngsters to talk to their contempoaries on german beaches and therein lies another problem .
although the consumption of wine and beer among youth groups has tailed off over the past years , the emergence of alcopops has had a truly explosive impact on child and youth drinking habits .
statistics from the bzga show that in 2003 almost 50 percent of young people between the ages of 14-17 were drinking alcopops at least once a month - six times more than in 1998 .
" alcopops even appeal to very young teenagers .
girls used to go out and drink coke , now they drink alcopops instead , but they do n't notice the alcohol .
young people do n't actually like alcohol , but they are seduced into liking it , " völker-albert said .
the crux of the matter last month the government introduced sweeping legislation to put up the tax on these liquor-laced , sickly sweet sodas , increasing the price of a bottle by around € 0.80 -lrb- $ 0.96 -rrb- , but whether it will actually have the desired effect remains to be seen .
" the fact that the prices have gone up wo n't change anything , except that i wo n't buy it myself , i 'll let other people buy them for me , " 16-year-old marietta told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youths drinking alcopops but the alcohol issue does not stand and fall with alcoholic soda .
although he welcomes the price hike , jörg richert believes the whole issue detracts from the real and much more existential core of the problem , which he sees as inextricably linked to declining social standards in germany , " the discussion surrounding alcopops is a distraction .
politicians should be looking at the employment market .
from january onwards , there will be 500,000 more children living from welfare benefit and the consequence will be the exorbitant increase in drug use , " he said . it 's a sombre prediction , but richert claims there is an undeniable connection between poverty and drinking , smoking and drugs .
and if he is right , the federal centre for health education is going to have its work cut out in making young people communicate in much louder and clearer voices . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe takes on alcopops in an attempt to tackle teenage alcohol consumption , european politicians are targeting alcopops , the trendy fruit-flavored alcoholic beverages preferred by young drinkers .

instead they have become the pleasure of an alarming percentage of the nation 's youth . when it comes to alcohol and tobacco consumption , germany is ailing .
with 16.7 million smokers and 1.6 million alcoholics , smoking and drinking have become so embedded in the fabric of society that it is hard to conceive of how younger generations can avoid falling prey to their addictive clutch .
truth is , tens of thousands can not . the staggering climb in both alcohol and tobacco use amongst youth groups was overlooked for too long , and although there are now some measures in place to both correct the damage already done and to prevent its continuation , there is a long way to go in protecting children from these essentially adult vices .
over the past ten years , tobacco consumption among 12-15 year-olds has almost doubled , with some 21 percent of girls and 18 percent of boys in the age group smoking regularly .
for 16-19 year-olds , the figure is 45 percent .
they 're alarming statistics , not least because smoking in germany is not actually legal until the age of 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alcopops but the country is a smokers ' paradise , with cheap cigarettes which kids can buy from machines on street corners and very few restrictions as to where it is or is not acceptable to light up .
in fact , the state of berlin broke new ground this year in implementing a ban on smoking in its schools .
it 's a move which other states are likely to follow , but for the time being children over the age of 16 can smoke in designated areas on school premises provided they present a letter of consent from their parents .
complex issues the biggest question is , if smoking is no more socially acceptable now than it was ten years ago - which it is not - why the massive rise ?
marita völker-albert , press officer for the federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- said the reasons are manifold .
" it 's different for boys and girls .
boys see it as a way of being cool , it makes them feel older and more masculine , whereas girls tend to succumb to peer-pressure and use smoking as a way of staying thin , " völker-albert told dw-world . jörg richert , managing director of karuna , an organization which helps children and young people with potential or existing addiction problems , believes there are more critical factors at play .
" social pressures created by the continual drop in living standards in germany lead to children and young adults not receiving the attention they need . when kids feel their parents are neglecting them , they try to get their attention by taking up smoking or drinking , " richert told dw-world . but he also cites another important issue as the desire of children to grow up against the backdrop of adults trying to stay young . " it is much more difficult for kids to become adults because we wear the same clothes as them , we listen to the same music , go to the same concerts - in short , we steal their identity , " richert said . so much for the reasons behind the trend , but what of the solutions ?
völker-albert believes it is crucial to get the young smokers and drinkers to discuss the potential dangers of what they are doing to their bodies .
" until they start talking to each other , there can be no critical reflection , " she said .
amongst others , the bzga already runs a campaign of sending young people to educate their contemporaries on germany 's beaches . nipping danger in the bud richert welcomes such measures .
as far as he is concerned , the only real way to the heart of the matter is to intervene in a preventative role at a very early stage , not least because of the snowball effect of early tobacco addiction .
" we now know that people who start smoking at an early age are much more likely to move on to alcohol or other addictive substances , " richert said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youngsters to talk to their contempoaries on german beaches and therein lies another problem .
although the consumption of wine and beer among youth groups has tailed off over the past years , the emergence of alcopops has had a truly explosive impact on child and youth drinking habits .
statistics from the bzga show that in 2003 almost 50 percent of young people between the ages of 14-17 were drinking alcopops at least once a month - six times more than in 1998 .
" alcopops even appeal to very young teenagers .
girls used to go out and drink coke , now they drink alcopops instead , but they do n't notice the alcohol .
young people do n't actually like alcohol , but they are seduced into liking it , " völker-albert said .
the crux of the matter last month the government introduced sweeping legislation to put up the tax on these liquor-laced , sickly sweet sodas , increasing the price of a bottle by around € 0.80 -lrb- $ 0.96 -rrb- , but whether it will actually have the desired effect remains to be seen .
" the fact that the prices have gone up wo n't change anything , except that i wo n't buy it myself , i 'll let other people buy them for me , " 16-year-old marietta told dw-world .

instead they have become the pleasure of an alarming percentage of the nation 's youth . when it comes to alcohol and tobacco consumption , germany is ailing .
with 16.7 million smokers and 1.6 million alcoholics , smoking and drinking have become so embedded in the fabric of society that it is hard to conceive of how younger generations can avoid falling prey to their addictive clutch .
truth is , tens of thousands can not . the staggering climb in both alcohol and tobacco use amongst youth groups was overlooked for too long , and although there are now some measures in place to both correct the damage already done and to prevent its continuation , there is a long way to go in protecting children from these essentially adult vices .
over the past ten years , tobacco consumption among 12-15 year-olds has almost doubled , with some 21 percent of girls and 18 percent of boys in the age group smoking regularly .
for 16-19 year-olds , the figure is 45 percent .
they 're alarming statistics , not least because smoking in germany is not actually legal until the age of 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alcopops but the country is a smokers ' paradise , with cheap cigarettes which kids can buy from machines on street corners and very few restrictions as to where it is or is not acceptable to light up .
in fact , the state of berlin broke new ground this year in implementing a ban on smoking in its schools .
it 's a move which other states are likely to follow , but for the time being children over the age of 16 can smoke in designated areas on school premises provided they present a letter of consent from their parents .
complex issues the biggest question is , if smoking is no more socially acceptable now than it was ten years ago - which it is not - why the massive rise ?
marita völker-albert , press officer for the federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- said the reasons are manifold .
" it 's different for boys and girls .
boys see it as a way of being cool , it makes them feel older and more masculine , whereas girls tend to succumb to peer-pressure and use smoking as a way of staying thin , " völker-albert told dw-world . jörg richert , managing director of karuna , an organization which helps children and young people with potential or existing addiction problems , believes there are more critical factors at play .
" social pressures created by the continual drop in living standards in germany lead to children and young adults not receiving the attention they need . when kids feel their parents are neglecting them , they try to get their attention by taking up smoking or drinking , " richert told dw-world . but he also cites another important issue as the desire of children to grow up against the backdrop of adults trying to stay young . " it is much more difficult for kids to become adults because we wear the same clothes as them , we listen to the same music , go to the same concerts - in short , we steal their identity , " richert said . so much for the reasons behind the trend , but what of the solutions ?
völker-albert believes it is crucial to get the young smokers and drinkers to discuss the potential dangers of what they are doing to their bodies .
" until they start talking to each other , there can be no critical reflection , " she said .
amongst others , the bzga already runs a campaign of sending young people to educate their contemporaries on germany 's beaches . nipping danger in the bud richert welcomes such measures .
as far as he is concerned , the only real way to the heart of the matter is to intervene in a preventative role at a very early stage , not least because of the snowball effect of early tobacco addiction .
" we now know that people who start smoking at an early age are much more likely to move on to alcohol or other addictive substances , " richert said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youngsters to talk to their contempoaries on german beaches and therein lies another problem .
although the consumption of wine and beer among youth groups has tailed off over the past years , the emergence of alcopops has had a truly explosive impact on child and youth drinking habits .
statistics from the bzga show that in 2003 almost 50 percent of young people between the ages of 14-17 were drinking alcopops at least once a month - six times more than in 1998 .
" alcopops even appeal to very young teenagers .
girls used to go out and drink coke , now they drink alcopops instead , but they do n't notice the alcohol .
young people do n't actually like alcohol , but they are seduced into liking it , " völker-albert said .
the crux of the matter last month the government introduced sweeping legislation to put up the tax on these liquor-laced , sickly sweet sodas , increasing the price of a bottle by around € 0.80 -lrb- $ 0.96 -rrb- , but whether it will actually have the desired effect remains to be seen .
" the fact that the prices have gone up wo n't change anything , except that i wo n't buy it myself , i 'll let other people buy them for me , " 16-year-old marietta told dw-world .

" it 's important not just to shed light on one 's own history superficially , but rather to tell it from within , " he said . eichinger stressed that emotions should be consciously allowed when in coming to terms with hitler from a german perspective .

" in the film , ganz barks out orders far removed from reality - ordering nonexistent units into battle - during the last days in the bunker .
his shaking hand concealed behind his back , he holds hate-filled monologues about the jews , alleged betrayers and victory that is assured in any case . his angry outbursts at the inability of his army to stave off the soviet attack are interspersed with moments of friendliness towards his female staff and towards eva braun , who he marries just a day before their joint suicide . " a real face to the drama " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justus von dohnanyi as general burgdorf , left , and bruno ganz as adolf hitler in the film " downfall " there is little doubt that eichinger is treading controversial ground with his more humane treatment of hitler in a country where displaying nazi emblems is banned and germans are long used to be constantly reminded in movies and books that hitler was the 20th century 's worst war criminal . the film has already generated hot debate in the german press , with some critics fearing it could pander to neo-nazis .

a new german film captures the madness of his last days and resurrects the führer as never before . he may be the subject of countless books and works around the world , but there is little doubt that no other phase of hitler 's life arouses as much morbid fascination as the final one . housed within the thick walls of his underground bunker in berlin 's wilhelm strasse for the last two months of his life , the nazi leader lived what appears to be an unreal life marked by parties , protocol and grandiose war plans even as the city 's civilian population battled for their lives above the ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juliane köhler -lrb- left -rrb- who plays eva braun , hitler 's lover , bruno ganz as adolf hitler -lrb- center -rrb- and heino ferch as architect albert speer in a scene from " downfall " the bizarre period is now the theme of a startlingly convincing new film by german star producer bernd eichinger .
called " downfall - hitler and the end of the third reich , " the € 13.5 million -lrb- $ 16.3 million -rrb- film , which boasts a star-studded cast , will open in german cinemas on sept .
16 . eichinger and director oliver hirschbiegel drew on a best-selling hitler biography by joachim fest , an award-winning historian , and the memoirs of the late traudl junge , hitler 's last personal secretary . junge 's book , published just days before she died in late 2002 , offers hitherto unknown insights into life in the bunker in the spring of 1945 . last 12 days of hitler 's life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " downfall " the two and a half hour film describes the period from april 20 , hitler 's last birthday , until may 2 , 1945 .
the soviet red army was fighting at the city gates to gain victory over the nazi regime while the führer and his closest followers battled against fear of the third reich 's collapse in their bunker . the film shows hitler on his last birthday as a bent , ashen-faced man holding a garbled speech in the garden of the old imperial chancellory and a rare public kiss with eva braun , his girlfriend , after she insists on staying by his side until the end . though the film is based on historical fact and eyewitness accounts , some scenes and dialogues have been invented . " time is ripe for such a film " what sets the film apart from past attempts at screen portrayals of hitler 's last days is eichinger 's candid depiction of the nazi leader as not just a monster , but a tragic human being , marking a more relaxed approach to germany 's past . " the time is ripe for such a film , " eichinger said during a media screening in berlin this week .
" it 's important not just to shed light on one 's own history superficially , but rather to tell it from within , " he said . eichinger stressed that emotions should be consciously allowed when in coming to terms with hitler from a german perspective .

bayer face munich in the bundesliga on saturday - and maybe in europe in the future . bayer leverkusen entertains bayern munich on saturday in the " play of the day " in the bundesliga with more than just the quest for three points and ultimately a championship title in common . on wednesday , despite losing 2-1 to banik ostrava on the night , leverkusen reached the group stage of the european champions league with a 6-2 aggregate victory and became the third german team to enter the draw on thursday along with their opponents at the weekend and current bundesliga title holders werder bremen . it has been a long road for bayer leverkusen back to the continent 's premier cup competition .
after reaching the 2002 final , where they lost 2-1 to real madrid , the team buckled under the crushing disappointment of losing narrowly out on a domestic league , cup and european treble and a little under 15 months ago were almost relegated to the second division . manager klaus augenthaler has since rebuilt the club and has now guided it back into the champions league with a new-look team stripped of stars such as michael ballack , lucio and ze roberto , all now preparing to meet their former employer on saturday as part of the bayern munich team . insummountable task for czechs in reality , it looked a dead cert that bayer would reach the champions league this year after the initial game against banik ostrava .
it would have taken a monumental effort from the czech side to overcome bayer 's 5-0 first-leg win but this did not stop them attempting it .
banik went ahead seven minutes before half-time after michal papadopulos had slipped the leverkusen defense to put his shot beyond the despairing hans-jörg butt . despite early efforts from dimitar berbatov , leverkusen looked to be coasting through the second leg in the czech republic , with the hard work already achieved in the home leg in germany .
their intent was clear from the start as leverkusen coach klaus augenthaler fielded a young side including only four of the team who so comprehensively eclipsed banik in the bayarena a week before . banik pushes young bayer side the onus was on the home side to push the visitors as they looked for an equally impressive display to overcome the lead leverkusen brought with them .
miroslav matusovic and mario licka worked well to create first half openings for banik but they could not find a way past leverkusen 's butt .
robson ponte also had a decent opportunity to put the czechs ahead but the relatively inexperienced side the germans were fielding continued to stand firm . the breakthrough came on 38 minutes when leverkusen goalkeeper butt failed to cut out a ball on the six-yard box , which was retrieved by mario licka who in turn fed papadopoulos , who found the back of the net . parity gained and lost in minutes it was n't until the 83rd minute that leverkusen achieved parity .
berbatov hauled leverkusen level after banik tried to play the bulgarian striker offside but their appeals were in vain and berbatov slotted home for the equalizer .
but the balance only remained in place for six minutes .
martin cizek 's cross for the home side found an unmarked libor zurek who notched the winner .
zurek , apparently forgetting the still huge deficit and the imminent defeat that faced his side , ripped off his shirt in celebration only to be booked by the referee for his enthusiastic display . but in the end , it was bayer leverkusen who earned the right to party .

bayer face munich in the bundesliga on saturday - and maybe in europe in the future . bayer leverkusen entertains bayern munich on saturday in the " play of the day " in the bundesliga with more than just the quest for three points and ultimately a championship title in common . on wednesday , despite losing 2-1 to banik ostrava on the night , leverkusen reached the group stage of the european champions league with a 6-2 aggregate victory and became the third german team to enter the draw on thursday along with their opponents at the weekend and current bundesliga title holders werder bremen . it has been a long road for bayer leverkusen back to the continent 's premier cup competition .
after reaching the 2002 final , where they lost 2-1 to real madrid , the team buckled under the crushing disappointment of losing narrowly out on a domestic league , cup and european treble and a little under 15 months ago were almost relegated to the second division . manager klaus augenthaler has since rebuilt the club and has now guided it back into the champions league with a new-look team stripped of stars such as michael ballack , lucio and ze roberto , all now preparing to meet their former employer on saturday as part of the bayern munich team . insummountable task for czechs in reality , it looked a dead cert that bayer would reach the champions league this year after the initial game against banik ostrava .
it would have taken a monumental effort from the czech side to overcome bayer 's 5-0 first-leg win but this did not stop them attempting it .
banik went ahead seven minutes before half-time after michal papadopulos had slipped the leverkusen defense to put his shot beyond the despairing hans-jörg butt . despite early efforts from dimitar berbatov , leverkusen looked to be coasting through the second leg in the czech republic , with the hard work already achieved in the home leg in germany .
their intent was clear from the start as leverkusen coach klaus augenthaler fielded a young side including only four of the team who so comprehensively eclipsed banik in the bayarena a week before . banik pushes young bayer side the onus was on the home side to push the visitors as they looked for an equally impressive display to overcome the lead leverkusen brought with them .
miroslav matusovic and mario licka worked well to create first half openings for banik but they could not find a way past leverkusen 's butt .
robson ponte also had a decent opportunity to put the czechs ahead but the relatively inexperienced side the germans were fielding continued to stand firm . the breakthrough came on 38 minutes when leverkusen goalkeeper butt failed to cut out a ball on the six-yard box , which was retrieved by mario licka who in turn fed papadopoulos , who found the back of the net . parity gained and lost in minutes it was n't until the 83rd minute that leverkusen achieved parity .
berbatov hauled leverkusen level after banik tried to play the bulgarian striker offside but their appeals were in vain and berbatov slotted home for the equalizer .
but the balance only remained in place for six minutes .
martin cizek 's cross for the home side found an unmarked libor zurek who notched the winner .
zurek , apparently forgetting the still huge deficit and the imminent defeat that faced his side , ripped off his shirt in celebration only to be booked by the referee for his enthusiastic display . but in the end , it was bayer leverkusen who earned the right to party .
a loss on the night could not take the shine off an overall performance that saw the team return to the upper echelons of european cup competition . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen set the pace for week three reigning champions werder bremen are the team to beat at this early stage of the season with two wins from two games .

bayer face munich in the bundesliga on saturday - and maybe in europe in the future . bayer leverkusen entertains bayern munich on saturday in the " play of the day " in the bundesliga with more than just the quest for three points and ultimately a championship title in common . on wednesday , despite losing 2-1 to banik ostrava on the night , leverkusen reached the group stage of the european champions league with a 6-2 aggregate victory and became the third german team to enter the draw on thursday along with their opponents at the weekend and current bundesliga title holders werder bremen . it has been a long road for bayer leverkusen back to the continent 's premier cup competition .
after reaching the 2002 final , where they lost 2-1 to real madrid , the team buckled under the crushing disappointment of losing narrowly out on a domestic league , cup and european treble and a little under 15 months ago were almost relegated to the second division . manager klaus augenthaler has since rebuilt the club and has now guided it back into the champions league with a new-look team stripped of stars such as michael ballack , lucio and ze roberto , all now preparing to meet their former employer on saturday as part of the bayern munich team . insummountable task for czechs in reality , it looked a dead cert that bayer would reach the champions league this year after the initial game against banik ostrava .
it would have taken a monumental effort from the czech side to overcome bayer 's 5-0 first-leg win but this did not stop them attempting it .
banik went ahead seven minutes before half-time after michal papadopulos had slipped the leverkusen defense to put his shot beyond the despairing hans-jörg butt . despite early efforts from dimitar berbatov , leverkusen looked to be coasting through the second leg in the czech republic , with the hard work already achieved in the home leg in germany .
their intent was clear from the start as leverkusen coach klaus augenthaler fielded a young side including only four of the team who so comprehensively eclipsed banik in the bayarena a week before . banik pushes young bayer side the onus was on the home side to push the visitors as they looked for an equally impressive display to overcome the lead leverkusen brought with them .
miroslav matusovic and mario licka worked well to create first half openings for banik but they could not find a way past leverkusen 's butt .
robson ponte also had a decent opportunity to put the czechs ahead but the relatively inexperienced side the germans were fielding continued to stand firm . the breakthrough came on 38 minutes when leverkusen goalkeeper butt failed to cut out a ball on the six-yard box , which was retrieved by mario licka who in turn fed papadopoulos , who found the back of the net . parity gained and lost in minutes it was n't until the 83rd minute that leverkusen achieved parity .
berbatov hauled leverkusen level after banik tried to play the bulgarian striker offside but their appeals were in vain and berbatov slotted home for the equalizer .
but the balance only remained in place for six minutes .
martin cizek 's cross for the home side found an unmarked libor zurek who notched the winner .
zurek , apparently forgetting the still huge deficit and the imminent defeat that faced his side , ripped off his shirt in celebration only to be booked by the referee for his enthusiastic display . but in the end , it was bayer leverkusen who earned the right to party .
a loss on the night could not take the shine off an overall performance that saw the team return to the upper echelons of european cup competition . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen set the pace for week three reigning champions werder bremen are the team to beat at this early stage of the season with two wins from two games .

" incalculable costs " the paper said that the magnitude of claims that could result from such an attack are simply too immense for the insurance industry . " we do n't want to insure such risks any more , they 're simply incalculable , " a spokeswoman for münchener rück , the world 's largest reinsurance company told news agency ap . german insurance , banking and asset management giant allianz said it had no definite commitment to cover terrorism risks in the future . the report also said that aviation underwriters in london , which lead the insurance of most of the world 's major airlines , had already drafted a new clause earlier this year that excludes such terror risks from their standard policies , but allowed them to be written back for an extra premium . lufthansa wants governments to step in the news has rattled major european airliners , who are obliged by law and international agreements to provide insurance cover for passengers and may not fly without insurance . german national carrier lufthansa and other european airliners are now pushing for eu governments to take over liability for damages resulting from terrorism and indemnify their airlines against such an attack . lufthansa 's insurance head ralf oelssner painted a drastic scenario , saying that the reinsurance industry 's move could mean that airliners would have to ground their fleets if governments did n't step in to provide cover for ininsurable aviation risks .
" without a state guarantee , there is a possibility that air traffic will have to be discontinued if the insurers cancel their terrorism cover , as announced , " oelssner told financial times deutschland . lufthansa has since played down fears it would have to stop its flights .
" practically , it 's rather absurd .
the airplanes wo n't stay on the ground , " thomas ellerbeck spokesman for lufthansa told reuters , adding the airline was confident a workable agreement could be found in talks with governments , insurers and the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.08.2004 wagner in weimar großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner wants to see weimar emerge from the shadow of its past nike wagner , great-great granddaughter of franz liszt and great granddaughter of richard wagner , has taken the helm of germany 's weimar arts festival until 2006 .
deutsche welle met up with the new director . since weimar 's glory days as european city of culture in 1999 , johann wolfgang von goethe 's home town has been struggling to maintain the international flair it gained five years ago . but now there 's a new girl in town - and she means business . under nike wagner , once tipped as a possible new director of the bayreuth festival but pipped at the post by her younger cousin katharina , the 2004 weimar arts festival marks a new departure for a city that 's trying hard to shake off its conservative image .
the revamped event has been hailed as a forum for contemporary arts , including music , art , literature and dance . the weimar mythology in a city as steeped in history as weimar , the task of re-energizing the local arts festival while upholding the city 's formidable legacy is far from an easy one .
but wagner stresses that the city 's unique past is what makes her post so challenging . " weimar has always had a certain mythology for me , " she says .
" i 'm west german through and through , but when i studied german at university , weimar really captured my imagination . " vokhard knigge , director of the weimar klassik foundation which organizes the festival , described her appointment as an " extraordinary opportunity . "
when the former culture minister in the hamburg regional government agreed to take over , a funding crisis meant it was n't even certain the event had a future .
and wagner admitted she had her work cut out for her .
" my generation never gave any thought to the eastern half of germany , which is something i deeply regret , " she says .
" but i was thrilled when i was asked to take over the festival . "
last but not liszt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe und schiller in weimar : gone but not forgotten in the past , the festival has highlighted the city 's literary heritage .
not only home to goethe and schiller , weimar 's other famous sons include herder and nietzsche .
but this year , wagner - not one to shy away from controversy - has chosen to highlight the hungarian composer franz lizst , who spent several decades in the city and who also happens to be her great , great grandfather . " this city is more or less off the beaten tourist track , and i wanted to find a way of making it more attractive , " she explains .
" i felt that music did this more than literature , so i decided to organize a music festival - and who do i come across ?
franz lizst . " moreover , wagner renamed the new-look festival pèlerinage , a title inspired by liszt 's piano cycle " années de pèlerinage " .
the pilgrimage theme is central to this year 's event , which has " heimweh " -lrb- homesickness -rrb- as its motto . " to me , art is something that has nothing to do with anything stationary , " wagner says .
" art is restless , it 's always looking for new departures , new shores , new utopias . " in 2004 , the increased post-enlargement east european presence at the festival gives this theme added relevance .
" nietzsche 's philosophy , for example , described the status and sensibility of new-age man as nomadic , " points out wagner .
" that 's the trademark of the modern age - in a philosophical sense , we no longer have a home . " commemorating the past this year 's festival also features plenty of modern music , including work by béla bartok and contemporary composers such as györgy kurtág , steffen schleiermacher and heiner goebbels .
wagner is aware that her detractors might find her program a little too challenging for classicist weimar .
but she firmly believes that the festival 's juxtaposition of old and new can only be good for a city whose history is both a boon and a burden . " modernist movements tended to fail here , they were often banished , " she observes .
" take the bauhaus artists , who left to go to dessau .
modernist movements have always been given a hard time in weimar , but it has to be pointed out that no other city needs modernism more than this one . " " it has a surplus of everything else , " she adds .
" its museum collections and archives are phenomenal , and obviously , they need to be preserved very carefully .
but you have to get around traditions , you have to see them as a challenge ! " another of her innovations has been to usher in a new tradition : every year the weimar festival will open with a concert in memory of buchenwald , the nearby nazi concentration camp . " it 's a memorial concert , but it wo n't be held in buchenwald , which would exploit the horrific past of the location , " she stresses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.08.2004 wagner in weimar großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner wants to see weimar emerge from the shadow of its past nike wagner , great-great granddaughter of franz liszt and great granddaughter of richard wagner , has taken the helm of germany 's weimar arts festival until 2006 .
deutsche welle met up with the new director . since weimar 's glory days as european city of culture in 1999 , johann wolfgang von goethe 's home town has been struggling to maintain the international flair it gained five years ago . but now there 's a new girl in town - and she means business . under nike wagner , once tipped as a possible new director of the bayreuth festival but pipped at the post by her younger cousin katharina , the 2004 weimar arts festival marks a new departure for a city that 's trying hard to shake off its conservative image .
the revamped event has been hailed as a forum for contemporary arts , including music , art , literature and dance . the weimar mythology in a city as steeped in history as weimar , the task of re-energizing the local arts festival while upholding the city 's formidable legacy is far from an easy one .
but wagner stresses that the city 's unique past is what makes her post so challenging . " weimar has always had a certain mythology for me , " she says .
" i 'm west german through and through , but when i studied german at university , weimar really captured my imagination . " vokhard knigge , director of the weimar klassik foundation which organizes the festival , described her appointment as an " extraordinary opportunity . "
when the former culture minister in the hamburg regional government agreed to take over , a funding crisis meant it was n't even certain the event had a future .
and wagner admitted she had her work cut out for her .
" my generation never gave any thought to the eastern half of germany , which is something i deeply regret , " she says .
" but i was thrilled when i was asked to take over the festival . "
last but not liszt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe und schiller in weimar : gone but not forgotten in the past , the festival has highlighted the city 's literary heritage .
not only home to goethe and schiller , weimar 's other famous sons include herder and nietzsche .
but this year , wagner - not one to shy away from controversy - has chosen to highlight the hungarian composer franz lizst , who spent several decades in the city and who also happens to be her great , great grandfather . " this city is more or less off the beaten tourist track , and i wanted to find a way of making it more attractive , " she explains .
" i felt that music did this more than literature , so i decided to organize a music festival - and who do i come across ?
franz lizst . " moreover , wagner renamed the new-look festival pèlerinage , a title inspired by liszt 's piano cycle " années de pèlerinage " .
the pilgrimage theme is central to this year 's event , which has " heimweh " -lrb- homesickness -rrb- as its motto . " to me , art is something that has nothing to do with anything stationary , " wagner says .
" art is restless , it 's always looking for new departures , new shores , new utopias . " in 2004 , the increased post-enlargement east european presence at the festival gives this theme added relevance .
" nietzsche 's philosophy , for example , described the status and sensibility of new-age man as nomadic , " points out wagner .
" that 's the trademark of the modern age - in a philosophical sense , we no longer have a home . " commemorating the past this year 's festival also features plenty of modern music , including work by béla bartok and contemporary composers such as györgy kurtág , steffen schleiermacher and heiner goebbels .
wagner is aware that her detractors might find her program a little too challenging for classicist weimar .
but she firmly believes that the festival 's juxtaposition of old and new can only be good for a city whose history is both a boon and a burden . " modernist movements tended to fail here , they were often banished , " she observes .
" take the bauhaus artists , who left to go to dessau .
modernist movements have always been given a hard time in weimar , but it has to be pointed out that no other city needs modernism more than this one . " " it has a surplus of everything else , " she adds .
" its museum collections and archives are phenomenal , and obviously , they need to be preserved very carefully .
but you have to get around traditions , you have to see them as a challenge ! " another of her innovations has been to usher in a new tradition : every year the weimar festival will open with a concert in memory of buchenwald , the nearby nazi concentration camp . " it 's a memorial concert , but it wo n't be held in buchenwald , which would exploit the horrific past of the location , " she stresses .
" it 's just a thoughtful , beautiful orchestral performance … .. there are few ways of commemorating the past appropriately , and this is one possible solution . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wagner festival starts without scandal the 2004 wagner festival opened with a controversial production of " parsifal " on sunday .
but despite some booing , many in the audience agreed that the director 's work was an interesting and courageous interpretation . -lrb- july 26 , 2004 -rrb- wagner 's great-granddaughter to make bayreuth debut the 25-year-old great-granddaughter of richard wagner will make her directing debut at the bayreuth festival , the prestigious festival dedicated exclusively to the composer 's works , in 2007 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.08.2004 revival of trade ties remains tricky in cyprus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the island of cyprus is still marked by borders and separations new eu regulations introduced this week allow ethnically divided greeks and turks in cyprus to resume trade ties .
but implementation promises to be far from easy . the new regulations , adopted by the european commission in july and which came into effect on monday this week , are meant to revive trade ties between the turkish and cypriot part of the divided island .
trading between the two sides came to a standstill following the division of cyprus in 1974 and has been non-existent until now . according to the eu regulations , turkish entrepreneurs in the northern part of the island can for the first time sell their products in the greek south .
from there the goods can also be exported to other eu countries without further checks and bureaucratic hurdles . the rules dictate that the goods have to comply with eu standards on food safety and plant health .
further , the turkish cypriot chamber of commerce will have to ensure that products must actually originate from northern cyprus and not turkey . the move is part of an eu package to rebuild the north 's economy and end the isolation of turkish cypriots after they voted in favour of reunification of the island in an april referendum .
however greek cypriots rejected the peace plan , allowing only the greek part of the island to join the european union . rules not free of hurdles but despite the good intentions , implementing the trade regulation will turn out to be tougher than it appears on paper . for one , all animal and agricultural products - goods with probably the most significant export potential - are excluded from the regulation as are goods originating from turkey . this week just a day after the regulation came into effect , greek cypriots sent back a turkish truckload of fish , which fell foul of the law . adrian van der meer , the eu 's representative in cyprus said the rejection of the fish by greek cypriot veterinary authorities was a regrettable necessity . " from a legal point of view the certificate of origin issued was correct because the fish originated in the northern part of cyprus , but the second clause says that no animal produce is allowed to cross , and we take a zero tolerance on this , " he told reuters . mutual trust needed in addition , turkish cypriot businessmen need a greek cypriot partner who will buy their products and sell them .
given the island 's division and troubled past , few believe it will be an easy task . " goods , whose origin is difficult to conceal such as consumer goods , will be difficult to sell in the south , " heinz kramer , cyprus expert at the science and politics foundation told dw-world . it also seems likely that greek cypriot businessmen would watch out for their interests and be wary of opening the door to possible competitors from the other end of the island . kramer said building materials and textile products count among the few goods that have a chance of being sold in the southern market .
" it will probably hardly interest anyone where his bricks are coming from , " kramer said . symbolism rather than real benefits as far as economic benefits go , hardly anyone expects the regulation to have a major impact .
flourishing trade between the two parts of the island remains an unrealistic hope . " i believe that the move is highly politically symbolic , one that 's meant to show that the north should n't be isolated .
but , its economic significance is very minimal , " kramer said . a real breakthrough in trade relations between the two parts of the divided island might instead come from a proposal that 's currently making the rounds in the eu council of ministers .
according to it , turkish cypriot products will be directly exported to the eu without a diversion via the southern greek cypriot part of the island . but it remains unclear whether the proposal will actually see the light of day .
greece and new eu member cyprus , which represents the greek part of the island , have already indicated that they are against full free trade for the north . michael knigge -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cyprus celebrates a dubious birthday thirty years after turkey invaded it , cyprus remains a divided island .

berlin has promised to pass a law to compel company chiefs to disclose their salary in a year if the executives fail to do so voluntarily .
" insufficient information in the balance sheets published in a company 's annual report - and that includes a legal obligation to disclose management board pay - will be punished with fines , " zypries said in an interview published on the internet site of manager magazin .
german law currently requires listed companies only to publish the total sum of all salaries of management board members , not individual salaries .
a code of conduct introduced in 2002 recommends that individual salaries also be disclosed , but only 11 of the 30 companies in germany 's blue-chip dax index have done so .

the fetching price for a 2.5 kilometer stretch of real estate , including beaches , five hotel blocks and forest land , is a modest € 125,000 .
the government 's previous attempts to find a buyer proved unsuccessful and berlin has now turned to the norddeutsche grundstücksauktionen auction house to re-launch the sale in a bid to top up its depleted coffers .
locals are none too pleased at the prospect of a vast hotel complex on their doorstep , with the island 's smaller hotels worried they may be put out of business .
the resort was originally built in the 1930s as part of the nazis ' " kraft durch freude " -lrb- " strength through joy " -rrb- program . more briefs 26.08.2004 -pipe- germany gets new iraqi ambassador 26.08.2004 -pipe- rüsselsheim gets memorial for us pows 25.08.2004 -pipe- germans agree with anti-reform protesters 25.08.2004 -pipe- train stations smoke-free in future 25.08.2004 -pipe- germans prefer to marry turks , asians 24.08.2004 -pipe- protesters throw eggs at schröder 24.08.2004 -pipe- terror suspect can resume studies 24.08.2004 -pipe- german ambassador accredited in iraq radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but implementation promises to be far from easy . the new regulations , adopted by the european commission in july and which came into effect on monday this week , are meant to revive trade ties between the turkish and cypriot part of the divided island .
trading between the two sides came to a standstill following the division of cyprus in 1974 and has been non-existent until now . according to the eu regulations , turkish entrepreneurs in the northern part of the island can for the first time sell their products in the greek south .

further , the turkish cypriot chamber of commerce will have to ensure that products must actually originate from northern cyprus and not turkey . the move is part of an eu package to rebuild the north 's economy and end the isolation of turkish cypriots after they voted in favour of reunification of the island in an april referendum .
however greek cypriots rejected the peace plan , allowing only the greek part of the island to join the european union . rules not free of hurdles but despite the good intentions , implementing the trade regulation will turn out to be tougher than it appears on paper . for one , all animal and agricultural products - goods with probably the most significant export potential - are excluded from the regulation as are goods originating from turkey . this week just a day after the regulation came into effect , greek cypriots sent back a turkish truckload of fish , which fell foul of the law . adrian van der meer , the eu 's representative in cyprus said the rejection of the fish by greek cypriot veterinary authorities was a regrettable necessity .

given the island 's division and troubled past , few believe it will be an easy task . " goods , whose origin is difficult to conceal such as consumer goods , will be difficult to sell in the south , " heinz kramer , cyprus expert at the science and politics foundation told dw-world . it also seems likely that greek cypriot businessmen would watch out for their interests and be wary of opening the door to possible competitors from the other end of the island . kramer said building materials and textile products count among the few goods that have a chance of being sold in the southern market .
" it will probably hardly interest anyone where his bricks are coming from , " kramer said . symbolism rather than real benefits as far as economic benefits go , hardly anyone expects the regulation to have a major impact .
flourishing trade between the two parts of the island remains an unrealistic hope . " i believe that the move is highly politically symbolic , one that 's meant to show that the north should n't be isolated .
but , its economic significance is very minimal , " kramer said . a real breakthrough in trade relations between the two parts of the divided island might instead come from a proposal that 's currently making the rounds in the eu council of ministers .

but implementation promises to be far from easy . the new regulations , adopted by the european commission in july and which came into effect on monday this week , are meant to revive trade ties between the turkish and cypriot part of the divided island .
trading between the two sides came to a standstill following the division of cyprus in 1974 and has been non-existent until now . according to the eu regulations , turkish entrepreneurs in the northern part of the island can for the first time sell their products in the greek south .
from there the goods can also be exported to other eu countries without further checks and bureaucratic hurdles . the rules dictate that the goods have to comply with eu standards on food safety and plant health .
further , the turkish cypriot chamber of commerce will have to ensure that products must actually originate from northern cyprus and not turkey . the move is part of an eu package to rebuild the north 's economy and end the isolation of turkish cypriots after they voted in favour of reunification of the island in an april referendum .
however greek cypriots rejected the peace plan , allowing only the greek part of the island to join the european union . rules not free of hurdles but despite the good intentions , implementing the trade regulation will turn out to be tougher than it appears on paper . for one , all animal and agricultural products - goods with probably the most significant export potential - are excluded from the regulation as are goods originating from turkey . this week just a day after the regulation came into effect , greek cypriots sent back a turkish truckload of fish , which fell foul of the law . adrian van der meer , the eu 's representative in cyprus said the rejection of the fish by greek cypriot veterinary authorities was a regrettable necessity . " from a legal point of view the certificate of origin issued was correct because the fish originated in the northern part of cyprus , but the second clause says that no animal produce is allowed to cross , and we take a zero tolerance on this , " he told reuters . mutual trust needed in addition , turkish cypriot businessmen need a greek cypriot partner who will buy their products and sell them .
given the island 's division and troubled past , few believe it will be an easy task . " goods , whose origin is difficult to conceal such as consumer goods , will be difficult to sell in the south , " heinz kramer , cyprus expert at the science and politics foundation told dw-world . it also seems likely that greek cypriot businessmen would watch out for their interests and be wary of opening the door to possible competitors from the other end of the island . kramer said building materials and textile products count among the few goods that have a chance of being sold in the southern market .
" it will probably hardly interest anyone where his bricks are coming from , " kramer said . symbolism rather than real benefits as far as economic benefits go , hardly anyone expects the regulation to have a major impact .
flourishing trade between the two parts of the island remains an unrealistic hope . " i believe that the move is highly politically symbolic , one that 's meant to show that the north should n't be isolated .
but , its economic significance is very minimal , " kramer said . a real breakthrough in trade relations between the two parts of the divided island might instead come from a proposal that 's currently making the rounds in the eu council of ministers .
according to it , turkish cypriot products will be directly exported to the eu without a diversion via the southern greek cypriot part of the island . but it remains unclear whether the proposal will actually see the light of day .
greece and new eu member cyprus , which represents the greek part of the island , have already indicated that they are against full free trade for the north . michael knigge -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cyprus celebrates a dubious birthday thirty years after turkey invaded it , cyprus remains a divided island .

the monthly business climate index calculated by munich-based economic institute ifo showed that business confidence in germany faded this month , as companies became more sceptical about the economic outlook over the next six months .
the index , the most widely watched barometer of business morale in germany , slipped to 95.3 points in august , its lowest level since october 2003 , ifo said in a statement .
ifo president hans-werner sinn said that the findings of its latest survey provided no evidence of a self-sustaining rebound in germany .
" economic recovery in germany is still not on a broad and secure footing , " he said .
" favorable exports are not feeding through to stronger domestic demand .

0.15 how would you describe your personality ?
" the good qualities are that i 'm a perceptive person , that i 'm persistent and that i 'm also very sensitive .
among the negative qualities , i 'd say my ambition and a certain tendency to melancholy . "
who 's your personal hero ?
" an indian philosopher named jiddu krishnamurti who lived in the 20th century and who 's unfortunately not very well known here , but whose writings would really be very valuable for anybody . " what 's a temptation you ca n't resist ?
" certainly chocolate , and also certainly my wife and good conversations with intelligent people . " + + + do you have a philosophy ?
" never stop , because everything stops on its own . " do you have an unfulfilled dream ?
" yes .
finding inner satisfaction and calm , inner peace .
but that will probably come all by itself someday . "
what drives you bananas ?
" stupidity , narrow-mindedness , brainless aggression , intolerance - which result in so many problems - and incompetence and laziness . "
what would your perfect day look like ?
" a perfect day is a day that brings surprises , that does n't turn out the way you planned it , or how you would like to it be .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.08.2004 airlines want state to shoulder terrorism insurance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa warns flights will be grounded if the state does n't step in european insurers are reportedly unwilling to provide cover for terror-related risks in aviation policies , prompting airlines like germany 's lufthansa to urge governments to pay for terror insurance . just as the aviation industry begins to recover from the effects of terrorism , sars and a sluggish world economy over the past few years , airlines are bracing for yet another blow .
major european reinsurance companies apparently want to drop certain terrorism-related risks from aviation policies . german daily financial times deutschland reported on wednesday that several european reinsurers starting 2005 want to explicitly rule out liability in the event of attacks with nuclear , chemical and biological weapons .
they include attacks with so-called " dirty bombs " containing radioactive or other hazardous materials being detonated aboard planes or at airports . " incalculable costs " the paper said that the magnitude of claims that could result from such an attack are simply too immense for the insurance industry . " we do n't want to insure such risks any more , they 're simply incalculable , " a spokeswoman for münchener rück , the world 's largest reinsurance company told news agency ap . german insurance , banking and asset management giant allianz said it had no definite commitment to cover terrorism risks in the future . the report also said that aviation underwriters in london , which lead the insurance of most of the world 's major airlines , had already drafted a new clause earlier this year that excludes such terror risks from their standard policies , but allowed them to be written back for an extra premium . lufthansa wants governments to step in the news has rattled major european airliners , who are obliged by law and international agreements to provide insurance cover for passengers and may not fly without insurance . german national carrier lufthansa and other european airliners are now pushing for eu governments to take over liability for damages resulting from terrorism and indemnify their airlines against such an attack . lufthansa 's insurance head ralf oelssner painted a drastic scenario , saying that the reinsurance industry 's move could mean that airliners would have to ground their fleets if governments did n't step in to provide cover for ininsurable aviation risks .
" without a state guarantee , there is a possibility that air traffic will have to be discontinued if the insurers cancel their terrorism cover , as announced , " oelssner told financial times deutschland . lufthansa has since played down fears it would have to stop its flights .
" practically , it 's rather absurd .
the airplanes wo n't stay on the ground , " thomas ellerbeck spokesman for lufthansa told reuters , adding the airline was confident a workable agreement could be found in talks with governments , insurers and the european union . " if there is no private-sector solution for european airlines , it will have to come down to a state guarantee for this particular risk , " ellerbeck said .
" this is also about fair competition across the north atlantic . "
in the us , the government already provides terrorism insurance and will do so until 2008 . " terrorism is a question of security and for us it 's a question of national security , not aviation security , " a spokeswoman for the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- , a geneva-based airlines trade association representing over 98 percent of scheduled international traffic , told reuters .
" governments should be taking on the cost burden of these activities … it 's a matter of protecting their citizens , " she said . european governments did temporarily take over terrorism insurance in the aftermath of the sept .

but implementation promises to be far from easy . the new regulations , adopted by the european commission in july and which came into effect on monday this week , are meant to revive trade ties between the turkish and cypriot part of the divided island .
trading between the two sides came to a standstill following the division of cyprus in 1974 and has been non-existent until now . according to the eu regulations , turkish entrepreneurs in the northern part of the island can for the first time sell their products in the greek south .
from there the goods can also be exported to other eu countries without further checks and bureaucratic hurdles . the rules dictate that the goods have to comply with eu standards on food safety and plant health .
further , the turkish cypriot chamber of commerce will have to ensure that products must actually originate from northern cyprus and not turkey . the move is part of an eu package to rebuild the north 's economy and end the isolation of turkish cypriots after they voted in favour of reunification of the island in an april referendum .
however greek cypriots rejected the peace plan , allowing only the greek part of the island to join the european union . rules not free of hurdles but despite the good intentions , implementing the trade regulation will turn out to be tougher than it appears on paper . for one , all animal and agricultural products - goods with probably the most significant export potential - are excluded from the regulation as are goods originating from turkey . this week just a day after the regulation came into effect , greek cypriots sent back a turkish truckload of fish , which fell foul of the law . adrian van der meer , the eu 's representative in cyprus said the rejection of the fish by greek cypriot veterinary authorities was a regrettable necessity . " from a legal point of view the certificate of origin issued was correct because the fish originated in the northern part of cyprus , but the second clause says that no animal produce is allowed to cross , and we take a zero tolerance on this , " he told reuters . mutual trust needed in addition , turkish cypriot businessmen need a greek cypriot partner who will buy their products and sell them .
given the island 's division and troubled past , few believe it will be an easy task . " goods , whose origin is difficult to conceal such as consumer goods , will be difficult to sell in the south , " heinz kramer , cyprus expert at the science and politics foundation told dw-world . it also seems likely that greek cypriot businessmen would watch out for their interests and be wary of opening the door to possible competitors from the other end of the island . kramer said building materials and textile products count among the few goods that have a chance of being sold in the southern market .
" it will probably hardly interest anyone where his bricks are coming from , " kramer said . symbolism rather than real benefits as far as economic benefits go , hardly anyone expects the regulation to have a major impact .
flourishing trade between the two parts of the island remains an unrealistic hope . " i believe that the move is highly politically symbolic , one that 's meant to show that the north should n't be isolated .
but , its economic significance is very minimal , " kramer said . a real breakthrough in trade relations between the two parts of the divided island might instead come from a proposal that 's currently making the rounds in the eu council of ministers .
according to it , turkish cypriot products will be directly exported to the eu without a diversion via the southern greek cypriot part of the island . but it remains unclear whether the proposal will actually see the light of day .
greece and new eu member cyprus , which represents the greek part of the island , have already indicated that they are against full free trade for the north . michael knigge -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cyprus celebrates a dubious birthday thirty years after turkey invaded it , cyprus remains a divided island .

major european reinsurance companies apparently want to drop certain terrorism-related risks from aviation policies . german daily financial times deutschland reported on wednesday that several european reinsurers starting 2005 want to explicitly rule out liability in the event of attacks with nuclear , chemical and biological weapons .
they include attacks with so-called " dirty bombs " containing radioactive or other hazardous materials being detonated aboard planes or at airports . " incalculable costs " the paper said that the magnitude of claims that could result from such an attack are simply too immense for the insurance industry . " we do n't want to insure such risks any more , they 're simply incalculable , " a spokeswoman for münchener rück , the world 's largest reinsurance company told news agency ap . german insurance , banking and asset management giant allianz said it had no definite commitment to cover terrorism risks in the future . the report also said that aviation underwriters in london , which lead the insurance of most of the world 's major airlines , had already drafted a new clause earlier this year that excludes such terror risks from their standard policies , but allowed them to be written back for an extra premium . lufthansa wants governments to step in the news has rattled major european airliners , who are obliged by law and international agreements to provide insurance cover for passengers and may not fly without insurance . german national carrier lufthansa and other european airliners are now pushing for eu governments to take over liability for damages resulting from terrorism and indemnify their airlines against such an attack . lufthansa 's insurance head ralf oelssner painted a drastic scenario , saying that the reinsurance industry 's move could mean that airliners would have to ground their fleets if governments did n't step in to provide cover for ininsurable aviation risks .
" without a state guarantee , there is a possibility that air traffic will have to be discontinued if the insurers cancel their terrorism cover , as announced , " oelssner told financial times deutschland . lufthansa has since played down fears it would have to stop its flights .
" practically , it 's rather absurd .
the airplanes wo n't stay on the ground , " thomas ellerbeck spokesman for lufthansa told reuters , adding the airline was confident a workable agreement could be found in talks with governments , insurers and the european union . " if there is no private-sector solution for european airlines , it will have to come down to a state guarantee for this particular risk , " ellerbeck said .
" this is also about fair competition across the north atlantic . "
in the us , the government already provides terrorism insurance and will do so until 2008 . " terrorism is a question of security and for us it 's a question of national security , not aviation security , " a spokeswoman for the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- , a geneva-based airlines trade association representing over 98 percent of scheduled international traffic , told reuters .
" governments should be taking on the cost burden of these activities … it 's a matter of protecting their citizens , " she said . european governments did temporarily take over terrorism insurance in the aftermath of the sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.08.2004 german egovernment initiative off to a slow start großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this should be the future when it comes to dealing with bureacracy the eu would like its citizens to use personal computers to do taxes and complete bureacratic formalities .
but apart from a successful egovernment project in bremen , germany still lags behind on an eu level . getting your own birth certificate in germany usually entails a bureaucratic nightmare lasting several weeks .
but a new high-tech project in bremen has reduced the process to literally a couple of clicks . all you have to do is order the certificate online from the registry office , you even sign the form right away on your computer .
within a couple of days , the certificate will be in the mail . kerstin sprock who works for a private company that maintains online services for the city of bremen is proud that the city leads the way when it comes to egovernment in germany . " we realized very early that it 's not just about information , but people also want to accomplish things .
and bremen stands out in the field , it has over 100 services that citizens can sign for with an electronic signature , " sprock told dw-radio . whether it 's informing authorities about a change in address , applying for a car license plate or filling out a form for dog taxes , it 's all possible via the internet in bremen , 24 hours a day and without spending time in long waiting lines at offices . electronic signature the show stealer the chief attraction is the electronic signature which works a bit like withdrawing money from a cash machine .
the user needs a chip card , an own scanner and a secret code . sprock says security is the main priority .
" according to current technology , the electronic signature ca n't be cracked , " she said .
" actually , the biggest security risk is at offices , in families and among friends .
but one needs to go to great criminal lengths to even get close technologically to such a signature . " but there remains little doubt that the electronic signature is n't foolproof .
security concerns over egovernment and other online services involving personal data have driven the european commission - which is pushing eu governments to make their bureaucracy more efficient , high-tech and user-friendly - to set up a european agency for network and information security called enisa .
its chief aim is to ensure that data protection guidelines are obeyed and that security standards of computers are constantly upgraded . bremen still has n't witnessed any misuse of its electronic signature , but then few citizens of the northern german city have been making use of the online services .
one of the chief reasons is that the card scanner and the chip card cost citizens around € 50 a year . but sprock said the project was still a success among corporate users .
" several people from business and industry have told us that they usually have an own office to deal with bureaucracy - now , naturally they can do away with it and save money . " germany lags behind the egovernment project is underway in bremen , esslingen and nuremberg .
the three cities are supported by the german government with funds and know-how with the framework of a pilot project .
but it 's clear that bremen is the trailblazer .
last year , it even won an award for its egovernment project from the european commission . but , apart from the cities involved in the online pilot project , the rest of germany 's cities and towns remain far behind on the information highway .
though citizens can download official forms on the internet almost everywhere , they still have to sign them by hand and then take the application to an office or at least to a mailbox . that makes germany a bit of a laggard on the european level when it comes to egovernment .
leading the way are the scandinavian countries where on an average , citizens can accomplish over 80 percent of official services sitting at their computers within the comfort of their homes .
as compared to that , germans can wrap up just about 50 percent of official services at home , taking it to third place in europe and only slightly better than belgium and luxembourg . despite the rising popularity and simplicity of egovernment , kerstin sprock does n't believe they 'll ever completely replace government officials .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.08.2004 wagner in weimar großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner wants to see weimar emerge from the shadow of its past nike wagner , great-great granddaughter of franz liszt and great granddaughter of richard wagner , has taken the helm of germany 's weimar arts festival until 2006 .
deutsche welle met up with the new director . since weimar 's glory days as european city of culture in 1999 , johann wolfgang von goethe 's home town has been struggling to maintain the international flair it gained five years ago . but now there 's a new girl in town - and she means business . under nike wagner , once tipped as a possible new director of the bayreuth festival but pipped at the post by her younger cousin katharina , the 2004 weimar arts festival marks a new departure for a city that 's trying hard to shake off its conservative image .
the revamped event has been hailed as a forum for contemporary arts , including music , art , literature and dance . the weimar mythology in a city as steeped in history as weimar , the task of re-energizing the local arts festival while upholding the city 's formidable legacy is far from an easy one .
but wagner stresses that the city 's unique past is what makes her post so challenging . " weimar has always had a certain mythology for me , " she says .
" i 'm west german through and through , but when i studied german at university , weimar really captured my imagination . " vokhard knigge , director of the weimar klassik foundation which organizes the festival , described her appointment as an " extraordinary opportunity . "
when the former culture minister in the hamburg regional government agreed to take over , a funding crisis meant it was n't even certain the event had a future .
and wagner admitted she had her work cut out for her .
" my generation never gave any thought to the eastern half of germany , which is something i deeply regret , " she says .
" but i was thrilled when i was asked to take over the festival . "
last but not liszt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe und schiller in weimar : gone but not forgotten in the past , the festival has highlighted the city 's literary heritage .
not only home to goethe and schiller , weimar 's other famous sons include herder and nietzsche .
but this year , wagner - not one to shy away from controversy - has chosen to highlight the hungarian composer franz lizst , who spent several decades in the city and who also happens to be her great , great grandfather . " this city is more or less off the beaten tourist track , and i wanted to find a way of making it more attractive , " she explains .
" i felt that music did this more than literature , so i decided to organize a music festival - and who do i come across ?
franz lizst . " moreover , wagner renamed the new-look festival pèlerinage , a title inspired by liszt 's piano cycle " années de pèlerinage " .
the pilgrimage theme is central to this year 's event , which has " heimweh " -lrb- homesickness -rrb- as its motto . " to me , art is something that has nothing to do with anything stationary , " wagner says .
" art is restless , it 's always looking for new departures , new shores , new utopias . " in 2004 , the increased post-enlargement east european presence at the festival gives this theme added relevance .
" nietzsche 's philosophy , for example , described the status and sensibility of new-age man as nomadic , " points out wagner .
" that 's the trademark of the modern age - in a philosophical sense , we no longer have a home . " commemorating the past this year 's festival also features plenty of modern music , including work by béla bartok and contemporary composers such as györgy kurtág , steffen schleiermacher and heiner goebbels .
wagner is aware that her detractors might find her program a little too challenging for classicist weimar .
but she firmly believes that the festival 's juxtaposition of old and new can only be good for a city whose history is both a boon and a burden . " modernist movements tended to fail here , they were often banished , " she observes .
" take the bauhaus artists , who left to go to dessau .
modernist movements have always been given a hard time in weimar , but it has to be pointed out that no other city needs modernism more than this one . " " it has a surplus of everything else , " she adds .
" its museum collections and archives are phenomenal , and obviously , they need to be preserved very carefully .
but you have to get around traditions , you have to see them as a challenge ! " another of her innovations has been to usher in a new tradition : every year the weimar festival will open with a concert in memory of buchenwald , the nearby nazi concentration camp . " it 's a memorial concert , but it wo n't be held in buchenwald , which would exploit the horrific past of the location , " she stresses .
" it 's just a thoughtful , beautiful orchestral performance … .. there are few ways of commemorating the past appropriately , and this is one possible solution .

a new german film captures the madness of his last days and resurrects the führer as never before . he may be the subject of countless books and works around the world , but there is little doubt that no other phase of hitler 's life arouses as much morbid fascination as the final one . housed within the thick walls of his underground bunker in berlin 's wilhelm strasse for the last two months of his life , the nazi leader lived what appears to be an unreal life marked by parties , protocol and grandiose war plans even as the city 's civilian population battled for their lives above the ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juliane köhler -lrb- left -rrb- who plays eva braun , hitler 's lover , bruno ganz as adolf hitler -lrb- center -rrb- and heino ferch as architect albert speer in a scene from " downfall " the bizarre period is now the theme of a startlingly convincing new film by german star producer bernd eichinger .
called " downfall - hitler and the end of the third reich , " the € 13.5 million -lrb- $ 16.3 million -rrb- film , which boasts a star-studded cast , will open in german cinemas on sept .
16 . eichinger and director oliver hirschbiegel drew on a best-selling hitler biography by joachim fest , an award-winning historian , and the memoirs of the late traudl junge , hitler 's last personal secretary . junge 's book , published just days before she died in late 2002 , offers hitherto unknown insights into life in the bunker in the spring of 1945 . last 12 days of hitler 's life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " downfall " the two and a half hour film describes the period from april 20 , hitler 's last birthday , until may 2 , 1945 .
the soviet red army was fighting at the city gates to gain victory over the nazi regime while the führer and his closest followers battled against fear of the third reich 's collapse in their bunker . the film shows hitler on his last birthday as a bent , ashen-faced man holding a garbled speech in the garden of the old imperial chancellory and a rare public kiss with eva braun , his girlfriend , after she insists on staying by his side until the end . though the film is based on historical fact and eyewitness accounts , some scenes and dialogues have been invented . " time is ripe for such a film " what sets the film apart from past attempts at screen portrayals of hitler 's last days is eichinger 's candid depiction of the nazi leader as not just a monster , but a tragic human being , marking a more relaxed approach to germany 's past . " the time is ripe for such a film , " eichinger said during a media screening in berlin this week .
" it 's important not just to shed light on one 's own history superficially , but rather to tell it from within , " he said . eichinger stressed that emotions should be consciously allowed when in coming to terms with hitler from a german perspective .
" if you had overall sympathy for hitler , then the film has failed in its intention .
but to show sympathy in certain moments is , i believe , quite fine , " eichinger said . a more human hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz as hitler in " downfall " veteran swiss actor bruno ganz , who plays hitler in the film , explained that the führer was a person who had earned the least sympathy .
" but i 'm not ashamed of the fact that i could feel sympathy for him during fleeting seconds , " ganz said in berlin . historian fest , who was consulted closely by eichinger during the making of the film , said , " ganz is really hitler : when you look at him you feel a chill down your spine . " in the film , ganz barks out orders far removed from reality - ordering nonexistent units into battle - during the last days in the bunker .
his shaking hand concealed behind his back , he holds hate-filled monologues about the jews , alleged betrayers and victory that is assured in any case . his angry outbursts at the inability of his army to stave off the soviet attack are interspersed with moments of friendliness towards his female staff and towards eva braun , who he marries just a day before their joint suicide . " a real face to the drama " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justus von dohnanyi as general burgdorf , left , and bruno ganz as adolf hitler in the film " downfall " there is little doubt that eichinger is treading controversial ground with his more humane treatment of hitler in a country where displaying nazi emblems is banned and germans are long used to be constantly reminded in movies and books that hitler was the 20th century 's worst war criminal . the film has already generated hot debate in the german press , with some critics fearing it could pander to neo-nazis .
" -lrb- ' downfall ' -rrb- prompts the question whether one should be allowed to feel sympathy for hitler , " the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekly wrote . others have taken a more favorable view .
der spiegel newsmagazine , which devoted its cover story to the film this week , wrote that eichinger had managed what no one had before : " to give the absurd drama in the bunker a real face .

16 . eichinger and director oliver hirschbiegel drew on a best-selling hitler biography by joachim fest , an award-winning historian , and the memoirs of the late traudl junge , hitler 's last personal secretary . junge 's book , published just days before she died in late 2002 , offers hitherto unknown insights into life in the bunker in the spring of 1945 . last 12 days of hitler 's life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " downfall " the two and a half hour film describes the period from april 20 , hitler 's last birthday , until may 2 , 1945 .
the soviet red army was fighting at the city gates to gain victory over the nazi regime while the führer and his closest followers battled against fear of the third reich 's collapse in their bunker . the film shows hitler on his last birthday as a bent , ashen-faced man holding a garbled speech in the garden of the old imperial chancellory and a rare public kiss with eva braun , his girlfriend , after she insists on staying by his side until the end . though the film is based on historical fact and eyewitness accounts , some scenes and dialogues have been invented . " time is ripe for such a film " what sets the film apart from past attempts at screen portrayals of hitler 's last days is eichinger 's candid depiction of the nazi leader as not just a monster , but a tragic human being , marking a more relaxed approach to germany 's past . " the time is ripe for such a film , " eichinger said during a media screening in berlin this week .
" it 's important not just to shed light on one 's own history superficially , but rather to tell it from within , " he said . eichinger stressed that emotions should be consciously allowed when in coming to terms with hitler from a german perspective .
" if you had overall sympathy for hitler , then the film has failed in its intention .

" but i 'm not ashamed of the fact that i could feel sympathy for him during fleeting seconds , " ganz said in berlin . historian fest , who was consulted closely by eichinger during the making of the film , said , " ganz is really hitler : when you look at him you feel a chill down your spine . " in the film , ganz barks out orders far removed from reality - ordering nonexistent units into battle - during the last days in the bunker .
his shaking hand concealed behind his back , he holds hate-filled monologues about the jews , alleged betrayers and victory that is assured in any case . his angry outbursts at the inability of his army to stave off the soviet attack are interspersed with moments of friendliness towards his female staff and towards eva braun , who he marries just a day before their joint suicide . " a real face to the drama " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justus von dohnanyi as general burgdorf , left , and bruno ganz as adolf hitler in the film " downfall " there is little doubt that eichinger is treading controversial ground with his more humane treatment of hitler in a country where displaying nazi emblems is banned and germans are long used to be constantly reminded in movies and books that hitler was the 20th century 's worst war criminal . the film has already generated hot debate in the german press , with some critics fearing it could pander to neo-nazis .
" -lrb- ' downfall ' -rrb- prompts the question whether one should be allowed to feel sympathy for hitler , " the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekly wrote . others have taken a more favorable view .

" but i 'm not ashamed of the fact that i could feel sympathy for him during fleeting seconds , " ganz said in berlin . historian fest , who was consulted closely by eichinger during the making of the film , said , " ganz is really hitler : when you look at him you feel a chill down your spine . " in the film , ganz barks out orders far removed from reality - ordering nonexistent units into battle - during the last days in the bunker .
his shaking hand concealed behind his back , he holds hate-filled monologues about the jews , alleged betrayers and victory that is assured in any case . his angry outbursts at the inability of his army to stave off the soviet attack are interspersed with moments of friendliness towards his female staff and towards eva braun , who he marries just a day before their joint suicide . " a real face to the drama " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justus von dohnanyi as general burgdorf , left , and bruno ganz as adolf hitler in the film " downfall " there is little doubt that eichinger is treading controversial ground with his more humane treatment of hitler in a country where displaying nazi emblems is banned and germans are long used to be constantly reminded in movies and books that hitler was the 20th century 's worst war criminal . the film has already generated hot debate in the german press , with some critics fearing it could pander to neo-nazis .
" -lrb- ' downfall ' -rrb- prompts the question whether one should be allowed to feel sympathy for hitler , " the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekly wrote . others have taken a more favorable view .

a new german film captures the madness of his last days and resurrects the führer as never before . he may be the subject of countless books and works around the world , but there is little doubt that no other phase of hitler 's life arouses as much morbid fascination as the final one . housed within the thick walls of his underground bunker in berlin 's wilhelm strasse for the last two months of his life , the nazi leader lived what appears to be an unreal life marked by parties , protocol and grandiose war plans even as the city 's civilian population battled for their lives above the ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juliane köhler -lrb- left -rrb- who plays eva braun , hitler 's lover , bruno ganz as adolf hitler -lrb- center -rrb- and heino ferch as architect albert speer in a scene from " downfall " the bizarre period is now the theme of a startlingly convincing new film by german star producer bernd eichinger .
called " downfall - hitler and the end of the third reich , " the € 13.5 million -lrb- $ 16.3 million -rrb- film , which boasts a star-studded cast , will open in german cinemas on sept .
16 . eichinger and director oliver hirschbiegel drew on a best-selling hitler biography by joachim fest , an award-winning historian , and the memoirs of the late traudl junge , hitler 's last personal secretary . junge 's book , published just days before she died in late 2002 , offers hitherto unknown insights into life in the bunker in the spring of 1945 . last 12 days of hitler 's life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " downfall " the two and a half hour film describes the period from april 20 , hitler 's last birthday , until may 2 , 1945 .
the soviet red army was fighting at the city gates to gain victory over the nazi regime while the führer and his closest followers battled against fear of the third reich 's collapse in their bunker . the film shows hitler on his last birthday as a bent , ashen-faced man holding a garbled speech in the garden of the old imperial chancellory and a rare public kiss with eva braun , his girlfriend , after she insists on staying by his side until the end . though the film is based on historical fact and eyewitness accounts , some scenes and dialogues have been invented . " time is ripe for such a film " what sets the film apart from past attempts at screen portrayals of hitler 's last days is eichinger 's candid depiction of the nazi leader as not just a monster , but a tragic human being , marking a more relaxed approach to germany 's past . " the time is ripe for such a film , " eichinger said during a media screening in berlin this week .
" it 's important not just to shed light on one 's own history superficially , but rather to tell it from within , " he said . eichinger stressed that emotions should be consciously allowed when in coming to terms with hitler from a german perspective .
" if you had overall sympathy for hitler , then the film has failed in its intention .
but to show sympathy in certain moments is , i believe , quite fine , " eichinger said . a more human hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz as hitler in " downfall " veteran swiss actor bruno ganz , who plays hitler in the film , explained that the führer was a person who had earned the least sympathy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.08.2004 italy and libya tackle illegal immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colonel gadhafi continues to fight his long-standing pariah status italian prime minister silvio berlusconi met libyan leader moammar gadhafi on wednesday for talks on stemming the tide of illegal immigrants using the north african country as a transit point . one day earlier , some 275 people trying to enter italy illegally landed on lampedusa , a small island off sicily .
authorities said they believe the ship set sail from a libyan port .
it 's an all-too-familiar scenario .
italian officials estimate some two million people are currently waiting to cross the mediterranean from libya , which attracts a steady flow of illegal immigrants from africa and asia .
to many , italy represents a passageway to the rest of europe .
co-operation needed during his talks with colonel gadhafi , berlusconi stressed the problem was neither libyan nor italian only , but needed the co-operation of both europe and africa . in early august , italy agreed to train libyan police with a long-term view to launching joint air , sea and land patrols .

bayer face munich in the bundesliga on saturday - and maybe in europe in the future . bayer leverkusen entertains bayern munich on saturday in the " play of the day " in the bundesliga with more than just the quest for three points and ultimately a championship title in common . on wednesday , despite losing 2-1 to banik ostrava on the night , leverkusen reached the group stage of the european champions league with a 6-2 aggregate victory and became the third german team to enter the draw on thursday along with their opponents at the weekend and current bundesliga title holders werder bremen . it has been a long road for bayer leverkusen back to the continent 's premier cup competition .
after reaching the 2002 final , where they lost 2-1 to real madrid , the team buckled under the crushing disappointment of losing narrowly out on a domestic league , cup and european treble and a little under 15 months ago were almost relegated to the second division . manager klaus augenthaler has since rebuilt the club and has now guided it back into the champions league with a new-look team stripped of stars such as michael ballack , lucio and ze roberto , all now preparing to meet their former employer on saturday as part of the bayern munich team . insummountable task for czechs in reality , it looked a dead cert that bayer would reach the champions league this year after the initial game against banik ostrava .
it would have taken a monumental effort from the czech side to overcome bayer 's 5-0 first-leg win but this did not stop them attempting it .
banik went ahead seven minutes before half-time after michal papadopulos had slipped the leverkusen defense to put his shot beyond the despairing hans-jörg butt . despite early efforts from dimitar berbatov , leverkusen looked to be coasting through the second leg in the czech republic , with the hard work already achieved in the home leg in germany .
their intent was clear from the start as leverkusen coach klaus augenthaler fielded a young side including only four of the team who so comprehensively eclipsed banik in the bayarena a week before . banik pushes young bayer side the onus was on the home side to push the visitors as they looked for an equally impressive display to overcome the lead leverkusen brought with them .
miroslav matusovic and mario licka worked well to create first half openings for banik but they could not find a way past leverkusen 's butt .
robson ponte also had a decent opportunity to put the czechs ahead but the relatively inexperienced side the germans were fielding continued to stand firm . the breakthrough came on 38 minutes when leverkusen goalkeeper butt failed to cut out a ball on the six-yard box , which was retrieved by mario licka who in turn fed papadopoulos , who found the back of the net . parity gained and lost in minutes it was n't until the 83rd minute that leverkusen achieved parity .
berbatov hauled leverkusen level after banik tried to play the bulgarian striker offside but their appeals were in vain and berbatov slotted home for the equalizer .
but the balance only remained in place for six minutes .
martin cizek 's cross for the home side found an unmarked libor zurek who notched the winner .
zurek , apparently forgetting the still huge deficit and the imminent defeat that faced his side , ripped off his shirt in celebration only to be booked by the referee for his enthusiastic display . but in the end , it was bayer leverkusen who earned the right to party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.08.2004 young germans and their vices großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young smokers are a common sight in germany the traditional german pastimes of boozing and smoking are no longer just the preserve of the working man .
instead they have become the pleasure of an alarming percentage of the nation 's youth . when it comes to alcohol and tobacco consumption , germany is ailing .
with 16.7 million smokers and 1.6 million alcoholics , smoking and drinking have become so embedded in the fabric of society that it is hard to conceive of how younger generations can avoid falling prey to their addictive clutch .
truth is , tens of thousands can not . the staggering climb in both alcohol and tobacco use amongst youth groups was overlooked for too long , and although there are now some measures in place to both correct the damage already done and to prevent its continuation , there is a long way to go in protecting children from these essentially adult vices .
over the past ten years , tobacco consumption among 12-15 year-olds has almost doubled , with some 21 percent of girls and 18 percent of boys in the age group smoking regularly .
for 16-19 year-olds , the figure is 45 percent .
they 're alarming statistics , not least because smoking in germany is not actually legal until the age of 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alcopops but the country is a smokers ' paradise , with cheap cigarettes which kids can buy from machines on street corners and very few restrictions as to where it is or is not acceptable to light up .
in fact , the state of berlin broke new ground this year in implementing a ban on smoking in its schools .
it 's a move which other states are likely to follow , but for the time being children over the age of 16 can smoke in designated areas on school premises provided they present a letter of consent from their parents .
complex issues the biggest question is , if smoking is no more socially acceptable now than it was ten years ago - which it is not - why the massive rise ?
marita völker-albert , press officer for the federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- said the reasons are manifold .
" it 's different for boys and girls .
boys see it as a way of being cool , it makes them feel older and more masculine , whereas girls tend to succumb to peer-pressure and use smoking as a way of staying thin , " völker-albert told dw-world . jörg richert , managing director of karuna , an organization which helps children and young people with potential or existing addiction problems , believes there are more critical factors at play .
" social pressures created by the continual drop in living standards in germany lead to children and young adults not receiving the attention they need . when kids feel their parents are neglecting them , they try to get their attention by taking up smoking or drinking , " richert told dw-world . but he also cites another important issue as the desire of children to grow up against the backdrop of adults trying to stay young . " it is much more difficult for kids to become adults because we wear the same clothes as them , we listen to the same music , go to the same concerts - in short , we steal their identity , " richert said . so much for the reasons behind the trend , but what of the solutions ?
völker-albert believes it is crucial to get the young smokers and drinkers to discuss the potential dangers of what they are doing to their bodies .
" until they start talking to each other , there can be no critical reflection , " she said .
amongst others , the bzga already runs a campaign of sending young people to educate their contemporaries on germany 's beaches . nipping danger in the bud richert welcomes such measures .

truth is , tens of thousands can not . the staggering climb in both alcohol and tobacco use amongst youth groups was overlooked for too long , and although there are now some measures in place to both correct the damage already done and to prevent its continuation , there is a long way to go in protecting children from these essentially adult vices .
over the past ten years , tobacco consumption among 12-15 year-olds has almost doubled , with some 21 percent of girls and 18 percent of boys in the age group smoking regularly .
for 16-19 year-olds , the figure is 45 percent .

in fact , the state of berlin broke new ground this year in implementing a ban on smoking in its schools .
it 's a move which other states are likely to follow , but for the time being children over the age of 16 can smoke in designated areas on school premises provided they present a letter of consent from their parents .
complex issues the biggest question is , if smoking is no more socially acceptable now than it was ten years ago - which it is not - why the massive rise ?
marita völker-albert , press officer for the federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- said the reasons are manifold .
" it 's different for boys and girls .
boys see it as a way of being cool , it makes them feel older and more masculine , whereas girls tend to succumb to peer-pressure and use smoking as a way of staying thin , " völker-albert told dw-world . jörg richert , managing director of karuna , an organization which helps children and young people with potential or existing addiction problems , believes there are more critical factors at play .
" social pressures created by the continual drop in living standards in germany lead to children and young adults not receiving the attention they need . when kids feel their parents are neglecting them , they try to get their attention by taking up smoking or drinking , " richert told dw-world . but he also cites another important issue as the desire of children to grow up against the backdrop of adults trying to stay young . " it is much more difficult for kids to become adults because we wear the same clothes as them , we listen to the same music , go to the same concerts - in short , we steal their identity , " richert said . so much for the reasons behind the trend , but what of the solutions ?
völker-albert believes it is crucial to get the young smokers and drinkers to discuss the potential dangers of what they are doing to their bodies .
" until they start talking to each other , there can be no critical reflection , " she said .
amongst others , the bzga already runs a campaign of sending young people to educate their contemporaries on germany 's beaches . nipping danger in the bud richert welcomes such measures .
as far as he is concerned , the only real way to the heart of the matter is to intervene in a preventative role at a very early stage , not least because of the snowball effect of early tobacco addiction .

boys see it as a way of being cool , it makes them feel older and more masculine , whereas girls tend to succumb to peer-pressure and use smoking as a way of staying thin , " völker-albert told dw-world . jörg richert , managing director of karuna , an organization which helps children and young people with potential or existing addiction problems , believes there are more critical factors at play .
" social pressures created by the continual drop in living standards in germany lead to children and young adults not receiving the attention they need . when kids feel their parents are neglecting them , they try to get their attention by taking up smoking or drinking , " richert told dw-world . but he also cites another important issue as the desire of children to grow up against the backdrop of adults trying to stay young . " it is much more difficult for kids to become adults because we wear the same clothes as them , we listen to the same music , go to the same concerts - in short , we steal their identity , " richert said . so much for the reasons behind the trend , but what of the solutions ?
völker-albert believes it is crucial to get the young smokers and drinkers to discuss the potential dangers of what they are doing to their bodies .
" until they start talking to each other , there can be no critical reflection , " she said .
amongst others , the bzga already runs a campaign of sending young people to educate their contemporaries on germany 's beaches . nipping danger in the bud richert welcomes such measures .
as far as he is concerned , the only real way to the heart of the matter is to intervene in a preventative role at a very early stage , not least because of the snowball effect of early tobacco addiction .
" we now know that people who start smoking at an early age are much more likely to move on to alcohol or other addictive substances , " richert said .

although the consumption of wine and beer among youth groups has tailed off over the past years , the emergence of alcopops has had a truly explosive impact on child and youth drinking habits .
statistics from the bzga show that in 2003 almost 50 percent of young people between the ages of 14-17 were drinking alcopops at least once a month - six times more than in 1998 .
" alcopops even appeal to very young teenagers .
girls used to go out and drink coke , now they drink alcopops instead , but they do n't notice the alcohol .
young people do n't actually like alcohol , but they are seduced into liking it , " völker-albert said .
the crux of the matter last month the government introduced sweeping legislation to put up the tax on these liquor-laced , sickly sweet sodas , increasing the price of a bottle by around € 0.80 -lrb- $ 0.96 -rrb- , but whether it will actually have the desired effect remains to be seen .

instead they have become the pleasure of an alarming percentage of the nation 's youth . when it comes to alcohol and tobacco consumption , germany is ailing .
with 16.7 million smokers and 1.6 million alcoholics , smoking and drinking have become so embedded in the fabric of society that it is hard to conceive of how younger generations can avoid falling prey to their addictive clutch .
truth is , tens of thousands can not . the staggering climb in both alcohol and tobacco use amongst youth groups was overlooked for too long , and although there are now some measures in place to both correct the damage already done and to prevent its continuation , there is a long way to go in protecting children from these essentially adult vices .
over the past ten years , tobacco consumption among 12-15 year-olds has almost doubled , with some 21 percent of girls and 18 percent of boys in the age group smoking regularly .
for 16-19 year-olds , the figure is 45 percent .
they 're alarming statistics , not least because smoking in germany is not actually legal until the age of 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alcopops but the country is a smokers ' paradise , with cheap cigarettes which kids can buy from machines on street corners and very few restrictions as to where it is or is not acceptable to light up .
in fact , the state of berlin broke new ground this year in implementing a ban on smoking in its schools .
it 's a move which other states are likely to follow , but for the time being children over the age of 16 can smoke in designated areas on school premises provided they present a letter of consent from their parents .
complex issues the biggest question is , if smoking is no more socially acceptable now than it was ten years ago - which it is not - why the massive rise ?
marita völker-albert , press officer for the federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- said the reasons are manifold .
" it 's different for boys and girls .
boys see it as a way of being cool , it makes them feel older and more masculine , whereas girls tend to succumb to peer-pressure and use smoking as a way of staying thin , " völker-albert told dw-world . jörg richert , managing director of karuna , an organization which helps children and young people with potential or existing addiction problems , believes there are more critical factors at play .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.08.2004 airlines want state to shoulder terrorism insurance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa warns flights will be grounded if the state does n't step in european insurers are reportedly unwilling to provide cover for terror-related risks in aviation policies , prompting airlines like germany 's lufthansa to urge governments to pay for terror insurance . just as the aviation industry begins to recover from the effects of terrorism , sars and a sluggish world economy over the past few years , airlines are bracing for yet another blow .
major european reinsurance companies apparently want to drop certain terrorism-related risks from aviation policies . german daily financial times deutschland reported on wednesday that several european reinsurers starting 2005 want to explicitly rule out liability in the event of attacks with nuclear , chemical and biological weapons .
they include attacks with so-called " dirty bombs " containing radioactive or other hazardous materials being detonated aboard planes or at airports . " incalculable costs " the paper said that the magnitude of claims that could result from such an attack are simply too immense for the insurance industry . " we do n't want to insure such risks any more , they 're simply incalculable , " a spokeswoman for münchener rück , the world 's largest reinsurance company told news agency ap . german insurance , banking and asset management giant allianz said it had no definite commitment to cover terrorism risks in the future . the report also said that aviation underwriters in london , which lead the insurance of most of the world 's major airlines , had already drafted a new clause earlier this year that excludes such terror risks from their standard policies , but allowed them to be written back for an extra premium . lufthansa wants governments to step in the news has rattled major european airliners , who are obliged by law and international agreements to provide insurance cover for passengers and may not fly without insurance . german national carrier lufthansa and other european airliners are now pushing for eu governments to take over liability for damages resulting from terrorism and indemnify their airlines against such an attack . lufthansa 's insurance head ralf oelssner painted a drastic scenario , saying that the reinsurance industry 's move could mean that airliners would have to ground their fleets if governments did n't step in to provide cover for ininsurable aviation risks .
" without a state guarantee , there is a possibility that air traffic will have to be discontinued if the insurers cancel their terrorism cover , as announced , " oelssner told financial times deutschland . lufthansa has since played down fears it would have to stop its flights .
" practically , it 's rather absurd .
the airplanes wo n't stay on the ground , " thomas ellerbeck spokesman for lufthansa told reuters , adding the airline was confident a workable agreement could be found in talks with governments , insurers and the european union . " if there is no private-sector solution for european airlines , it will have to come down to a state guarantee for this particular risk , " ellerbeck said .
" this is also about fair competition across the north atlantic . "
in the us , the government already provides terrorism insurance and will do so until 2008 . " terrorism is a question of security and for us it 's a question of national security , not aviation security , " a spokeswoman for the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- , a geneva-based airlines trade association representing over 98 percent of scheduled international traffic , told reuters .
" governments should be taking on the cost burden of these activities … it 's a matter of protecting their citizens , " she said . european governments did temporarily take over terrorism insurance in the aftermath of the sept .

bayer face munich in the bundesliga on saturday - and maybe in europe in the future . bayer leverkusen entertains bayern munich on saturday in the " play of the day " in the bundesliga with more than just the quest for three points and ultimately a championship title in common . on wednesday , despite losing 2-1 to banik ostrava on the night , leverkusen reached the group stage of the european champions league with a 6-2 aggregate victory and became the third german team to enter the draw on thursday along with their opponents at the weekend and current bundesliga title holders werder bremen . it has been a long road for bayer leverkusen back to the continent 's premier cup competition .
after reaching the 2002 final , where they lost 2-1 to real madrid , the team buckled under the crushing disappointment of losing narrowly out on a domestic league , cup and european treble and a little under 15 months ago were almost relegated to the second division . manager klaus augenthaler has since rebuilt the club and has now guided it back into the champions league with a new-look team stripped of stars such as michael ballack , lucio and ze roberto , all now preparing to meet their former employer on saturday as part of the bayern munich team . insummountable task for czechs in reality , it looked a dead cert that bayer would reach the champions league this year after the initial game against banik ostrava .
it would have taken a monumental effort from the czech side to overcome bayer 's 5-0 first-leg win but this did not stop them attempting it .
banik went ahead seven minutes before half-time after michal papadopulos had slipped the leverkusen defense to put his shot beyond the despairing hans-jörg butt . despite early efforts from dimitar berbatov , leverkusen looked to be coasting through the second leg in the czech republic , with the hard work already achieved in the home leg in germany .
their intent was clear from the start as leverkusen coach klaus augenthaler fielded a young side including only four of the team who so comprehensively eclipsed banik in the bayarena a week before . banik pushes young bayer side the onus was on the home side to push the visitors as they looked for an equally impressive display to overcome the lead leverkusen brought with them .
miroslav matusovic and mario licka worked well to create first half openings for banik but they could not find a way past leverkusen 's butt .
robson ponte also had a decent opportunity to put the czechs ahead but the relatively inexperienced side the germans were fielding continued to stand firm . the breakthrough came on 38 minutes when leverkusen goalkeeper butt failed to cut out a ball on the six-yard box , which was retrieved by mario licka who in turn fed papadopoulos , who found the back of the net . parity gained and lost in minutes it was n't until the 83rd minute that leverkusen achieved parity .
berbatov hauled leverkusen level after banik tried to play the bulgarian striker offside but their appeals were in vain and berbatov slotted home for the equalizer .
but the balance only remained in place for six minutes .
martin cizek 's cross for the home side found an unmarked libor zurek who notched the winner .
zurek , apparently forgetting the still huge deficit and the imminent defeat that faced his side , ripped off his shirt in celebration only to be booked by the referee for his enthusiastic display . but in the end , it was bayer leverkusen who earned the right to party .

authorities said they believe the ship set sail from a libyan port .
it 's an all-too-familiar scenario .
italian officials estimate some two million people are currently waiting to cross the mediterranean from libya , which attracts a steady flow of illegal immigrants from africa and asia .
to many , italy represents a passageway to the rest of europe .
co-operation needed during his talks with colonel gadhafi , berlusconi stressed the problem was neither libyan nor italian only , but needed the co-operation of both europe and africa . in early august , italy agreed to train libyan police with a long-term view to launching joint air , sea and land patrols .
italy also recently called on the eu to help in the effort to battle illegal immigration by relaxing the embargo against libya so that it could buy military equipment to help clamp down on the problem of human smuggling by increasing patrols along its borders . gadhafi 's rehabilitation gadhafi , a pariah for much of his 34-year rule because of his links to international terrorism , has won back much credibility after announcing in 2003 that he would abandon the pursuit of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons . berlusconi was the first western leader to meet gadhafi after the announcement .
since then , the leader has undergone a surprise rehabilitation among countries that cold-shouldered his government for years , welcoming british prime minister tony blair in march this year and embarking on an historic visit to brussels several weeks later .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 26.08.2004 leverkusen 's european win spices up bayern clash großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimitar berbatov , right , leveled for leverkusen against banik ostrava bayer leverkusen became the third german team in the european champions league on wednesday , joining bayern munich and werder bremen .
bayer face munich in the bundesliga on saturday - and maybe in europe in the future . bayer leverkusen entertains bayern munich on saturday in the " play of the day " in the bundesliga with more than just the quest for three points and ultimately a championship title in common . on wednesday , despite losing 2-1 to banik ostrava on the night , leverkusen reached the group stage of the european champions league with a 6-2 aggregate victory and became the third german team to enter the draw on thursday along with their opponents at the weekend and current bundesliga title holders werder bremen . it has been a long road for bayer leverkusen back to the continent 's premier cup competition .
after reaching the 2002 final , where they lost 2-1 to real madrid , the team buckled under the crushing disappointment of losing narrowly out on a domestic league , cup and european treble and a little under 15 months ago were almost relegated to the second division . manager klaus augenthaler has since rebuilt the club and has now guided it back into the champions league with a new-look team stripped of stars such as michael ballack , lucio and ze roberto , all now preparing to meet their former employer on saturday as part of the bayern munich team . insummountable task for czechs in reality , it looked a dead cert that bayer would reach the champions league this year after the initial game against banik ostrava .
it would have taken a monumental effort from the czech side to overcome bayer 's 5-0 first-leg win but this did not stop them attempting it .
banik went ahead seven minutes before half-time after michal papadopulos had slipped the leverkusen defense to put his shot beyond the despairing hans-jörg butt . despite early efforts from dimitar berbatov , leverkusen looked to be coasting through the second leg in the czech republic , with the hard work already achieved in the home leg in germany .
their intent was clear from the start as leverkusen coach klaus augenthaler fielded a young side including only four of the team who so comprehensively eclipsed banik in the bayarena a week before . banik pushes young bayer side the onus was on the home side to push the visitors as they looked for an equally impressive display to overcome the lead leverkusen brought with them .
miroslav matusovic and mario licka worked well to create first half openings for banik but they could not find a way past leverkusen 's butt .
robson ponte also had a decent opportunity to put the czechs ahead but the relatively inexperienced side the germans were fielding continued to stand firm . the breakthrough came on 38 minutes when leverkusen goalkeeper butt failed to cut out a ball on the six-yard box , which was retrieved by mario licka who in turn fed papadopoulos , who found the back of the net . parity gained and lost in minutes it was n't until the 83rd minute that leverkusen achieved parity .
berbatov hauled leverkusen level after banik tried to play the bulgarian striker offside but their appeals were in vain and berbatov slotted home for the equalizer .
but the balance only remained in place for six minutes .
martin cizek 's cross for the home side found an unmarked libor zurek who notched the winner .
zurek , apparently forgetting the still huge deficit and the imminent defeat that faced his side , ripped off his shirt in celebration only to be booked by the referee for his enthusiastic display . but in the end , it was bayer leverkusen who earned the right to party .
a loss on the night could not take the shine off an overall performance that saw the team return to the upper echelons of european cup competition . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen set the pace for week three reigning champions werder bremen are the team to beat at this early stage of the season with two wins from two games .

but apart from a successful egovernment project in bremen , germany still lags behind on an eu level . getting your own birth certificate in germany usually entails a bureaucratic nightmare lasting several weeks .
but a new high-tech project in bremen has reduced the process to literally a couple of clicks . all you have to do is order the certificate online from the registry office , you even sign the form right away on your computer .
within a couple of days , the certificate will be in the mail . kerstin sprock who works for a private company that maintains online services for the city of bremen is proud that the city leads the way when it comes to egovernment in germany . " we realized very early that it 's not just about information , but people also want to accomplish things .
and bremen stands out in the field , it has over 100 services that citizens can sign for with an electronic signature , " sprock told dw-radio . whether it 's informing authorities about a change in address , applying for a car license plate or filling out a form for dog taxes , it 's all possible via the internet in bremen , 24 hours a day and without spending time in long waiting lines at offices . electronic signature the show stealer the chief attraction is the electronic signature which works a bit like withdrawing money from a cash machine .
the user needs a chip card , an own scanner and a secret code . sprock says security is the main priority .
" according to current technology , the electronic signature ca n't be cracked , " she said .
" actually , the biggest security risk is at offices , in families and among friends .
but one needs to go to great criminal lengths to even get close technologically to such a signature . " but there remains little doubt that the electronic signature is n't foolproof .
security concerns over egovernment and other online services involving personal data have driven the european commission - which is pushing eu governments to make their bureaucracy more efficient , high-tech and user-friendly - to set up a european agency for network and information security called enisa .
its chief aim is to ensure that data protection guidelines are obeyed and that security standards of computers are constantly upgraded . bremen still has n't witnessed any misuse of its electronic signature , but then few citizens of the northern german city have been making use of the online services .
one of the chief reasons is that the card scanner and the chip card cost citizens around € 50 a year . but sprock said the project was still a success among corporate users .
" several people from business and industry have told us that they usually have an own office to deal with bureaucracy - now , naturally they can do away with it and save money . " germany lags behind the egovernment project is underway in bremen , esslingen and nuremberg .
the three cities are supported by the german government with funds and know-how with the framework of a pilot project .
but it 's clear that bremen is the trailblazer .
last year , it even won an award for its egovernment project from the european commission . but , apart from the cities involved in the online pilot project , the rest of germany 's cities and towns remain far behind on the information highway .
though citizens can download official forms on the internet almost everywhere , they still have to sign them by hand and then take the application to an office or at least to a mailbox . that makes germany a bit of a laggard on the european level when it comes to egovernment .
leading the way are the scandinavian countries where on an average , citizens can accomplish over 80 percent of official services sitting at their computers within the comfort of their homes .
as compared to that , germans can wrap up just about 50 percent of official services at home , taking it to third place in europe and only slightly better than belgium and luxembourg . despite the rising popularity and simplicity of egovernment , kerstin sprock does n't believe they 'll ever completely replace government officials .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.08.2004 wagner in weimar großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner wants to see weimar emerge from the shadow of its past nike wagner , great-great granddaughter of franz liszt and great granddaughter of richard wagner , has taken the helm of germany 's weimar arts festival until 2006 .
deutsche welle met up with the new director . since weimar 's glory days as european city of culture in 1999 , johann wolfgang von goethe 's home town has been struggling to maintain the international flair it gained five years ago . but now there 's a new girl in town - and she means business . under nike wagner , once tipped as a possible new director of the bayreuth festival but pipped at the post by her younger cousin katharina , the 2004 weimar arts festival marks a new departure for a city that 's trying hard to shake off its conservative image .
the revamped event has been hailed as a forum for contemporary arts , including music , art , literature and dance . the weimar mythology in a city as steeped in history as weimar , the task of re-energizing the local arts festival while upholding the city 's formidable legacy is far from an easy one .
but wagner stresses that the city 's unique past is what makes her post so challenging . " weimar has always had a certain mythology for me , " she says .
" i 'm west german through and through , but when i studied german at university , weimar really captured my imagination . " vokhard knigge , director of the weimar klassik foundation which organizes the festival , described her appointment as an " extraordinary opportunity . "
when the former culture minister in the hamburg regional government agreed to take over , a funding crisis meant it was n't even certain the event had a future .
and wagner admitted she had her work cut out for her .
" my generation never gave any thought to the eastern half of germany , which is something i deeply regret , " she says .
" but i was thrilled when i was asked to take over the festival . "
last but not liszt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe und schiller in weimar : gone but not forgotten in the past , the festival has highlighted the city 's literary heritage .
not only home to goethe and schiller , weimar 's other famous sons include herder and nietzsche .
but this year , wagner - not one to shy away from controversy - has chosen to highlight the hungarian composer franz lizst , who spent several decades in the city and who also happens to be her great , great grandfather . " this city is more or less off the beaten tourist track , and i wanted to find a way of making it more attractive , " she explains .
" i felt that music did this more than literature , so i decided to organize a music festival - and who do i come across ?
franz lizst . " moreover , wagner renamed the new-look festival pèlerinage , a title inspired by liszt 's piano cycle " années de pèlerinage " .
the pilgrimage theme is central to this year 's event , which has " heimweh " -lrb- homesickness -rrb- as its motto . " to me , art is something that has nothing to do with anything stationary , " wagner says .
" art is restless , it 's always looking for new departures , new shores , new utopias . " in 2004 , the increased post-enlargement east european presence at the festival gives this theme added relevance .
" nietzsche 's philosophy , for example , described the status and sensibility of new-age man as nomadic , " points out wagner .
" that 's the trademark of the modern age - in a philosophical sense , we no longer have a home . " commemorating the past this year 's festival also features plenty of modern music , including work by béla bartok and contemporary composers such as györgy kurtág , steffen schleiermacher and heiner goebbels .
wagner is aware that her detractors might find her program a little too challenging for classicist weimar .
but she firmly believes that the festival 's juxtaposition of old and new can only be good for a city whose history is both a boon and a burden . " modernist movements tended to fail here , they were often banished , " she observes .
" take the bauhaus artists , who left to go to dessau .
modernist movements have always been given a hard time in weimar , but it has to be pointed out that no other city needs modernism more than this one . " " it has a surplus of everything else , " she adds .
" its museum collections and archives are phenomenal , and obviously , they need to be preserved very carefully .
but you have to get around traditions , you have to see them as a challenge ! " another of her innovations has been to usher in a new tradition : every year the weimar festival will open with a concert in memory of buchenwald , the nearby nazi concentration camp . " it 's a memorial concert , but it wo n't be held in buchenwald , which would exploit the horrific past of the location , " she stresses .

but implementation promises to be far from easy . the new regulations , adopted by the european commission in july and which came into effect on monday this week , are meant to revive trade ties between the turkish and cypriot part of the divided island .
trading between the two sides came to a standstill following the division of cyprus in 1974 and has been non-existent until now . according to the eu regulations , turkish entrepreneurs in the northern part of the island can for the first time sell their products in the greek south .
from there the goods can also be exported to other eu countries without further checks and bureaucratic hurdles . the rules dictate that the goods have to comply with eu standards on food safety and plant health .
further , the turkish cypriot chamber of commerce will have to ensure that products must actually originate from northern cyprus and not turkey . the move is part of an eu package to rebuild the north 's economy and end the isolation of turkish cypriots after they voted in favour of reunification of the island in an april referendum .
however greek cypriots rejected the peace plan , allowing only the greek part of the island to join the european union . rules not free of hurdles but despite the good intentions , implementing the trade regulation will turn out to be tougher than it appears on paper . for one , all animal and agricultural products - goods with probably the most significant export potential - are excluded from the regulation as are goods originating from turkey . this week just a day after the regulation came into effect , greek cypriots sent back a turkish truckload of fish , which fell foul of the law . adrian van der meer , the eu 's representative in cyprus said the rejection of the fish by greek cypriot veterinary authorities was a regrettable necessity . " from a legal point of view the certificate of origin issued was correct because the fish originated in the northern part of cyprus , but the second clause says that no animal produce is allowed to cross , and we take a zero tolerance on this , " he told reuters . mutual trust needed in addition , turkish cypriot businessmen need a greek cypriot partner who will buy their products and sell them .
given the island 's division and troubled past , few believe it will be an easy task . " goods , whose origin is difficult to conceal such as consumer goods , will be difficult to sell in the south , " heinz kramer , cyprus expert at the science and politics foundation told dw-world . it also seems likely that greek cypriot businessmen would watch out for their interests and be wary of opening the door to possible competitors from the other end of the island . kramer said building materials and textile products count among the few goods that have a chance of being sold in the southern market .
" it will probably hardly interest anyone where his bricks are coming from , " kramer said . symbolism rather than real benefits as far as economic benefits go , hardly anyone expects the regulation to have a major impact .
flourishing trade between the two parts of the island remains an unrealistic hope . " i believe that the move is highly politically symbolic , one that 's meant to show that the north should n't be isolated .
but , its economic significance is very minimal , " kramer said . a real breakthrough in trade relations between the two parts of the divided island might instead come from a proposal that 's currently making the rounds in the eu council of ministers .
according to it , turkish cypriot products will be directly exported to the eu without a diversion via the southern greek cypriot part of the island . but it remains unclear whether the proposal will actually see the light of day .
greece and new eu member cyprus , which represents the greek part of the island , have already indicated that they are against full free trade for the north . michael knigge -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cyprus celebrates a dubious birthday thirty years after turkey invaded it , cyprus remains a divided island .

further , the turkish cypriot chamber of commerce will have to ensure that products must actually originate from northern cyprus and not turkey . the move is part of an eu package to rebuild the north 's economy and end the isolation of turkish cypriots after they voted in favour of reunification of the island in an april referendum .
however greek cypriots rejected the peace plan , allowing only the greek part of the island to join the european union . rules not free of hurdles but despite the good intentions , implementing the trade regulation will turn out to be tougher than it appears on paper . for one , all animal and agricultural products - goods with probably the most significant export potential - are excluded from the regulation as are goods originating from turkey . this week just a day after the regulation came into effect , greek cypriots sent back a turkish truckload of fish , which fell foul of the law . adrian van der meer , the eu 's representative in cyprus said the rejection of the fish by greek cypriot veterinary authorities was a regrettable necessity . " from a legal point of view the certificate of origin issued was correct because the fish originated in the northern part of cyprus , but the second clause says that no animal produce is allowed to cross , and we take a zero tolerance on this , " he told reuters . mutual trust needed in addition , turkish cypriot businessmen need a greek cypriot partner who will buy their products and sell them .
given the island 's division and troubled past , few believe it will be an easy task . " goods , whose origin is difficult to conceal such as consumer goods , will be difficult to sell in the south , " heinz kramer , cyprus expert at the science and politics foundation told dw-world . it also seems likely that greek cypriot businessmen would watch out for their interests and be wary of opening the door to possible competitors from the other end of the island . kramer said building materials and textile products count among the few goods that have a chance of being sold in the southern market .
" it will probably hardly interest anyone where his bricks are coming from , " kramer said . symbolism rather than real benefits as far as economic benefits go , hardly anyone expects the regulation to have a major impact .
flourishing trade between the two parts of the island remains an unrealistic hope . " i believe that the move is highly politically symbolic , one that 's meant to show that the north should n't be isolated .
but , its economic significance is very minimal , " kramer said . a real breakthrough in trade relations between the two parts of the divided island might instead come from a proposal that 's currently making the rounds in the eu council of ministers .
according to it , turkish cypriot products will be directly exported to the eu without a diversion via the southern greek cypriot part of the island . but it remains unclear whether the proposal will actually see the light of day .
greece and new eu member cyprus , which represents the greek part of the island , have already indicated that they are against full free trade for the north . michael knigge -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cyprus celebrates a dubious birthday thirty years after turkey invaded it , cyprus remains a divided island .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.08.2004 german egovernment initiative off to a slow start großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this should be the future when it comes to dealing with bureacracy the eu would like its citizens to use personal computers to do taxes and complete bureacratic formalities .
but apart from a successful egovernment project in bremen , germany still lags behind on an eu level . getting your own birth certificate in germany usually entails a bureaucratic nightmare lasting several weeks .
but a new high-tech project in bremen has reduced the process to literally a couple of clicks . all you have to do is order the certificate online from the registry office , you even sign the form right away on your computer .
within a couple of days , the certificate will be in the mail . kerstin sprock who works for a private company that maintains online services for the city of bremen is proud that the city leads the way when it comes to egovernment in germany . " we realized very early that it 's not just about information , but people also want to accomplish things .
and bremen stands out in the field , it has over 100 services that citizens can sign for with an electronic signature , " sprock told dw-radio . whether it 's informing authorities about a change in address , applying for a car license plate or filling out a form for dog taxes , it 's all possible via the internet in bremen , 24 hours a day and without spending time in long waiting lines at offices . electronic signature the show stealer the chief attraction is the electronic signature which works a bit like withdrawing money from a cash machine .
the user needs a chip card , an own scanner and a secret code . sprock says security is the main priority .
" according to current technology , the electronic signature ca n't be cracked , " she said .
" actually , the biggest security risk is at offices , in families and among friends .
but one needs to go to great criminal lengths to even get close technologically to such a signature . " but there remains little doubt that the electronic signature is n't foolproof .
security concerns over egovernment and other online services involving personal data have driven the european commission - which is pushing eu governments to make their bureaucracy more efficient , high-tech and user-friendly - to set up a european agency for network and information security called enisa .
its chief aim is to ensure that data protection guidelines are obeyed and that security standards of computers are constantly upgraded . bremen still has n't witnessed any misuse of its electronic signature , but then few citizens of the northern german city have been making use of the online services .
one of the chief reasons is that the card scanner and the chip card cost citizens around € 50 a year . but sprock said the project was still a success among corporate users .
" several people from business and industry have told us that they usually have an own office to deal with bureaucracy - now , naturally they can do away with it and save money . " germany lags behind the egovernment project is underway in bremen , esslingen and nuremberg .
the three cities are supported by the german government with funds and know-how with the framework of a pilot project .
but it 's clear that bremen is the trailblazer .
last year , it even won an award for its egovernment project from the european commission . but , apart from the cities involved in the online pilot project , the rest of germany 's cities and towns remain far behind on the information highway .
though citizens can download official forms on the internet almost everywhere , they still have to sign them by hand and then take the application to an office or at least to a mailbox . that makes germany a bit of a laggard on the european level when it comes to egovernment .
leading the way are the scandinavian countries where on an average , citizens can accomplish over 80 percent of official services sitting at their computers within the comfort of their homes .
as compared to that , germans can wrap up just about 50 percent of official services at home , taking it to third place in europe and only slightly better than belgium and luxembourg . despite the rising popularity and simplicity of egovernment , kerstin sprock does n't believe they 'll ever completely replace government officials . " for instance marriage : that 's the most beautiful day of your life - who would want to spend it in front of the computer ? " irene haider -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany celebrates 20 years of e-mail when a group of computer scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent germany 's first e-mail 20 years ago , they had no idea they were heralding in the digital age .

bayer face munich in the bundesliga on saturday - and maybe in europe in the future . bayer leverkusen entertains bayern munich on saturday in the " play of the day " in the bundesliga with more than just the quest for three points and ultimately a championship title in common . on wednesday , despite losing 2-1 to banik ostrava on the night , leverkusen reached the group stage of the european champions league with a 6-2 aggregate victory and became the third german team to enter the draw on thursday along with their opponents at the weekend and current bundesliga title holders werder bremen . it has been a long road for bayer leverkusen back to the continent 's premier cup competition .
after reaching the 2002 final , where they lost 2-1 to real madrid , the team buckled under the crushing disappointment of losing narrowly out on a domestic league , cup and european treble and a little under 15 months ago were almost relegated to the second division . manager klaus augenthaler has since rebuilt the club and has now guided it back into the champions league with a new-look team stripped of stars such as michael ballack , lucio and ze roberto , all now preparing to meet their former employer on saturday as part of the bayern munich team . insummountable task for czechs in reality , it looked a dead cert that bayer would reach the champions league this year after the initial game against banik ostrava .
it would have taken a monumental effort from the czech side to overcome bayer 's 5-0 first-leg win but this did not stop them attempting it .
banik went ahead seven minutes before half-time after michal papadopulos had slipped the leverkusen defense to put his shot beyond the despairing hans-jörg butt . despite early efforts from dimitar berbatov , leverkusen looked to be coasting through the second leg in the czech republic , with the hard work already achieved in the home leg in germany .
their intent was clear from the start as leverkusen coach klaus augenthaler fielded a young side including only four of the team who so comprehensively eclipsed banik in the bayarena a week before . banik pushes young bayer side the onus was on the home side to push the visitors as they looked for an equally impressive display to overcome the lead leverkusen brought with them .
miroslav matusovic and mario licka worked well to create first half openings for banik but they could not find a way past leverkusen 's butt .
robson ponte also had a decent opportunity to put the czechs ahead but the relatively inexperienced side the germans were fielding continued to stand firm . the breakthrough came on 38 minutes when leverkusen goalkeeper butt failed to cut out a ball on the six-yard box , which was retrieved by mario licka who in turn fed papadopoulos , who found the back of the net . parity gained and lost in minutes it was n't until the 83rd minute that leverkusen achieved parity .
berbatov hauled leverkusen level after banik tried to play the bulgarian striker offside but their appeals were in vain and berbatov slotted home for the equalizer .
but the balance only remained in place for six minutes .
martin cizek 's cross for the home side found an unmarked libor zurek who notched the winner .
zurek , apparently forgetting the still huge deficit and the imminent defeat that faced his side , ripped off his shirt in celebration only to be booked by the referee for his enthusiastic display . but in the end , it was bayer leverkusen who earned the right to party .
a loss on the night could not take the shine off an overall performance that saw the team return to the upper echelons of european cup competition . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen set the pace for week three reigning champions werder bremen are the team to beat at this early stage of the season with two wins from two games .

deutsche welle met up with the new director . since weimar 's glory days as european city of culture in 1999 , johann wolfgang von goethe 's home town has been struggling to maintain the international flair it gained five years ago . but now there 's a new girl in town - and she means business . under nike wagner , once tipped as a possible new director of the bayreuth festival but pipped at the post by her younger cousin katharina , the 2004 weimar arts festival marks a new departure for a city that 's trying hard to shake off its conservative image .
the revamped event has been hailed as a forum for contemporary arts , including music , art , literature and dance . the weimar mythology in a city as steeped in history as weimar , the task of re-energizing the local arts festival while upholding the city 's formidable legacy is far from an easy one .
but wagner stresses that the city 's unique past is what makes her post so challenging . " weimar has always had a certain mythology for me , " she says .
" i 'm west german through and through , but when i studied german at university , weimar really captured my imagination . " vokhard knigge , director of the weimar klassik foundation which organizes the festival , described her appointment as an " extraordinary opportunity . "
when the former culture minister in the hamburg regional government agreed to take over , a funding crisis meant it was n't even certain the event had a future .
and wagner admitted she had her work cut out for her .
" my generation never gave any thought to the eastern half of germany , which is something i deeply regret , " she says .
" but i was thrilled when i was asked to take over the festival . "
last but not liszt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe und schiller in weimar : gone but not forgotten in the past , the festival has highlighted the city 's literary heritage .
not only home to goethe and schiller , weimar 's other famous sons include herder and nietzsche .
but this year , wagner - not one to shy away from controversy - has chosen to highlight the hungarian composer franz lizst , who spent several decades in the city and who also happens to be her great , great grandfather . " this city is more or less off the beaten tourist track , and i wanted to find a way of making it more attractive , " she explains .
" i felt that music did this more than literature , so i decided to organize a music festival - and who do i come across ?
franz lizst . " moreover , wagner renamed the new-look festival pèlerinage , a title inspired by liszt 's piano cycle " années de pèlerinage " .
the pilgrimage theme is central to this year 's event , which has " heimweh " -lrb- homesickness -rrb- as its motto . " to me , art is something that has nothing to do with anything stationary , " wagner says .
" art is restless , it 's always looking for new departures , new shores , new utopias . " in 2004 , the increased post-enlargement east european presence at the festival gives this theme added relevance .
" nietzsche 's philosophy , for example , described the status and sensibility of new-age man as nomadic , " points out wagner .
" that 's the trademark of the modern age - in a philosophical sense , we no longer have a home . " commemorating the past this year 's festival also features plenty of modern music , including work by béla bartok and contemporary composers such as györgy kurtág , steffen schleiermacher and heiner goebbels .
wagner is aware that her detractors might find her program a little too challenging for classicist weimar .
but she firmly believes that the festival 's juxtaposition of old and new can only be good for a city whose history is both a boon and a burden . " modernist movements tended to fail here , they were often banished , " she observes .
" take the bauhaus artists , who left to go to dessau .
modernist movements have always been given a hard time in weimar , but it has to be pointed out that no other city needs modernism more than this one . " " it has a surplus of everything else , " she adds .
" its museum collections and archives are phenomenal , and obviously , they need to be preserved very carefully .
but you have to get around traditions , you have to see them as a challenge ! " another of her innovations has been to usher in a new tradition : every year the weimar festival will open with a concert in memory of buchenwald , the nearby nazi concentration camp . " it 's a memorial concert , but it wo n't be held in buchenwald , which would exploit the horrific past of the location , " she stresses .

but implementation promises to be far from easy . the new regulations , adopted by the european commission in july and which came into effect on monday this week , are meant to revive trade ties between the turkish and cypriot part of the divided island .
trading between the two sides came to a standstill following the division of cyprus in 1974 and has been non-existent until now . according to the eu regulations , turkish entrepreneurs in the northern part of the island can for the first time sell their products in the greek south .
from there the goods can also be exported to other eu countries without further checks and bureaucratic hurdles . the rules dictate that the goods have to comply with eu standards on food safety and plant health .
further , the turkish cypriot chamber of commerce will have to ensure that products must actually originate from northern cyprus and not turkey . the move is part of an eu package to rebuild the north 's economy and end the isolation of turkish cypriots after they voted in favour of reunification of the island in an april referendum .
however greek cypriots rejected the peace plan , allowing only the greek part of the island to join the european union . rules not free of hurdles but despite the good intentions , implementing the trade regulation will turn out to be tougher than it appears on paper . for one , all animal and agricultural products - goods with probably the most significant export potential - are excluded from the regulation as are goods originating from turkey . this week just a day after the regulation came into effect , greek cypriots sent back a turkish truckload of fish , which fell foul of the law . adrian van der meer , the eu 's representative in cyprus said the rejection of the fish by greek cypriot veterinary authorities was a regrettable necessity . " from a legal point of view the certificate of origin issued was correct because the fish originated in the northern part of cyprus , but the second clause says that no animal produce is allowed to cross , and we take a zero tolerance on this , " he told reuters . mutual trust needed in addition , turkish cypriot businessmen need a greek cypriot partner who will buy their products and sell them .
given the island 's division and troubled past , few believe it will be an easy task . " goods , whose origin is difficult to conceal such as consumer goods , will be difficult to sell in the south , " heinz kramer , cyprus expert at the science and politics foundation told dw-world . it also seems likely that greek cypriot businessmen would watch out for their interests and be wary of opening the door to possible competitors from the other end of the island . kramer said building materials and textile products count among the few goods that have a chance of being sold in the southern market .
" it will probably hardly interest anyone where his bricks are coming from , " kramer said . symbolism rather than real benefits as far as economic benefits go , hardly anyone expects the regulation to have a major impact .
flourishing trade between the two parts of the island remains an unrealistic hope . " i believe that the move is highly politically symbolic , one that 's meant to show that the north should n't be isolated .
but , its economic significance is very minimal , " kramer said . a real breakthrough in trade relations between the two parts of the divided island might instead come from a proposal that 's currently making the rounds in the eu council of ministers .
according to it , turkish cypriot products will be directly exported to the eu without a diversion via the southern greek cypriot part of the island . but it remains unclear whether the proposal will actually see the light of day .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.08.2004 german egovernment initiative off to a slow start großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this should be the future when it comes to dealing with bureacracy the eu would like its citizens to use personal computers to do taxes and complete bureacratic formalities .
but apart from a successful egovernment project in bremen , germany still lags behind on an eu level . getting your own birth certificate in germany usually entails a bureaucratic nightmare lasting several weeks .
but a new high-tech project in bremen has reduced the process to literally a couple of clicks . all you have to do is order the certificate online from the registry office , you even sign the form right away on your computer .
within a couple of days , the certificate will be in the mail . kerstin sprock who works for a private company that maintains online services for the city of bremen is proud that the city leads the way when it comes to egovernment in germany . " we realized very early that it 's not just about information , but people also want to accomplish things .
and bremen stands out in the field , it has over 100 services that citizens can sign for with an electronic signature , " sprock told dw-radio . whether it 's informing authorities about a change in address , applying for a car license plate or filling out a form for dog taxes , it 's all possible via the internet in bremen , 24 hours a day and without spending time in long waiting lines at offices . electronic signature the show stealer the chief attraction is the electronic signature which works a bit like withdrawing money from a cash machine .
the user needs a chip card , an own scanner and a secret code . sprock says security is the main priority .
" according to current technology , the electronic signature ca n't be cracked , " she said .
" actually , the biggest security risk is at offices , in families and among friends .
but one needs to go to great criminal lengths to even get close technologically to such a signature . " but there remains little doubt that the electronic signature is n't foolproof .
security concerns over egovernment and other online services involving personal data have driven the european commission - which is pushing eu governments to make their bureaucracy more efficient , high-tech and user-friendly - to set up a european agency for network and information security called enisa .
its chief aim is to ensure that data protection guidelines are obeyed and that security standards of computers are constantly upgraded . bremen still has n't witnessed any misuse of its electronic signature , but then few citizens of the northern german city have been making use of the online services .
one of the chief reasons is that the card scanner and the chip card cost citizens around € 50 a year . but sprock said the project was still a success among corporate users .
" several people from business and industry have told us that they usually have an own office to deal with bureaucracy - now , naturally they can do away with it and save money . " germany lags behind the egovernment project is underway in bremen , esslingen and nuremberg .
the three cities are supported by the german government with funds and know-how with the framework of a pilot project .
but it 's clear that bremen is the trailblazer .
last year , it even won an award for its egovernment project from the european commission . but , apart from the cities involved in the online pilot project , the rest of germany 's cities and towns remain far behind on the information highway .
though citizens can download official forms on the internet almost everywhere , they still have to sign them by hand and then take the application to an office or at least to a mailbox . that makes germany a bit of a laggard on the european level when it comes to egovernment .
leading the way are the scandinavian countries where on an average , citizens can accomplish over 80 percent of official services sitting at their computers within the comfort of their homes .
as compared to that , germans can wrap up just about 50 percent of official services at home , taking it to third place in europe and only slightly better than belgium and luxembourg . despite the rising popularity and simplicity of egovernment , kerstin sprock does n't believe they 'll ever completely replace government officials . " for instance marriage : that 's the most beautiful day of your life - who would want to spend it in front of the computer ?

but implementation promises to be far from easy . the new regulations , adopted by the european commission in july and which came into effect on monday this week , are meant to revive trade ties between the turkish and cypriot part of the divided island .
trading between the two sides came to a standstill following the division of cyprus in 1974 and has been non-existent until now . according to the eu regulations , turkish entrepreneurs in the northern part of the island can for the first time sell their products in the greek south .
from there the goods can also be exported to other eu countries without further checks and bureaucratic hurdles . the rules dictate that the goods have to comply with eu standards on food safety and plant health .
further , the turkish cypriot chamber of commerce will have to ensure that products must actually originate from northern cyprus and not turkey . the move is part of an eu package to rebuild the north 's economy and end the isolation of turkish cypriots after they voted in favour of reunification of the island in an april referendum .
however greek cypriots rejected the peace plan , allowing only the greek part of the island to join the european union . rules not free of hurdles but despite the good intentions , implementing the trade regulation will turn out to be tougher than it appears on paper . for one , all animal and agricultural products - goods with probably the most significant export potential - are excluded from the regulation as are goods originating from turkey . this week just a day after the regulation came into effect , greek cypriots sent back a turkish truckload of fish , which fell foul of the law . adrian van der meer , the eu 's representative in cyprus said the rejection of the fish by greek cypriot veterinary authorities was a regrettable necessity . " from a legal point of view the certificate of origin issued was correct because the fish originated in the northern part of cyprus , but the second clause says that no animal produce is allowed to cross , and we take a zero tolerance on this , " he told reuters . mutual trust needed in addition , turkish cypriot businessmen need a greek cypriot partner who will buy their products and sell them .
given the island 's division and troubled past , few believe it will be an easy task . " goods , whose origin is difficult to conceal such as consumer goods , will be difficult to sell in the south , " heinz kramer , cyprus expert at the science and politics foundation told dw-world . it also seems likely that greek cypriot businessmen would watch out for their interests and be wary of opening the door to possible competitors from the other end of the island . kramer said building materials and textile products count among the few goods that have a chance of being sold in the southern market .
" it will probably hardly interest anyone where his bricks are coming from , " kramer said . symbolism rather than real benefits as far as economic benefits go , hardly anyone expects the regulation to have a major impact .
flourishing trade between the two parts of the island remains an unrealistic hope . " i believe that the move is highly politically symbolic , one that 's meant to show that the north should n't be isolated .
but , its economic significance is very minimal , " kramer said . a real breakthrough in trade relations between the two parts of the divided island might instead come from a proposal that 's currently making the rounds in the eu council of ministers .
according to it , turkish cypriot products will be directly exported to the eu without a diversion via the southern greek cypriot part of the island . but it remains unclear whether the proposal will actually see the light of day .
greece and new eu member cyprus , which represents the greek part of the island , have already indicated that they are against full free trade for the north . michael knigge -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cyprus celebrates a dubious birthday thirty years after turkey invaded it , cyprus remains a divided island .

major european reinsurance companies apparently want to drop certain terrorism-related risks from aviation policies . german daily financial times deutschland reported on wednesday that several european reinsurers starting 2005 want to explicitly rule out liability in the event of attacks with nuclear , chemical and biological weapons .
they include attacks with so-called " dirty bombs " containing radioactive or other hazardous materials being detonated aboard planes or at airports . " incalculable costs " the paper said that the magnitude of claims that could result from such an attack are simply too immense for the insurance industry . " we do n't want to insure such risks any more , they 're simply incalculable , " a spokeswoman for münchener rück , the world 's largest reinsurance company told news agency ap . german insurance , banking and asset management giant allianz said it had no definite commitment to cover terrorism risks in the future . the report also said that aviation underwriters in london , which lead the insurance of most of the world 's major airlines , had already drafted a new clause earlier this year that excludes such terror risks from their standard policies , but allowed them to be written back for an extra premium . lufthansa wants governments to step in the news has rattled major european airliners , who are obliged by law and international agreements to provide insurance cover for passengers and may not fly without insurance . german national carrier lufthansa and other european airliners are now pushing for eu governments to take over liability for damages resulting from terrorism and indemnify their airlines against such an attack . lufthansa 's insurance head ralf oelssner painted a drastic scenario , saying that the reinsurance industry 's move could mean that airliners would have to ground their fleets if governments did n't step in to provide cover for ininsurable aviation risks .
" without a state guarantee , there is a possibility that air traffic will have to be discontinued if the insurers cancel their terrorism cover , as announced , " oelssner told financial times deutschland . lufthansa has since played down fears it would have to stop its flights .
" practically , it 's rather absurd .
the airplanes wo n't stay on the ground , " thomas ellerbeck spokesman for lufthansa told reuters , adding the airline was confident a workable agreement could be found in talks with governments , insurers and the european union . " if there is no private-sector solution for european airlines , it will have to come down to a state guarantee for this particular risk , " ellerbeck said .

" we do n't want to insure such risks any more , they 're simply incalculable , " a spokeswoman for münchener rück , the world 's largest reinsurance company told news agency ap . german insurance , banking and asset management giant allianz said it had no definite commitment to cover terrorism risks in the future . the report also said that aviation underwriters in london , which lead the insurance of most of the world 's major airlines , had already drafted a new clause earlier this year that excludes such terror risks from their standard policies , but allowed them to be written back for an extra premium . lufthansa wants governments to step in the news has rattled major european airliners , who are obliged by law and international agreements to provide insurance cover for passengers and may not fly without insurance . german national carrier lufthansa and other european airliners are now pushing for eu governments to take over liability for damages resulting from terrorism and indemnify their airlines against such an attack . lufthansa 's insurance head ralf oelssner painted a drastic scenario , saying that the reinsurance industry 's move could mean that airliners would have to ground their fleets if governments did n't step in to provide cover for ininsurable aviation risks .
" without a state guarantee , there is a possibility that air traffic will have to be discontinued if the insurers cancel their terrorism cover , as announced , " oelssner told financial times deutschland . lufthansa has since played down fears it would have to stop its flights .
" practically , it 's rather absurd .
the airplanes wo n't stay on the ground , " thomas ellerbeck spokesman for lufthansa told reuters , adding the airline was confident a workable agreement could be found in talks with governments , insurers and the european union . " if there is no private-sector solution for european airlines , it will have to come down to a state guarantee for this particular risk , " ellerbeck said .
" this is also about fair competition across the north atlantic . "
in the us , the government already provides terrorism insurance and will do so until 2008 . " terrorism is a question of security and for us it 's a question of national security , not aviation security , " a spokeswoman for the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- , a geneva-based airlines trade association representing over 98 percent of scheduled international traffic , told reuters .
" governments should be taking on the cost burden of these activities … it 's a matter of protecting their citizens , " she said . european governments did temporarily take over terrorism insurance in the aftermath of the sept .

bayer face munich in the bundesliga on saturday - and maybe in europe in the future . bayer leverkusen entertains bayern munich on saturday in the " play of the day " in the bundesliga with more than just the quest for three points and ultimately a championship title in common . on wednesday , despite losing 2-1 to banik ostrava on the night , leverkusen reached the group stage of the european champions league with a 6-2 aggregate victory and became the third german team to enter the draw on thursday along with their opponents at the weekend and current bundesliga title holders werder bremen . it has been a long road for bayer leverkusen back to the continent 's premier cup competition .
after reaching the 2002 final , where they lost 2-1 to real madrid , the team buckled under the crushing disappointment of losing narrowly out on a domestic league , cup and european treble and a little under 15 months ago were almost relegated to the second division . manager klaus augenthaler has since rebuilt the club and has now guided it back into the champions league with a new-look team stripped of stars such as michael ballack , lucio and ze roberto , all now preparing to meet their former employer on saturday as part of the bayern munich team . insummountable task for czechs in reality , it looked a dead cert that bayer would reach the champions league this year after the initial game against banik ostrava .
it would have taken a monumental effort from the czech side to overcome bayer 's 5-0 first-leg win but this did not stop them attempting it .
banik went ahead seven minutes before half-time after michal papadopulos had slipped the leverkusen defense to put his shot beyond the despairing hans-jörg butt . despite early efforts from dimitar berbatov , leverkusen looked to be coasting through the second leg in the czech republic , with the hard work already achieved in the home leg in germany .
their intent was clear from the start as leverkusen coach klaus augenthaler fielded a young side including only four of the team who so comprehensively eclipsed banik in the bayarena a week before . banik pushes young bayer side the onus was on the home side to push the visitors as they looked for an equally impressive display to overcome the lead leverkusen brought with them .
miroslav matusovic and mario licka worked well to create first half openings for banik but they could not find a way past leverkusen 's butt .
robson ponte also had a decent opportunity to put the czechs ahead but the relatively inexperienced side the germans were fielding continued to stand firm . the breakthrough came on 38 minutes when leverkusen goalkeeper butt failed to cut out a ball on the six-yard box , which was retrieved by mario licka who in turn fed papadopoulos , who found the back of the net . parity gained and lost in minutes it was n't until the 83rd minute that leverkusen achieved parity .
berbatov hauled leverkusen level after banik tried to play the bulgarian striker offside but their appeals were in vain and berbatov slotted home for the equalizer .
but the balance only remained in place for six minutes .
martin cizek 's cross for the home side found an unmarked libor zurek who notched the winner .

but apart from a successful egovernment project in bremen , germany still lags behind on an eu level . getting your own birth certificate in germany usually entails a bureaucratic nightmare lasting several weeks .
but a new high-tech project in bremen has reduced the process to literally a couple of clicks . all you have to do is order the certificate online from the registry office , you even sign the form right away on your computer .
within a couple of days , the certificate will be in the mail . kerstin sprock who works for a private company that maintains online services for the city of bremen is proud that the city leads the way when it comes to egovernment in germany . " we realized very early that it 's not just about information , but people also want to accomplish things .
and bremen stands out in the field , it has over 100 services that citizens can sign for with an electronic signature , " sprock told dw-radio . whether it 's informing authorities about a change in address , applying for a car license plate or filling out a form for dog taxes , it 's all possible via the internet in bremen , 24 hours a day and without spending time in long waiting lines at offices . electronic signature the show stealer the chief attraction is the electronic signature which works a bit like withdrawing money from a cash machine .
the user needs a chip card , an own scanner and a secret code . sprock says security is the main priority .
" according to current technology , the electronic signature ca n't be cracked , " she said .
" actually , the biggest security risk is at offices , in families and among friends .
but one needs to go to great criminal lengths to even get close technologically to such a signature . " but there remains little doubt that the electronic signature is n't foolproof .
security concerns over egovernment and other online services involving personal data have driven the european commission - which is pushing eu governments to make their bureaucracy more efficient , high-tech and user-friendly - to set up a european agency for network and information security called enisa .
its chief aim is to ensure that data protection guidelines are obeyed and that security standards of computers are constantly upgraded . bremen still has n't witnessed any misuse of its electronic signature , but then few citizens of the northern german city have been making use of the online services .
one of the chief reasons is that the card scanner and the chip card cost citizens around € 50 a year . but sprock said the project was still a success among corporate users .
" several people from business and industry have told us that they usually have an own office to deal with bureaucracy - now , naturally they can do away with it and save money . " germany lags behind the egovernment project is underway in bremen , esslingen and nuremberg .
the three cities are supported by the german government with funds and know-how with the framework of a pilot project .
but it 's clear that bremen is the trailblazer .
last year , it even won an award for its egovernment project from the european commission . but , apart from the cities involved in the online pilot project , the rest of germany 's cities and towns remain far behind on the information highway .
though citizens can download official forms on the internet almost everywhere , they still have to sign them by hand and then take the application to an office or at least to a mailbox . that makes germany a bit of a laggard on the european level when it comes to egovernment .
leading the way are the scandinavian countries where on an average , citizens can accomplish over 80 percent of official services sitting at their computers within the comfort of their homes .
as compared to that , germans can wrap up just about 50 percent of official services at home , taking it to third place in europe and only slightly better than belgium and luxembourg . despite the rising popularity and simplicity of egovernment , kerstin sprock does n't believe they 'll ever completely replace government officials . " for instance marriage : that 's the most beautiful day of your life - who would want to spend it in front of the computer ?

bayer face munich in the bundesliga on saturday - and maybe in europe in the future . bayer leverkusen entertains bayern munich on saturday in the " play of the day " in the bundesliga with more than just the quest for three points and ultimately a championship title in common . on wednesday , despite losing 2-1 to banik ostrava on the night , leverkusen reached the group stage of the european champions league with a 6-2 aggregate victory and became the third german team to enter the draw on thursday along with their opponents at the weekend and current bundesliga title holders werder bremen . it has been a long road for bayer leverkusen back to the continent 's premier cup competition .
after reaching the 2002 final , where they lost 2-1 to real madrid , the team buckled under the crushing disappointment of losing narrowly out on a domestic league , cup and european treble and a little under 15 months ago were almost relegated to the second division . manager klaus augenthaler has since rebuilt the club and has now guided it back into the champions league with a new-look team stripped of stars such as michael ballack , lucio and ze roberto , all now preparing to meet their former employer on saturday as part of the bayern munich team . insummountable task for czechs in reality , it looked a dead cert that bayer would reach the champions league this year after the initial game against banik ostrava .
it would have taken a monumental effort from the czech side to overcome bayer 's 5-0 first-leg win but this did not stop them attempting it .
banik went ahead seven minutes before half-time after michal papadopulos had slipped the leverkusen defense to put his shot beyond the despairing hans-jörg butt . despite early efforts from dimitar berbatov , leverkusen looked to be coasting through the second leg in the czech republic , with the hard work already achieved in the home leg in germany .
their intent was clear from the start as leverkusen coach klaus augenthaler fielded a young side including only four of the team who so comprehensively eclipsed banik in the bayarena a week before . banik pushes young bayer side the onus was on the home side to push the visitors as they looked for an equally impressive display to overcome the lead leverkusen brought with them .
miroslav matusovic and mario licka worked well to create first half openings for banik but they could not find a way past leverkusen 's butt .
robson ponte also had a decent opportunity to put the czechs ahead but the relatively inexperienced side the germans were fielding continued to stand firm . the breakthrough came on 38 minutes when leverkusen goalkeeper butt failed to cut out a ball on the six-yard box , which was retrieved by mario licka who in turn fed papadopoulos , who found the back of the net . parity gained and lost in minutes it was n't until the 83rd minute that leverkusen achieved parity .
berbatov hauled leverkusen level after banik tried to play the bulgarian striker offside but their appeals were in vain and berbatov slotted home for the equalizer .
but the balance only remained in place for six minutes .
martin cizek 's cross for the home side found an unmarked libor zurek who notched the winner .
zurek , apparently forgetting the still huge deficit and the imminent defeat that faced his side , ripped off his shirt in celebration only to be booked by the referee for his enthusiastic display . but in the end , it was bayer leverkusen who earned the right to party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.08.2004 italy and libya tackle illegal immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colonel gadhafi continues to fight his long-standing pariah status italian prime minister silvio berlusconi met libyan leader moammar gadhafi on wednesday for talks on stemming the tide of illegal immigrants using the north african country as a transit point . one day earlier , some 275 people trying to enter italy illegally landed on lampedusa , a small island off sicily .
authorities said they believe the ship set sail from a libyan port .
it 's an all-too-familiar scenario .
italian officials estimate some two million people are currently waiting to cross the mediterranean from libya , which attracts a steady flow of illegal immigrants from africa and asia .
to many , italy represents a passageway to the rest of europe .

authorities said they believe the ship set sail from a libyan port .
it 's an all-too-familiar scenario .
italian officials estimate some two million people are currently waiting to cross the mediterranean from libya , which attracts a steady flow of illegal immigrants from africa and asia .
to many , italy represents a passageway to the rest of europe .
co-operation needed during his talks with colonel gadhafi , berlusconi stressed the problem was neither libyan nor italian only , but needed the co-operation of both europe and africa . in early august , italy agreed to train libyan police with a long-term view to launching joint air , sea and land patrols .
italy also recently called on the eu to help in the effort to battle illegal immigration by relaxing the embargo against libya so that it could buy military equipment to help clamp down on the problem of human smuggling by increasing patrols along its borders . gadhafi 's rehabilitation gadhafi , a pariah for much of his 34-year rule because of his links to international terrorism , has won back much credibility after announcing in 2003 that he would abandon the pursuit of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons . berlusconi was the first western leader to meet gadhafi after the announcement .
since then , the leader has undergone a surprise rehabilitation among countries that cold-shouldered his government for years , welcoming british prime minister tony blair in march this year and embarking on an historic visit to brussels several weeks later .
the same month , the us lifted sanctions , making the opec member once again a lucrative destination for western energy companies . a close relationship as libya 's main trading partner , italy has played a key role in re-integrating the north african state into the international community . italy occupied the oil-rich country from 1911 to 1943 and suffered a bloody uprising in 1915 in the port city of sirte , gadhafi 's home-town , 500 km east of the capital tripoli .
wednesday 's talks also included discussion of libya 's long-standing request for italian reparations for decades of occupation . the trip was not without controversy .

the soviet red army was fighting at the city gates to gain victory over the nazi regime while the führer and his closest followers battled against fear of the third reich 's collapse in their bunker . the film shows hitler on his last birthday as a bent , ashen-faced man holding a garbled speech in the garden of the old imperial chancellory and a rare public kiss with eva braun , his girlfriend , after she insists on staying by his side until the end . though the film is based on historical fact and eyewitness accounts , some scenes and dialogues have been invented .

" the time is ripe for such a film , " eichinger said during a media screening in berlin this week .

" in the film , ganz barks out orders far removed from reality - ordering nonexistent units into battle - during the last days in the bunker .
his shaking hand concealed behind his back , he holds hate-filled monologues about the jews , alleged betrayers and victory that is assured in any case . his angry outbursts at the inability of his army to stave off the soviet attack are interspersed with moments of friendliness towards his female staff and towards eva braun , who he marries just a day before their joint suicide .

a new german film captures the madness of his last days and resurrects the führer as never before . he may be the subject of countless books and works around the world , but there is little doubt that no other phase of hitler 's life arouses as much morbid fascination as the final one . housed within the thick walls of his underground bunker in berlin 's wilhelm strasse for the last two months of his life , the nazi leader lived what appears to be an unreal life marked by parties , protocol and grandiose war plans even as the city 's civilian population battled for their lives above the ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juliane köhler -lrb- left -rrb- who plays eva braun , hitler 's lover , bruno ganz as adolf hitler -lrb- center -rrb- and heino ferch as architect albert speer in a scene from " downfall " the bizarre period is now the theme of a startlingly convincing new film by german star producer bernd eichinger .
called " downfall - hitler and the end of the third reich , " the € 13.5 million -lrb- $ 16.3 million -rrb- film , which boasts a star-studded cast , will open in german cinemas on sept .
16 . eichinger and director oliver hirschbiegel drew on a best-selling hitler biography by joachim fest , an award-winning historian , and the memoirs of the late traudl junge , hitler 's last personal secretary . junge 's book , published just days before she died in late 2002 , offers hitherto unknown insights into life in the bunker in the spring of 1945 . last 12 days of hitler 's life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " downfall " the two and a half hour film describes the period from april 20 , hitler 's last birthday , until may 2 , 1945 .
the soviet red army was fighting at the city gates to gain victory over the nazi regime while the führer and his closest followers battled against fear of the third reich 's collapse in their bunker . the film shows hitler on his last birthday as a bent , ashen-faced man holding a garbled speech in the garden of the old imperial chancellory and a rare public kiss with eva braun , his girlfriend , after she insists on staying by his side until the end . though the film is based on historical fact and eyewitness accounts , some scenes and dialogues have been invented . " time is ripe for such a film " what sets the film apart from past attempts at screen portrayals of hitler 's last days is eichinger 's candid depiction of the nazi leader as not just a monster , but a tragic human being , marking a more relaxed approach to germany 's past . " the time is ripe for such a film , " eichinger said during a media screening in berlin this week .
" it 's important not just to shed light on one 's own history superficially , but rather to tell it from within , " he said . eichinger stressed that emotions should be consciously allowed when in coming to terms with hitler from a german perspective .
" if you had overall sympathy for hitler , then the film has failed in its intention .
but to show sympathy in certain moments is , i believe , quite fine , " eichinger said . a more human hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz as hitler in " downfall " veteran swiss actor bruno ganz , who plays hitler in the film , explained that the führer was a person who had earned the least sympathy .
" but i 'm not ashamed of the fact that i could feel sympathy for him during fleeting seconds , " ganz said in berlin . historian fest , who was consulted closely by eichinger during the making of the film , said , " ganz is really hitler : when you look at him you feel a chill down your spine . " in the film , ganz barks out orders far removed from reality - ordering nonexistent units into battle - during the last days in the bunker .
his shaking hand concealed behind his back , he holds hate-filled monologues about the jews , alleged betrayers and victory that is assured in any case . his angry outbursts at the inability of his army to stave off the soviet attack are interspersed with moments of friendliness towards his female staff and towards eva braun , who he marries just a day before their joint suicide . " a real face to the drama " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justus von dohnanyi as general burgdorf , left , and bruno ganz as adolf hitler in the film " downfall " there is little doubt that eichinger is treading controversial ground with his more humane treatment of hitler in a country where displaying nazi emblems is banned and germans are long used to be constantly reminded in movies and books that hitler was the 20th century 's worst war criminal . the film has already generated hot debate in the german press , with some critics fearing it could pander to neo-nazis .
" -lrb- ' downfall ' -rrb- prompts the question whether one should be allowed to feel sympathy for hitler , " the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekly wrote . others have taken a more favorable view .
der spiegel newsmagazine , which devoted its cover story to the film this week , wrote that eichinger had managed what no one had before : " to give the absurd drama in the bunker a real face .

instead they have become the pleasure of an alarming percentage of the nation 's youth . when it comes to alcohol and tobacco consumption , germany is ailing .
with 16.7 million smokers and 1.6 million alcoholics , smoking and drinking have become so embedded in the fabric of society that it is hard to conceive of how younger generations can avoid falling prey to their addictive clutch .
truth is , tens of thousands can not . the staggering climb in both alcohol and tobacco use amongst youth groups was overlooked for too long , and although there are now some measures in place to both correct the damage already done and to prevent its continuation , there is a long way to go in protecting children from these essentially adult vices .
over the past ten years , tobacco consumption among 12-15 year-olds has almost doubled , with some 21 percent of girls and 18 percent of boys in the age group smoking regularly .
for 16-19 year-olds , the figure is 45 percent .
they 're alarming statistics , not least because smoking in germany is not actually legal until the age of 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alcopops but the country is a smokers ' paradise , with cheap cigarettes which kids can buy from machines on street corners and very few restrictions as to where it is or is not acceptable to light up .
in fact , the state of berlin broke new ground this year in implementing a ban on smoking in its schools .
it 's a move which other states are likely to follow , but for the time being children over the age of 16 can smoke in designated areas on school premises provided they present a letter of consent from their parents .
complex issues the biggest question is , if smoking is no more socially acceptable now than it was ten years ago - which it is not - why the massive rise ?
marita völker-albert , press officer for the federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- said the reasons are manifold .
" it 's different for boys and girls .
boys see it as a way of being cool , it makes them feel older and more masculine , whereas girls tend to succumb to peer-pressure and use smoking as a way of staying thin , " völker-albert told dw-world . jörg richert , managing director of karuna , an organization which helps children and young people with potential or existing addiction problems , believes there are more critical factors at play .
" social pressures created by the continual drop in living standards in germany lead to children and young adults not receiving the attention they need . when kids feel their parents are neglecting them , they try to get their attention by taking up smoking or drinking , " richert told dw-world . but he also cites another important issue as the desire of children to grow up against the backdrop of adults trying to stay young . " it is much more difficult for kids to become adults because we wear the same clothes as them , we listen to the same music , go to the same concerts - in short , we steal their identity , " richert said . so much for the reasons behind the trend , but what of the solutions ?
völker-albert believes it is crucial to get the young smokers and drinkers to discuss the potential dangers of what they are doing to their bodies .
" until they start talking to each other , there can be no critical reflection , " she said .
amongst others , the bzga already runs a campaign of sending young people to educate their contemporaries on germany 's beaches . nipping danger in the bud richert welcomes such measures .
as far as he is concerned , the only real way to the heart of the matter is to intervene in a preventative role at a very early stage , not least because of the snowball effect of early tobacco addiction .
" we now know that people who start smoking at an early age are much more likely to move on to alcohol or other addictive substances , " richert said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youngsters to talk to their contempoaries on german beaches and therein lies another problem .
although the consumption of wine and beer among youth groups has tailed off over the past years , the emergence of alcopops has had a truly explosive impact on child and youth drinking habits .
statistics from the bzga show that in 2003 almost 50 percent of young people between the ages of 14-17 were drinking alcopops at least once a month - six times more than in 1998 .
" alcopops even appeal to very young teenagers .
girls used to go out and drink coke , now they drink alcopops instead , but they do n't notice the alcohol .
young people do n't actually like alcohol , but they are seduced into liking it , " völker-albert said .
the crux of the matter last month the government introduced sweeping legislation to put up the tax on these liquor-laced , sickly sweet sodas , increasing the price of a bottle by around € 0.80 -lrb- $ 0.96 -rrb- , but whether it will actually have the desired effect remains to be seen .
" the fact that the prices have gone up wo n't change anything , except that i wo n't buy it myself , i 'll let other people buy them for me , " 16-year-old marietta told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youths drinking alcopops but the alcohol issue does not stand and fall with alcoholic soda .
although he welcomes the price hike , jörg richert believes the whole issue detracts from the real and much more existential core of the problem , which he sees as inextricably linked to declining social standards in germany , " the discussion surrounding alcopops is a distraction .
politicians should be looking at the employment market .
from january onwards , there will be 500,000 more children living from welfare benefit and the consequence will be the exorbitant increase in drug use , " he said . it 's a sombre prediction , but richert claims there is an undeniable connection between poverty and drinking , smoking and drugs .

they 're alarming statistics , not least because smoking in germany is not actually legal until the age of 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alcopops but the country is a smokers ' paradise , with cheap cigarettes which kids can buy from machines on street corners and very few restrictions as to where it is or is not acceptable to light up .
in fact , the state of berlin broke new ground this year in implementing a ban on smoking in its schools .
it 's a move which other states are likely to follow , but for the time being children over the age of 16 can smoke in designated areas on school premises provided they present a letter of consent from their parents .
complex issues the biggest question is , if smoking is no more socially acceptable now than it was ten years ago - which it is not - why the massive rise ?
marita völker-albert , press officer for the federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- said the reasons are manifold .
" it 's different for boys and girls .
boys see it as a way of being cool , it makes them feel older and more masculine , whereas girls tend to succumb to peer-pressure and use smoking as a way of staying thin , " völker-albert told dw-world . jörg richert , managing director of karuna , an organization which helps children and young people with potential or existing addiction problems , believes there are more critical factors at play .
" social pressures created by the continual drop in living standards in germany lead to children and young adults not receiving the attention they need . when kids feel their parents are neglecting them , they try to get their attention by taking up smoking or drinking , " richert told dw-world . but he also cites another important issue as the desire of children to grow up against the backdrop of adults trying to stay young . " it is much more difficult for kids to become adults because we wear the same clothes as them , we listen to the same music , go to the same concerts - in short , we steal their identity , " richert said . so much for the reasons behind the trend , but what of the solutions ?
völker-albert believes it is crucial to get the young smokers and drinkers to discuss the potential dangers of what they are doing to their bodies .
" until they start talking to each other , there can be no critical reflection , " she said .
amongst others , the bzga already runs a campaign of sending young people to educate their contemporaries on germany 's beaches . nipping danger in the bud richert welcomes such measures .
as far as he is concerned , the only real way to the heart of the matter is to intervene in a preventative role at a very early stage , not least because of the snowball effect of early tobacco addiction .
" we now know that people who start smoking at an early age are much more likely to move on to alcohol or other addictive substances , " richert said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youngsters to talk to their contempoaries on german beaches and therein lies another problem .
although the consumption of wine and beer among youth groups has tailed off over the past years , the emergence of alcopops has had a truly explosive impact on child and youth drinking habits .
statistics from the bzga show that in 2003 almost 50 percent of young people between the ages of 14-17 were drinking alcopops at least once a month - six times more than in 1998 .
" alcopops even appeal to very young teenagers .
girls used to go out and drink coke , now they drink alcopops instead , but they do n't notice the alcohol .
young people do n't actually like alcohol , but they are seduced into liking it , " völker-albert said .
the crux of the matter last month the government introduced sweeping legislation to put up the tax on these liquor-laced , sickly sweet sodas , increasing the price of a bottle by around € 0.80 -lrb- $ 0.96 -rrb- , but whether it will actually have the desired effect remains to be seen .
" the fact that the prices have gone up wo n't change anything , except that i wo n't buy it myself , i 'll let other people buy them for me , " 16-year-old marietta told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youths drinking alcopops but the alcohol issue does not stand and fall with alcoholic soda .
although he welcomes the price hike , jörg richert believes the whole issue detracts from the real and much more existential core of the problem , which he sees as inextricably linked to declining social standards in germany , " the discussion surrounding alcopops is a distraction .
politicians should be looking at the employment market .
from january onwards , there will be 500,000 more children living from welfare benefit and the consequence will be the exorbitant increase in drug use , " he said . it 's a sombre prediction , but richert claims there is an undeniable connection between poverty and drinking , smoking and drugs .
and if he is right , the federal centre for health education is going to have its work cut out in making young people communicate in much louder and clearer voices . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe takes on alcopops in an attempt to tackle teenage alcohol consumption , european politicians are targeting alcopops , the trendy fruit-flavored alcoholic beverages preferred by young drinkers .

ireland has become the first european country to implement a ban on smoking in public , with others soon to follow .

but apart from a successful egovernment project in bremen , germany still lags behind on an eu level . getting your own birth certificate in germany usually entails a bureaucratic nightmare lasting several weeks .
but a new high-tech project in bremen has reduced the process to literally a couple of clicks . all you have to do is order the certificate online from the registry office , you even sign the form right away on your computer .
within a couple of days , the certificate will be in the mail . kerstin sprock who works for a private company that maintains online services for the city of bremen is proud that the city leads the way when it comes to egovernment in germany . " we realized very early that it 's not just about information , but people also want to accomplish things .
and bremen stands out in the field , it has over 100 services that citizens can sign for with an electronic signature , " sprock told dw-radio . whether it 's informing authorities about a change in address , applying for a car license plate or filling out a form for dog taxes , it 's all possible via the internet in bremen , 24 hours a day and without spending time in long waiting lines at offices . electronic signature the show stealer the chief attraction is the electronic signature which works a bit like withdrawing money from a cash machine .
the user needs a chip card , an own scanner and a secret code . sprock says security is the main priority .
" according to current technology , the electronic signature ca n't be cracked , " she said .
" actually , the biggest security risk is at offices , in families and among friends .
but one needs to go to great criminal lengths to even get close technologically to such a signature . " but there remains little doubt that the electronic signature is n't foolproof .
security concerns over egovernment and other online services involving personal data have driven the european commission - which is pushing eu governments to make their bureaucracy more efficient , high-tech and user-friendly - to set up a european agency for network and information security called enisa .
its chief aim is to ensure that data protection guidelines are obeyed and that security standards of computers are constantly upgraded . bremen still has n't witnessed any misuse of its electronic signature , but then few citizens of the northern german city have been making use of the online services .
one of the chief reasons is that the card scanner and the chip card cost citizens around € 50 a year . but sprock said the project was still a success among corporate users .
" several people from business and industry have told us that they usually have an own office to deal with bureaucracy - now , naturally they can do away with it and save money . " germany lags behind the egovernment project is underway in bremen , esslingen and nuremberg .
the three cities are supported by the german government with funds and know-how with the framework of a pilot project .
but it 's clear that bremen is the trailblazer .
last year , it even won an award for its egovernment project from the european commission . but , apart from the cities involved in the online pilot project , the rest of germany 's cities and towns remain far behind on the information highway .
though citizens can download official forms on the internet almost everywhere , they still have to sign them by hand and then take the application to an office or at least to a mailbox . that makes germany a bit of a laggard on the european level when it comes to egovernment .
leading the way are the scandinavian countries where on an average , citizens can accomplish over 80 percent of official services sitting at their computers within the comfort of their homes .
as compared to that , germans can wrap up just about 50 percent of official services at home , taking it to third place in europe and only slightly better than belgium and luxembourg . despite the rising popularity and simplicity of egovernment , kerstin sprock does n't believe they 'll ever completely replace government officials .

but apart from a successful egovernment project in bremen , germany still lags behind on an eu level . getting your own birth certificate in germany usually entails a bureaucratic nightmare lasting several weeks .
but a new high-tech project in bremen has reduced the process to literally a couple of clicks . all you have to do is order the certificate online from the registry office , you even sign the form right away on your computer .
within a couple of days , the certificate will be in the mail . kerstin sprock who works for a private company that maintains online services for the city of bremen is proud that the city leads the way when it comes to egovernment in germany . " we realized very early that it 's not just about information , but people also want to accomplish things .
and bremen stands out in the field , it has over 100 services that citizens can sign for with an electronic signature , " sprock told dw-radio . whether it 's informing authorities about a change in address , applying for a car license plate or filling out a form for dog taxes , it 's all possible via the internet in bremen , 24 hours a day and without spending time in long waiting lines at offices . electronic signature the show stealer the chief attraction is the electronic signature which works a bit like withdrawing money from a cash machine .
the user needs a chip card , an own scanner and a secret code . sprock says security is the main priority .
" according to current technology , the electronic signature ca n't be cracked , " she said .
" actually , the biggest security risk is at offices , in families and among friends .
but one needs to go to great criminal lengths to even get close technologically to such a signature . " but there remains little doubt that the electronic signature is n't foolproof .
security concerns over egovernment and other online services involving personal data have driven the european commission - which is pushing eu governments to make their bureaucracy more efficient , high-tech and user-friendly - to set up a european agency for network and information security called enisa .
its chief aim is to ensure that data protection guidelines are obeyed and that security standards of computers are constantly upgraded . bremen still has n't witnessed any misuse of its electronic signature , but then few citizens of the northern german city have been making use of the online services .
one of the chief reasons is that the card scanner and the chip card cost citizens around € 50 a year . but sprock said the project was still a success among corporate users .
" several people from business and industry have told us that they usually have an own office to deal with bureaucracy - now , naturally they can do away with it and save money . " germany lags behind the egovernment project is underway in bremen , esslingen and nuremberg .
the three cities are supported by the german government with funds and know-how with the framework of a pilot project .
but it 's clear that bremen is the trailblazer .
last year , it even won an award for its egovernment project from the european commission . but , apart from the cities involved in the online pilot project , the rest of germany 's cities and towns remain far behind on the information highway .
though citizens can download official forms on the internet almost everywhere , they still have to sign them by hand and then take the application to an office or at least to a mailbox . that makes germany a bit of a laggard on the european level when it comes to egovernment .
leading the way are the scandinavian countries where on an average , citizens can accomplish over 80 percent of official services sitting at their computers within the comfort of their homes .
as compared to that , germans can wrap up just about 50 percent of official services at home , taking it to third place in europe and only slightly better than belgium and luxembourg . despite the rising popularity and simplicity of egovernment , kerstin sprock does n't believe they 'll ever completely replace government officials . " for instance marriage : that 's the most beautiful day of your life - who would want to spend it in front of the computer ? " irene haider -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany celebrates 20 years of e-mail when a group of computer scientists at the university of karlsruhe sent germany 's first e-mail 20 years ago , they had no idea they were heralding in the digital age .
-lrb- august 2 , 2004 -rrb- germans struggle with online addiction about 30 million germans use the internet .
experts believe up to one million people are addicted to surfing online .
reasons vary , but addicts have one thing in common : they 're virtually trying to escape the real world .

do you find it much more effective than paper-based dealings with authorities ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.08.2004 wagner in weimar großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner wants to see weimar emerge from the shadow of its past nike wagner , great-great granddaughter of franz liszt and great granddaughter of richard wagner , has taken the helm of germany 's weimar arts festival until 2006 .
deutsche welle met up with the new director . since weimar 's glory days as european city of culture in 1999 , johann wolfgang von goethe 's home town has been struggling to maintain the international flair it gained five years ago . but now there 's a new girl in town - and she means business . under nike wagner , once tipped as a possible new director of the bayreuth festival but pipped at the post by her younger cousin katharina , the 2004 weimar arts festival marks a new departure for a city that 's trying hard to shake off its conservative image .
the revamped event has been hailed as a forum for contemporary arts , including music , art , literature and dance . the weimar mythology in a city as steeped in history as weimar , the task of re-energizing the local arts festival while upholding the city 's formidable legacy is far from an easy one .
but wagner stresses that the city 's unique past is what makes her post so challenging . " weimar has always had a certain mythology for me , " she says .
" i 'm west german through and through , but when i studied german at university , weimar really captured my imagination . " vokhard knigge , director of the weimar klassik foundation which organizes the festival , described her appointment as an " extraordinary opportunity . "
when the former culture minister in the hamburg regional government agreed to take over , a funding crisis meant it was n't even certain the event had a future .
and wagner admitted she had her work cut out for her .
" my generation never gave any thought to the eastern half of germany , which is something i deeply regret , " she says .
" but i was thrilled when i was asked to take over the festival . "
last but not liszt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe und schiller in weimar : gone but not forgotten in the past , the festival has highlighted the city 's literary heritage .
not only home to goethe and schiller , weimar 's other famous sons include herder and nietzsche .
but this year , wagner - not one to shy away from controversy - has chosen to highlight the hungarian composer franz lizst , who spent several decades in the city and who also happens to be her great , great grandfather . " this city is more or less off the beaten tourist track , and i wanted to find a way of making it more attractive , " she explains .
" i felt that music did this more than literature , so i decided to organize a music festival - and who do i come across ?
franz lizst . " moreover , wagner renamed the new-look festival pèlerinage , a title inspired by liszt 's piano cycle " années de pèlerinage " .
the pilgrimage theme is central to this year 's event , which has " heimweh " -lrb- homesickness -rrb- as its motto . " to me , art is something that has nothing to do with anything stationary , " wagner says .
" art is restless , it 's always looking for new departures , new shores , new utopias . " in 2004 , the increased post-enlargement east european presence at the festival gives this theme added relevance .
" nietzsche 's philosophy , for example , described the status and sensibility of new-age man as nomadic , " points out wagner .
" that 's the trademark of the modern age - in a philosophical sense , we no longer have a home . " commemorating the past this year 's festival also features plenty of modern music , including work by béla bartok and contemporary composers such as györgy kurtág , steffen schleiermacher and heiner goebbels .
wagner is aware that her detractors might find her program a little too challenging for classicist weimar .
but she firmly believes that the festival 's juxtaposition of old and new can only be good for a city whose history is both a boon and a burden . " modernist movements tended to fail here , they were often banished , " she observes .
" take the bauhaus artists , who left to go to dessau .
modernist movements have always been given a hard time in weimar , but it has to be pointed out that no other city needs modernism more than this one . " " it has a surplus of everything else , " she adds .
" its museum collections and archives are phenomenal , and obviously , they need to be preserved very carefully .
but you have to get around traditions , you have to see them as a challenge ! " another of her innovations has been to usher in a new tradition : every year the weimar festival will open with a concert in memory of buchenwald , the nearby nazi concentration camp . " it 's a memorial concert , but it wo n't be held in buchenwald , which would exploit the horrific past of the location , " she stresses .
" it 's just a thoughtful , beautiful orchestral performance … .. there are few ways of commemorating the past appropriately , and this is one possible solution .

deutsche welle met up with the new director . since weimar 's glory days as european city of culture in 1999 , johann wolfgang von goethe 's home town has been struggling to maintain the international flair it gained five years ago . but now there 's a new girl in town - and she means business . under nike wagner , once tipped as a possible new director of the bayreuth festival but pipped at the post by her younger cousin katharina , the 2004 weimar arts festival marks a new departure for a city that 's trying hard to shake off its conservative image .
the revamped event has been hailed as a forum for contemporary arts , including music , art , literature and dance . the weimar mythology in a city as steeped in history as weimar , the task of re-energizing the local arts festival while upholding the city 's formidable legacy is far from an easy one .
but wagner stresses that the city 's unique past is what makes her post so challenging . " weimar has always had a certain mythology for me , " she says .
" i 'm west german through and through , but when i studied german at university , weimar really captured my imagination . " vokhard knigge , director of the weimar klassik foundation which organizes the festival , described her appointment as an " extraordinary opportunity . "
when the former culture minister in the hamburg regional government agreed to take over , a funding crisis meant it was n't even certain the event had a future .
and wagner admitted she had her work cut out for her .
" my generation never gave any thought to the eastern half of germany , which is something i deeply regret , " she says .
" but i was thrilled when i was asked to take over the festival . "
last but not liszt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe und schiller in weimar : gone but not forgotten in the past , the festival has highlighted the city 's literary heritage .
not only home to goethe and schiller , weimar 's other famous sons include herder and nietzsche .
but this year , wagner - not one to shy away from controversy - has chosen to highlight the hungarian composer franz lizst , who spent several decades in the city and who also happens to be her great , great grandfather . " this city is more or less off the beaten tourist track , and i wanted to find a way of making it more attractive , " she explains .
" i felt that music did this more than literature , so i decided to organize a music festival - and who do i come across ?
franz lizst . " moreover , wagner renamed the new-look festival pèlerinage , a title inspired by liszt 's piano cycle " années de pèlerinage " .
the pilgrimage theme is central to this year 's event , which has " heimweh " -lrb- homesickness -rrb- as its motto . " to me , art is something that has nothing to do with anything stationary , " wagner says .
" art is restless , it 's always looking for new departures , new shores , new utopias . " in 2004 , the increased post-enlargement east european presence at the festival gives this theme added relevance .
" nietzsche 's philosophy , for example , described the status and sensibility of new-age man as nomadic , " points out wagner .
" that 's the trademark of the modern age - in a philosophical sense , we no longer have a home . " commemorating the past this year 's festival also features plenty of modern music , including work by béla bartok and contemporary composers such as györgy kurtág , steffen schleiermacher and heiner goebbels .
wagner is aware that her detractors might find her program a little too challenging for classicist weimar .
but she firmly believes that the festival 's juxtaposition of old and new can only be good for a city whose history is both a boon and a burden . " modernist movements tended to fail here , they were often banished , " she observes .
" take the bauhaus artists , who left to go to dessau .
modernist movements have always been given a hard time in weimar , but it has to be pointed out that no other city needs modernism more than this one . " " it has a surplus of everything else , " she adds .
" its museum collections and archives are phenomenal , and obviously , they need to be preserved very carefully .
but you have to get around traditions , you have to see them as a challenge ! " another of her innovations has been to usher in a new tradition : every year the weimar festival will open with a concert in memory of buchenwald , the nearby nazi concentration camp . " it 's a memorial concert , but it wo n't be held in buchenwald , which would exploit the horrific past of the location , " she stresses .
" it 's just a thoughtful , beautiful orchestral performance … .. there are few ways of commemorating the past appropriately , and this is one possible solution . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wagner festival starts without scandal the 2004 wagner festival opened with a controversial production of " parsifal " on sunday .
but despite some booing , many in the audience agreed that the director 's work was an interesting and courageous interpretation . -lrb- july 26 , 2004 -rrb- wagner 's great-granddaughter to make bayreuth debut the 25-year-old great-granddaughter of richard wagner will make her directing debut at the bayreuth festival , the prestigious festival dedicated exclusively to the composer 's works , in 2007 .

major european reinsurance companies apparently want to drop certain terrorism-related risks from aviation policies . german daily financial times deutschland reported on wednesday that several european reinsurers starting 2005 want to explicitly rule out liability in the event of attacks with nuclear , chemical and biological weapons .
they include attacks with so-called " dirty bombs " containing radioactive or other hazardous materials being detonated aboard planes or at airports . " incalculable costs " the paper said that the magnitude of claims that could result from such an attack are simply too immense for the insurance industry . " we do n't want to insure such risks any more , they 're simply incalculable , " a spokeswoman for münchener rück , the world 's largest reinsurance company told news agency ap . german insurance , banking and asset management giant allianz said it had no definite commitment to cover terrorism risks in the future . the report also said that aviation underwriters in london , which lead the insurance of most of the world 's major airlines , had already drafted a new clause earlier this year that excludes such terror risks from their standard policies , but allowed them to be written back for an extra premium . lufthansa wants governments to step in the news has rattled major european airliners , who are obliged by law and international agreements to provide insurance cover for passengers and may not fly without insurance . german national carrier lufthansa and other european airliners are now pushing for eu governments to take over liability for damages resulting from terrorism and indemnify their airlines against such an attack . lufthansa 's insurance head ralf oelssner painted a drastic scenario , saying that the reinsurance industry 's move could mean that airliners would have to ground their fleets if governments did n't step in to provide cover for ininsurable aviation risks .
" without a state guarantee , there is a possibility that air traffic will have to be discontinued if the insurers cancel their terrorism cover , as announced , " oelssner told financial times deutschland . lufthansa has since played down fears it would have to stop its flights .
" practically , it 's rather absurd .
the airplanes wo n't stay on the ground , " thomas ellerbeck spokesman for lufthansa told reuters , adding the airline was confident a workable agreement could be found in talks with governments , insurers and the european union . " if there is no private-sector solution for european airlines , it will have to come down to a state guarantee for this particular risk , " ellerbeck said .
" this is also about fair competition across the north atlantic . "

instead they have become the pleasure of an alarming percentage of the nation 's youth . when it comes to alcohol and tobacco consumption , germany is ailing .
with 16.7 million smokers and 1.6 million alcoholics , smoking and drinking have become so embedded in the fabric of society that it is hard to conceive of how younger generations can avoid falling prey to their addictive clutch .
truth is , tens of thousands can not . the staggering climb in both alcohol and tobacco use amongst youth groups was overlooked for too long , and although there are now some measures in place to both correct the damage already done and to prevent its continuation , there is a long way to go in protecting children from these essentially adult vices .
over the past ten years , tobacco consumption among 12-15 year-olds has almost doubled , with some 21 percent of girls and 18 percent of boys in the age group smoking regularly .
for 16-19 year-olds , the figure is 45 percent .
they 're alarming statistics , not least because smoking in germany is not actually legal until the age of 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alcopops but the country is a smokers ' paradise , with cheap cigarettes which kids can buy from machines on street corners and very few restrictions as to where it is or is not acceptable to light up .
in fact , the state of berlin broke new ground this year in implementing a ban on smoking in its schools .
it 's a move which other states are likely to follow , but for the time being children over the age of 16 can smoke in designated areas on school premises provided they present a letter of consent from their parents .
complex issues the biggest question is , if smoking is no more socially acceptable now than it was ten years ago - which it is not - why the massive rise ?
marita völker-albert , press officer for the federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- said the reasons are manifold .
" it 's different for boys and girls .
boys see it as a way of being cool , it makes them feel older and more masculine , whereas girls tend to succumb to peer-pressure and use smoking as a way of staying thin , " völker-albert told dw-world . jörg richert , managing director of karuna , an organization which helps children and young people with potential or existing addiction problems , believes there are more critical factors at play .
" social pressures created by the continual drop in living standards in germany lead to children and young adults not receiving the attention they need . when kids feel their parents are neglecting them , they try to get their attention by taking up smoking or drinking , " richert told dw-world . but he also cites another important issue as the desire of children to grow up against the backdrop of adults trying to stay young . " it is much more difficult for kids to become adults because we wear the same clothes as them , we listen to the same music , go to the same concerts - in short , we steal their identity , " richert said . so much for the reasons behind the trend , but what of the solutions ?
völker-albert believes it is crucial to get the young smokers and drinkers to discuss the potential dangers of what they are doing to their bodies .
" until they start talking to each other , there can be no critical reflection , " she said .
amongst others , the bzga already runs a campaign of sending young people to educate their contemporaries on germany 's beaches . nipping danger in the bud richert welcomes such measures .
as far as he is concerned , the only real way to the heart of the matter is to intervene in a preventative role at a very early stage , not least because of the snowball effect of early tobacco addiction .
" we now know that people who start smoking at an early age are much more likely to move on to alcohol or other addictive substances , " richert said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youngsters to talk to their contempoaries on german beaches and therein lies another problem .
although the consumption of wine and beer among youth groups has tailed off over the past years , the emergence of alcopops has had a truly explosive impact on child and youth drinking habits .
statistics from the bzga show that in 2003 almost 50 percent of young people between the ages of 14-17 were drinking alcopops at least once a month - six times more than in 1998 .
" alcopops even appeal to very young teenagers .
girls used to go out and drink coke , now they drink alcopops instead , but they do n't notice the alcohol .
young people do n't actually like alcohol , but they are seduced into liking it , " völker-albert said .
the crux of the matter last month the government introduced sweeping legislation to put up the tax on these liquor-laced , sickly sweet sodas , increasing the price of a bottle by around € 0.80 -lrb- $ 0.96 -rrb- , but whether it will actually have the desired effect remains to be seen .
" the fact that the prices have gone up wo n't change anything , except that i wo n't buy it myself , i 'll let other people buy them for me , " 16-year-old marietta told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youths drinking alcopops but the alcohol issue does not stand and fall with alcoholic soda .
although he welcomes the price hike , jörg richert believes the whole issue detracts from the real and much more existential core of the problem , which he sees as inextricably linked to declining social standards in germany , " the discussion surrounding alcopops is a distraction .
politicians should be looking at the employment market .
from january onwards , there will be 500,000 more children living from welfare benefit and the consequence will be the exorbitant increase in drug use , " he said . it 's a sombre prediction , but richert claims there is an undeniable connection between poverty and drinking , smoking and drugs .

over the past ten years , tobacco consumption among 12-15 year-olds has almost doubled , with some 21 percent of girls and 18 percent of boys in the age group smoking regularly .
for 16-19 year-olds , the figure is 45 percent .

in fact , the state of berlin broke new ground this year in implementing a ban on smoking in its schools .
it 's a move which other states are likely to follow , but for the time being children over the age of 16 can smoke in designated areas on school premises provided they present a letter of consent from their parents .
complex issues the biggest question is , if smoking is no more socially acceptable now than it was ten years ago - which it is not - why the massive rise ?
marita völker-albert , press officer for the federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- said the reasons are manifold .
" it 's different for boys and girls .
boys see it as a way of being cool , it makes them feel older and more masculine , whereas girls tend to succumb to peer-pressure and use smoking as a way of staying thin , " völker-albert told dw-world . jörg richert , managing director of karuna , an organization which helps children and young people with potential or existing addiction problems , believes there are more critical factors at play .
" social pressures created by the continual drop in living standards in germany lead to children and young adults not receiving the attention they need . when kids feel their parents are neglecting them , they try to get their attention by taking up smoking or drinking , " richert told dw-world . but he also cites another important issue as the desire of children to grow up against the backdrop of adults trying to stay young . " it is much more difficult for kids to become adults because we wear the same clothes as them , we listen to the same music , go to the same concerts - in short , we steal their identity , " richert said . so much for the reasons behind the trend , but what of the solutions ?
völker-albert believes it is crucial to get the young smokers and drinkers to discuss the potential dangers of what they are doing to their bodies .
" until they start talking to each other , there can be no critical reflection , " she said .
amongst others , the bzga already runs a campaign of sending young people to educate their contemporaries on germany 's beaches . nipping danger in the bud richert welcomes such measures .
as far as he is concerned , the only real way to the heart of the matter is to intervene in a preventative role at a very early stage , not least because of the snowball effect of early tobacco addiction .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youngsters to talk to their contempoaries on german beaches and therein lies another problem .
although the consumption of wine and beer among youth groups has tailed off over the past years , the emergence of alcopops has had a truly explosive impact on child and youth drinking habits .
statistics from the bzga show that in 2003 almost 50 percent of young people between the ages of 14-17 were drinking alcopops at least once a month - six times more than in 1998 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.08.2004 german egovernment initiative off to a slow start großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this should be the future when it comes to dealing with bureacracy the eu would like its citizens to use personal computers to do taxes and complete bureacratic formalities .
but apart from a successful egovernment project in bremen , germany still lags behind on an eu level . getting your own birth certificate in germany usually entails a bureaucratic nightmare lasting several weeks .
but a new high-tech project in bremen has reduced the process to literally a couple of clicks . all you have to do is order the certificate online from the registry office , you even sign the form right away on your computer .
within a couple of days , the certificate will be in the mail . kerstin sprock who works for a private company that maintains online services for the city of bremen is proud that the city leads the way when it comes to egovernment in germany . " we realized very early that it 's not just about information , but people also want to accomplish things .
and bremen stands out in the field , it has over 100 services that citizens can sign for with an electronic signature , " sprock told dw-radio . whether it 's informing authorities about a change in address , applying for a car license plate or filling out a form for dog taxes , it 's all possible via the internet in bremen , 24 hours a day and without spending time in long waiting lines at offices . electronic signature the show stealer the chief attraction is the electronic signature which works a bit like withdrawing money from a cash machine .
the user needs a chip card , an own scanner and a secret code . sprock says security is the main priority .
" according to current technology , the electronic signature ca n't be cracked , " she said .
" actually , the biggest security risk is at offices , in families and among friends .
but one needs to go to great criminal lengths to even get close technologically to such a signature . " but there remains little doubt that the electronic signature is n't foolproof .
security concerns over egovernment and other online services involving personal data have driven the european commission - which is pushing eu governments to make their bureaucracy more efficient , high-tech and user-friendly - to set up a european agency for network and information security called enisa .
its chief aim is to ensure that data protection guidelines are obeyed and that security standards of computers are constantly upgraded . bremen still has n't witnessed any misuse of its electronic signature , but then few citizens of the northern german city have been making use of the online services .
one of the chief reasons is that the card scanner and the chip card cost citizens around € 50 a year . but sprock said the project was still a success among corporate users .
" several people from business and industry have told us that they usually have an own office to deal with bureaucracy - now , naturally they can do away with it and save money . " germany lags behind the egovernment project is underway in bremen , esslingen and nuremberg .

but apart from a successful egovernment project in bremen , germany still lags behind on an eu level . getting your own birth certificate in germany usually entails a bureaucratic nightmare lasting several weeks .
but a new high-tech project in bremen has reduced the process to literally a couple of clicks . all you have to do is order the certificate online from the registry office , you even sign the form right away on your computer .
within a couple of days , the certificate will be in the mail . kerstin sprock who works for a private company that maintains online services for the city of bremen is proud that the city leads the way when it comes to egovernment in germany . " we realized very early that it 's not just about information , but people also want to accomplish things .
and bremen stands out in the field , it has over 100 services that citizens can sign for with an electronic signature , " sprock told dw-radio . whether it 's informing authorities about a change in address , applying for a car license plate or filling out a form for dog taxes , it 's all possible via the internet in bremen , 24 hours a day and without spending time in long waiting lines at offices . electronic signature the show stealer the chief attraction is the electronic signature which works a bit like withdrawing money from a cash machine .
the user needs a chip card , an own scanner and a secret code . sprock says security is the main priority .
" according to current technology , the electronic signature ca n't be cracked , " she said .
" actually , the biggest security risk is at offices , in families and among friends .
but one needs to go to great criminal lengths to even get close technologically to such a signature . " but there remains little doubt that the electronic signature is n't foolproof .
security concerns over egovernment and other online services involving personal data have driven the european commission - which is pushing eu governments to make their bureaucracy more efficient , high-tech and user-friendly - to set up a european agency for network and information security called enisa .
its chief aim is to ensure that data protection guidelines are obeyed and that security standards of computers are constantly upgraded . bremen still has n't witnessed any misuse of its electronic signature , but then few citizens of the northern german city have been making use of the online services .
one of the chief reasons is that the card scanner and the chip card cost citizens around € 50 a year . but sprock said the project was still a success among corporate users .
" several people from business and industry have told us that they usually have an own office to deal with bureaucracy - now , naturally they can do away with it and save money . " germany lags behind the egovernment project is underway in bremen , esslingen and nuremberg .

deutsche welle met up with the new director . since weimar 's glory days as european city of culture in 1999 , johann wolfgang von goethe 's home town has been struggling to maintain the international flair it gained five years ago . but now there 's a new girl in town - and she means business . under nike wagner , once tipped as a possible new director of the bayreuth festival but pipped at the post by her younger cousin katharina , the 2004 weimar arts festival marks a new departure for a city that 's trying hard to shake off its conservative image .

a new german film captures the madness of his last days and resurrects the führer as never before . he may be the subject of countless books and works around the world , but there is little doubt that no other phase of hitler 's life arouses as much morbid fascination as the final one . housed within the thick walls of his underground bunker in berlin 's wilhelm strasse for the last two months of his life , the nazi leader lived what appears to be an unreal life marked by parties , protocol and grandiose war plans even as the city 's civilian population battled for their lives above the ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juliane köhler -lrb- left -rrb- who plays eva braun , hitler 's lover , bruno ganz as adolf hitler -lrb- center -rrb- and heino ferch as architect albert speer in a scene from " downfall " the bizarre period is now the theme of a startlingly convincing new film by german star producer bernd eichinger .
called " downfall - hitler and the end of the third reich , " the € 13.5 million -lrb- $ 16.3 million -rrb- film , which boasts a star-studded cast , will open in german cinemas on sept .
16 . eichinger and director oliver hirschbiegel drew on a best-selling hitler biography by joachim fest , an award-winning historian , and the memoirs of the late traudl junge , hitler 's last personal secretary . junge 's book , published just days before she died in late 2002 , offers hitherto unknown insights into life in the bunker in the spring of 1945 . last 12 days of hitler 's life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " downfall " the two and a half hour film describes the period from april 20 , hitler 's last birthday , until may 2 , 1945 .
the soviet red army was fighting at the city gates to gain victory over the nazi regime while the führer and his closest followers battled against fear of the third reich 's collapse in their bunker . the film shows hitler on his last birthday as a bent , ashen-faced man holding a garbled speech in the garden of the old imperial chancellory and a rare public kiss with eva braun , his girlfriend , after she insists on staying by his side until the end . though the film is based on historical fact and eyewitness accounts , some scenes and dialogues have been invented . " time is ripe for such a film " what sets the film apart from past attempts at screen portrayals of hitler 's last days is eichinger 's candid depiction of the nazi leader as not just a monster , but a tragic human being , marking a more relaxed approach to germany 's past . " the time is ripe for such a film , " eichinger said during a media screening in berlin this week .
" it 's important not just to shed light on one 's own history superficially , but rather to tell it from within , " he said . eichinger stressed that emotions should be consciously allowed when in coming to terms with hitler from a german perspective .
" if you had overall sympathy for hitler , then the film has failed in its intention .
but to show sympathy in certain moments is , i believe , quite fine , " eichinger said . a more human hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz as hitler in " downfall " veteran swiss actor bruno ganz , who plays hitler in the film , explained that the führer was a person who had earned the least sympathy .
" but i 'm not ashamed of the fact that i could feel sympathy for him during fleeting seconds , " ganz said in berlin . historian fest , who was consulted closely by eichinger during the making of the film , said , " ganz is really hitler : when you look at him you feel a chill down your spine . " in the film , ganz barks out orders far removed from reality - ordering nonexistent units into battle - during the last days in the bunker .
his shaking hand concealed behind his back , he holds hate-filled monologues about the jews , alleged betrayers and victory that is assured in any case . his angry outbursts at the inability of his army to stave off the soviet attack are interspersed with moments of friendliness towards his female staff and towards eva braun , who he marries just a day before their joint suicide . " a real face to the drama " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justus von dohnanyi as general burgdorf , left , and bruno ganz as adolf hitler in the film " downfall " there is little doubt that eichinger is treading controversial ground with his more humane treatment of hitler in a country where displaying nazi emblems is banned and germans are long used to be constantly reminded in movies and books that hitler was the 20th century 's worst war criminal . the film has already generated hot debate in the german press , with some critics fearing it could pander to neo-nazis .
" -lrb- ' downfall ' -rrb- prompts the question whether one should be allowed to feel sympathy for hitler , " the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekly wrote . others have taken a more favorable view .
der spiegel newsmagazine , which devoted its cover story to the film this week , wrote that eichinger had managed what no one had before : " to give the absurd drama in the bunker a real face .

a new german film captures the madness of his last days and resurrects the führer as never before . he may be the subject of countless books and works around the world , but there is little doubt that no other phase of hitler 's life arouses as much morbid fascination as the final one . housed within the thick walls of his underground bunker in berlin 's wilhelm strasse for the last two months of his life , the nazi leader lived what appears to be an unreal life marked by parties , protocol and grandiose war plans even as the city 's civilian population battled for their lives above the ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juliane köhler -lrb- left -rrb- who plays eva braun , hitler 's lover , bruno ganz as adolf hitler -lrb- center -rrb- and heino ferch as architect albert speer in a scene from " downfall " the bizarre period is now the theme of a startlingly convincing new film by german star producer bernd eichinger .
called " downfall - hitler and the end of the third reich , " the € 13.5 million -lrb- $ 16.3 million -rrb- film , which boasts a star-studded cast , will open in german cinemas on sept .
16 . eichinger and director oliver hirschbiegel drew on a best-selling hitler biography by joachim fest , an award-winning historian , and the memoirs of the late traudl junge , hitler 's last personal secretary . junge 's book , published just days before she died in late 2002 , offers hitherto unknown insights into life in the bunker in the spring of 1945 . last 12 days of hitler 's life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " downfall " the two and a half hour film describes the period from april 20 , hitler 's last birthday , until may 2 , 1945 .
the soviet red army was fighting at the city gates to gain victory over the nazi regime while the führer and his closest followers battled against fear of the third reich 's collapse in their bunker . the film shows hitler on his last birthday as a bent , ashen-faced man holding a garbled speech in the garden of the old imperial chancellory and a rare public kiss with eva braun , his girlfriend , after she insists on staying by his side until the end . though the film is based on historical fact and eyewitness accounts , some scenes and dialogues have been invented . " time is ripe for such a film " what sets the film apart from past attempts at screen portrayals of hitler 's last days is eichinger 's candid depiction of the nazi leader as not just a monster , but a tragic human being , marking a more relaxed approach to germany 's past . " the time is ripe for such a film , " eichinger said during a media screening in berlin this week .
" it 's important not just to shed light on one 's own history superficially , but rather to tell it from within , " he said . eichinger stressed that emotions should be consciously allowed when in coming to terms with hitler from a german perspective .
" if you had overall sympathy for hitler , then the film has failed in its intention .
but to show sympathy in certain moments is , i believe , quite fine , " eichinger said . a more human hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz as hitler in " downfall " veteran swiss actor bruno ganz , who plays hitler in the film , explained that the führer was a person who had earned the least sympathy .
" but i 'm not ashamed of the fact that i could feel sympathy for him during fleeting seconds , " ganz said in berlin . historian fest , who was consulted closely by eichinger during the making of the film , said , " ganz is really hitler : when you look at him you feel a chill down your spine . " in the film , ganz barks out orders far removed from reality - ordering nonexistent units into battle - during the last days in the bunker .
his shaking hand concealed behind his back , he holds hate-filled monologues about the jews , alleged betrayers and victory that is assured in any case . his angry outbursts at the inability of his army to stave off the soviet attack are interspersed with moments of friendliness towards his female staff and towards eva braun , who he marries just a day before their joint suicide . " a real face to the drama " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justus von dohnanyi as general burgdorf , left , and bruno ganz as adolf hitler in the film " downfall " there is little doubt that eichinger is treading controversial ground with his more humane treatment of hitler in a country where displaying nazi emblems is banned and germans are long used to be constantly reminded in movies and books that hitler was the 20th century 's worst war criminal . the film has already generated hot debate in the german press , with some critics fearing it could pander to neo-nazis .
" -lrb- ' downfall ' -rrb- prompts the question whether one should be allowed to feel sympathy for hitler , " the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekly wrote . others have taken a more favorable view .

deutsche welle met up with the new director . since weimar 's glory days as european city of culture in 1999 , johann wolfgang von goethe 's home town has been struggling to maintain the international flair it gained five years ago . but now there 's a new girl in town - and she means business . under nike wagner , once tipped as a possible new director of the bayreuth festival but pipped at the post by her younger cousin katharina , the 2004 weimar arts festival marks a new departure for a city that 's trying hard to shake off its conservative image .
the revamped event has been hailed as a forum for contemporary arts , including music , art , literature and dance . the weimar mythology in a city as steeped in history as weimar , the task of re-energizing the local arts festival while upholding the city 's formidable legacy is far from an easy one .
but wagner stresses that the city 's unique past is what makes her post so challenging . " weimar has always had a certain mythology for me , " she says .
" i 'm west german through and through , but when i studied german at university , weimar really captured my imagination . " vokhard knigge , director of the weimar klassik foundation which organizes the festival , described her appointment as an " extraordinary opportunity . "
when the former culture minister in the hamburg regional government agreed to take over , a funding crisis meant it was n't even certain the event had a future .
and wagner admitted she had her work cut out for her .
" my generation never gave any thought to the eastern half of germany , which is something i deeply regret , " she says .
" but i was thrilled when i was asked to take over the festival . "
last but not liszt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe und schiller in weimar : gone but not forgotten in the past , the festival has highlighted the city 's literary heritage .
not only home to goethe and schiller , weimar 's other famous sons include herder and nietzsche .
but this year , wagner - not one to shy away from controversy - has chosen to highlight the hungarian composer franz lizst , who spent several decades in the city and who also happens to be her great , great grandfather . " this city is more or less off the beaten tourist track , and i wanted to find a way of making it more attractive , " she explains .
" i felt that music did this more than literature , so i decided to organize a music festival - and who do i come across ?
franz lizst . " moreover , wagner renamed the new-look festival pèlerinage , a title inspired by liszt 's piano cycle " années de pèlerinage " .
the pilgrimage theme is central to this year 's event , which has " heimweh " -lrb- homesickness -rrb- as its motto . " to me , art is something that has nothing to do with anything stationary , " wagner says .
" art is restless , it 's always looking for new departures , new shores , new utopias . " in 2004 , the increased post-enlargement east european presence at the festival gives this theme added relevance .
" nietzsche 's philosophy , for example , described the status and sensibility of new-age man as nomadic , " points out wagner .
" that 's the trademark of the modern age - in a philosophical sense , we no longer have a home . " commemorating the past this year 's festival also features plenty of modern music , including work by béla bartok and contemporary composers such as györgy kurtág , steffen schleiermacher and heiner goebbels .
wagner is aware that her detractors might find her program a little too challenging for classicist weimar .
but she firmly believes that the festival 's juxtaposition of old and new can only be good for a city whose history is both a boon and a burden . " modernist movements tended to fail here , they were often banished , " she observes .
" take the bauhaus artists , who left to go to dessau .
modernist movements have always been given a hard time in weimar , but it has to be pointed out that no other city needs modernism more than this one . " " it has a surplus of everything else , " she adds .
" its museum collections and archives are phenomenal , and obviously , they need to be preserved very carefully .
but you have to get around traditions , you have to see them as a challenge ! " another of her innovations has been to usher in a new tradition : every year the weimar festival will open with a concert in memory of buchenwald , the nearby nazi concentration camp . " it 's a memorial concert , but it wo n't be held in buchenwald , which would exploit the horrific past of the location , " she stresses .

but she firmly believes that the festival 's juxtaposition of old and new can only be good for a city whose history is both a boon and a burden . " modernist movements tended to fail here , they were often banished , " she observes .
" take the bauhaus artists , who left to go to dessau .
modernist movements have always been given a hard time in weimar , but it has to be pointed out that no other city needs modernism more than this one . " " it has a surplus of everything else , " she adds .
" its museum collections and archives are phenomenal , and obviously , they need to be preserved very carefully .
but you have to get around traditions , you have to see them as a challenge ! " another of her innovations has been to usher in a new tradition : every year the weimar festival will open with a concert in memory of buchenwald , the nearby nazi concentration camp . " it 's a memorial concert , but it wo n't be held in buchenwald , which would exploit the horrific past of the location , " she stresses .
" it 's just a thoughtful , beautiful orchestral performance … .. there are few ways of commemorating the past appropriately , and this is one possible solution .

but implementation promises to be far from easy . the new regulations , adopted by the european commission in july and which came into effect on monday this week , are meant to revive trade ties between the turkish and cypriot part of the divided island .
trading between the two sides came to a standstill following the division of cyprus in 1974 and has been non-existent until now . according to the eu regulations , turkish entrepreneurs in the northern part of the island can for the first time sell their products in the greek south .
from there the goods can also be exported to other eu countries without further checks and bureaucratic hurdles . the rules dictate that the goods have to comply with eu standards on food safety and plant health .
further , the turkish cypriot chamber of commerce will have to ensure that products must actually originate from northern cyprus and not turkey . the move is part of an eu package to rebuild the north 's economy and end the isolation of turkish cypriots after they voted in favour of reunification of the island in an april referendum .
however greek cypriots rejected the peace plan , allowing only the greek part of the island to join the european union . rules not free of hurdles but despite the good intentions , implementing the trade regulation will turn out to be tougher than it appears on paper . for one , all animal and agricultural products - goods with probably the most significant export potential - are excluded from the regulation as are goods originating from turkey . this week just a day after the regulation came into effect , greek cypriots sent back a turkish truckload of fish , which fell foul of the law . adrian van der meer , the eu 's representative in cyprus said the rejection of the fish by greek cypriot veterinary authorities was a regrettable necessity . " from a legal point of view the certificate of origin issued was correct because the fish originated in the northern part of cyprus , but the second clause says that no animal produce is allowed to cross , and we take a zero tolerance on this , " he told reuters . mutual trust needed in addition , turkish cypriot businessmen need a greek cypriot partner who will buy their products and sell them .
given the island 's division and troubled past , few believe it will be an easy task . " goods , whose origin is difficult to conceal such as consumer goods , will be difficult to sell in the south , " heinz kramer , cyprus expert at the science and politics foundation told dw-world . it also seems likely that greek cypriot businessmen would watch out for their interests and be wary of opening the door to possible competitors from the other end of the island . kramer said building materials and textile products count among the few goods that have a chance of being sold in the southern market .
" it will probably hardly interest anyone where his bricks are coming from , " kramer said . symbolism rather than real benefits as far as economic benefits go , hardly anyone expects the regulation to have a major impact .
flourishing trade between the two parts of the island remains an unrealistic hope . " i believe that the move is highly politically symbolic , one that 's meant to show that the north should n't be isolated .
but , its economic significance is very minimal , " kramer said . a real breakthrough in trade relations between the two parts of the divided island might instead come from a proposal that 's currently making the rounds in the eu council of ministers .
according to it , turkish cypriot products will be directly exported to the eu without a diversion via the southern greek cypriot part of the island . but it remains unclear whether the proposal will actually see the light of day .
greece and new eu member cyprus , which represents the greek part of the island , have already indicated that they are against full free trade for the north . michael knigge -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cyprus celebrates a dubious birthday thirty years after turkey invaded it , cyprus remains a divided island .

" from a legal point of view the certificate of origin issued was correct because the fish originated in the northern part of cyprus , but the second clause says that no animal produce is allowed to cross , and we take a zero tolerance on this , " he told reuters . mutual trust needed in addition , turkish cypriot businessmen need a greek cypriot partner who will buy their products and sell them .
given the island 's division and troubled past , few believe it will be an easy task . " goods , whose origin is difficult to conceal such as consumer goods , will be difficult to sell in the south , " heinz kramer , cyprus expert at the science and politics foundation told dw-world . it also seems likely that greek cypriot businessmen would watch out for their interests and be wary of opening the door to possible competitors from the other end of the island . kramer said building materials and textile products count among the few goods that have a chance of being sold in the southern market .
" it will probably hardly interest anyone where his bricks are coming from , " kramer said . symbolism rather than real benefits as far as economic benefits go , hardly anyone expects the regulation to have a major impact .
flourishing trade between the two parts of the island remains an unrealistic hope . " i believe that the move is highly politically symbolic , one that 's meant to show that the north should n't be isolated .
but , its economic significance is very minimal , " kramer said . a real breakthrough in trade relations between the two parts of the divided island might instead come from a proposal that 's currently making the rounds in the eu council of ministers .
according to it , turkish cypriot products will be directly exported to the eu without a diversion via the southern greek cypriot part of the island . but it remains unclear whether the proposal will actually see the light of day .
greece and new eu member cyprus , which represents the greek part of the island , have already indicated that they are against full free trade for the north . michael knigge -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cyprus celebrates a dubious birthday thirty years after turkey invaded it , cyprus remains a divided island .

bayer face munich in the bundesliga on saturday - and maybe in europe in the future . bayer leverkusen entertains bayern munich on saturday in the " play of the day " in the bundesliga with more than just the quest for three points and ultimately a championship title in common . on wednesday , despite losing 2-1 to banik ostrava on the night , leverkusen reached the group stage of the european champions league with a 6-2 aggregate victory and became the third german team to enter the draw on thursday along with their opponents at the weekend and current bundesliga title holders werder bremen . it has been a long road for bayer leverkusen back to the continent 's premier cup competition .
after reaching the 2002 final , where they lost 2-1 to real madrid , the team buckled under the crushing disappointment of losing narrowly out on a domestic league , cup and european treble and a little under 15 months ago were almost relegated to the second division . manager klaus augenthaler has since rebuilt the club and has now guided it back into the champions league with a new-look team stripped of stars such as michael ballack , lucio and ze roberto , all now preparing to meet their former employer on saturday as part of the bayern munich team . insummountable task for czechs in reality , it looked a dead cert that bayer would reach the champions league this year after the initial game against banik ostrava .
it would have taken a monumental effort from the czech side to overcome bayer 's 5-0 first-leg win but this did not stop them attempting it .
banik went ahead seven minutes before half-time after michal papadopulos had slipped the leverkusen defense to put his shot beyond the despairing hans-jörg butt . despite early efforts from dimitar berbatov , leverkusen looked to be coasting through the second leg in the czech republic , with the hard work already achieved in the home leg in germany .
their intent was clear from the start as leverkusen coach klaus augenthaler fielded a young side including only four of the team who so comprehensively eclipsed banik in the bayarena a week before . banik pushes young bayer side the onus was on the home side to push the visitors as they looked for an equally impressive display to overcome the lead leverkusen brought with them .
miroslav matusovic and mario licka worked well to create first half openings for banik but they could not find a way past leverkusen 's butt .
robson ponte also had a decent opportunity to put the czechs ahead but the relatively inexperienced side the germans were fielding continued to stand firm . the breakthrough came on 38 minutes when leverkusen goalkeeper butt failed to cut out a ball on the six-yard box , which was retrieved by mario licka who in turn fed papadopoulos , who found the back of the net . parity gained and lost in minutes it was n't until the 83rd minute that leverkusen achieved parity .
berbatov hauled leverkusen level after banik tried to play the bulgarian striker offside but their appeals were in vain and berbatov slotted home for the equalizer .
but the balance only remained in place for six minutes .
martin cizek 's cross for the home side found an unmarked libor zurek who notched the winner .
zurek , apparently forgetting the still huge deficit and the imminent defeat that faced his side , ripped off his shirt in celebration only to be booked by the referee for his enthusiastic display . but in the end , it was bayer leverkusen who earned the right to party .

bayer face munich in the bundesliga on saturday - and maybe in europe in the future . bayer leverkusen entertains bayern munich on saturday in the " play of the day " in the bundesliga with more than just the quest for three points and ultimately a championship title in common . on wednesday , despite losing 2-1 to banik ostrava on the night , leverkusen reached the group stage of the european champions league with a 6-2 aggregate victory and became the third german team to enter the draw on thursday along with their opponents at the weekend and current bundesliga title holders werder bremen . it has been a long road for bayer leverkusen back to the continent 's premier cup competition .
after reaching the 2002 final , where they lost 2-1 to real madrid , the team buckled under the crushing disappointment of losing narrowly out on a domestic league , cup and european treble and a little under 15 months ago were almost relegated to the second division . manager klaus augenthaler has since rebuilt the club and has now guided it back into the champions league with a new-look team stripped of stars such as michael ballack , lucio and ze roberto , all now preparing to meet their former employer on saturday as part of the bayern munich team . insummountable task for czechs in reality , it looked a dead cert that bayer would reach the champions league this year after the initial game against banik ostrava .
it would have taken a monumental effort from the czech side to overcome bayer 's 5-0 first-leg win but this did not stop them attempting it .
banik went ahead seven minutes before half-time after michal papadopulos had slipped the leverkusen defense to put his shot beyond the despairing hans-jörg butt . despite early efforts from dimitar berbatov , leverkusen looked to be coasting through the second leg in the czech republic , with the hard work already achieved in the home leg in germany .
their intent was clear from the start as leverkusen coach klaus augenthaler fielded a young side including only four of the team who so comprehensively eclipsed banik in the bayarena a week before . banik pushes young bayer side the onus was on the home side to push the visitors as they looked for an equally impressive display to overcome the lead leverkusen brought with them .
miroslav matusovic and mario licka worked well to create first half openings for banik but they could not find a way past leverkusen 's butt .
robson ponte also had a decent opportunity to put the czechs ahead but the relatively inexperienced side the germans were fielding continued to stand firm . the breakthrough came on 38 minutes when leverkusen goalkeeper butt failed to cut out a ball on the six-yard box , which was retrieved by mario licka who in turn fed papadopoulos , who found the back of the net . parity gained and lost in minutes it was n't until the 83rd minute that leverkusen achieved parity .
berbatov hauled leverkusen level after banik tried to play the bulgarian striker offside but their appeals were in vain and berbatov slotted home for the equalizer .
but the balance only remained in place for six minutes .
martin cizek 's cross for the home side found an unmarked libor zurek who notched the winner .
zurek , apparently forgetting the still huge deficit and the imminent defeat that faced his side , ripped off his shirt in celebration only to be booked by the referee for his enthusiastic display . but in the end , it was bayer leverkusen who earned the right to party .
a loss on the night could not take the shine off an overall performance that saw the team return to the upper echelons of european cup competition . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen set the pace for week three reigning champions werder bremen are the team to beat at this early stage of the season with two wins from two games .

major european reinsurance companies apparently want to drop certain terrorism-related risks from aviation policies . german daily financial times deutschland reported on wednesday that several european reinsurers starting 2005 want to explicitly rule out liability in the event of attacks with nuclear , chemical and biological weapons .
they include attacks with so-called " dirty bombs " containing radioactive or other hazardous materials being detonated aboard planes or at airports . " incalculable costs " the paper said that the magnitude of claims that could result from such an attack are simply too immense for the insurance industry . " we do n't want to insure such risks any more , they 're simply incalculable , " a spokeswoman for münchener rück , the world 's largest reinsurance company told news agency ap . german insurance , banking and asset management giant allianz said it had no definite commitment to cover terrorism risks in the future . the report also said that aviation underwriters in london , which lead the insurance of most of the world 's major airlines , had already drafted a new clause earlier this year that excludes such terror risks from their standard policies , but allowed them to be written back for an extra premium . lufthansa wants governments to step in the news has rattled major european airliners , who are obliged by law and international agreements to provide insurance cover for passengers and may not fly without insurance . german national carrier lufthansa and other european airliners are now pushing for eu governments to take over liability for damages resulting from terrorism and indemnify their airlines against such an attack . lufthansa 's insurance head ralf oelssner painted a drastic scenario , saying that the reinsurance industry 's move could mean that airliners would have to ground their fleets if governments did n't step in to provide cover for ininsurable aviation risks .
" without a state guarantee , there is a possibility that air traffic will have to be discontinued if the insurers cancel their terrorism cover , as announced , " oelssner told financial times deutschland . lufthansa has since played down fears it would have to stop its flights .
" practically , it 's rather absurd .
the airplanes wo n't stay on the ground , " thomas ellerbeck spokesman for lufthansa told reuters , adding the airline was confident a workable agreement could be found in talks with governments , insurers and the european union . " if there is no private-sector solution for european airlines , it will have to come down to a state guarantee for this particular risk , " ellerbeck said .
" this is also about fair competition across the north atlantic . "
in the us , the government already provides terrorism insurance and will do so until 2008 . " terrorism is a question of security and for us it 's a question of national security , not aviation security , " a spokeswoman for the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- , a geneva-based airlines trade association representing over 98 percent of scheduled international traffic , told reuters .
" governments should be taking on the cost burden of these activities … it 's a matter of protecting their citizens , " she said . european governments did temporarily take over terrorism insurance in the aftermath of the sept .

instead they have become the pleasure of an alarming percentage of the nation 's youth . when it comes to alcohol and tobacco consumption , germany is ailing .
with 16.7 million smokers and 1.6 million alcoholics , smoking and drinking have become so embedded in the fabric of society that it is hard to conceive of how younger generations can avoid falling prey to their addictive clutch .
truth is , tens of thousands can not . the staggering climb in both alcohol and tobacco use amongst youth groups was overlooked for too long , and although there are now some measures in place to both correct the damage already done and to prevent its continuation , there is a long way to go in protecting children from these essentially adult vices .
over the past ten years , tobacco consumption among 12-15 year-olds has almost doubled , with some 21 percent of girls and 18 percent of boys in the age group smoking regularly .
for 16-19 year-olds , the figure is 45 percent .
they 're alarming statistics , not least because smoking in germany is not actually legal until the age of 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alcopops but the country is a smokers ' paradise , with cheap cigarettes which kids can buy from machines on street corners and very few restrictions as to where it is or is not acceptable to light up .
in fact , the state of berlin broke new ground this year in implementing a ban on smoking in its schools .
it 's a move which other states are likely to follow , but for the time being children over the age of 16 can smoke in designated areas on school premises provided they present a letter of consent from their parents .
complex issues the biggest question is , if smoking is no more socially acceptable now than it was ten years ago - which it is not - why the massive rise ?
marita völker-albert , press officer for the federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- said the reasons are manifold .
" it 's different for boys and girls .
boys see it as a way of being cool , it makes them feel older and more masculine , whereas girls tend to succumb to peer-pressure and use smoking as a way of staying thin , " völker-albert told dw-world . jörg richert , managing director of karuna , an organization which helps children and young people with potential or existing addiction problems , believes there are more critical factors at play .
" social pressures created by the continual drop in living standards in germany lead to children and young adults not receiving the attention they need . when kids feel their parents are neglecting them , they try to get their attention by taking up smoking or drinking , " richert told dw-world . but he also cites another important issue as the desire of children to grow up against the backdrop of adults trying to stay young . " it is much more difficult for kids to become adults because we wear the same clothes as them , we listen to the same music , go to the same concerts - in short , we steal their identity , " richert said . so much for the reasons behind the trend , but what of the solutions ?
völker-albert believes it is crucial to get the young smokers and drinkers to discuss the potential dangers of what they are doing to their bodies .
" until they start talking to each other , there can be no critical reflection , " she said .
amongst others , the bzga already runs a campaign of sending young people to educate their contemporaries on germany 's beaches . nipping danger in the bud richert welcomes such measures .
as far as he is concerned , the only real way to the heart of the matter is to intervene in a preventative role at a very early stage , not least because of the snowball effect of early tobacco addiction .
" we now know that people who start smoking at an early age are much more likely to move on to alcohol or other addictive substances , " richert said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youngsters to talk to their contempoaries on german beaches and therein lies another problem .
although the consumption of wine and beer among youth groups has tailed off over the past years , the emergence of alcopops has had a truly explosive impact on child and youth drinking habits .
statistics from the bzga show that in 2003 almost 50 percent of young people between the ages of 14-17 were drinking alcopops at least once a month - six times more than in 1998 .
" alcopops even appeal to very young teenagers .
girls used to go out and drink coke , now they drink alcopops instead , but they do n't notice the alcohol .
young people do n't actually like alcohol , but they are seduced into liking it , " völker-albert said .
the crux of the matter last month the government introduced sweeping legislation to put up the tax on these liquor-laced , sickly sweet sodas , increasing the price of a bottle by around € 0.80 -lrb- $ 0.96 -rrb- , but whether it will actually have the desired effect remains to be seen .
" the fact that the prices have gone up wo n't change anything , except that i wo n't buy it myself , i 'll let other people buy them for me , " 16-year-old marietta told dw-world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youths drinking alcopops but the alcohol issue does not stand and fall with alcoholic soda .
although he welcomes the price hike , jörg richert believes the whole issue detracts from the real and much more existential core of the problem , which he sees as inextricably linked to declining social standards in germany , " the discussion surrounding alcopops is a distraction .
politicians should be looking at the employment market .
from january onwards , there will be 500,000 more children living from welfare benefit and the consequence will be the exorbitant increase in drug use , " he said . it 's a sombre prediction , but richert claims there is an undeniable connection between poverty and drinking , smoking and drugs .

over the past ten years , tobacco consumption among 12-15 year-olds has almost doubled , with some 21 percent of girls and 18 percent of boys in the age group smoking regularly .
for 16-19 year-olds , the figure is 45 percent .

in fact , the state of berlin broke new ground this year in implementing a ban on smoking in its schools .
it 's a move which other states are likely to follow , but for the time being children over the age of 16 can smoke in designated areas on school premises provided they present a letter of consent from their parents .
complex issues the biggest question is , if smoking is no more socially acceptable now than it was ten years ago - which it is not - why the massive rise ?
marita völker-albert , press officer for the federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- said the reasons are manifold .
" it 's different for boys and girls .
boys see it as a way of being cool , it makes them feel older and more masculine , whereas girls tend to succumb to peer-pressure and use smoking as a way of staying thin , " völker-albert told dw-world . jörg richert , managing director of karuna , an organization which helps children and young people with potential or existing addiction problems , believes there are more critical factors at play .
" social pressures created by the continual drop in living standards in germany lead to children and young adults not receiving the attention they need . when kids feel their parents are neglecting them , they try to get their attention by taking up smoking or drinking , " richert told dw-world . but he also cites another important issue as the desire of children to grow up against the backdrop of adults trying to stay young . " it is much more difficult for kids to become adults because we wear the same clothes as them , we listen to the same music , go to the same concerts - in short , we steal their identity , " richert said . so much for the reasons behind the trend , but what of the solutions ?
völker-albert believes it is crucial to get the young smokers and drinkers to discuss the potential dangers of what they are doing to their bodies .
" until they start talking to each other , there can be no critical reflection , " she said .
amongst others , the bzga already runs a campaign of sending young people to educate their contemporaries on germany 's beaches . nipping danger in the bud richert welcomes such measures .
as far as he is concerned , the only real way to the heart of the matter is to intervene in a preventative role at a very early stage , not least because of the snowball effect of early tobacco addiction .
" we now know that people who start smoking at an early age are much more likely to move on to alcohol or other addictive substances , " richert said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youngsters to talk to their contempoaries on german beaches and therein lies another problem .
although the consumption of wine and beer among youth groups has tailed off over the past years , the emergence of alcopops has had a truly explosive impact on child and youth drinking habits .
statistics from the bzga show that in 2003 almost 50 percent of young people between the ages of 14-17 were drinking alcopops at least once a month - six times more than in 1998 .
" alcopops even appeal to very young teenagers .
girls used to go out and drink coke , now they drink alcopops instead , but they do n't notice the alcohol .
young people do n't actually like alcohol , but they are seduced into liking it , " völker-albert said .
the crux of the matter last month the government introduced sweeping legislation to put up the tax on these liquor-laced , sickly sweet sodas , increasing the price of a bottle by around € 0.80 -lrb- $ 0.96 -rrb- , but whether it will actually have the desired effect remains to be seen .

but implementation promises to be far from easy . the new regulations , adopted by the european commission in july and which came into effect on monday this week , are meant to revive trade ties between the turkish and cypriot part of the divided island .
trading between the two sides came to a standstill following the division of cyprus in 1974 and has been non-existent until now . according to the eu regulations , turkish entrepreneurs in the northern part of the island can for the first time sell their products in the greek south .
from there the goods can also be exported to other eu countries without further checks and bureaucratic hurdles . the rules dictate that the goods have to comply with eu standards on food safety and plant health .
further , the turkish cypriot chamber of commerce will have to ensure that products must actually originate from northern cyprus and not turkey . the move is part of an eu package to rebuild the north 's economy and end the isolation of turkish cypriots after they voted in favour of reunification of the island in an april referendum .
however greek cypriots rejected the peace plan , allowing only the greek part of the island to join the european union . rules not free of hurdles but despite the good intentions , implementing the trade regulation will turn out to be tougher than it appears on paper . for one , all animal and agricultural products - goods with probably the most significant export potential - are excluded from the regulation as are goods originating from turkey . this week just a day after the regulation came into effect , greek cypriots sent back a turkish truckload of fish , which fell foul of the law . adrian van der meer , the eu 's representative in cyprus said the rejection of the fish by greek cypriot veterinary authorities was a regrettable necessity . " from a legal point of view the certificate of origin issued was correct because the fish originated in the northern part of cyprus , but the second clause says that no animal produce is allowed to cross , and we take a zero tolerance on this , " he told reuters . mutual trust needed in addition , turkish cypriot businessmen need a greek cypriot partner who will buy their products and sell them .
given the island 's division and troubled past , few believe it will be an easy task . " goods , whose origin is difficult to conceal such as consumer goods , will be difficult to sell in the south , " heinz kramer , cyprus expert at the science and politics foundation told dw-world . it also seems likely that greek cypriot businessmen would watch out for their interests and be wary of opening the door to possible competitors from the other end of the island . kramer said building materials and textile products count among the few goods that have a chance of being sold in the southern market .
" it will probably hardly interest anyone where his bricks are coming from , " kramer said . symbolism rather than real benefits as far as economic benefits go , hardly anyone expects the regulation to have a major impact .
flourishing trade between the two parts of the island remains an unrealistic hope . " i believe that the move is highly politically symbolic , one that 's meant to show that the north should n't be isolated .
but , its economic significance is very minimal , " kramer said . a real breakthrough in trade relations between the two parts of the divided island might instead come from a proposal that 's currently making the rounds in the eu council of ministers .
according to it , turkish cypriot products will be directly exported to the eu without a diversion via the southern greek cypriot part of the island . but it remains unclear whether the proposal will actually see the light of day .
greece and new eu member cyprus , which represents the greek part of the island , have already indicated that they are against full free trade for the north . michael knigge -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cyprus celebrates a dubious birthday thirty years after turkey invaded it , cyprus remains a divided island .

however greek cypriots rejected the peace plan , allowing only the greek part of the island to join the european union . rules not free of hurdles but despite the good intentions , implementing the trade regulation will turn out to be tougher than it appears on paper . for one , all animal and agricultural products - goods with probably the most significant export potential - are excluded from the regulation as are goods originating from turkey . this week just a day after the regulation came into effect , greek cypriots sent back a turkish truckload of fish , which fell foul of the law . adrian van der meer , the eu 's representative in cyprus said the rejection of the fish by greek cypriot veterinary authorities was a regrettable necessity .

given the island 's division and troubled past , few believe it will be an easy task . " goods , whose origin is difficult to conceal such as consumer goods , will be difficult to sell in the south , " heinz kramer , cyprus expert at the science and politics foundation told dw-world . it also seems likely that greek cypriot businessmen would watch out for their interests and be wary of opening the door to possible competitors from the other end of the island . kramer said building materials and textile products count among the few goods that have a chance of being sold in the southern market .
" it will probably hardly interest anyone where his bricks are coming from , " kramer said . symbolism rather than real benefits as far as economic benefits go , hardly anyone expects the regulation to have a major impact .

but implementation promises to be far from easy . the new regulations , adopted by the european commission in july and which came into effect on monday this week , are meant to revive trade ties between the turkish and cypriot part of the divided island .
trading between the two sides came to a standstill following the division of cyprus in 1974 and has been non-existent until now . according to the eu regulations , turkish entrepreneurs in the northern part of the island can for the first time sell their products in the greek south .
from there the goods can also be exported to other eu countries without further checks and bureaucratic hurdles . the rules dictate that the goods have to comply with eu standards on food safety and plant health .
further , the turkish cypriot chamber of commerce will have to ensure that products must actually originate from northern cyprus and not turkey . the move is part of an eu package to rebuild the north 's economy and end the isolation of turkish cypriots after they voted in favour of reunification of the island in an april referendum .

major european reinsurance companies apparently want to drop certain terrorism-related risks from aviation policies . german daily financial times deutschland reported on wednesday that several european reinsurers starting 2005 want to explicitly rule out liability in the event of attacks with nuclear , chemical and biological weapons .
they include attacks with so-called " dirty bombs " containing radioactive or other hazardous materials being detonated aboard planes or at airports . " incalculable costs " the paper said that the magnitude of claims that could result from such an attack are simply too immense for the insurance industry . " we do n't want to insure such risks any more , they 're simply incalculable , " a spokeswoman for münchener rück , the world 's largest reinsurance company told news agency ap . german insurance , banking and asset management giant allianz said it had no definite commitment to cover terrorism risks in the future . the report also said that aviation underwriters in london , which lead the insurance of most of the world 's major airlines , had already drafted a new clause earlier this year that excludes such terror risks from their standard policies , but allowed them to be written back for an extra premium . lufthansa wants governments to step in the news has rattled major european airliners , who are obliged by law and international agreements to provide insurance cover for passengers and may not fly without insurance . german national carrier lufthansa and other european airliners are now pushing for eu governments to take over liability for damages resulting from terrorism and indemnify their airlines against such an attack . lufthansa 's insurance head ralf oelssner painted a drastic scenario , saying that the reinsurance industry 's move could mean that airliners would have to ground their fleets if governments did n't step in to provide cover for ininsurable aviation risks .
" without a state guarantee , there is a possibility that air traffic will have to be discontinued if the insurers cancel their terrorism cover , as announced , " oelssner told financial times deutschland . lufthansa has since played down fears it would have to stop its flights .
" practically , it 's rather absurd .
the airplanes wo n't stay on the ground , " thomas ellerbeck spokesman for lufthansa told reuters , adding the airline was confident a workable agreement could be found in talks with governments , insurers and the european union . " if there is no private-sector solution for european airlines , it will have to come down to a state guarantee for this particular risk , " ellerbeck said .
" this is also about fair competition across the north atlantic . "
in the us , the government already provides terrorism insurance and will do so until 2008 . " terrorism is a question of security and for us it 's a question of national security , not aviation security , " a spokeswoman for the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- , a geneva-based airlines trade association representing over 98 percent of scheduled international traffic , told reuters .
" governments should be taking on the cost burden of these activities … it 's a matter of protecting their citizens , " she said . european governments did temporarily take over terrorism insurance in the aftermath of the sept .

bayer face munich in the bundesliga on saturday - and maybe in europe in the future . bayer leverkusen entertains bayern munich on saturday in the " play of the day " in the bundesliga with more than just the quest for three points and ultimately a championship title in common . on wednesday , despite losing 2-1 to banik ostrava on the night , leverkusen reached the group stage of the european champions league with a 6-2 aggregate victory and became the third german team to enter the draw on thursday along with their opponents at the weekend and current bundesliga title holders werder bremen . it has been a long road for bayer leverkusen back to the continent 's premier cup competition .
after reaching the 2002 final , where they lost 2-1 to real madrid , the team buckled under the crushing disappointment of losing narrowly out on a domestic league , cup and european treble and a little under 15 months ago were almost relegated to the second division . manager klaus augenthaler has since rebuilt the club and has now guided it back into the champions league with a new-look team stripped of stars such as michael ballack , lucio and ze roberto , all now preparing to meet their former employer on saturday as part of the bayern munich team . insummountable task for czechs in reality , it looked a dead cert that bayer would reach the champions league this year after the initial game against banik ostrava .
it would have taken a monumental effort from the czech side to overcome bayer 's 5-0 first-leg win but this did not stop them attempting it .
banik went ahead seven minutes before half-time after michal papadopulos had slipped the leverkusen defense to put his shot beyond the despairing hans-jörg butt . despite early efforts from dimitar berbatov , leverkusen looked to be coasting through the second leg in the czech republic , with the hard work already achieved in the home leg in germany .
their intent was clear from the start as leverkusen coach klaus augenthaler fielded a young side including only four of the team who so comprehensively eclipsed banik in the bayarena a week before . banik pushes young bayer side the onus was on the home side to push the visitors as they looked for an equally impressive display to overcome the lead leverkusen brought with them .
miroslav matusovic and mario licka worked well to create first half openings for banik but they could not find a way past leverkusen 's butt .
robson ponte also had a decent opportunity to put the czechs ahead but the relatively inexperienced side the germans were fielding continued to stand firm . the breakthrough came on 38 minutes when leverkusen goalkeeper butt failed to cut out a ball on the six-yard box , which was retrieved by mario licka who in turn fed papadopoulos , who found the back of the net . parity gained and lost in minutes it was n't until the 83rd minute that leverkusen achieved parity .
berbatov hauled leverkusen level after banik tried to play the bulgarian striker offside but their appeals were in vain and berbatov slotted home for the equalizer .
but the balance only remained in place for six minutes .
martin cizek 's cross for the home side found an unmarked libor zurek who notched the winner .
zurek , apparently forgetting the still huge deficit and the imminent defeat that faced his side , ripped off his shirt in celebration only to be booked by the referee for his enthusiastic display . but in the end , it was bayer leverkusen who earned the right to party .

banik went ahead seven minutes before half-time after michal papadopulos had slipped the leverkusen defense to put his shot beyond the despairing hans-jörg butt . despite early efforts from dimitar berbatov , leverkusen looked to be coasting through the second leg in the czech republic , with the hard work already achieved in the home leg in germany .
their intent was clear from the start as leverkusen coach klaus augenthaler fielded a young side including only four of the team who so comprehensively eclipsed banik in the bayarena a week before . banik pushes young bayer side the onus was on the home side to push the visitors as they looked for an equally impressive display to overcome the lead leverkusen brought with them .
miroslav matusovic and mario licka worked well to create first half openings for banik but they could not find a way past leverkusen 's butt .
robson ponte also had a decent opportunity to put the czechs ahead but the relatively inexperienced side the germans were fielding continued to stand firm . the breakthrough came on 38 minutes when leverkusen goalkeeper butt failed to cut out a ball on the six-yard box , which was retrieved by mario licka who in turn fed papadopoulos , who found the back of the net . parity gained and lost in minutes it was n't until the 83rd minute that leverkusen achieved parity .
berbatov hauled leverkusen level after banik tried to play the bulgarian striker offside but their appeals were in vain and berbatov slotted home for the equalizer .
but the balance only remained in place for six minutes .
martin cizek 's cross for the home side found an unmarked libor zurek who notched the winner .
zurek , apparently forgetting the still huge deficit and the imminent defeat that faced his side , ripped off his shirt in celebration only to be booked by the referee for his enthusiastic display . but in the end , it was bayer leverkusen who earned the right to party .

authorities said they believe the ship set sail from a libyan port .
it 's an all-too-familiar scenario .
italian officials estimate some two million people are currently waiting to cross the mediterranean from libya , which attracts a steady flow of illegal immigrants from africa and asia .
to many , italy represents a passageway to the rest of europe .
co-operation needed during his talks with colonel gadhafi , berlusconi stressed the problem was neither libyan nor italian only , but needed the co-operation of both europe and africa . in early august , italy agreed to train libyan police with a long-term view to launching joint air , sea and land patrols .
italy also recently called on the eu to help in the effort to battle illegal immigration by relaxing the embargo against libya so that it could buy military equipment to help clamp down on the problem of human smuggling by increasing patrols along its borders . gadhafi 's rehabilitation gadhafi , a pariah for much of his 34-year rule because of his links to international terrorism , has won back much credibility after announcing in 2003 that he would abandon the pursuit of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons . berlusconi was the first western leader to meet gadhafi after the announcement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.08.2004 revival of trade ties remains tricky in cyprus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the island of cyprus is still marked by borders and separations new eu regulations introduced this week allow ethnically divided greeks and turks in cyprus to resume trade ties .
but implementation promises to be far from easy . the new regulations , adopted by the european commission in july and which came into effect on monday this week , are meant to revive trade ties between the turkish and cypriot part of the divided island .
trading between the two sides came to a standstill following the division of cyprus in 1974 and has been non-existent until now . according to the eu regulations , turkish entrepreneurs in the northern part of the island can for the first time sell their products in the greek south .
from there the goods can also be exported to other eu countries without further checks and bureaucratic hurdles . the rules dictate that the goods have to comply with eu standards on food safety and plant health .
further , the turkish cypriot chamber of commerce will have to ensure that products must actually originate from northern cyprus and not turkey . the move is part of an eu package to rebuild the north 's economy and end the isolation of turkish cypriots after they voted in favour of reunification of the island in an april referendum .
however greek cypriots rejected the peace plan , allowing only the greek part of the island to join the european union . rules not free of hurdles but despite the good intentions , implementing the trade regulation will turn out to be tougher than it appears on paper . for one , all animal and agricultural products - goods with probably the most significant export potential - are excluded from the regulation as are goods originating from turkey . this week just a day after the regulation came into effect , greek cypriots sent back a turkish truckload of fish , which fell foul of the law . adrian van der meer , the eu 's representative in cyprus said the rejection of the fish by greek cypriot veterinary authorities was a regrettable necessity . " from a legal point of view the certificate of origin issued was correct because the fish originated in the northern part of cyprus , but the second clause says that no animal produce is allowed to cross , and we take a zero tolerance on this , " he told reuters . mutual trust needed in addition , turkish cypriot businessmen need a greek cypriot partner who will buy their products and sell them .

but implementation promises to be far from easy . the new regulations , adopted by the european commission in july and which came into effect on monday this week , are meant to revive trade ties between the turkish and cypriot part of the divided island .
trading between the two sides came to a standstill following the division of cyprus in 1974 and has been non-existent until now . according to the eu regulations , turkish entrepreneurs in the northern part of the island can for the first time sell their products in the greek south .
from there the goods can also be exported to other eu countries without further checks and bureaucratic hurdles . the rules dictate that the goods have to comply with eu standards on food safety and plant health .
further , the turkish cypriot chamber of commerce will have to ensure that products must actually originate from northern cyprus and not turkey . the move is part of an eu package to rebuild the north 's economy and end the isolation of turkish cypriots after they voted in favour of reunification of the island in an april referendum .
however greek cypriots rejected the peace plan , allowing only the greek part of the island to join the european union . rules not free of hurdles but despite the good intentions , implementing the trade regulation will turn out to be tougher than it appears on paper . for one , all animal and agricultural products - goods with probably the most significant export potential - are excluded from the regulation as are goods originating from turkey . this week just a day after the regulation came into effect , greek cypriots sent back a turkish truckload of fish , which fell foul of the law . adrian van der meer , the eu 's representative in cyprus said the rejection of the fish by greek cypriot veterinary authorities was a regrettable necessity . " from a legal point of view the certificate of origin issued was correct because the fish originated in the northern part of cyprus , but the second clause says that no animal produce is allowed to cross , and we take a zero tolerance on this , " he told reuters . mutual trust needed in addition , turkish cypriot businessmen need a greek cypriot partner who will buy their products and sell them .

authorities said they believe the ship set sail from a libyan port .
it 's an all-too-familiar scenario .
italian officials estimate some two million people are currently waiting to cross the mediterranean from libya , which attracts a steady flow of illegal immigrants from africa and asia .
to many , italy represents a passageway to the rest of europe .
co-operation needed during his talks with colonel gadhafi , berlusconi stressed the problem was neither libyan nor italian only , but needed the co-operation of both europe and africa . in early august , italy agreed to train libyan police with a long-term view to launching joint air , sea and land patrols .
italy also recently called on the eu to help in the effort to battle illegal immigration by relaxing the embargo against libya so that it could buy military equipment to help clamp down on the problem of human smuggling by increasing patrols along its borders . gadhafi 's rehabilitation gadhafi , a pariah for much of his 34-year rule because of his links to international terrorism , has won back much credibility after announcing in 2003 that he would abandon the pursuit of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons . berlusconi was the first western leader to meet gadhafi after the announcement .
since then , the leader has undergone a surprise rehabilitation among countries that cold-shouldered his government for years , welcoming british prime minister tony blair in march this year and embarking on an historic visit to brussels several weeks later .
the same month , the us lifted sanctions , making the opec member once again a lucrative destination for western energy companies . a close relationship as libya 's main trading partner , italy has played a key role in re-integrating the north african state into the international community . italy occupied the oil-rich country from 1911 to 1943 and suffered a bloody uprising in 1915 in the port city of sirte , gadhafi 's home-town , 500 km east of the capital tripoli .
wednesday 's talks also included discussion of libya 's long-standing request for italian reparations for decades of occupation . the trip was not without controversy .
the italian prime minister ignored militant threats to unleash a " jihad " on the north african state if his trip went ahead .
other islamist groups also recently threatened to attack italy in retaliation for its presence in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libyan leader pitches tent in brussels meeting with eu leaders tuesday , moammar gadhafi makes his first visit to europe in 15 years .

posters and postcards featuring spoof cosmetic images will be distributed in pubs and coffee shops from next month .
women are being advised to drink no more than two to three units per day compared with three to four for men .
sickness the campaign warns women who binge-drink may gain weight , suffer broken veins under the skin 's surface , and bloodshot eyes .
it adds they risk injuring themselves while drunk , will smell of alcohol and are more vulnerable to alcohol-related illnesses than men .
the group is using an image of a spoof cosmetic called masq creme de regret and a bottle with a logo of a woman holding her head while vomiting , to get the message across .
jean coussins , chief executive of the portman group , said : " the facts speak for themselves : among young women aged 16 to 24 , the proportion drinking more than 35 units per week has more than tripled , rising from 3 % in 1998 to 10 % in 2002 .
" binge-drinking plays havoc with your skin as it dehydrates .
" drinking too much also interrupts your beauty sleep which means you may not look your best the next day . "

" women are being targeted by retailers and alcohol producers more than ever before , in specific ways - be it by targeting their appearance or image .
" if the industry wants to be serious about making women drink at less harmful levels , they need to embrace that problem too and not just launch this campaign . "

a crackdown on motorists in folkestone and hythe who ignore the law starts on thursday after residents complained about a rise in the problem .
people who flout the rules and park either partly or completely on the pavement will face fixed penalty fines .
police said parking in such a way was selfish , dangerous and also expensive to repair pavements damaged by cars .
pc andy mundy said : " this type of selfish behaviour is not only dangerous to pedestrians who , on many occasions have to walk into the road to get around the vehicles , but it is also extremely expensive to shepway council and kent highways .
" pavements are not constructed to take the weight of vehicles and a substantial amount of damage is caused by drivers who insist on parking their cars on the pavement . "

claire 's south london school was deemed to be failing and was closed down after she completed year 10 -lrb- the first year of gcse courses -rrb- .
with low predictions and a sense of disillusion , claire and some of her peers were taken on by lewisham college where tutors devised a special course to accommodate their particular needs .
the " k4 " programme developed the teenagers ' key skills , but , having had so much disruption in their education , they were not due to be entered for gcses .
just do n't worry claire goodwin on merit , however , claire and some others were entered for maths and english and claire achieved two grade cs , then went on to sit her a-levels .
claire says while it is easy to think gcse success is the be all and end all , candidates who do not do well should not panic and look at all other options .
" just do n't worry .
my mindset was that if you did n't pass my gcses you have n't got anything and people drummed that into me .
it 's as though it 's your path to life , " says claire .

' not the end of the world ' claire goodwin , 18 , sat a-levels in english , media studies and psychology this summer and hopes to go on to university after a year off to study advertising .
claire now hopes to head off to university but two years ago she had just two gcses at grade c to her name .
claire 's south london school was deemed to be failing and was closed down after she completed year 10 -lrb- the first year of gcse courses -rrb- .
with low predictions and a sense of disillusion , claire and some of her peers were taken on by lewisham college where tutors devised a special course to accommodate their particular needs .
the " k4 " programme developed the teenagers ' key skills , but , having had so much disruption in their education , they were not due to be entered for gcses .
just do n't worry claire goodwin on merit , however , claire and some others were entered for maths and english and claire achieved two grade cs , then went on to sit her a-levels .
claire says while it is easy to think gcse success is the be all and end all , candidates who do not do well should not panic and look at all other options .
" just do n't worry .
my mindset was that if you did n't pass my gcses you have n't got anything and people drummed that into me .
it 's as though it 's your path to life , " says claire .
" but they really do n't need to worry , there are always other courses you can do , a-levels are n't the only thing .
" it 's just not the end of the world . "

she recommended lydia be entered for an international gcse after coming top of her class in almost every subject .

" english is her first language .

there were two versions of the portuguese igcse - one as a second language , the other as a first language .
lydia sat the latter , harder one .
nigel said : " it was like a 13 year old in england doing an english language gcse .

lydia 's school - the espaco verde , or green school - is far-removed from that of most gcse students .
it is set in a reserve area of rainforest , 2,500 metres above sea level , surrounding an old colonial building .
the nine pupils in lydia 's class start lessons at 7.30am and finish at 12.30pm , while the academic year runs from january to december .
nigel said : " it 's been a valuable experience for her .
it 's very different from home .
the system here is normally quite old-fashioned in the way subjects are taught .
" but lydia 's schools is very down-to-earth .

the family to brazil eight years ago , to work with street children , and will return to northern ireland later this year .
in autumn 2005 , lydia is expected - like other children - to start the rest of her gcses .

a ground-breaking ceremony marks the start of a £ 9m scheme at chilton , near spennymoor .
work should be finished by july 2006 .
a bypass for the area was first suggested as long ago as 1939 .
the 2.3km stretch of single-carriageway will remove about 80 % of the 18,000 vehicles which now pass through the village every day .
durham county councillor george porter was sending the diggers into action to start work on the bypass , with the help of local schoolchildren .
road safety he said : " a bypass was first proposed as long ago as 1939 by the department of transport .
" but nothing ever came of the idea .
" we 've had to wait 65 years for the bypass , but it will be well worth it in terms of improving road safety and the environment . "
the single carriageway bypass will leave the roundabout junction of the a167 and a689 at rushyford and go to the west of chilton via west chilton terrace returning to the existing a167 at west close , south of ferryhill .
as well as alleviating traffic congestion , the bypass will boost pedestrian safety and improve air quality in the village .
road users will also benefit from a 20 % reduction in journey time on the busy section of the a167 .

belgium may not be internationally renowned for its rock stars , but ron " bucketbutt " van den branden is aiming to improve its standing in the music world .
ron is belgium 's entry in the air guitar world championships after impressing judges in his home nation .
wrapped in cellophane with a rubber glove adorning his head , ron sent the crowd wild with his " sci-fi influenced " fingerwork .
air guitar rules the instrument must be invisible - ie , air an air guitarist may play an electric guitar or an acoustic one - or both personal air roadies are allowed , but backing groups -lrb- real or air -rrb- are not the winner must carry the joyful tidings of the air guitar forward - thus promoting world peace .
he will now line up alongside 14 more imaginary guitar heroes from around the globe in finland on thursday and friday .
they include new zealander tarquin " the tarkness " keys , holland 's michael " destroyer " heffels , finland 's own " doctor " david nystrom and us competitor miri " sonyk rok " park - the first woman to win a national contest .
for the uninitiated , air guitar is the art of pretending to play along to a rock solo or a chord sequence with nothing but an imaginary guitar and the appropriate facial expressions .
" what air guitar is all about is to surrender to the music without having an actual instrument , " says championship organiser martika lamberg .
" anyone can taste rock stardom by playing the air guitar .
no equipment is needed , and there is no requirement for any specific place or special skills .
" in air guitar playing , all people are equal regardless of race , gender , age , social status or sexual orientation . "
competitors try to seek out the angus young within what began as a guilty secret practised before suburban bedroom mirrors by the odd heavy metal fan has turned into a cheerful yet competitive global showcase enjoyed by thousands .
the highlight of a music video festival held every year in oulu , finland , it attracts spandex-wearers in their droves .
finalists must perform a compulsory one-minute song - which they do not hear until just before the final - as well as a song of their own choice .
there is no dress code and extra props , such as a guitar pick , may be used .
contestants can strum or finger pick .
air guitar ideology all wars would end and every bad thing would disappear if all the people in the world played air guitar a person playing air guitar can not simultaneously be up to any mischief after playing air guitar , mischief just does not seem like such a good idea anymore judges are looking for originality , the ability to be taken over by the music , stage charisma , technique , artistic impression and - it goes without saying - " airness " .
winners get a -lrb- real -rrb- handmade flying finn electric guitar worth 2,500 euros -lrb- £ 1,650 -rrb- and the contest is streamed live on the internet .
this year 's uk hopeful is 24-year-old jeremy chick , a music promoter and led zeppelin fan from wimbledon , south-west london .
a video of jeremy performing walk by pantera while jumping around in a frilly retro shirt and afro wig was enough to convince organisers of his air potential .
he will reveal his inner jimmy page to edited highlights of led zeppelin 's whole lotta love and stairway to heaven .
air guitar idols jimi hendrix angus young eddie van halen gary moore brian may the climax to jeremy 's routine is an approximation of the who axeman pete townsend smashing his instrument during my generation .
" the guitar solo has n't been held in such high esteem since punk and garage rock , but i do n't think it should be frowned upon , " he says .
" i 'm doing this for the fun and the experience , but you ca n't come here and expect to make an absolute mess of it .
" there 's a level of skill and passion , and you have got to respect the performers . "

belgium may not be internationally renowned for its rock stars , but ron " bucketbutt " van den branden is aiming to improve its standing in the music world .
ron is belgium 's entry in the air guitar world championships after impressing judges in his home nation .
wrapped in cellophane with a rubber glove adorning his head , ron sent the crowd wild with his " sci-fi influenced " fingerwork .
air guitar rules the instrument must be invisible - ie , air an air guitarist may play an electric guitar or an acoustic one - or both personal air roadies are allowed , but backing groups -lrb- real or air -rrb- are not the winner must carry the joyful tidings of the air guitar forward - thus promoting world peace .
he will now line up alongside 14 more imaginary guitar heroes from around the globe in finland on thursday and friday .
they include new zealander tarquin " the tarkness " keys , holland 's michael " destroyer " heffels , finland 's own " doctor " david nystrom and us competitor miri " sonyk rok " park - the first woman to win a national contest .
for the uninitiated , air guitar is the art of pretending to play along to a rock solo or a chord sequence with nothing but an imaginary guitar and the appropriate facial expressions .
" what air guitar is all about is to surrender to the music without having an actual instrument , " says championship organiser martika lamberg .
" anyone can taste rock stardom by playing the air guitar .
no equipment is needed , and there is no requirement for any specific place or special skills .
" in air guitar playing , all people are equal regardless of race , gender , age , social status or sexual orientation . "
what began as a guilty secret practised before suburban bedroom mirrors by the odd heavy metal fan has turned into a cheerful yet competitive global showcase enjoyed by thousands .
the highlight of a music video festival held every year in oulu , finland , it attracts spandex-wearers in their droves .
finalists must perform a compulsory one-minute song - which they do not hear until just before the final - as well as a song of their own choice .
there is no dress code and extra props , such as a guitar pick , may be used .
contestants can strum or finger pick .
air guitar ideology all wars would end and every bad thing would disappear if all the people in the world played air guitar a person playing air guitar can not simultaneously be up to any mischief after playing air guitar , mischief just does not seem like such a good idea anymore judges are looking for originality , the ability to be taken over by the music , stage charisma , technique , artistic impression and - it goes without saying - " airness " .
winners get a -lrb- real -rrb- handmade flying finn electric guitar worth 2,500 euros -lrb- £ 1,650 -rrb- and the contest is streamed live on the internet .
this year 's uk hopeful is 24-year-old jeremy chick , a music promoter and led zeppelin fan from wimbledon , south-west london .
a video of jeremy performing walk by pantera while jumping around in a frilly retro shirt and afro wig was enough to convince organisers of his air potential .
he will reveal his inner jimmy page to edited highlights of led zeppelin 's whole lotta love and stairway to heaven .
air guitar idols jimi hendrix angus young eddie van halen gary moore brian may the climax to jeremy 's routine is an approximation of the who axeman pete townsend smashing his instrument during my generation .
" the guitar solo has n't been held in such high esteem since punk and garage rock , but i do n't think it should be frowned upon , " he says .
" i 'm doing this for the fun and the experience , but you ca n't come here and expect to make an absolute mess of it .
" there 's a level of skill and passion , and you have got to respect the performers . "

the inquiry will determine if proposals to restart coal mining at ffos-y-fran in merthyr tydfil should go ahead .
the 12-day welsh assembly inquiry will open on 7 september into the plans by miller argent .
if the scheme is approved , more than 10 million tonnes of coal will be extracted from the area over 15 years .
the coal is expected to be sold to nearby aberthaw power station , and the developers have promised to pay more than £ 6m in royalties to the local council to be spent on public schemes .
however , local people have voiced strong objections to the plans .
fears about the effect on health , the devaluation of houses and the impact it will have on inward investment to the town have been raised by people opposed to the scheme .
a 1,000-signature petition was collected by members of the merthyr tydfil anti-opencast alliance against the plans .
but the scheme has had the backing of the transport and general workers union , which says that vital jobs will be brought to the area if the plans are approved .
they say that 200 jobs will be created as a direct result of the scheme , with a further 400 contractor jobs being made .
the public inquiry will open on 7 september at the bessemer club , high street , dowlais at 1000bst .

the inquiry will determine if proposals to restart coal mining at ffos-y-fran in merthyr tydfil should go ahead .
the 12-day welsh assembly inquiry will open on 7 september into the plans by miller argent .
if the scheme is approved , more than 10 million tonnes of coal will be extracted from the area over 15 years .
the coal is expected to be sold to nearby aberthaw power station , and the developers have promised to pay more than £ 6m in royalties to the local council to be spent on public schemes .
however , local people have voiced strong objections to the plans .
fears about the effect on health , the devaluation of houses and the impact it will have on inward investment to the town have been raised by people opposed to the scheme .
a 1,000-signature petition was collected by members of the merthyr tydfil anti-opencast alliance against the plans .
but the scheme has had the backing of the transport and general workers union , which says that vital jobs will be brought to the area if the plans are approved .
they say that 200 jobs will be created as a direct result of the scheme , with a further 400 contractor jobs being made .
the public inquiry will open on 7 september at the bessemer club , high street , dowlais at 1000bst .

but , according to kensington and chelsea council , it is not everyone 's cup of tea with some of the area 's older residents overwhelmed by the enormity of the event .
so this year they are whisking 40 people away to stay at a butlins holiday camp in bognor regis over the august bank holiday weekend .
alice marshall , 64 , and her husband darnley , 70 , have lived in weston park road for 40 years . "
to be quite honest they could take us anywhere as long as it 's away from london " resident alice marshall mrs marshall remembers the first carnival but finds the huge numbers of people that swarm to the event nowadays too much to cope with .
she told bbc news online : " there are so many strangers in this area during carnival and it 's so noisy with the sound systems that the whole house shakes .
it 's quite stressful .
" when it first started it was just one lorry taking the children around but now it has got so big . "
mrs marshall says being given the chance to get out of notting hill during carnival is " absolutely wonderful " .
" to be quite honest they could take us anywhere as long as it 's away from london , " she said .
three-night break " you always get people knocking on the doors wanting to have some water , or warm their baby 's milk up or use your toilet , but you just ca n't have strangers wondering around your house .
" i think it would be better to put carnival in a big park , like party in the park .
then people would n't be so squashed together and would be able to see more . "
councillor david campion said that although the three-night break is being paid for by the council this year , they want carnival sponsors to cover the cost in future .
the council is stumping up £ 13,000 for the transport and accommodation but those attending have to provide their own spending money .
mr campion said : " in the past people have been shot and killed which has given carnival a bad name and sponsors have disappeared as they do n't want to be associated with it .
" thanks to the police we have n't had anything like that for a number of years so i think the sponsors will come back and provide more finance . "
mr campion said the trip was a way of making amends with the locals whose streets host the event .
he said : " it 's not the people living on the route who suffer but those who are in the middle of it where the sound systems are .
not only do you get the noise from the system but you also get large groups of people around it .
" the idea has been around for many years and it started because the roads were packed and the meals on wheels could n't get through to help those who are vulnerable . "
' symbol of multiculturalism ' chris mullard , chairman of the london notting hill carnival ltd , said the trip showed support for the carnival as well as care for the borough 's older residents .
he said organisers tried to keep disturbance down to a minimum during the weekend .
mr mullard explained : " what we hope is that the weekend , the music and its multicultural impact have a long-term effect in the area , making it more tolerant , more aware of different traditions and more attractive to people wishing to come to live in the area .
" so as long as adequate provision is made for those who wish to leave the area during the weekend , the carnival must be seen as a major symbol of multiculturalism for notting hill and beyond . "
a butlins spokeswoman said the visitors will be able to relax over the weekend in bognor regis .

" to be quite honest they could take us anywhere as long as it 's away from london , " she said .
three-night break " you always get people knocking on the doors wanting to have some water , or warm their baby 's milk up or use your toilet , but you just ca n't have strangers wondering around your house .
" i think it would be better to put carnival in a big park , like party in the park .
then people would n't be so squashed together and would be able to see more . "
councillor david campion said that although the three-night break is being paid for by the council this year , they want carnival sponsors to cover the cost in future .
the council is stumping up £ 13,000 for the transport and accommodation but those attending have to provide their own spending money .
butlins says the visitors will be able to have a relaxing time mr campion said : " in the past people have been shot and killed which has given carnival a bad name and sponsors have disappeared as they do n't want to be associated with it .
" thanks to the police we have n't had anything like that for a number of years so i think the sponsors will come back and provide more finance . "
mr campion said the trip was a way of making amends with the locals whose streets host the event .
he said : " it 's not the people living on the route who suffer but those who are in the middle of it where the sound systems are .
not only do you get the noise from the system but you also get large groups of people around it .
" the idea has been around for many years and it started because the roads were packed and the meals on wheels could n't get through to help those who are vulnerable . "
' symbol of multiculturalism ' chris mullard , chairman of the london notting hill carnival ltd , said the trip showed support for the carnival as well as care for the borough 's older residents .
he said organisers tried to keep disturbance down to a minimum during the weekend .
mr mullard explained : " what we hope is that the weekend , the music and its multicultural impact have a long-term effect in the area , making it more tolerant , more aware of different traditions and more attractive to people wishing to come to live in the area .
" so as long as adequate provision is made for those who wish to leave the area during the weekend , the carnival must be seen as a major symbol of multiculturalism for notting hill and beyond . "
a butlins spokeswoman said the visitors will be able to relax over the weekend in bognor regis .

councillor david campion said that although the three-night break is being paid for by the council this year , they want carnival sponsors to cover the cost in future .
the council is stumping up £ 13,000 for the transport and accommodation but those attending have to provide their own spending money .
butlins says the visitors will be able to have a relaxing time mr campion said : " in the past people have been shot and killed which has given carnival a bad name and sponsors have disappeared as they do n't want to be associated with it .
" thanks to the police we have n't had anything like that for a number of years so i think the sponsors will come back and provide more finance . "
mr campion said the trip was a way of making amends with the locals whose streets host the event .
he said : " it 's not the people living on the route who suffer but those who are in the middle of it where the sound systems are .
not only do you get the noise from the system but you also get large groups of people around it .
" the idea has been around for many years and it started because the roads were packed and the meals on wheels could n't get through to help those who are vulnerable . "
' symbol of multiculturalism ' chris mullard , chairman of the london notting hill carnival ltd , said the trip showed support for the carnival as well as care for the borough 's older residents .
he said organisers tried to keep disturbance down to a minimum during the weekend .
mr mullard explained : " what we hope is that the weekend , the music and its multicultural impact have a long-term effect in the area , making it more tolerant , more aware of different traditions and more attractive to people wishing to come to live in the area .
" so as long as adequate provision is made for those who wish to leave the area during the weekend , the carnival must be seen as a major symbol of multiculturalism for notting hill and beyond . "
a butlins spokeswoman said the visitors will be able to relax over the weekend in bognor regis .
