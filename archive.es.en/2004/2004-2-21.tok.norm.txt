the federal office for radiation protection -lrb- bfs -rrb- has called for the shut-down of five german nuclear energy plants because they lack sufficient protection against terror attacks . of germany 's 18 nuclear power plants , the five plants are most vulnerable in case of a terror attack involving planes such as the sept .

germany 's largest shipping port - the eighth busiest in the world - has installed security cameras , id and x-ray scanners as part of the international ship and port facility security code , agreed on by the united states in 2002 .

carnival in the rhineland culminates this week , but germany 's economic downturn has created problems for the region 's carnival associations .
with reduced government support and donations , many face an existential crisis . during the days of carnival , liquor flows freely as do the euros when millions are joining in the parades and street parties of germany 's largest public event .
countless bars and restaurants are full and of visitors flock to the rhineland for the six days of festivities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the star attraction is always the carnival associations , with their elaborately decorated floats and extravagant costumes .
they include everything from neighborhood groups to social groups , including gays and lesbians .
most dress as 18th century french soldiers -lrb- photo -rrb- - a mocking gesture to the region 's former occupier . for a long time now , carnival has been an important part of the economy in the cities and towns in the rhineland and along the main river .
but with a flagging economy in germany and diminished purchasing power , people are more reluctant to shell out money for costumes , beer and the expensive parties hosted by carnival associations .
that 's created a crisis for the groups . fewer sales , fewer subsidies " in cologne , where the biggest carnival celebrations are held , some groups are really having trouble this year , " said franz wolf , president of the german carnival association .
" at some of the events only 80 percent of the tickets were sold and empty tables could be found .
those are the first indications that something is wrong . " wolf does n't believe the economy has anything to do with it . " in my opinion , what the hospitality industry did after the change from the deutsch mark to the euro was impossible , " he said .
" in many cases , they just kept the deutsche mark price and put a euro sign in front of it making things twice as expensive .
nobody can pay the new prices . " in some places there are empty halls , empty bars , and even empty cash registers .
with lower tax revenues pouring in , many cities have also reduced the amount of subsidies they give to the different carnival associations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then german labor minister walter riester is pictured tortured as he appears during the 2001carnival parade in düsseldorf .
donations to the groups have also dropped and they 're having trouble making ends meet .
the average carnival association spends about € 400,000 -lrb- $ 506,000 -rrb- each year for everything from candy that 's tossed to crowds during parades to portable restrooms . an industry worth billions in order to plug the holes in their budgets , the associations have started doing what sporting event organizers have long been doing : they 're charging tv stations for the rights to broadcast their annual parties , which are often filled with celebrities and politicians . public broadcaster wdr in north-rhine-westphalia recently purchased the exclusive rights to broadcast massive rose monday parade in cologne .
other broadcasters are limited to covering the event in news reports . wdr is rumored to have paid in the seven figures for those rights .

after years of all-out war against the rise of denglish -lrb- a mixture of german and english -rrb- , the institute for german language -lrb- vds -rrb- - self-appointed guardian of the sanctity of german language - is celebrating .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going german at mcdonald 's " we have detected a trend reversal , " walter krämer , chairman of the vds told dpa news agency .

but rather than a sense of loyalty and pride towards its own native language - a sentiment more in keeping with international mother language day - it 's pragmatic concerns that have fuelled the german advertising industry 's recourse to german .
tobias mindner , vds press spokesman pointed out that advertising gurus in germany had found in a study that most of its target audience did n't understand slick english one-liners .
indeed the recent representative study concluded that 59 percent of those surveyed could n't correctly translate mcdonald 's every time a good time into german .
the same went for mitsubishi 's slogan drive alive .
just 18 percent understood it as " lively driving " in german , the rest interpreted it as " survive the drive in our car " - a potentially damaging promo for the carmaker .

" no to denglish " the onslaught of so-called denglish is apparent not just in germany 's advertising and business world , but increasingly in almost all walks of life and it is n't just irking language experts .
a group of senior citizens in the bavarian city of nuremberg recently started a " no to denglish " signature campaign .
magda schleip , a member , told daily süddeutsche zeitung , " older people only understand fragments of what politicians , advertising gurus and media tell them everyday . "

opinion : desperately ditching denglish europe battles english invasion should german be cleansed of " denglish " ? culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.02.2004 deutsch please , we 're german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe bilingual is the way to go ?
as the world celebrates international mother language day on saturday , germany 's language purists bemoan the relentless onslaught of denglish .
but a german watchdog has hinted that a turnabout might be in sight . when burger giant mcdonald 's recently dropped its famous english slogan " everytime a good time " for its tv advertisement in germany and replaced it with a very german " ich liebe es " -lrb- i 'm lovin ' it -rrb- , an audible whoop of joy was heard in the language purist camp in the country .
after years of all-out war against the rise of denglish -lrb- a mixture of german and english -rrb- , the institute for german language -lrb- vds -rrb- - self-appointed guardian of the sanctity of german language - is celebrating .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going german at mcdonald 's " we have detected a trend reversal , " walter krämer , chairman of the vds told dpa news agency .
" the fast-food chain mcdonald 's is once again advertising in german for its products , even other companies and concerns have rediscovered german for their slogans , " he said .
understand english ?
but rather than a sense of loyalty and pride towards its own native language - a sentiment more in keeping with international mother language day - it 's pragmatic concerns that have fuelled the german advertising industry 's recourse to german .
tobias mindner , vds press spokesman pointed out that advertising gurus in germany had found in a study that most of its target audience did n't understand slick english one-liners .
indeed the recent representative study concluded that 59 percent of those surveyed could n't correctly translate mcdonald 's every time a good time into german .
the same went for mitsubishi 's slogan drive alive .
just 18 percent understood it as " lively driving " in german , the rest interpreted it as " survive the drive in our car " - a potentially damaging promo for the carmaker .
the participants were all aged between 14 and 59 - a target group that 's considered the biggest spender and thus the most promising for the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw calls on customers to " dress your car , " but what 's that supposed to mean , exactly ?
" a much smaller percentage of people in germany speak english than is generally assumed , " mindner told dw-world .
" just about ten percent speak and really understand it well .
so you ca n't really just use snazzy english phrases and enthuse people for products , when they do n't really get the message , " he added .
spectacular moves to clean up german the vds has been up in arms against the encroachment of english words in the german language for the past six years and is known for its often eccentric ways to achieve its aim .
last year the watchdog symbolically auctioned the german language on ebay .
within two days , the highest bid lay above ten million euro , following which the internet auction site stopped the trade .
the organization also attempted to sue the supervisory board of deutsche telekom for its " nonsensical use " of english words like city call , holiday plus tarif and german call .
the institute also awards a prize for the sprachpanscher -lrb- language debaser -rrb- of the year .
" no to denglish " the onslaught of so-called denglish is apparent not just in germany 's advertising and business world , but increasingly in almost all walks of life and it is n't just irking language experts .
a group of senior citizens in the bavarian city of nuremberg recently started a " no to denglish " signature campaign .
magda schleip , a member , told daily süddeutsche zeitung , " older people only understand fragments of what politicians , advertising gurus and media tell them everyday . "
schleip added that the problem was even more acute for the unemployed .
" the federal labor agency only talks about job centers , cluster building , clearing offices , " she said .
" which unemployed person understands that ? "
awareness the key ?
though politicians - who are prey to denglish themselves -lrb- task force , road show , pre-events -rrb- - are clear it 's impossible to enforce laws to cleanse german , it 's generally agreed that awareness is the best way to counter the malaise .
thus the bavarian education ministry has announced that it has urged schools to " take special responsibility for the german language " on feb .
21 , the international mother language day .

the moma exhibition opened in berlin on friday .
dw-tv talked to peter-klaus schuster , director general of the city of berlin 's state museums , about his work as well as the event . thanks very much for joining us today , mr schuster .
now if my math is up to much then you are in charge of no fewer than sixteen separate museums and galleries .
it ’ s an impressive total , among them are some of the most prestigious in the world .
it 's no surprise therefore , i 've got a quote , that you have been described by one source at least as being " the most powerful museum administrator in the world " .
is that how it feels to you ?
not really , we feel much more modest .
but you 're right , there are sixteen museums in one museum institution , this makes the state museum of berlin so unique .
if you compare it to london that would mean the british museum , the tate museum the national gallery all in one museum .
it 's a big job you 've got , and it 's a big year you 've got coming up in 2004 .
foremost amongst the attractions we can look forward to is the moma , the legendary museum of modern art based in new york is coming to berlin to put on display 200 masterpieces of modern european art .
it 's a very exciting prospect , how did it come about ?
the idea was to give the museum of modern art seven months somewhere and where should it be ?
and they said , let 's make tokyo , madrid and all this and then they considered it from the point of history and said let 's go back to berlin to a place where somehow our roots are .
the very beginning of the moma as an ideal concept was in berlin with the national gallery and with the bauhaus in germany .
so coming back and also coming back to mies van der rohe .
in this building , mies van der rohe is somehow the architect of the moma .
so the modernist project comes back to berlin .
that 's it and for seven and more months , this is much more than an exhibition .
it 's a manifestation of modernism .
the point is the moma is coming back to the beginning and berlin is coming back to modernism .
you see modernism or modern art in berlin , in germany too , is also a disaster with all that we had with the degenerated art and all that .
art described as degenerative by the nazis .
yes , and now we have the collection of modernism in this building , a temple of modernity . it 's a great prospect , but there 's more to it than meets the eye , perhaps because there 's also a political aspect to it all as well .
the co-patrons of the exhibition are joschka fischer , the german foreign minister , and colin powell , his american counter-part .
there 's been a lot of turbulence on the diplomatic level between germany and america in recent times let 's say .
is there an element of cultural fence mending going on here ?
it 's a manifestation of real understanding a deep friendship in the cultural field .
there 's not so much trouble and confusion as in the political field .
berlin is always looking with love to new york .
berlin always likes to be compared with new york , berlin likes to be the other new york .
and there 's more coming up in 2004 than just to moma exhibition , what else is bubbling ?
we will open the helmut newton museum , the helmut newton foundation .
it 's an artist coming from berlin and becoming international in paris , london , new york .
and so you see this cosmopolitan - this side of berlin , to re-establish this and this is in the middle of the year .
towards the end of the year we have the collection of frederic christian flick , the “ mick flick collection ” of very contemporary art in our museum of contemporary art , the hamburger bahnhof , and so you have the beginning of the classical modern with the moma and then you have how modernism ends with the very contemporary .
and so you could say that berlin is somehow a little bit of the cultural capital in 2004 - luckily . berlin the cultural capital of europe perhaps , berlin the cultural capital of germany maybe .
let me put another quote to you .
berlin , you have said yourself , is a showcase for the nation , for the german nation .
what does that mean ?
the awareness of germany is very difficult with the different länders . the federal states ?
yes , and this very important capital areas like munich , hamburg , stuttgart and all these .
and then almost you have the question where is germany ?
as what is really relevant or who can demonstrate a figure from germany .
and at the very end there is now berlin - the new capital of this united germany and this tremendously large museum complex .
and so you get an awareness of germany and it 's somehow that the international audience is expecting .
the international audience maybe , but there are many in germany in many of the other german cities hamburg , munich , frankfurt perhaps they 're not happy about berlin being the featured german city , not necessarily so .
well the point is that ten-fifteen years ago we always said berlin was the showcase of the free western society .
west berlin ?
yeah , and everybody was glad about this and now i think we have this free society and we should make the best of it and we should develop a good feeling .
and for all these other cities we are now somehow at the stage , for bavaria and saxony for example , in berlin , to be seen by an international audience .
see after the flood in dresden we made the large exhibitions and then it went to london to the royal academy .
so i think this works in a mutual friendship .
berlin is so big , berlin is so rich with the collections that there are so many other places for the others to be here and to be shown here .
so i think there is good competition but at the very end its the focus .
we 've talked about berlin as a national arts capital for germany perhaps , now what about berlin and international art ?
the point is we are a universal museum and our companion museum , is somehow the british museum and it 's more than le louvre and we would like really to establish a non-european collections also in the center of berlin , in what we call the " mitte of the mitte . "
the " middle of the middle . "
that 's it - and there 's a complete deserted area where the castle was in the centre .
the former hohenzollern palace in the center of berlin .
that 's it the berlin castle and we would like to establish a non-european museum there , so we have the european and the non-european - a touch of le louvre and a bit of the british museum all concentrated in this city and i think this will give a new aspect , dimension to berlin and the cultural role of this capital . one aspect of the berlin landscape that we have n't mentioned so far is the museum island .
it 's a world cultural heritage site since 1994 , unesco nominated it as such .
it 's a very impressive ensemble .
could you describe museum island and your vision for it .
the museum island is an island in the center of the town with five museum buildings or better put five museum temples built from 1830 to 1930 - and it 's unique to have five so completely different museums for european art history , from the very beginning till 1900 .
and as it 's in one spot , it 's like an acropolis of the arts - and it 's only for the arts , only for the visitors and to re-do this , one building is a complete ruin , the others have to be re-done and all this will be finished in ten years .
and now we 're on the way and we 're re-doing one building after the other and it 's a real surprise , you have historical monumental buildings that no-one would build now .
it 's a real luxury in museum crowd and to have this rich collection together with - it 's really unique , you should see it . interview conducted by peter craven send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moma in berlin back to deutsche welle 's complete coverage 9801 the dw-tv asia + quiz want to see if you have won ?

and then almost you have the question where is germany ?
as what is really relevant or who can demonstrate a figure from germany .
and at the very end there is now berlin - the new capital of this united germany and this tremendously large museum complex .
and so you get an awareness of germany and it 's somehow that the international audience is expecting .
the international audience maybe , but there are many in germany in many of the other german cities hamburg , munich , frankfurt perhaps they 're not happy about berlin being the featured german city , not necessarily so .
well the point is that ten-fifteen years ago we always said berlin was the showcase of the free western society .
west berlin ?
yeah , and everybody was glad about this and now i think we have this free society and we should make the best of it and we should develop a good feeling .
and for all these other cities we are now somehow at the stage , for bavaria and saxony for example , in berlin , to be seen by an international audience .
see after the flood in dresden we made the large exhibitions and then it went to london to the royal academy .
so i think this works in a mutual friendship .
berlin is so big , berlin is so rich with the collections that there are so many other places for the others to be here and to be shown here .
so i think there is good competition but at the very end its the focus .
we 've talked about berlin as a national arts capital for germany perhaps , now what about berlin and international art ?
the point is we are a universal museum and our companion museum , is somehow the british museum and it 's more than le louvre and we would like really to establish a non-european collections also in the center of berlin , in what we call the " mitte of the mitte . "
the " middle of the middle . "
that 's it - and there 's a complete deserted area where the castle was in the centre .
the former hohenzollern palace in the center of berlin .
that 's it the berlin castle and we would like to establish a non-european museum there , so we have the european and the non-european - a touch of le louvre and a bit of the british museum all concentrated in this city and i think this will give a new aspect , dimension to berlin and the cultural role of this capital . one aspect of the berlin landscape that we have n't mentioned so far is the museum island .
it 's a world cultural heritage site since 1994 , unesco nominated it as such .
it 's a very impressive ensemble .
could you describe museum island and your vision for it .
the museum island is an island in the center of the town with five museum buildings or better put five museum temples built from 1830 to 1930 - and it 's unique to have five so completely different museums for european art history , from the very beginning till 1900 .
and as it 's in one spot , it 's like an acropolis of the arts - and it 's only for the arts , only for the visitors and to re-do this , one building is a complete ruin , the others have to be re-done and all this will be finished in ten years .
and now we 're on the way and we 're re-doing one building after the other and it 's a real surprise , you have historical monumental buildings that no-one would build now .

the moma exhibition opened in berlin on friday .
dw-tv talked to peter-klaus schuster , director general of the city of berlin 's state museums , about his work as well as the event . thanks very much for joining us today , mr schuster .
now if my math is up to much then you are in charge of no fewer than sixteen separate museums and galleries .
it ’ s an impressive total , among them are some of the most prestigious in the world .
it 's no surprise therefore , i 've got a quote , that you have been described by one source at least as being " the most powerful museum administrator in the world " .
is that how it feels to you ?
not really , we feel much more modest .
but you 're right , there are sixteen museums in one museum institution , this makes the state museum of berlin so unique .
if you compare it to london that would mean the british museum , the tate museum the national gallery all in one museum .
it 's a big job you 've got , and it 's a big year you 've got coming up in 2004 .
foremost amongst the attractions we can look forward to is the moma , the legendary museum of modern art based in new york is coming to berlin to put on display 200 masterpieces of modern european art .
it 's a very exciting prospect , how did it come about ?
the idea was to give the museum of modern art seven months somewhere and where should it be ?
and they said , let 's make tokyo , madrid and all this and then they considered it from the point of history and said let 's go back to berlin to a place where somehow our roots are .
the very beginning of the moma as an ideal concept was in berlin with the national gallery and with the bauhaus in germany .
so coming back and also coming back to mies van der rohe .
in this building , mies van der rohe is somehow the architect of the moma .
so the modernist project comes back to berlin .
that 's it and for seven and more months , this is much more than an exhibition .
it 's a manifestation of modernism .
the point is the moma is coming back to the beginning and berlin is coming back to modernism .
you see modernism or modern art in berlin , in germany too , is also a disaster with all that we had with the degenerated art and all that .
art described as degenerative by the nazis .
yes , and now we have the collection of modernism in this building , a temple of modernity . it 's a great prospect , but there 's more to it than meets the eye , perhaps because there 's also a political aspect to it all as well .
the co-patrons of the exhibition are joschka fischer , the german foreign minister , and colin powell , his american counter-part .
there 's been a lot of turbulence on the diplomatic level between germany and america in recent times let 's say .
is there an element of cultural fence mending going on here ?
it 's a manifestation of real understanding a deep friendship in the cultural field .
there 's not so much trouble and confusion as in the political field .
berlin is always looking with love to new york .
berlin always likes to be compared with new york , berlin likes to be the other new york .
and there 's more coming up in 2004 than just to moma exhibition , what else is bubbling ?
we will open the helmut newton museum , the helmut newton foundation .
it 's an artist coming from berlin and becoming international in paris , london , new york .
and so you see this cosmopolitan - this side of berlin , to re-establish this and this is in the middle of the year .
towards the end of the year we have the collection of frederic christian flick , the “ mick flick collection ” of very contemporary art in our museum of contemporary art , the hamburger bahnhof , and so you have the beginning of the classical modern with the moma and then you have how modernism ends with the very contemporary .
and so you could say that berlin is somehow a little bit of the cultural capital in 2004 - luckily . berlin the cultural capital of europe perhaps , berlin the cultural capital of germany maybe .
let me put another quote to you .
berlin , you have said yourself , is a showcase for the nation , for the german nation .
what does that mean ?
the awareness of germany is very difficult with the different länders . the federal states ?
yes , and this very important capital areas like munich , hamburg , stuttgart and all these .
and then almost you have the question where is germany ?
as what is really relevant or who can demonstrate a figure from germany .
and at the very end there is now berlin - the new capital of this united germany and this tremendously large museum complex .
and so you get an awareness of germany and it 's somehow that the international audience is expecting .
the international audience maybe , but there are many in germany in many of the other german cities hamburg , munich , frankfurt perhaps they 're not happy about berlin being the featured german city , not necessarily so .

if german ports want to continue doing business with america , they have until july 1 to install comprehensive and high-tech security systems designed to keep out terrorists . over the past two years , hamburg 's massive port has begun to turn itself into a modern-day fortress .
germany 's largest shipping port - the eighth busiest in the world - has installed security cameras , id and x-ray scanners as part of the international ship and port facility security code , agreed on by the united states in 2002 .
the code lays out security plans international ports must implement if they want to continue doing trade with the united states .
only ports that have given u.s. customs agents access to their facilities are allowed to ship freight to u.s. ports . " it 's very important to do this now , " jens weber , who is responsible for bringing the port 's security procedures in line with america 's demands , told dw-radio .
" the terminals are sheltered against theft , but to shelter a terminal against acts of terrorism , there is much more to be done . " high-tech , random checks all container trucks passing through the gates of the hamburg port are now subject to a security check .
port employees scan the truck 's documents and freight papers and cross check the information in a computer system and with the shipping company .
should there be any reason for suspicion , customs officers will check the container using new x-ray scanners . if everything checks out the driver is given a plastic id card that must then be presented at other check points until the container has been transferred the harbor ’ s satellite-controlled and fully automated loading system . customs officials are also on hand to examine container numbers and documentation .
inspectors look to see if there ’ s any damage to the steel container and they check the high security seal on the door . " they make random checks .
first they check the papers and if there ’ s any suggestion there ’ s anything wrong , they make an x-ray check and if they find something on the screen , they strip the container , ” said weber . major task ahead of them the companies that use the harbor bear the large brunt of the cost .
in order to get a security certificate from officials , companies have to invest at least € 30,000 -lrb- $ 37,580 -rrb- .
for large firms , the costs climb into the millions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 6 million containers went in and out of the port last year .
despite acknowledgement that their harbor is among the most modern in the world , hamburg city officials are realistic about the challenges that face them .
last year , more than six million containers moved in and out of the hamburg port .
the harbor has room for 300 ships . " “ if we checked each of the six million containers that we handle in hamburg each year – opened the doors or sent them to be x-rayed , we ’ d have a traffic jam all the way to the alps , " said heiko beller , of hamburg 's department of the interior in a dw-radio interview . port officials will have to learn how to keep security standards high without hampering the normal flow of business . “ we need to undertake measures that don ’ t strangle the port economy and traffic , " beller said .
" of course we want to promote trade .
if the measures became too strong , they would probably restrict it .
but that ’ s a balancing act that has to be performed . ” dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. seeks to help secure european ports as america steps up measures to secure its ports , customs officials are now working with their counterparts in europe to scan container cargo for terrorist material before it reaches the u.s.

the moma exhibition opened in berlin on friday .
dw-tv talked to peter-klaus schuster , director general of the city of berlin 's state museums , about his work as well as the event . thanks very much for joining us today , mr schuster .
now if my math is up to much then you are in charge of no fewer than sixteen separate museums and galleries .
it ’ s an impressive total , among them are some of the most prestigious in the world .
it 's no surprise therefore , i 've got a quote , that you have been described by one source at least as being " the most powerful museum administrator in the world " .
is that how it feels to you ?
not really , we feel much more modest .
but you 're right , there are sixteen museums in one museum institution , this makes the state museum of berlin so unique .
if you compare it to london that would mean the british museum , the tate museum the national gallery all in one museum .
it 's a big job you 've got , and it 's a big year you 've got coming up in 2004 .
foremost amongst the attractions we can look forward to is the moma , the legendary museum of modern art based in new york is coming to berlin to put on display 200 masterpieces of modern european art .
it 's a very exciting prospect , how did it come about ?
the idea was to give the museum of modern art seven months somewhere and where should it be ?
and they said , let 's make tokyo , madrid and all this and then they considered it from the point of history and said let 's go back to berlin to a place where somehow our roots are .
the very beginning of the moma as an ideal concept was in berlin with the national gallery and with the bauhaus in germany .
so coming back and also coming back to mies van der rohe .
in this building , mies van der rohe is somehow the architect of the moma .
so the modernist project comes back to berlin .
that 's it and for seven and more months , this is much more than an exhibition .
it 's a manifestation of modernism .
the point is the moma is coming back to the beginning and berlin is coming back to modernism .
you see modernism or modern art in berlin , in germany too , is also a disaster with all that we had with the degenerated art and all that .
art described as degenerative by the nazis .
yes , and now we have the collection of modernism in this building , a temple of modernity . it 's a great prospect , but there 's more to it than meets the eye , perhaps because there 's also a political aspect to it all as well .
the co-patrons of the exhibition are joschka fischer , the german foreign minister , and colin powell , his american counter-part .
there 's been a lot of turbulence on the diplomatic level between germany and america in recent times let 's say .
is there an element of cultural fence mending going on here ?
it 's a manifestation of real understanding a deep friendship in the cultural field .
there 's not so much trouble and confusion as in the political field .
berlin is always looking with love to new york .
berlin always likes to be compared with new york , berlin likes to be the other new york .
and there 's more coming up in 2004 than just to moma exhibition , what else is bubbling ?
we will open the helmut newton museum , the helmut newton foundation .
it 's an artist coming from berlin and becoming international in paris , london , new york .
and so you see this cosmopolitan - this side of berlin , to re-establish this and this is in the middle of the year .
towards the end of the year we have the collection of frederic christian flick , the “ mick flick collection ” of very contemporary art in our museum of contemporary art , the hamburger bahnhof , and so you have the beginning of the classical modern with the moma and then you have how modernism ends with the very contemporary .
and so you could say that berlin is somehow a little bit of the cultural capital in 2004 - luckily . berlin the cultural capital of europe perhaps , berlin the cultural capital of germany maybe .
let me put another quote to you .
berlin , you have said yourself , is a showcase for the nation , for the german nation .
what does that mean ?
the awareness of germany is very difficult with the different länders . the federal states ?
yes , and this very important capital areas like munich , hamburg , stuttgart and all these .
and then almost you have the question where is germany ?
as what is really relevant or who can demonstrate a figure from germany .
and at the very end there is now berlin - the new capital of this united germany and this tremendously large museum complex .
and so you get an awareness of germany and it 's somehow that the international audience is expecting .
the international audience maybe , but there are many in germany in many of the other german cities hamburg , munich , frankfurt perhaps they 're not happy about berlin being the featured german city , not necessarily so .
well the point is that ten-fifteen years ago we always said berlin was the showcase of the free western society .
west berlin ?
yeah , and everybody was glad about this and now i think we have this free society and we should make the best of it and we should develop a good feeling .
and for all these other cities we are now somehow at the stage , for bavaria and saxony for example , in berlin , to be seen by an international audience .
see after the flood in dresden we made the large exhibitions and then it went to london to the royal academy .
so i think this works in a mutual friendship .
berlin is so big , berlin is so rich with the collections that there are so many other places for the others to be here and to be shown here .
so i think there is good competition but at the very end its the focus .
we 've talked about berlin as a national arts capital for germany perhaps , now what about berlin and international art ?
the point is we are a universal museum and our companion museum , is somehow the british museum and it 's more than le louvre and we would like really to establish a non-european collections also in the center of berlin , in what we call the " mitte of the mitte . "
the " middle of the middle . "
that 's it - and there 's a complete deserted area where the castle was in the centre .
the former hohenzollern palace in the center of berlin .
that 's it the berlin castle and we would like to establish a non-european museum there , so we have the european and the non-european - a touch of le louvre and a bit of the british museum all concentrated in this city and i think this will give a new aspect , dimension to berlin and the cultural role of this capital . one aspect of the berlin landscape that we have n't mentioned so far is the museum island .
it 's a world cultural heritage site since 1994 , unesco nominated it as such .
it 's a very impressive ensemble .
could you describe museum island and your vision for it .
the museum island is an island in the center of the town with five museum buildings or better put five museum temples built from 1830 to 1930 - and it 's unique to have five so completely different museums for european art history , from the very beginning till 1900 .
and as it 's in one spot , it 's like an acropolis of the arts - and it 's only for the arts , only for the visitors and to re-do this , one building is a complete ruin , the others have to be re-done and all this will be finished in ten years .
and now we 're on the way and we 're re-doing one building after the other and it 's a real surprise , you have historical monumental buildings that no-one would build now .
it 's a real luxury in museum crowd and to have this rich collection together with - it 's really unique , you should see it . interview conducted by peter craven send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moma in berlin back to deutsche welle 's complete coverage 9798 the dw-tv asia + quiz want to see if you have won ?

the moma exhibition opened in berlin on friday .
dw-tv talked to peter-klaus schuster , director general of the city of berlin 's state museums , about his work as well as the event . thanks very much for joining us today , mr schuster .
now if my math is up to much then you are in charge of no fewer than sixteen separate museums and galleries .
it ’ s an impressive total , among them are some of the most prestigious in the world .
it 's no surprise therefore , i 've got a quote , that you have been described by one source at least as being " the most powerful museum administrator in the world " .
is that how it feels to you ?
not really , we feel much more modest .
but you 're right , there are sixteen museums in one museum institution , this makes the state museum of berlin so unique .
if you compare it to london that would mean the british museum , the tate museum the national gallery all in one museum .
it 's a big job you 've got , and it 's a big year you 've got coming up in 2004 .
foremost amongst the attractions we can look forward to is the moma , the legendary museum of modern art based in new york is coming to berlin to put on display 200 masterpieces of modern european art .
it 's a very exciting prospect , how did it come about ?
the idea was to give the museum of modern art seven months somewhere and where should it be ?
and they said , let 's make tokyo , madrid and all this and then they considered it from the point of history and said let 's go back to berlin to a place where somehow our roots are .
the very beginning of the moma as an ideal concept was in berlin with the national gallery and with the bauhaus in germany .
so coming back and also coming back to mies van der rohe .
in this building , mies van der rohe is somehow the architect of the moma .
so the modernist project comes back to berlin .
that 's it and for seven and more months , this is much more than an exhibition .
it 's a manifestation of modernism .
the point is the moma is coming back to the beginning and berlin is coming back to modernism .
you see modernism or modern art in berlin , in germany too , is also a disaster with all that we had with the degenerated art and all that .
art described as degenerative by the nazis .
yes , and now we have the collection of modernism in this building , a temple of modernity . it 's a great prospect , but there 's more to it than meets the eye , perhaps because there 's also a political aspect to it all as well .
the co-patrons of the exhibition are joschka fischer , the german foreign minister , and colin powell , his american counter-part .
there 's been a lot of turbulence on the diplomatic level between germany and america in recent times let 's say .
is there an element of cultural fence mending going on here ?
it 's a manifestation of real understanding a deep friendship in the cultural field .
there 's not so much trouble and confusion as in the political field .
berlin is always looking with love to new york .
berlin always likes to be compared with new york , berlin likes to be the other new york .
and there 's more coming up in 2004 than just to moma exhibition , what else is bubbling ?
we will open the helmut newton museum , the helmut newton foundation .
it 's an artist coming from berlin and becoming international in paris , london , new york .
and so you see this cosmopolitan - this side of berlin , to re-establish this and this is in the middle of the year .
towards the end of the year we have the collection of frederic christian flick , the “ mick flick collection ” of very contemporary art in our museum of contemporary art , the hamburger bahnhof , and so you have the beginning of the classical modern with the moma and then you have how modernism ends with the very contemporary .
and so you could say that berlin is somehow a little bit of the cultural capital in 2004 - luckily . berlin the cultural capital of europe perhaps , berlin the cultural capital of germany maybe .
let me put another quote to you .
berlin , you have said yourself , is a showcase for the nation , for the german nation .
what does that mean ?
the awareness of germany is very difficult with the different länders . the federal states ?
yes , and this very important capital areas like munich , hamburg , stuttgart and all these .
and then almost you have the question where is germany ?
as what is really relevant or who can demonstrate a figure from germany .
and at the very end there is now berlin - the new capital of this united germany and this tremendously large museum complex .
and so you get an awareness of germany and it 's somehow that the international audience is expecting .
the international audience maybe , but there are many in germany in many of the other german cities hamburg , munich , frankfurt perhaps they 're not happy about berlin being the featured german city , not necessarily so .
well the point is that ten-fifteen years ago we always said berlin was the showcase of the free western society .
west berlin ?
yeah , and everybody was glad about this and now i think we have this free society and we should make the best of it and we should develop a good feeling .
and for all these other cities we are now somehow at the stage , for bavaria and saxony for example , in berlin , to be seen by an international audience .
see after the flood in dresden we made the large exhibitions and then it went to london to the royal academy .
so i think this works in a mutual friendship .
berlin is so big , berlin is so rich with the collections that there are so many other places for the others to be here and to be shown here .
so i think there is good competition but at the very end its the focus .
we 've talked about berlin as a national arts capital for germany perhaps , now what about berlin and international art ?
the point is we are a universal museum and our companion museum , is somehow the british museum and it 's more than le louvre and we would like really to establish a non-european collections also in the center of berlin , in what we call the " mitte of the mitte . "
the " middle of the middle . "
that 's it - and there 's a complete deserted area where the castle was in the centre .
the former hohenzollern palace in the center of berlin .
that 's it the berlin castle and we would like to establish a non-european museum there , so we have the european and the non-european - a touch of le louvre and a bit of the british museum all concentrated in this city and i think this will give a new aspect , dimension to berlin and the cultural role of this capital . one aspect of the berlin landscape that we have n't mentioned so far is the museum island .
it 's a world cultural heritage site since 1994 , unesco nominated it as such .
it 's a very impressive ensemble .
could you describe museum island and your vision for it .
the museum island is an island in the center of the town with five museum buildings or better put five museum temples built from 1830 to 1930 - and it 's unique to have five so completely different museums for european art history , from the very beginning till 1900 .
and as it 's in one spot , it 's like an acropolis of the arts - and it 's only for the arts , only for the visitors and to re-do this , one building is a complete ruin , the others have to be re-done and all this will be finished in ten years .
and now we 're on the way and we 're re-doing one building after the other and it 's a real surprise , you have historical monumental buildings that no-one would build now .
it 's a real luxury in museum crowd and to have this rich collection together with - it 's really unique , you should see it . interview conducted by peter craven send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moma in berlin back to deutsche welle 's complete coverage 9798 the dw-tv asia + quiz want to see if you have won ?

yes , and now we have the collection of modernism in this building , a temple of modernity . it 's a great prospect , but there 's more to it than meets the eye , perhaps because there 's also a political aspect to it all as well .
the co-patrons of the exhibition are joschka fischer , the german foreign minister , and colin powell , his american counter-part .
there 's been a lot of turbulence on the diplomatic level between germany and america in recent times let 's say .
is there an element of cultural fence mending going on here ?
it 's a manifestation of real understanding a deep friendship in the cultural field .
there 's not so much trouble and confusion as in the political field .
berlin is always looking with love to new york .
berlin always likes to be compared with new york , berlin likes to be the other new york .
and there 's more coming up in 2004 than just to moma exhibition , what else is bubbling ?
we will open the helmut newton museum , the helmut newton foundation .
it 's an artist coming from berlin and becoming international in paris , london , new york .
and so you see this cosmopolitan - this side of berlin , to re-establish this and this is in the middle of the year .
towards the end of the year we have the collection of frederic christian flick , the “ mick flick collection ” of very contemporary art in our museum of contemporary art , the hamburger bahnhof , and so you have the beginning of the classical modern with the moma and then you have how modernism ends with the very contemporary .
and so you could say that berlin is somehow a little bit of the cultural capital in 2004 - luckily . berlin the cultural capital of europe perhaps , berlin the cultural capital of germany maybe .
let me put another quote to you .
berlin , you have said yourself , is a showcase for the nation , for the german nation .
what does that mean ?
the awareness of germany is very difficult with the different länders . the federal states ?
yes , and this very important capital areas like munich , hamburg , stuttgart and all these .
and then almost you have the question where is germany ?
as what is really relevant or who can demonstrate a figure from germany .
and at the very end there is now berlin - the new capital of this united germany and this tremendously large museum complex .
and so you get an awareness of germany and it 's somehow that the international audience is expecting .
the international audience maybe , but there are many in germany in many of the other german cities hamburg , munich , frankfurt perhaps they 're not happy about berlin being the featured german city , not necessarily so .
well the point is that ten-fifteen years ago we always said berlin was the showcase of the free western society .
west berlin ?
yeah , and everybody was glad about this and now i think we have this free society and we should make the best of it and we should develop a good feeling .
and for all these other cities we are now somehow at the stage , for bavaria and saxony for example , in berlin , to be seen by an international audience .
see after the flood in dresden we made the large exhibitions and then it went to london to the royal academy .
so i think this works in a mutual friendship .
berlin is so big , berlin is so rich with the collections that there are so many other places for the others to be here and to be shown here .
so i think there is good competition but at the very end its the focus .
we 've talked about berlin as a national arts capital for germany perhaps , now what about berlin and international art ?
the point is we are a universal museum and our companion museum , is somehow the british museum and it 's more than le louvre and we would like really to establish a non-european collections also in the center of berlin , in what we call the " mitte of the mitte . "
the " middle of the middle . "
that 's it - and there 's a complete deserted area where the castle was in the centre .
the former hohenzollern palace in the center of berlin .
that 's it the berlin castle and we would like to establish a non-european museum there , so we have the european and the non-european - a touch of le louvre and a bit of the british museum all concentrated in this city and i think this will give a new aspect , dimension to berlin and the cultural role of this capital . one aspect of the berlin landscape that we have n't mentioned so far is the museum island .
it 's a world cultural heritage site since 1994 , unesco nominated it as such .
it 's a very impressive ensemble .
could you describe museum island and your vision for it .
the museum island is an island in the center of the town with five museum buildings or better put five museum temples built from 1830 to 1930 - and it 's unique to have five so completely different museums for european art history , from the very beginning till 1900 .
and as it 's in one spot , it 's like an acropolis of the arts - and it 's only for the arts , only for the visitors and to re-do this , one building is a complete ruin , the others have to be re-done and all this will be finished in ten years .
and now we 're on the way and we 're re-doing one building after the other and it 's a real surprise , you have historical monumental buildings that no-one would build now .
it 's a real luxury in museum crowd and to have this rich collection together with - it 's really unique , you should see it . interview conducted by peter craven send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moma in berlin back to deutsche welle 's complete coverage 9798 the dw-tv asia + quiz want to see if you have won ?

as the world celebrates international mother language day on saturday , germany 's language purists bemoan the relentless onslaught of denglish .
but a german watchdog has hinted that a turnabout might be in sight . when burger giant mcdonald 's recently dropped its famous english slogan " everytime a good time " for its tv advertisement in germany and replaced it with a very german " ich liebe es " -lrb- i 'm lovin ' it -rrb- , an audible whoop of joy was heard in the language purist camp in the country .
after years of all-out war against the rise of denglish -lrb- a mixture of german and english -rrb- , the institute for german language -lrb- vds -rrb- - self-appointed guardian of the sanctity of german language - is celebrating .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going german at mcdonald 's " we have detected a trend reversal , " walter krämer , chairman of the vds told dpa news agency .
" the fast-food chain mcdonald 's is once again advertising in german for its products , even other companies and concerns have rediscovered german for their slogans , " he said .
understand english ?
but rather than a sense of loyalty and pride towards its own native language - a sentiment more in keeping with international mother language day - it 's pragmatic concerns that have fuelled the german advertising industry 's recourse to german .
tobias mindner , vds press spokesman pointed out that advertising gurus in germany had found in a study that most of its target audience did n't understand slick english one-liners .
indeed the recent representative study concluded that 59 percent of those surveyed could n't correctly translate mcdonald 's every time a good time into german .
the same went for mitsubishi 's slogan drive alive .
just 18 percent understood it as " lively driving " in german , the rest interpreted it as " survive the drive in our car " - a potentially damaging promo for the carmaker .
the participants were all aged between 14 and 59 - a target group that 's considered the biggest spender and thus the most promising for the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw calls on customers to " dress your car , " but what 's that supposed to mean , exactly ?
" a much smaller percentage of people in germany speak english than is generally assumed , " mindner told dw-world .
" just about ten percent speak and really understand it well .
so you ca n't really just use snazzy english phrases and enthuse people for products , when they do n't really get the message , " he added .
spectacular moves to clean up german the vds has been up in arms against the encroachment of english words in the german language for the past six years and is known for its often eccentric ways to achieve its aim .
last year the watchdog symbolically auctioned the german language on ebay .
within two days , the highest bid lay above ten million euro , following which the internet auction site stopped the trade .
the organization also attempted to sue the supervisory board of deutsche telekom for its " nonsensical use " of english words like city call , holiday plus tarif and german call .
the institute also awards a prize for the sprachpanscher -lrb- language debaser -rrb- of the year .
" no to denglish " the onslaught of so-called denglish is apparent not just in germany 's advertising and business world , but increasingly in almost all walks of life and it is n't just irking language experts .
a group of senior citizens in the bavarian city of nuremberg recently started a " no to denglish " signature campaign .
magda schleip , a member , told daily süddeutsche zeitung , " older people only understand fragments of what politicians , advertising gurus and media tell them everyday . "
schleip added that the problem was even more acute for the unemployed .
" the federal labor agency only talks about job centers , cluster building , clearing offices , " she said .

opinion : desperately ditching denglish europe battles english invasion should german be cleansed of " denglish " ? culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.02.2004 deutsch please , we 're german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe bilingual is the way to go ?
as the world celebrates international mother language day on saturday , germany 's language purists bemoan the relentless onslaught of denglish .
but a german watchdog has hinted that a turnabout might be in sight . when burger giant mcdonald 's recently dropped its famous english slogan " everytime a good time " for its tv advertisement in germany and replaced it with a very german " ich liebe es " -lrb- i 'm lovin ' it -rrb- , an audible whoop of joy was heard in the language purist camp in the country .
after years of all-out war against the rise of denglish -lrb- a mixture of german and english -rrb- , the institute for german language -lrb- vds -rrb- - self-appointed guardian of the sanctity of german language - is celebrating .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going german at mcdonald 's " we have detected a trend reversal , " walter krämer , chairman of the vds told dpa news agency .
" the fast-food chain mcdonald 's is once again advertising in german for its products , even other companies and concerns have rediscovered german for their slogans , " he said .
understand english ?
but rather than a sense of loyalty and pride towards its own native language - a sentiment more in keeping with international mother language day - it 's pragmatic concerns that have fuelled the german advertising industry 's recourse to german .
tobias mindner , vds press spokesman pointed out that advertising gurus in germany had found in a study that most of its target audience did n't understand slick english one-liners .
indeed the recent representative study concluded that 59 percent of those surveyed could n't correctly translate mcdonald 's every time a good time into german .
the same went for mitsubishi 's slogan drive alive .
just 18 percent understood it as " lively driving " in german , the rest interpreted it as " survive the drive in our car " - a potentially damaging promo for the carmaker .
the participants were all aged between 14 and 59 - a target group that 's considered the biggest spender and thus the most promising for the industry .

" a much smaller percentage of people in germany speak english than is generally assumed , " mindner told dw-world .

if german ports want to continue doing business with america , they have until july 1 to install comprehensive and high-tech security systems designed to keep out terrorists . over the past two years , hamburg 's massive port has begun to turn itself into a modern-day fortress .
germany 's largest shipping port - the eighth busiest in the world - has installed security cameras , id and x-ray scanners as part of the international ship and port facility security code , agreed on by the united states in 2002 .
the code lays out security plans international ports must implement if they want to continue doing trade with the united states .
only ports that have given u.s. customs agents access to their facilities are allowed to ship freight to u.s. ports . " it 's very important to do this now , " jens weber , who is responsible for bringing the port 's security procedures in line with america 's demands , told dw-radio .
" the terminals are sheltered against theft , but to shelter a terminal against acts of terrorism , there is much more to be done . " high-tech , random checks all container trucks passing through the gates of the hamburg port are now subject to a security check .
port employees scan the truck 's documents and freight papers and cross check the information in a computer system and with the shipping company .
should there be any reason for suspicion , customs officers will check the container using new x-ray scanners . if everything checks out the driver is given a plastic id card that must then be presented at other check points until the container has been transferred the harbor ’ s satellite-controlled and fully automated loading system . customs officials are also on hand to examine container numbers and documentation .
inspectors look to see if there ’ s any damage to the steel container and they check the high security seal on the door . " they make random checks .
first they check the papers and if there ’ s any suggestion there ’ s anything wrong , they make an x-ray check and if they find something on the screen , they strip the container , ” said weber . major task ahead of them the companies that use the harbor bear the large brunt of the cost .
in order to get a security certificate from officials , companies have to invest at least € 30,000 -lrb- $ 37,580 -rrb- .
for large firms , the costs climb into the millions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 6 million containers went in and out of the port last year .

" “ if we checked each of the six million containers that we handle in hamburg each year – opened the doors or sent them to be x-rayed , we ’ d have a traffic jam all the way to the alps , " said heiko beller , of hamburg 's department of the interior in a dw-radio interview . port officials will have to learn how to keep security standards high without hampering the normal flow of business . “ we need to undertake measures that don ’ t strangle the port economy and traffic , " beller said .

the federal office for radiation protection -lrb- bfs -rrb- has called for the shut-down of five german nuclear energy plants because they lack sufficient protection against terror attacks . of germany 's 18 nuclear power plants , the five plants are most vulnerable in case of a terror attack involving planes such as the sept .
11 attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon , bfs president wolfram könig said in an interview with berliner zeitung .
könig 's assessment is based on a report by the society for reactor safety -lrb- grs -rrb- , germany 's central expert institution on nuclear safety . the report however does not look at concrete , actual safety risks at particular plants , according to a statement by germany 's federal ministry for the environment , nature conservation and nuclear safety , which oversees the bfs .
the ministry 's statement added that german states had so far failed to review the safety of plants based on the report . the plants include biblis a in the german state of hesse , which is operated by rwe , philipsburg 1 and obrigheim in baden-württemberg , which belong to energy company enbw , isar 1 in bavaria that 's part of power giant eon and brunsbüttel in schlwesig-holstein , which is operated by vattenfall europe and eon .
spokespeople for the companies could not be reached on saturday or did not want to comment on könig 's statements . environmentalists welcomed könig 's call to shut down the plants , saying that such a step was long overdue .

each of the country 's nuclear plants will be closed down after operating for 32 years .
the first closure already happened last november , when the stade plant -lrb- photo -rrb- was removed from the power grid .
obrigheim is next in line , with shut-off scheduled for may 2005 . extending lifetime of safer plants ? könig suggested that energy companies could be compensated for closing down allegedly unsafe plants by extending the operating time on other , more secure sites .
" that 's economically justifiable and legally possible , " könig told the paper . he also criticized germany 's nuclear energy suppliers for failing to do more to protect plants from terror attacks .
könig said he believed the companies had not done what 's necessary after the sept .

the federal office for radiation protection -lrb- bfs -rrb- has called for the shut-down of five german nuclear energy plants because they lack sufficient protection against terror attacks . of germany 's 18 nuclear power plants , the five plants are most vulnerable in case of a terror attack involving planes such as the sept .
11 attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon , bfs president wolfram könig said in an interview with berliner zeitung .
könig 's assessment is based on a report by the society for reactor safety -lrb- grs -rrb- , germany 's central expert institution on nuclear safety . the report however does not look at concrete , actual safety risks at particular plants , according to a statement by germany 's federal ministry for the environment , nature conservation and nuclear safety , which oversees the bfs .
the ministry 's statement added that german states had so far failed to review the safety of plants based on the report . the plants include biblis a in the german state of hesse , which is operated by rwe , philipsburg 1 and obrigheim in baden-württemberg , which belong to energy company enbw , isar 1 in bavaria that 's part of power giant eon and brunsbüttel in schlwesig-holstein , which is operated by vattenfall europe and eon .
spokespeople for the companies could not be reached on saturday or did not want to comment on könig 's statements . environmentalists welcomed könig 's call to shut down the plants , saying that such a step was long overdue .
" a plane crash could lead to a worst case scenario at any german nuclear power plant , " walter jungbauer , a nuclear energy expert with german environmental organization bund , told dpa news service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stade plant has already been switched off .
germany has already passed a law that will phase out nuclear energy by 2020 .
each of the country 's nuclear plants will be closed down after operating for 32 years .
the first closure already happened last november , when the stade plant -lrb- photo -rrb- was removed from the power grid .
obrigheim is next in line , with shut-off scheduled for may 2005 . extending lifetime of safer plants ? könig suggested that energy companies could be compensated for closing down allegedly unsafe plants by extending the operating time on other , more secure sites .
" that 's economically justifiable and legally possible , " könig told the paper . he also criticized germany 's nuclear energy suppliers for failing to do more to protect plants from terror attacks .
könig said he believed the companies had not done what 's necessary after the sept .
11 attacks .
he added that he did n't think proposals to enclose plants in a cloud of fog in case of an attack would alleviate the public 's safety concerns . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts nuclear energy phase-out germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .

carnival in the rhineland culminates this week , but germany 's economic downturn has created problems for the region 's carnival associations .
with reduced government support and donations , many face an existential crisis . during the days of carnival , liquor flows freely as do the euros when millions are joining in the parades and street parties of germany 's largest public event .

that 's created a crisis for the groups . fewer sales , fewer subsidies " in cologne , where the biggest carnival celebrations are held , some groups are really having trouble this year , " said franz wolf , president of the german carnival association .

carnival in the rhineland culminates this week , but germany 's economic downturn has created problems for the region 's carnival associations .
with reduced government support and donations , many face an existential crisis . during the days of carnival , liquor flows freely as do the euros when millions are joining in the parades and street parties of germany 's largest public event .
countless bars and restaurants are full and of visitors flock to the rhineland for the six days of festivities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the star attraction is always the carnival associations , with their elaborately decorated floats and extravagant costumes .
they include everything from neighborhood groups to social groups , including gays and lesbians .
most dress as 18th century french soldiers -lrb- photo -rrb- - a mocking gesture to the region 's former occupier . for a long time now , carnival has been an important part of the economy in the cities and towns in the rhineland and along the main river .
but with a flagging economy in germany and diminished purchasing power , people are more reluctant to shell out money for costumes , beer and the expensive parties hosted by carnival associations .
that 's created a crisis for the groups . fewer sales , fewer subsidies " in cologne , where the biggest carnival celebrations are held , some groups are really having trouble this year , " said franz wolf , president of the german carnival association .
" at some of the events only 80 percent of the tickets were sold and empty tables could be found .
those are the first indications that something is wrong . " wolf does n't believe the economy has anything to do with it . " in my opinion , what the hospitality industry did after the change from the deutsch mark to the euro was impossible , " he said .
" in many cases , they just kept the deutsche mark price and put a euro sign in front of it making things twice as expensive .
nobody can pay the new prices . " in some places there are empty halls , empty bars , and even empty cash registers .
with lower tax revenues pouring in , many cities have also reduced the amount of subsidies they give to the different carnival associations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then german labor minister walter riester is pictured tortured as he appears during the 2001carnival parade in düsseldorf .
donations to the groups have also dropped and they 're having trouble making ends meet .

as the world celebrates international mother language day on saturday , germany 's language purists bemoan the relentless onslaught of denglish .
but a german watchdog has hinted that a turnabout might be in sight . when burger giant mcdonald 's recently dropped its famous english slogan " everytime a good time " for its tv advertisement in germany and replaced it with a very german " ich liebe es " -lrb- i 'm lovin ' it -rrb- , an audible whoop of joy was heard in the language purist camp in the country .
after years of all-out war against the rise of denglish -lrb- a mixture of german and english -rrb- , the institute for german language -lrb- vds -rrb- - self-appointed guardian of the sanctity of german language - is celebrating .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going german at mcdonald 's " we have detected a trend reversal , " walter krämer , chairman of the vds told dpa news agency .
" the fast-food chain mcdonald 's is once again advertising in german for its products , even other companies and concerns have rediscovered german for their slogans , " he said .
understand english ?
but rather than a sense of loyalty and pride towards its own native language - a sentiment more in keeping with international mother language day - it 's pragmatic concerns that have fuelled the german advertising industry 's recourse to german .
tobias mindner , vds press spokesman pointed out that advertising gurus in germany had found in a study that most of its target audience did n't understand slick english one-liners .
indeed the recent representative study concluded that 59 percent of those surveyed could n't correctly translate mcdonald 's every time a good time into german .
the same went for mitsubishi 's slogan drive alive .
just 18 percent understood it as " lively driving " in german , the rest interpreted it as " survive the drive in our car " - a potentially damaging promo for the carmaker .
the participants were all aged between 14 and 59 - a target group that 's considered the biggest spender and thus the most promising for the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw calls on customers to " dress your car , " but what 's that supposed to mean , exactly ?
" a much smaller percentage of people in germany speak english than is generally assumed , " mindner told dw-world .
" just about ten percent speak and really understand it well .
so you ca n't really just use snazzy english phrases and enthuse people for products , when they do n't really get the message , " he added .
spectacular moves to clean up german the vds has been up in arms against the encroachment of english words in the german language for the past six years and is known for its often eccentric ways to achieve its aim .
last year the watchdog symbolically auctioned the german language on ebay .
within two days , the highest bid lay above ten million euro , following which the internet auction site stopped the trade .
the organization also attempted to sue the supervisory board of deutsche telekom for its " nonsensical use " of english words like city call , holiday plus tarif and german call .
the institute also awards a prize for the sprachpanscher -lrb- language debaser -rrb- of the year .
" no to denglish " the onslaught of so-called denglish is apparent not just in germany 's advertising and business world , but increasingly in almost all walks of life and it is n't just irking language experts .
a group of senior citizens in the bavarian city of nuremberg recently started a " no to denglish " signature campaign .
magda schleip , a member , told daily süddeutsche zeitung , " older people only understand fragments of what politicians , advertising gurus and media tell them everyday . "
schleip added that the problem was even more acute for the unemployed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home : dw-tv europa in focus : moma in berlin american season 2004 a modernist master avant retro - moma comes to berlin museum of modern art - a history dw-tv -pipe- 21.02.2004 berlin 's museum master großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter-klaus schuster heads 16 museums .
the moma exhibition opened in berlin on friday .
dw-tv talked to peter-klaus schuster , director general of the city of berlin 's state museums , about his work as well as the event . thanks very much for joining us today , mr schuster .
now if my math is up to much then you are in charge of no fewer than sixteen separate museums and galleries .
it ’ s an impressive total , among them are some of the most prestigious in the world .
it 's no surprise therefore , i 've got a quote , that you have been described by one source at least as being " the most powerful museum administrator in the world " .
is that how it feels to you ?
not really , we feel much more modest .
but you 're right , there are sixteen museums in one museum institution , this makes the state museum of berlin so unique .
if you compare it to london that would mean the british museum , the tate museum the national gallery all in one museum .
it 's a big job you 've got , and it 's a big year you 've got coming up in 2004 .
foremost amongst the attractions we can look forward to is the moma , the legendary museum of modern art based in new york is coming to berlin to put on display 200 masterpieces of modern european art .
it 's a very exciting prospect , how did it come about ?
the idea was to give the museum of modern art seven months somewhere and where should it be ?
and they said , let 's make tokyo , madrid and all this and then they considered it from the point of history and said let 's go back to berlin to a place where somehow our roots are .
the very beginning of the moma as an ideal concept was in berlin with the national gallery and with the bauhaus in germany .
so coming back and also coming back to mies van der rohe .
in this building , mies van der rohe is somehow the architect of the moma .
so the modernist project comes back to berlin .
that 's it and for seven and more months , this is much more than an exhibition .
it 's a manifestation of modernism .
the point is the moma is coming back to the beginning and berlin is coming back to modernism .
you see modernism or modern art in berlin , in germany too , is also a disaster with all that we had with the degenerated art and all that .
art described as degenerative by the nazis .
yes , and now we have the collection of modernism in this building , a temple of modernity . it 's a great prospect , but there 's more to it than meets the eye , perhaps because there 's also a political aspect to it all as well .
the co-patrons of the exhibition are joschka fischer , the german foreign minister , and colin powell , his american counter-part .
there 's been a lot of turbulence on the diplomatic level between germany and america in recent times let 's say .
is there an element of cultural fence mending going on here ?
it 's a manifestation of real understanding a deep friendship in the cultural field .
there 's not so much trouble and confusion as in the political field .
berlin is always looking with love to new york .
berlin always likes to be compared with new york , berlin likes to be the other new york .
and there 's more coming up in 2004 than just to moma exhibition , what else is bubbling ?
we will open the helmut newton museum , the helmut newton foundation .
it 's an artist coming from berlin and becoming international in paris , london , new york .
and so you see this cosmopolitan - this side of berlin , to re-establish this and this is in the middle of the year .
towards the end of the year we have the collection of frederic christian flick , the “ mick flick collection ” of very contemporary art in our museum of contemporary art , the hamburger bahnhof , and so you have the beginning of the classical modern with the moma and then you have how modernism ends with the very contemporary .
and so you could say that berlin is somehow a little bit of the cultural capital in 2004 - luckily . berlin the cultural capital of europe perhaps , berlin the cultural capital of germany maybe .
let me put another quote to you .
berlin , you have said yourself , is a showcase for the nation , for the german nation .
what does that mean ?
the awareness of germany is very difficult with the different länders . the federal states ?
yes , and this very important capital areas like munich , hamburg , stuttgart and all these .
and then almost you have the question where is germany ?
as what is really relevant or who can demonstrate a figure from germany .
and at the very end there is now berlin - the new capital of this united germany and this tremendously large museum complex .
and so you get an awareness of germany and it 's somehow that the international audience is expecting .
the international audience maybe , but there are many in germany in many of the other german cities hamburg , munich , frankfurt perhaps they 're not happy about berlin being the featured german city , not necessarily so .
well the point is that ten-fifteen years ago we always said berlin was the showcase of the free western society .
west berlin ?
yeah , and everybody was glad about this and now i think we have this free society and we should make the best of it and we should develop a good feeling .
and for all these other cities we are now somehow at the stage , for bavaria and saxony for example , in berlin , to be seen by an international audience .
see after the flood in dresden we made the large exhibitions and then it went to london to the royal academy .
so i think this works in a mutual friendship .
berlin is so big , berlin is so rich with the collections that there are so many other places for the others to be here and to be shown here .
so i think there is good competition but at the very end its the focus .
we 've talked about berlin as a national arts capital for germany perhaps , now what about berlin and international art ?
the point is we are a universal museum and our companion museum , is somehow the british museum and it 's more than le louvre and we would like really to establish a non-european collections also in the center of berlin , in what we call the " mitte of the mitte . "
the " middle of the middle . "
that 's it - and there 's a complete deserted area where the castle was in the centre .
the former hohenzollern palace in the center of berlin .
that 's it the berlin castle and we would like to establish a non-european museum there , so we have the european and the non-european - a touch of le louvre and a bit of the british museum all concentrated in this city and i think this will give a new aspect , dimension to berlin and the cultural role of this capital . one aspect of the berlin landscape that we have n't mentioned so far is the museum island .
it 's a world cultural heritage site since 1994 , unesco nominated it as such .

the moma exhibition opened in berlin on friday .
dw-tv talked to peter-klaus schuster , director general of the city of berlin 's state museums , about his work as well as the event . thanks very much for joining us today , mr schuster .
now if my math is up to much then you are in charge of no fewer than sixteen separate museums and galleries .
it ’ s an impressive total , among them are some of the most prestigious in the world .
it 's no surprise therefore , i 've got a quote , that you have been described by one source at least as being " the most powerful museum administrator in the world " .
is that how it feels to you ?
not really , we feel much more modest .
but you 're right , there are sixteen museums in one museum institution , this makes the state museum of berlin so unique .
if you compare it to london that would mean the british museum , the tate museum the national gallery all in one museum .
it 's a big job you 've got , and it 's a big year you 've got coming up in 2004 .
foremost amongst the attractions we can look forward to is the moma , the legendary museum of modern art based in new york is coming to berlin to put on display 200 masterpieces of modern european art .
it 's a very exciting prospect , how did it come about ?
the idea was to give the museum of modern art seven months somewhere and where should it be ?
and they said , let 's make tokyo , madrid and all this and then they considered it from the point of history and said let 's go back to berlin to a place where somehow our roots are .
the very beginning of the moma as an ideal concept was in berlin with the national gallery and with the bauhaus in germany .
so coming back and also coming back to mies van der rohe .
in this building , mies van der rohe is somehow the architect of the moma .
so the modernist project comes back to berlin .
that 's it and for seven and more months , this is much more than an exhibition .
it 's a manifestation of modernism .
the point is the moma is coming back to the beginning and berlin is coming back to modernism .
you see modernism or modern art in berlin , in germany too , is also a disaster with all that we had with the degenerated art and all that .
art described as degenerative by the nazis .
yes , and now we have the collection of modernism in this building , a temple of modernity . it 's a great prospect , but there 's more to it than meets the eye , perhaps because there 's also a political aspect to it all as well .
the co-patrons of the exhibition are joschka fischer , the german foreign minister , and colin powell , his american counter-part .
there 's been a lot of turbulence on the diplomatic level between germany and america in recent times let 's say .
is there an element of cultural fence mending going on here ?
it 's a manifestation of real understanding a deep friendship in the cultural field .
there 's not so much trouble and confusion as in the political field .
berlin is always looking with love to new york .
berlin always likes to be compared with new york , berlin likes to be the other new york .
and there 's more coming up in 2004 than just to moma exhibition , what else is bubbling ?
we will open the helmut newton museum , the helmut newton foundation .
it 's an artist coming from berlin and becoming international in paris , london , new york .
and so you see this cosmopolitan - this side of berlin , to re-establish this and this is in the middle of the year .
towards the end of the year we have the collection of frederic christian flick , the “ mick flick collection ” of very contemporary art in our museum of contemporary art , the hamburger bahnhof , and so you have the beginning of the classical modern with the moma and then you have how modernism ends with the very contemporary .
and so you could say that berlin is somehow a little bit of the cultural capital in 2004 - luckily . berlin the cultural capital of europe perhaps , berlin the cultural capital of germany maybe .
let me put another quote to you .
berlin , you have said yourself , is a showcase for the nation , for the german nation .
what does that mean ?
the awareness of germany is very difficult with the different länders . the federal states ?
yes , and this very important capital areas like munich , hamburg , stuttgart and all these .
and then almost you have the question where is germany ?
as what is really relevant or who can demonstrate a figure from germany .
and at the very end there is now berlin - the new capital of this united germany and this tremendously large museum complex .
and so you get an awareness of germany and it 's somehow that the international audience is expecting .
the international audience maybe , but there are many in germany in many of the other german cities hamburg , munich , frankfurt perhaps they 're not happy about berlin being the featured german city , not necessarily so .
well the point is that ten-fifteen years ago we always said berlin was the showcase of the free western society .
west berlin ?
yeah , and everybody was glad about this and now i think we have this free society and we should make the best of it and we should develop a good feeling .
and for all these other cities we are now somehow at the stage , for bavaria and saxony for example , in berlin , to be seen by an international audience .
see after the flood in dresden we made the large exhibitions and then it went to london to the royal academy .
so i think this works in a mutual friendship .
berlin is so big , berlin is so rich with the collections that there are so many other places for the others to be here and to be shown here .
so i think there is good competition but at the very end its the focus .
we 've talked about berlin as a national arts capital for germany perhaps , now what about berlin and international art ?
the point is we are a universal museum and our companion museum , is somehow the british museum and it 's more than le louvre and we would like really to establish a non-european collections also in the center of berlin , in what we call the " mitte of the mitte . "
the " middle of the middle . "
that 's it - and there 's a complete deserted area where the castle was in the centre .
the former hohenzollern palace in the center of berlin .
that 's it the berlin castle and we would like to establish a non-european museum there , so we have the european and the non-european - a touch of le louvre and a bit of the british museum all concentrated in this city and i think this will give a new aspect , dimension to berlin and the cultural role of this capital . one aspect of the berlin landscape that we have n't mentioned so far is the museum island .
it 's a world cultural heritage site since 1994 , unesco nominated it as such .
it 's a very impressive ensemble .

opinion : desperately ditching denglish europe battles english invasion should german be cleansed of " denglish " ? culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.02.2004 deutsch please , we 're german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe bilingual is the way to go ?
as the world celebrates international mother language day on saturday , germany 's language purists bemoan the relentless onslaught of denglish .
but a german watchdog has hinted that a turnabout might be in sight . when burger giant mcdonald 's recently dropped its famous english slogan " everytime a good time " for its tv advertisement in germany and replaced it with a very german " ich liebe es " -lrb- i 'm lovin ' it -rrb- , an audible whoop of joy was heard in the language purist camp in the country .
after years of all-out war against the rise of denglish -lrb- a mixture of german and english -rrb- , the institute for german language -lrb- vds -rrb- - self-appointed guardian of the sanctity of german language - is celebrating .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going german at mcdonald 's " we have detected a trend reversal , " walter krämer , chairman of the vds told dpa news agency .
" the fast-food chain mcdonald 's is once again advertising in german for its products , even other companies and concerns have rediscovered german for their slogans , " he said .
understand english ?
but rather than a sense of loyalty and pride towards its own native language - a sentiment more in keeping with international mother language day - it 's pragmatic concerns that have fuelled the german advertising industry 's recourse to german .
tobias mindner , vds press spokesman pointed out that advertising gurus in germany had found in a study that most of its target audience did n't understand slick english one-liners .
indeed the recent representative study concluded that 59 percent of those surveyed could n't correctly translate mcdonald 's every time a good time into german .
the same went for mitsubishi 's slogan drive alive .
just 18 percent understood it as " lively driving " in german , the rest interpreted it as " survive the drive in our car " - a potentially damaging promo for the carmaker .
the participants were all aged between 14 and 59 - a target group that 's considered the biggest spender and thus the most promising for the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw calls on customers to " dress your car , " but what 's that supposed to mean , exactly ?
" a much smaller percentage of people in germany speak english than is generally assumed , " mindner told dw-world .
" just about ten percent speak and really understand it well .
so you ca n't really just use snazzy english phrases and enthuse people for products , when they do n't really get the message , " he added .
spectacular moves to clean up german the vds has been up in arms against the encroachment of english words in the german language for the past six years and is known for its often eccentric ways to achieve its aim .
last year the watchdog symbolically auctioned the german language on ebay .
within two days , the highest bid lay above ten million euro , following which the internet auction site stopped the trade .
the organization also attempted to sue the supervisory board of deutsche telekom for its " nonsensical use " of english words like city call , holiday plus tarif and german call .
the institute also awards a prize for the sprachpanscher -lrb- language debaser -rrb- of the year .
" no to denglish " the onslaught of so-called denglish is apparent not just in germany 's advertising and business world , but increasingly in almost all walks of life and it is n't just irking language experts .
a group of senior citizens in the bavarian city of nuremberg recently started a " no to denglish " signature campaign .
magda schleip , a member , told daily süddeutsche zeitung , " older people only understand fragments of what politicians , advertising gurus and media tell them everyday . "
schleip added that the problem was even more acute for the unemployed .
" the federal labor agency only talks about job centers , cluster building , clearing offices , " she said .
" which unemployed person understands that ? "
awareness the key ?
though politicians - who are prey to denglish themselves -lrb- task force , road show , pre-events -rrb- - are clear it 's impossible to enforce laws to cleanse german , it 's generally agreed that awareness is the best way to counter the malaise .
thus the bavarian education ministry has announced that it has urged schools to " take special responsibility for the german language " on feb .
21 , the international mother language day .

towards the end of the year we have the collection of frederic christian flick , the “ mick flick collection ” of very contemporary art in our museum of contemporary art , the hamburger bahnhof , and so you have the beginning of the classical modern with the moma and then you have how modernism ends with the very contemporary .
and so you could say that berlin is somehow a little bit of the cultural capital in 2004 - luckily . berlin the cultural capital of europe perhaps , berlin the cultural capital of germany maybe .
let me put another quote to you .
berlin , you have said yourself , is a showcase for the nation , for the german nation .
what does that mean ?
the awareness of germany is very difficult with the different länders . the federal states ?
yes , and this very important capital areas like munich , hamburg , stuttgart and all these .
and then almost you have the question where is germany ?
as what is really relevant or who can demonstrate a figure from germany .
and at the very end there is now berlin - the new capital of this united germany and this tremendously large museum complex .
and so you get an awareness of germany and it 's somehow that the international audience is expecting .
the international audience maybe , but there are many in germany in many of the other german cities hamburg , munich , frankfurt perhaps they 're not happy about berlin being the featured german city , not necessarily so .
well the point is that ten-fifteen years ago we always said berlin was the showcase of the free western society .
west berlin ?
yeah , and everybody was glad about this and now i think we have this free society and we should make the best of it and we should develop a good feeling .
and for all these other cities we are now somehow at the stage , for bavaria and saxony for example , in berlin , to be seen by an international audience .
see after the flood in dresden we made the large exhibitions and then it went to london to the royal academy .
so i think this works in a mutual friendship .
berlin is so big , berlin is so rich with the collections that there are so many other places for the others to be here and to be shown here .
so i think there is good competition but at the very end its the focus .
we 've talked about berlin as a national arts capital for germany perhaps , now what about berlin and international art ?
the point is we are a universal museum and our companion museum , is somehow the british museum and it 's more than le louvre and we would like really to establish a non-european collections also in the center of berlin , in what we call the " mitte of the mitte . "
the " middle of the middle . "
that 's it - and there 's a complete deserted area where the castle was in the centre .
the former hohenzollern palace in the center of berlin .
that 's it the berlin castle and we would like to establish a non-european museum there , so we have the european and the non-european - a touch of le louvre and a bit of the british museum all concentrated in this city and i think this will give a new aspect , dimension to berlin and the cultural role of this capital . one aspect of the berlin landscape that we have n't mentioned so far is the museum island .
it 's a world cultural heritage site since 1994 , unesco nominated it as such .
it 's a very impressive ensemble .
could you describe museum island and your vision for it .
the museum island is an island in the center of the town with five museum buildings or better put five museum temples built from 1830 to 1930 - and it 's unique to have five so completely different museums for european art history , from the very beginning till 1900 .
and as it 's in one spot , it 's like an acropolis of the arts - and it 's only for the arts , only for the visitors and to re-do this , one building is a complete ruin , the others have to be re-done and all this will be finished in ten years .
and now we 're on the way and we 're re-doing one building after the other and it 's a real surprise , you have historical monumental buildings that no-one would build now .
it 's a real luxury in museum crowd and to have this rich collection together with - it 's really unique , you should see it . interview conducted by peter craven send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moma in berlin back to deutsche welle 's complete coverage the dw-tv asia + quiz want to see if you have won ?

the moma exhibition opened in berlin on friday .
dw-tv talked to peter-klaus schuster , director general of the city of berlin 's state museums , about his work as well as the event . thanks very much for joining us today , mr schuster .
now if my math is up to much then you are in charge of no fewer than sixteen separate museums and galleries .
it ’ s an impressive total , among them are some of the most prestigious in the world .
it 's no surprise therefore , i 've got a quote , that you have been described by one source at least as being " the most powerful museum administrator in the world " .
is that how it feels to you ?
not really , we feel much more modest .
but you 're right , there are sixteen museums in one museum institution , this makes the state museum of berlin so unique .
if you compare it to london that would mean the british museum , the tate museum the national gallery all in one museum .
it 's a big job you 've got , and it 's a big year you 've got coming up in 2004 .
foremost amongst the attractions we can look forward to is the moma , the legendary museum of modern art based in new york is coming to berlin to put on display 200 masterpieces of modern european art .
it 's a very exciting prospect , how did it come about ?
the idea was to give the museum of modern art seven months somewhere and where should it be ?
and they said , let 's make tokyo , madrid and all this and then they considered it from the point of history and said let 's go back to berlin to a place where somehow our roots are .
the very beginning of the moma as an ideal concept was in berlin with the national gallery and with the bauhaus in germany .
so coming back and also coming back to mies van der rohe .
in this building , mies van der rohe is somehow the architect of the moma .
so the modernist project comes back to berlin .
that 's it and for seven and more months , this is much more than an exhibition .
it 's a manifestation of modernism .
the point is the moma is coming back to the beginning and berlin is coming back to modernism .
you see modernism or modern art in berlin , in germany too , is also a disaster with all that we had with the degenerated art and all that .
art described as degenerative by the nazis .
yes , and now we have the collection of modernism in this building , a temple of modernity . it 's a great prospect , but there 's more to it than meets the eye , perhaps because there 's also a political aspect to it all as well .
the co-patrons of the exhibition are joschka fischer , the german foreign minister , and colin powell , his american counter-part .
there 's been a lot of turbulence on the diplomatic level between germany and america in recent times let 's say .
is there an element of cultural fence mending going on here ?
it 's a manifestation of real understanding a deep friendship in the cultural field .
there 's not so much trouble and confusion as in the political field .
berlin is always looking with love to new york .
berlin always likes to be compared with new york , berlin likes to be the other new york .
and there 's more coming up in 2004 than just to moma exhibition , what else is bubbling ?
we will open the helmut newton museum , the helmut newton foundation .
it 's an artist coming from berlin and becoming international in paris , london , new york .
and so you see this cosmopolitan - this side of berlin , to re-establish this and this is in the middle of the year .
towards the end of the year we have the collection of frederic christian flick , the “ mick flick collection ” of very contemporary art in our museum of contemporary art , the hamburger bahnhof , and so you have the beginning of the classical modern with the moma and then you have how modernism ends with the very contemporary .

the federal office for radiation protection -lrb- bfs -rrb- has called for the shut-down of five german nuclear energy plants because they lack sufficient protection against terror attacks . of germany 's 18 nuclear power plants , the five plants are most vulnerable in case of a terror attack involving planes such as the sept .
11 attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon , bfs president wolfram könig said in an interview with berliner zeitung .
könig 's assessment is based on a report by the society for reactor safety -lrb- grs -rrb- , germany 's central expert institution on nuclear safety . the report however does not look at concrete , actual safety risks at particular plants , according to a statement by germany 's federal ministry for the environment , nature conservation and nuclear safety , which oversees the bfs .
the ministry 's statement added that german states had so far failed to review the safety of plants based on the report . the plants include biblis a in the german state of hesse , which is operated by rwe , philipsburg 1 and obrigheim in baden-württemberg , which belong to energy company enbw , isar 1 in bavaria that 's part of power giant eon and brunsbüttel in schlwesig-holstein , which is operated by vattenfall europe and eon .
spokespeople for the companies could not be reached on saturday or did not want to comment on könig 's statements . environmentalists welcomed könig 's call to shut down the plants , saying that such a step was long overdue .
" a plane crash could lead to a worst case scenario at any german nuclear power plant , " walter jungbauer , a nuclear energy expert with german environmental organization bund , told dpa news service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stade plant has already been switched off .
germany has already passed a law that will phase out nuclear energy by 2020 .
each of the country 's nuclear plants will be closed down after operating for 32 years .
the first closure already happened last november , when the stade plant -lrb- photo -rrb- was removed from the power grid .
obrigheim is next in line , with shut-off scheduled for may 2005 . extending lifetime of safer plants ? könig suggested that energy companies could be compensated for closing down allegedly unsafe plants by extending the operating time on other , more secure sites .
" that 's economically justifiable and legally possible , " könig told the paper . he also criticized germany 's nuclear energy suppliers for failing to do more to protect plants from terror attacks .
könig said he believed the companies had not done what 's necessary after the sept .
11 attacks .
he added that he did n't think proposals to enclose plants in a cloud of fog in case of an attack would alleviate the public 's safety concerns . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts nuclear energy phase-out germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .

as the world celebrates international mother language day on saturday , germany 's language purists bemoan the relentless onslaught of denglish .
but a german watchdog has hinted that a turnabout might be in sight . when burger giant mcdonald 's recently dropped its famous english slogan " everytime a good time " for its tv advertisement in germany and replaced it with a very german " ich liebe es " -lrb- i 'm lovin ' it -rrb- , an audible whoop of joy was heard in the language purist camp in the country .
after years of all-out war against the rise of denglish -lrb- a mixture of german and english -rrb- , the institute for german language -lrb- vds -rrb- - self-appointed guardian of the sanctity of german language - is celebrating .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going german at mcdonald 's " we have detected a trend reversal , " walter krämer , chairman of the vds told dpa news agency .
" the fast-food chain mcdonald 's is once again advertising in german for its products , even other companies and concerns have rediscovered german for their slogans , " he said .
understand english ?
but rather than a sense of loyalty and pride towards its own native language - a sentiment more in keeping with international mother language day - it 's pragmatic concerns that have fuelled the german advertising industry 's recourse to german .
tobias mindner , vds press spokesman pointed out that advertising gurus in germany had found in a study that most of its target audience did n't understand slick english one-liners .
indeed the recent representative study concluded that 59 percent of those surveyed could n't correctly translate mcdonald 's every time a good time into german .
the same went for mitsubishi 's slogan drive alive .
just 18 percent understood it as " lively driving " in german , the rest interpreted it as " survive the drive in our car " - a potentially damaging promo for the carmaker .
the participants were all aged between 14 and 59 - a target group that 's considered the biggest spender and thus the most promising for the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw calls on customers to " dress your car , " but what 's that supposed to mean , exactly ?
" a much smaller percentage of people in germany speak english than is generally assumed , " mindner told dw-world .
" just about ten percent speak and really understand it well .
so you ca n't really just use snazzy english phrases and enthuse people for products , when they do n't really get the message , " he added .
spectacular moves to clean up german the vds has been up in arms against the encroachment of english words in the german language for the past six years and is known for its often eccentric ways to achieve its aim .
last year the watchdog symbolically auctioned the german language on ebay .
within two days , the highest bid lay above ten million euro , following which the internet auction site stopped the trade .
the organization also attempted to sue the supervisory board of deutsche telekom for its " nonsensical use " of english words like city call , holiday plus tarif and german call .
the institute also awards a prize for the sprachpanscher -lrb- language debaser -rrb- of the year .
" no to denglish " the onslaught of so-called denglish is apparent not just in germany 's advertising and business world , but increasingly in almost all walks of life and it is n't just irking language experts .
a group of senior citizens in the bavarian city of nuremberg recently started a " no to denglish " signature campaign .
magda schleip , a member , told daily süddeutsche zeitung , " older people only understand fragments of what politicians , advertising gurus and media tell them everyday . "
schleip added that the problem was even more acute for the unemployed .
" the federal labor agency only talks about job centers , cluster building , clearing offices , " she said .
" which unemployed person understands that ? "

if german ports want to continue doing business with america , they have until july 1 to install comprehensive and high-tech security systems designed to keep out terrorists . over the past two years , hamburg 's massive port has begun to turn itself into a modern-day fortress .
germany 's largest shipping port - the eighth busiest in the world - has installed security cameras , id and x-ray scanners as part of the international ship and port facility security code , agreed on by the united states in 2002 .
the code lays out security plans international ports must implement if they want to continue doing trade with the united states .
only ports that have given u.s. customs agents access to their facilities are allowed to ship freight to u.s. ports . " it 's very important to do this now , " jens weber , who is responsible for bringing the port 's security procedures in line with america 's demands , told dw-radio .
" the terminals are sheltered against theft , but to shelter a terminal against acts of terrorism , there is much more to be done . " high-tech , random checks all container trucks passing through the gates of the hamburg port are now subject to a security check .
port employees scan the truck 's documents and freight papers and cross check the information in a computer system and with the shipping company .
should there be any reason for suspicion , customs officers will check the container using new x-ray scanners . if everything checks out the driver is given a plastic id card that must then be presented at other check points until the container has been transferred the harbor ’ s satellite-controlled and fully automated loading system . customs officials are also on hand to examine container numbers and documentation .
inspectors look to see if there ’ s any damage to the steel container and they check the high security seal on the door . " they make random checks .
first they check the papers and if there ’ s any suggestion there ’ s anything wrong , they make an x-ray check and if they find something on the screen , they strip the container , ” said weber . major task ahead of them the companies that use the harbor bear the large brunt of the cost .
in order to get a security certificate from officials , companies have to invest at least € 30,000 -lrb- $ 37,580 -rrb- .
for large firms , the costs climb into the millions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 6 million containers went in and out of the port last year .
despite acknowledgement that their harbor is among the most modern in the world , hamburg city officials are realistic about the challenges that face them .
last year , more than six million containers moved in and out of the hamburg port .
the harbor has room for 300 ships . " “ if we checked each of the six million containers that we handle in hamburg each year – opened the doors or sent them to be x-rayed , we ’ d have a traffic jam all the way to the alps , " said heiko beller , of hamburg 's department of the interior in a dw-radio interview . port officials will have to learn how to keep security standards high without hampering the normal flow of business . “ we need to undertake measures that don ’ t strangle the port economy and traffic , " beller said .
" of course we want to promote trade .
if the measures became too strong , they would probably restrict it .
but that ’ s a balancing act that has to be performed . ” dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. seeks to help secure european ports as america steps up measures to secure its ports , customs officials are now working with their counterparts in europe to scan container cargo for terrorist material before it reaches the u.s.

opinion : desperately ditching denglish europe battles english invasion should german be cleansed of " denglish " ? culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.02.2004 deutsch please , we 're german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe bilingual is the way to go ?
as the world celebrates international mother language day on saturday , germany 's language purists bemoan the relentless onslaught of denglish .
but a german watchdog has hinted that a turnabout might be in sight . when burger giant mcdonald 's recently dropped its famous english slogan " everytime a good time " for its tv advertisement in germany and replaced it with a very german " ich liebe es " -lrb- i 'm lovin ' it -rrb- , an audible whoop of joy was heard in the language purist camp in the country .
after years of all-out war against the rise of denglish -lrb- a mixture of german and english -rrb- , the institute for german language -lrb- vds -rrb- - self-appointed guardian of the sanctity of german language - is celebrating .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going german at mcdonald 's " we have detected a trend reversal , " walter krämer , chairman of the vds told dpa news agency .
" the fast-food chain mcdonald 's is once again advertising in german for its products , even other companies and concerns have rediscovered german for their slogans , " he said .
understand english ?
but rather than a sense of loyalty and pride towards its own native language - a sentiment more in keeping with international mother language day - it 's pragmatic concerns that have fuelled the german advertising industry 's recourse to german .
tobias mindner , vds press spokesman pointed out that advertising gurus in germany had found in a study that most of its target audience did n't understand slick english one-liners .
indeed the recent representative study concluded that 59 percent of those surveyed could n't correctly translate mcdonald 's every time a good time into german .
the same went for mitsubishi 's slogan drive alive .
just 18 percent understood it as " lively driving " in german , the rest interpreted it as " survive the drive in our car " - a potentially damaging promo for the carmaker .
the participants were all aged between 14 and 59 - a target group that 's considered the biggest spender and thus the most promising for the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw calls on customers to " dress your car , " but what 's that supposed to mean , exactly ?
" a much smaller percentage of people in germany speak english than is generally assumed , " mindner told dw-world .
" just about ten percent speak and really understand it well .
so you ca n't really just use snazzy english phrases and enthuse people for products , when they do n't really get the message , " he added .
spectacular moves to clean up german the vds has been up in arms against the encroachment of english words in the german language for the past six years and is known for its often eccentric ways to achieve its aim .
last year the watchdog symbolically auctioned the german language on ebay .
within two days , the highest bid lay above ten million euro , following which the internet auction site stopped the trade .
the organization also attempted to sue the supervisory board of deutsche telekom for its " nonsensical use " of english words like city call , holiday plus tarif and german call .
the institute also awards a prize for the sprachpanscher -lrb- language debaser -rrb- of the year .
" no to denglish " the onslaught of so-called denglish is apparent not just in germany 's advertising and business world , but increasingly in almost all walks of life and it is n't just irking language experts .
a group of senior citizens in the bavarian city of nuremberg recently started a " no to denglish " signature campaign .
magda schleip , a member , told daily süddeutsche zeitung , " older people only understand fragments of what politicians , advertising gurus and media tell them everyday . "
schleip added that the problem was even more acute for the unemployed .
" the federal labor agency only talks about job centers , cluster building , clearing offices , " she said .
" which unemployed person understands that ? "
awareness the key ?
though politicians - who are prey to denglish themselves -lrb- task force , road show , pre-events -rrb- - are clear it 's impossible to enforce laws to cleanse german , it 's generally agreed that awareness is the best way to counter the malaise .
thus the bavarian education ministry has announced that it has urged schools to " take special responsibility for the german language " on feb .
21 , the international mother language day .

the moma exhibition opened in berlin on friday .
dw-tv talked to peter-klaus schuster , director general of the city of berlin 's state museums , about his work as well as the event . thanks very much for joining us today , mr schuster .
now if my math is up to much then you are in charge of no fewer than sixteen separate museums and galleries .
it ’ s an impressive total , among them are some of the most prestigious in the world .
it 's no surprise therefore , i 've got a quote , that you have been described by one source at least as being " the most powerful museum administrator in the world " .
is that how it feels to you ?
not really , we feel much more modest .
but you 're right , there are sixteen museums in one museum institution , this makes the state museum of berlin so unique .
if you compare it to london that would mean the british museum , the tate museum the national gallery all in one museum .
it 's a big job you 've got , and it 's a big year you 've got coming up in 2004 .
foremost amongst the attractions we can look forward to is the moma , the legendary museum of modern art based in new york is coming to berlin to put on display 200 masterpieces of modern european art .
it 's a very exciting prospect , how did it come about ?
the idea was to give the museum of modern art seven months somewhere and where should it be ?
and they said , let 's make tokyo , madrid and all this and then they considered it from the point of history and said let 's go back to berlin to a place where somehow our roots are .
the very beginning of the moma as an ideal concept was in berlin with the national gallery and with the bauhaus in germany .
so coming back and also coming back to mies van der rohe .
in this building , mies van der rohe is somehow the architect of the moma .
so the modernist project comes back to berlin .
that 's it and for seven and more months , this is much more than an exhibition .
it 's a manifestation of modernism .
the point is the moma is coming back to the beginning and berlin is coming back to modernism .
you see modernism or modern art in berlin , in germany too , is also a disaster with all that we had with the degenerated art and all that .
art described as degenerative by the nazis .
yes , and now we have the collection of modernism in this building , a temple of modernity . it 's a great prospect , but there 's more to it than meets the eye , perhaps because there 's also a political aspect to it all as well .
the co-patrons of the exhibition are joschka fischer , the german foreign minister , and colin powell , his american counter-part .
there 's been a lot of turbulence on the diplomatic level between germany and america in recent times let 's say .
is there an element of cultural fence mending going on here ?
it 's a manifestation of real understanding a deep friendship in the cultural field .
there 's not so much trouble and confusion as in the political field .
berlin is always looking with love to new york .
berlin always likes to be compared with new york , berlin likes to be the other new york .
and there 's more coming up in 2004 than just to moma exhibition , what else is bubbling ?
we will open the helmut newton museum , the helmut newton foundation .
it 's an artist coming from berlin and becoming international in paris , london , new york .
and so you see this cosmopolitan - this side of berlin , to re-establish this and this is in the middle of the year .
towards the end of the year we have the collection of frederic christian flick , the “ mick flick collection ” of very contemporary art in our museum of contemporary art , the hamburger bahnhof , and so you have the beginning of the classical modern with the moma and then you have how modernism ends with the very contemporary .
and so you could say that berlin is somehow a little bit of the cultural capital in 2004 - luckily . berlin the cultural capital of europe perhaps , berlin the cultural capital of germany maybe .
let me put another quote to you .
berlin , you have said yourself , is a showcase for the nation , for the german nation .
what does that mean ?
the awareness of germany is very difficult with the different länders . the federal states ?
yes , and this very important capital areas like munich , hamburg , stuttgart and all these .
and then almost you have the question where is germany ?
as what is really relevant or who can demonstrate a figure from germany .
and at the very end there is now berlin - the new capital of this united germany and this tremendously large museum complex .
and so you get an awareness of germany and it 's somehow that the international audience is expecting .
the international audience maybe , but there are many in germany in many of the other german cities hamburg , munich , frankfurt perhaps they 're not happy about berlin being the featured german city , not necessarily so .
well the point is that ten-fifteen years ago we always said berlin was the showcase of the free western society .
west berlin ?
yeah , and everybody was glad about this and now i think we have this free society and we should make the best of it and we should develop a good feeling .
and for all these other cities we are now somehow at the stage , for bavaria and saxony for example , in berlin , to be seen by an international audience .
see after the flood in dresden we made the large exhibitions and then it went to london to the royal academy .
so i think this works in a mutual friendship .
berlin is so big , berlin is so rich with the collections that there are so many other places for the others to be here and to be shown here .
so i think there is good competition but at the very end its the focus .
we 've talked about berlin as a national arts capital for germany perhaps , now what about berlin and international art ?
the point is we are a universal museum and our companion museum , is somehow the british museum and it 's more than le louvre and we would like really to establish a non-european collections also in the center of berlin , in what we call the " mitte of the mitte . "
the " middle of the middle . "
that 's it - and there 's a complete deserted area where the castle was in the centre .
the former hohenzollern palace in the center of berlin .
that 's it the berlin castle and we would like to establish a non-european museum there , so we have the european and the non-european - a touch of le louvre and a bit of the british museum all concentrated in this city and i think this will give a new aspect , dimension to berlin and the cultural role of this capital . one aspect of the berlin landscape that we have n't mentioned so far is the museum island .
it 's a world cultural heritage site since 1994 , unesco nominated it as such .
it 's a very impressive ensemble .
could you describe museum island and your vision for it .
the museum island is an island in the center of the town with five museum buildings or better put five museum temples built from 1830 to 1930 - and it 's unique to have five so completely different museums for european art history , from the very beginning till 1900 .
and as it 's in one spot , it 's like an acropolis of the arts - and it 's only for the arts , only for the visitors and to re-do this , one building is a complete ruin , the others have to be re-done and all this will be finished in ten years .
and now we 're on the way and we 're re-doing one building after the other and it 's a real surprise , you have historical monumental buildings that no-one would build now .
it 's a real luxury in museum crowd and to have this rich collection together with - it 's really unique , you should see it . interview conducted by peter craven send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moma in berlin back to deutsche welle 's complete coverage the dw-tv asia + quiz want to see if you have won ?

if german ports want to continue doing business with america , they have until july 1 to install comprehensive and high-tech security systems designed to keep out terrorists . over the past two years , hamburg 's massive port has begun to turn itself into a modern-day fortress .
germany 's largest shipping port - the eighth busiest in the world - has installed security cameras , id and x-ray scanners as part of the international ship and port facility security code , agreed on by the united states in 2002 .
the code lays out security plans international ports must implement if they want to continue doing trade with the united states .
only ports that have given u.s. customs agents access to their facilities are allowed to ship freight to u.s. ports . " it 's very important to do this now , " jens weber , who is responsible for bringing the port 's security procedures in line with america 's demands , told dw-radio .
" the terminals are sheltered against theft , but to shelter a terminal against acts of terrorism , there is much more to be done . " high-tech , random checks all container trucks passing through the gates of the hamburg port are now subject to a security check .
port employees scan the truck 's documents and freight papers and cross check the information in a computer system and with the shipping company .
should there be any reason for suspicion , customs officers will check the container using new x-ray scanners . if everything checks out the driver is given a plastic id card that must then be presented at other check points until the container has been transferred the harbor ’ s satellite-controlled and fully automated loading system . customs officials are also on hand to examine container numbers and documentation .
inspectors look to see if there ’ s any damage to the steel container and they check the high security seal on the door . " they make random checks .
first they check the papers and if there ’ s any suggestion there ’ s anything wrong , they make an x-ray check and if they find something on the screen , they strip the container , ” said weber . major task ahead of them the companies that use the harbor bear the large brunt of the cost .
in order to get a security certificate from officials , companies have to invest at least € 30,000 -lrb- $ 37,580 -rrb- .
for large firms , the costs climb into the millions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 6 million containers went in and out of the port last year .
despite acknowledgement that their harbor is among the most modern in the world , hamburg city officials are realistic about the challenges that face them .

the federal office for radiation protection -lrb- bfs -rrb- has called for the shut-down of five german nuclear energy plants because they lack sufficient protection against terror attacks . of germany 's 18 nuclear power plants , the five plants are most vulnerable in case of a terror attack involving planes such as the sept .
11 attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon , bfs president wolfram könig said in an interview with berliner zeitung .
könig 's assessment is based on a report by the society for reactor safety -lrb- grs -rrb- , germany 's central expert institution on nuclear safety . the report however does not look at concrete , actual safety risks at particular plants , according to a statement by germany 's federal ministry for the environment , nature conservation and nuclear safety , which oversees the bfs .
the ministry 's statement added that german states had so far failed to review the safety of plants based on the report . the plants include biblis a in the german state of hesse , which is operated by rwe , philipsburg 1 and obrigheim in baden-württemberg , which belong to energy company enbw , isar 1 in bavaria that 's part of power giant eon and brunsbüttel in schlwesig-holstein , which is operated by vattenfall europe and eon .
spokespeople for the companies could not be reached on saturday or did not want to comment on könig 's statements . environmentalists welcomed könig 's call to shut down the plants , saying that such a step was long overdue .
" a plane crash could lead to a worst case scenario at any german nuclear power plant , " walter jungbauer , a nuclear energy expert with german environmental organization bund , told dpa news service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stade plant has already been switched off .
germany has already passed a law that will phase out nuclear energy by 2020 .
each of the country 's nuclear plants will be closed down after operating for 32 years .
the first closure already happened last november , when the stade plant -lrb- photo -rrb- was removed from the power grid .
obrigheim is next in line , with shut-off scheduled for may 2005 . extending lifetime of safer plants ? könig suggested that energy companies could be compensated for closing down allegedly unsafe plants by extending the operating time on other , more secure sites .
" that 's economically justifiable and legally possible , " könig told the paper . he also criticized germany 's nuclear energy suppliers for failing to do more to protect plants from terror attacks .
könig said he believed the companies had not done what 's necessary after the sept .
11 attacks .
he added that he did n't think proposals to enclose plants in a cloud of fog in case of an attack would alleviate the public 's safety concerns . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts nuclear energy phase-out germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .

the moma exhibition opened in berlin on friday .
dw-tv talked to peter-klaus schuster , director general of the city of berlin 's state museums , about his work as well as the event . thanks very much for joining us today , mr schuster .
now if my math is up to much then you are in charge of no fewer than sixteen separate museums and galleries .
it ’ s an impressive total , among them are some of the most prestigious in the world .
it 's no surprise therefore , i 've got a quote , that you have been described by one source at least as being " the most powerful museum administrator in the world " .
is that how it feels to you ?
not really , we feel much more modest .
but you 're right , there are sixteen museums in one museum institution , this makes the state museum of berlin so unique .
if you compare it to london that would mean the british museum , the tate museum the national gallery all in one museum .
it 's a big job you 've got , and it 's a big year you 've got coming up in 2004 .
foremost amongst the attractions we can look forward to is the moma , the legendary museum of modern art based in new york is coming to berlin to put on display 200 masterpieces of modern european art .
it 's a very exciting prospect , how did it come about ?
the idea was to give the museum of modern art seven months somewhere and where should it be ?
and they said , let 's make tokyo , madrid and all this and then they considered it from the point of history and said let 's go back to berlin to a place where somehow our roots are .
the very beginning of the moma as an ideal concept was in berlin with the national gallery and with the bauhaus in germany .
so coming back and also coming back to mies van der rohe .
in this building , mies van der rohe is somehow the architect of the moma .
so the modernist project comes back to berlin .
that 's it and for seven and more months , this is much more than an exhibition .
it 's a manifestation of modernism .
the point is the moma is coming back to the beginning and berlin is coming back to modernism .
you see modernism or modern art in berlin , in germany too , is also a disaster with all that we had with the degenerated art and all that .
art described as degenerative by the nazis .
yes , and now we have the collection of modernism in this building , a temple of modernity . it 's a great prospect , but there 's more to it than meets the eye , perhaps because there 's also a political aspect to it all as well .
the co-patrons of the exhibition are joschka fischer , the german foreign minister , and colin powell , his american counter-part .
there 's been a lot of turbulence on the diplomatic level between germany and america in recent times let 's say .
is there an element of cultural fence mending going on here ?
it 's a manifestation of real understanding a deep friendship in the cultural field .
there 's not so much trouble and confusion as in the political field .
berlin is always looking with love to new york .
berlin always likes to be compared with new york , berlin likes to be the other new york .
and there 's more coming up in 2004 than just to moma exhibition , what else is bubbling ?
we will open the helmut newton museum , the helmut newton foundation .
it 's an artist coming from berlin and becoming international in paris , london , new york .
and so you see this cosmopolitan - this side of berlin , to re-establish this and this is in the middle of the year .
towards the end of the year we have the collection of frederic christian flick , the “ mick flick collection ” of very contemporary art in our museum of contemporary art , the hamburger bahnhof , and so you have the beginning of the classical modern with the moma and then you have how modernism ends with the very contemporary .
and so you could say that berlin is somehow a little bit of the cultural capital in 2004 - luckily . berlin the cultural capital of europe perhaps , berlin the cultural capital of germany maybe .
let me put another quote to you .
berlin , you have said yourself , is a showcase for the nation , for the german nation .
what does that mean ?
the awareness of germany is very difficult with the different länders . the federal states ?
yes , and this very important capital areas like munich , hamburg , stuttgart and all these .
and then almost you have the question where is germany ?
as what is really relevant or who can demonstrate a figure from germany .
and at the very end there is now berlin - the new capital of this united germany and this tremendously large museum complex .
and so you get an awareness of germany and it 's somehow that the international audience is expecting .
the international audience maybe , but there are many in germany in many of the other german cities hamburg , munich , frankfurt perhaps they 're not happy about berlin being the featured german city , not necessarily so .
well the point is that ten-fifteen years ago we always said berlin was the showcase of the free western society .
west berlin ?
yeah , and everybody was glad about this and now i think we have this free society and we should make the best of it and we should develop a good feeling .
and for all these other cities we are now somehow at the stage , for bavaria and saxony for example , in berlin , to be seen by an international audience .
see after the flood in dresden we made the large exhibitions and then it went to london to the royal academy .
so i think this works in a mutual friendship .
berlin is so big , berlin is so rich with the collections that there are so many other places for the others to be here and to be shown here .
so i think there is good competition but at the very end its the focus .
we 've talked about berlin as a national arts capital for germany perhaps , now what about berlin and international art ?
the point is we are a universal museum and our companion museum , is somehow the british museum and it 's more than le louvre and we would like really to establish a non-european collections also in the center of berlin , in what we call the " mitte of the mitte . "
the " middle of the middle . "
that 's it - and there 's a complete deserted area where the castle was in the centre .
the former hohenzollern palace in the center of berlin .
that 's it the berlin castle and we would like to establish a non-european museum there , so we have the european and the non-european - a touch of le louvre and a bit of the british museum all concentrated in this city and i think this will give a new aspect , dimension to berlin and the cultural role of this capital . one aspect of the berlin landscape that we have n't mentioned so far is the museum island .
it 's a world cultural heritage site since 1994 , unesco nominated it as such .
it 's a very impressive ensemble .
could you describe museum island and your vision for it .
the museum island is an island in the center of the town with five museum buildings or better put five museum temples built from 1830 to 1930 - and it 's unique to have five so completely different museums for european art history , from the very beginning till 1900 .
and as it 's in one spot , it 's like an acropolis of the arts - and it 's only for the arts , only for the visitors and to re-do this , one building is a complete ruin , the others have to be re-done and all this will be finished in ten years .
and now we 're on the way and we 're re-doing one building after the other and it 's a real surprise , you have historical monumental buildings that no-one would build now .
it 's a real luxury in museum crowd and to have this rich collection together with - it 's really unique , you should see it . interview conducted by peter craven send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moma in berlin back to deutsche welle 's complete coverage the dw-tv asia + quiz want to see if you have won ?

if german ports want to continue doing business with america , they have until july 1 to install comprehensive and high-tech security systems designed to keep out terrorists . over the past two years , hamburg 's massive port has begun to turn itself into a modern-day fortress .
germany 's largest shipping port - the eighth busiest in the world - has installed security cameras , id and x-ray scanners as part of the international ship and port facility security code , agreed on by the united states in 2002 .
the code lays out security plans international ports must implement if they want to continue doing trade with the united states .
only ports that have given u.s. customs agents access to their facilities are allowed to ship freight to u.s. ports . " it 's very important to do this now , " jens weber , who is responsible for bringing the port 's security procedures in line with america 's demands , told dw-radio .
" the terminals are sheltered against theft , but to shelter a terminal against acts of terrorism , there is much more to be done . " high-tech , random checks all container trucks passing through the gates of the hamburg port are now subject to a security check .
port employees scan the truck 's documents and freight papers and cross check the information in a computer system and with the shipping company .
should there be any reason for suspicion , customs officers will check the container using new x-ray scanners . if everything checks out the driver is given a plastic id card that must then be presented at other check points until the container has been transferred the harbor ’ s satellite-controlled and fully automated loading system . customs officials are also on hand to examine container numbers and documentation .
inspectors look to see if there ’ s any damage to the steel container and they check the high security seal on the door . " they make random checks .
first they check the papers and if there ’ s any suggestion there ’ s anything wrong , they make an x-ray check and if they find something on the screen , they strip the container , ” said weber . major task ahead of them the companies that use the harbor bear the large brunt of the cost .
in order to get a security certificate from officials , companies have to invest at least € 30,000 -lrb- $ 37,580 -rrb- .
for large firms , the costs climb into the millions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 6 million containers went in and out of the port last year .
despite acknowledgement that their harbor is among the most modern in the world , hamburg city officials are realistic about the challenges that face them .
last year , more than six million containers moved in and out of the hamburg port .
the harbor has room for 300 ships . " “ if we checked each of the six million containers that we handle in hamburg each year – opened the doors or sent them to be x-rayed , we ’ d have a traffic jam all the way to the alps , " said heiko beller , of hamburg 's department of the interior in a dw-radio interview . port officials will have to learn how to keep security standards high without hampering the normal flow of business . “ we need to undertake measures that don ’ t strangle the port economy and traffic , " beller said .

if german ports want to continue doing business with america , they have until july 1 to install comprehensive and high-tech security systems designed to keep out terrorists . over the past two years , hamburg 's massive port has begun to turn itself into a modern-day fortress .
germany 's largest shipping port - the eighth busiest in the world - has installed security cameras , id and x-ray scanners as part of the international ship and port facility security code , agreed on by the united states in 2002 .
the code lays out security plans international ports must implement if they want to continue doing trade with the united states .
only ports that have given u.s. customs agents access to their facilities are allowed to ship freight to u.s. ports . " it 's very important to do this now , " jens weber , who is responsible for bringing the port 's security procedures in line with america 's demands , told dw-radio .
" the terminals are sheltered against theft , but to shelter a terminal against acts of terrorism , there is much more to be done . " high-tech , random checks all container trucks passing through the gates of the hamburg port are now subject to a security check .
port employees scan the truck 's documents and freight papers and cross check the information in a computer system and with the shipping company .
should there be any reason for suspicion , customs officers will check the container using new x-ray scanners . if everything checks out the driver is given a plastic id card that must then be presented at other check points until the container has been transferred the harbor ’ s satellite-controlled and fully automated loading system . customs officials are also on hand to examine container numbers and documentation .

carnival in the rhineland culminates this week , but germany 's economic downturn has created problems for the region 's carnival associations .
with reduced government support and donations , many face an existential crisis . during the days of carnival , liquor flows freely as do the euros when millions are joining in the parades and street parties of germany 's largest public event .
countless bars and restaurants are full and of visitors flock to the rhineland for the six days of festivities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the star attraction is always the carnival associations , with their elaborately decorated floats and extravagant costumes .
they include everything from neighborhood groups to social groups , including gays and lesbians .
most dress as 18th century french soldiers -lrb- photo -rrb- - a mocking gesture to the region 's former occupier . for a long time now , carnival has been an important part of the economy in the cities and towns in the rhineland and along the main river .
but with a flagging economy in germany and diminished purchasing power , people are more reluctant to shell out money for costumes , beer and the expensive parties hosted by carnival associations .
that 's created a crisis for the groups . fewer sales , fewer subsidies " in cologne , where the biggest carnival celebrations are held , some groups are really having trouble this year , " said franz wolf , president of the german carnival association .
" at some of the events only 80 percent of the tickets were sold and empty tables could be found .
those are the first indications that something is wrong . " wolf does n't believe the economy has anything to do with it . " in my opinion , what the hospitality industry did after the change from the deutsch mark to the euro was impossible , " he said .
" in many cases , they just kept the deutsche mark price and put a euro sign in front of it making things twice as expensive .
nobody can pay the new prices . " in some places there are empty halls , empty bars , and even empty cash registers .
with lower tax revenues pouring in , many cities have also reduced the amount of subsidies they give to the different carnival associations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then german labor minister walter riester is pictured tortured as he appears during the 2001carnival parade in düsseldorf .
donations to the groups have also dropped and they 're having trouble making ends meet .
the average carnival association spends about € 400,000 -lrb- $ 506,000 -rrb- each year for everything from candy that 's tossed to crowds during parades to portable restrooms . an industry worth billions in order to plug the holes in their budgets , the associations have started doing what sporting event organizers have long been doing : they 're charging tv stations for the rights to broadcast their annual parties , which are often filled with celebrities and politicians . public broadcaster wdr in north-rhine-westphalia recently purchased the exclusive rights to broadcast massive rose monday parade in cologne .
other broadcasters are limited to covering the event in news reports . wdr is rumored to have paid in the seven figures for those rights .
but wdr is n't telling . tough times or not , carnival is an event that brings in big money that reaches virtually every business in the region . " it starts out when the women go to the hairdresser , " wolf said .
" they then attend a carnival event and they take a taxi or public transportation to get there .
they also buy costumes , drinks , meals . " it 's even been the subject of mckinsey study .
the consulting company found that germany 's carnival is a € 4 billion industry . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cashing in at karneval as cologne gears up for its annual party ritual when millions of visitors descend upon the city for the karneval , local businesses are rubbing their hands in glee at the thought of big profits .

carnival in the rhineland culminates this week , but germany 's economic downturn has created problems for the region 's carnival associations .
with reduced government support and donations , many face an existential crisis . during the days of carnival , liquor flows freely as do the euros when millions are joining in the parades and street parties of germany 's largest public event .
countless bars and restaurants are full and of visitors flock to the rhineland for the six days of festivities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the star attraction is always the carnival associations , with their elaborately decorated floats and extravagant costumes .

but with a flagging economy in germany and diminished purchasing power , people are more reluctant to shell out money for costumes , beer and the expensive parties hosted by carnival associations .
that 's created a crisis for the groups . fewer sales , fewer subsidies " in cologne , where the biggest carnival celebrations are held , some groups are really having trouble this year , " said franz wolf , president of the german carnival association .
" at some of the events only 80 percent of the tickets were sold and empty tables could be found .
those are the first indications that something is wrong . " wolf does n't believe the economy has anything to do with it . " in my opinion , what the hospitality industry did after the change from the deutsch mark to the euro was impossible , " he said .
" in many cases , they just kept the deutsche mark price and put a euro sign in front of it making things twice as expensive .

the federal office for radiation protection -lrb- bfs -rrb- has called for the shut-down of five german nuclear energy plants because they lack sufficient protection against terror attacks . of germany 's 18 nuclear power plants , the five plants are most vulnerable in case of a terror attack involving planes such as the sept .
11 attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon , bfs president wolfram könig said in an interview with berliner zeitung .
könig 's assessment is based on a report by the society for reactor safety -lrb- grs -rrb- , germany 's central expert institution on nuclear safety . the report however does not look at concrete , actual safety risks at particular plants , according to a statement by germany 's federal ministry for the environment , nature conservation and nuclear safety , which oversees the bfs .
the ministry 's statement added that german states had so far failed to review the safety of plants based on the report . the plants include biblis a in the german state of hesse , which is operated by rwe , philipsburg 1 and obrigheim in baden-württemberg , which belong to energy company enbw , isar 1 in bavaria that 's part of power giant eon and brunsbüttel in schlwesig-holstein , which is operated by vattenfall europe and eon .
spokespeople for the companies could not be reached on saturday or did not want to comment on könig 's statements . environmentalists welcomed könig 's call to shut down the plants , saying that such a step was long overdue .
" a plane crash could lead to a worst case scenario at any german nuclear power plant , " walter jungbauer , a nuclear energy expert with german environmental organization bund , told dpa news service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stade plant has already been switched off .
germany has already passed a law that will phase out nuclear energy by 2020 .
each of the country 's nuclear plants will be closed down after operating for 32 years .
the first closure already happened last november , when the stade plant -lrb- photo -rrb- was removed from the power grid .
obrigheim is next in line , with shut-off scheduled for may 2005 . extending lifetime of safer plants ? könig suggested that energy companies could be compensated for closing down allegedly unsafe plants by extending the operating time on other , more secure sites .
" that 's economically justifiable and legally possible , " könig told the paper . he also criticized germany 's nuclear energy suppliers for failing to do more to protect plants from terror attacks .
könig said he believed the companies had not done what 's necessary after the sept .

if german ports want to continue doing business with america , they have until july 1 to install comprehensive and high-tech security systems designed to keep out terrorists . over the past two years , hamburg 's massive port has begun to turn itself into a modern-day fortress .
germany 's largest shipping port - the eighth busiest in the world - has installed security cameras , id and x-ray scanners as part of the international ship and port facility security code , agreed on by the united states in 2002 .
the code lays out security plans international ports must implement if they want to continue doing trade with the united states .
only ports that have given u.s. customs agents access to their facilities are allowed to ship freight to u.s. ports . " it 's very important to do this now , " jens weber , who is responsible for bringing the port 's security procedures in line with america 's demands , told dw-radio .
" the terminals are sheltered against theft , but to shelter a terminal against acts of terrorism , there is much more to be done . " high-tech , random checks all container trucks passing through the gates of the hamburg port are now subject to a security check .
port employees scan the truck 's documents and freight papers and cross check the information in a computer system and with the shipping company .
should there be any reason for suspicion , customs officers will check the container using new x-ray scanners . if everything checks out the driver is given a plastic id card that must then be presented at other check points until the container has been transferred the harbor ’ s satellite-controlled and fully automated loading system . customs officials are also on hand to examine container numbers and documentation .
inspectors look to see if there ’ s any damage to the steel container and they check the high security seal on the door . " they make random checks .
first they check the papers and if there ’ s any suggestion there ’ s anything wrong , they make an x-ray check and if they find something on the screen , they strip the container , ” said weber . major task ahead of them the companies that use the harbor bear the large brunt of the cost .
in order to get a security certificate from officials , companies have to invest at least € 30,000 -lrb- $ 37,580 -rrb- .
for large firms , the costs climb into the millions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 6 million containers went in and out of the port last year .
despite acknowledgement that their harbor is among the most modern in the world , hamburg city officials are realistic about the challenges that face them .
last year , more than six million containers moved in and out of the hamburg port .
the harbor has room for 300 ships . " “ if we checked each of the six million containers that we handle in hamburg each year – opened the doors or sent them to be x-rayed , we ’ d have a traffic jam all the way to the alps , " said heiko beller , of hamburg 's department of the interior in a dw-radio interview . port officials will have to learn how to keep security standards high without hampering the normal flow of business . “ we need to undertake measures that don ’ t strangle the port economy and traffic , " beller said .
" of course we want to promote trade .
if the measures became too strong , they would probably restrict it .
but that ’ s a balancing act that has to be performed . ” dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. seeks to help secure european ports as america steps up measures to secure its ports , customs officials are now working with their counterparts in europe to scan container cargo for terrorist material before it reaches the u.s.

tobias mindner , vds press spokesman pointed out that advertising gurus in germany had found in a study that most of its target audience did n't understand slick english one-liners .
indeed the recent representative study concluded that 59 percent of those surveyed could n't correctly translate mcdonald 's every time a good time into german .

as the world celebrates international mother language day on saturday , germany 's language purists bemoan the relentless onslaught of denglish .
but a german watchdog has hinted that a turnabout might be in sight . when burger giant mcdonald 's recently dropped its famous english slogan " everytime a good time " for its tv advertisement in germany and replaced it with a very german " ich liebe es " -lrb- i 'm lovin ' it -rrb- , an audible whoop of joy was heard in the language purist camp in the country .
after years of all-out war against the rise of denglish -lrb- a mixture of german and english -rrb- , the institute for german language -lrb- vds -rrb- - self-appointed guardian of the sanctity of german language - is celebrating .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going german at mcdonald 's " we have detected a trend reversal , " walter krämer , chairman of the vds told dpa news agency .
" the fast-food chain mcdonald 's is once again advertising in german for its products , even other companies and concerns have rediscovered german for their slogans , " he said .
understand english ?
but rather than a sense of loyalty and pride towards its own native language - a sentiment more in keeping with international mother language day - it 's pragmatic concerns that have fuelled the german advertising industry 's recourse to german .
tobias mindner , vds press spokesman pointed out that advertising gurus in germany had found in a study that most of its target audience did n't understand slick english one-liners .
indeed the recent representative study concluded that 59 percent of those surveyed could n't correctly translate mcdonald 's every time a good time into german .
the same went for mitsubishi 's slogan drive alive .
just 18 percent understood it as " lively driving " in german , the rest interpreted it as " survive the drive in our car " - a potentially damaging promo for the carmaker .
the participants were all aged between 14 and 59 - a target group that 's considered the biggest spender and thus the most promising for the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw calls on customers to " dress your car , " but what 's that supposed to mean , exactly ?
" a much smaller percentage of people in germany speak english than is generally assumed , " mindner told dw-world .

spectacular moves to clean up german the vds has been up in arms against the encroachment of english words in the german language for the past six years and is known for its often eccentric ways to achieve its aim .
last year the watchdog symbolically auctioned the german language on ebay .
within two days , the highest bid lay above ten million euro , following which the internet auction site stopped the trade .
the organization also attempted to sue the supervisory board of deutsche telekom for its " nonsensical use " of english words like city call , holiday plus tarif and german call .
the institute also awards a prize for the sprachpanscher -lrb- language debaser -rrb- of the year .
" no to denglish " the onslaught of so-called denglish is apparent not just in germany 's advertising and business world , but increasingly in almost all walks of life and it is n't just irking language experts .
a group of senior citizens in the bavarian city of nuremberg recently started a " no to denglish " signature campaign .
magda schleip , a member , told daily süddeutsche zeitung , " older people only understand fragments of what politicians , advertising gurus and media tell them everyday . "
schleip added that the problem was even more acute for the unemployed .
" the federal labor agency only talks about job centers , cluster building , clearing offices , " she said .
" which unemployed person understands that ? "

if german ports want to continue doing business with america , they have until july 1 to install comprehensive and high-tech security systems designed to keep out terrorists . over the past two years , hamburg 's massive port has begun to turn itself into a modern-day fortress .
germany 's largest shipping port - the eighth busiest in the world - has installed security cameras , id and x-ray scanners as part of the international ship and port facility security code , agreed on by the united states in 2002 .
the code lays out security plans international ports must implement if they want to continue doing trade with the united states .
only ports that have given u.s. customs agents access to their facilities are allowed to ship freight to u.s. ports . " it 's very important to do this now , " jens weber , who is responsible for bringing the port 's security procedures in line with america 's demands , told dw-radio .
" the terminals are sheltered against theft , but to shelter a terminal against acts of terrorism , there is much more to be done . " high-tech , random checks all container trucks passing through the gates of the hamburg port are now subject to a security check .
port employees scan the truck 's documents and freight papers and cross check the information in a computer system and with the shipping company .
should there be any reason for suspicion , customs officers will check the container using new x-ray scanners . if everything checks out the driver is given a plastic id card that must then be presented at other check points until the container has been transferred the harbor ’ s satellite-controlled and fully automated loading system . customs officials are also on hand to examine container numbers and documentation .
inspectors look to see if there ’ s any damage to the steel container and they check the high security seal on the door . " they make random checks .
first they check the papers and if there ’ s any suggestion there ’ s anything wrong , they make an x-ray check and if they find something on the screen , they strip the container , ” said weber . major task ahead of them the companies that use the harbor bear the large brunt of the cost .
in order to get a security certificate from officials , companies have to invest at least € 30,000 -lrb- $ 37,580 -rrb- .
for large firms , the costs climb into the millions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 6 million containers went in and out of the port last year .
despite acknowledgement that their harbor is among the most modern in the world , hamburg city officials are realistic about the challenges that face them .
last year , more than six million containers moved in and out of the hamburg port .
the harbor has room for 300 ships . " “ if we checked each of the six million containers that we handle in hamburg each year – opened the doors or sent them to be x-rayed , we ’ d have a traffic jam all the way to the alps , " said heiko beller , of hamburg 's department of the interior in a dw-radio interview . port officials will have to learn how to keep security standards high without hampering the normal flow of business . “ we need to undertake measures that don ’ t strangle the port economy and traffic , " beller said .
" of course we want to promote trade .
if the measures became too strong , they would probably restrict it .
but that ’ s a balancing act that has to be performed . ” dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. seeks to help secure european ports as america steps up measures to secure its ports , customs officials are now working with their counterparts in europe to scan container cargo for terrorist material before it reaches the u.s.

carnival in the rhineland culminates this week , but germany 's economic downturn has created problems for the region 's carnival associations .
with reduced government support and donations , many face an existential crisis . during the days of carnival , liquor flows freely as do the euros when millions are joining in the parades and street parties of germany 's largest public event .
countless bars and restaurants are full and of visitors flock to the rhineland for the six days of festivities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the star attraction is always the carnival associations , with their elaborately decorated floats and extravagant costumes .
they include everything from neighborhood groups to social groups , including gays and lesbians .
most dress as 18th century french soldiers -lrb- photo -rrb- - a mocking gesture to the region 's former occupier . for a long time now , carnival has been an important part of the economy in the cities and towns in the rhineland and along the main river .
but with a flagging economy in germany and diminished purchasing power , people are more reluctant to shell out money for costumes , beer and the expensive parties hosted by carnival associations .
that 's created a crisis for the groups . fewer sales , fewer subsidies " in cologne , where the biggest carnival celebrations are held , some groups are really having trouble this year , " said franz wolf , president of the german carnival association .
" at some of the events only 80 percent of the tickets were sold and empty tables could be found .
those are the first indications that something is wrong . " wolf does n't believe the economy has anything to do with it . " in my opinion , what the hospitality industry did after the change from the deutsch mark to the euro was impossible , " he said .
" in many cases , they just kept the deutsche mark price and put a euro sign in front of it making things twice as expensive .
nobody can pay the new prices . " in some places there are empty halls , empty bars , and even empty cash registers .
with lower tax revenues pouring in , many cities have also reduced the amount of subsidies they give to the different carnival associations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then german labor minister walter riester is pictured tortured as he appears during the 2001carnival parade in düsseldorf .
donations to the groups have also dropped and they 're having trouble making ends meet .
the average carnival association spends about € 400,000 -lrb- $ 506,000 -rrb- each year for everything from candy that 's tossed to crowds during parades to portable restrooms . an industry worth billions in order to plug the holes in their budgets , the associations have started doing what sporting event organizers have long been doing : they 're charging tv stations for the rights to broadcast their annual parties , which are often filled with celebrities and politicians . public broadcaster wdr in north-rhine-westphalia recently purchased the exclusive rights to broadcast massive rose monday parade in cologne .
other broadcasters are limited to covering the event in news reports . wdr is rumored to have paid in the seven figures for those rights .
but wdr is n't telling . tough times or not , carnival is an event that brings in big money that reaches virtually every business in the region . " it starts out when the women go to the hairdresser , " wolf said .
" they then attend a carnival event and they take a taxi or public transportation to get there .
they also buy costumes , drinks , meals . " it 's even been the subject of mckinsey study .

the federal office for radiation protection -lrb- bfs -rrb- has called for the shut-down of five german nuclear energy plants because they lack sufficient protection against terror attacks . of germany 's 18 nuclear power plants , the five plants are most vulnerable in case of a terror attack involving planes such as the sept .
11 attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon , bfs president wolfram könig said in an interview with berliner zeitung .
könig 's assessment is based on a report by the society for reactor safety -lrb- grs -rrb- , germany 's central expert institution on nuclear safety . the report however does not look at concrete , actual safety risks at particular plants , according to a statement by germany 's federal ministry for the environment , nature conservation and nuclear safety , which oversees the bfs .
the ministry 's statement added that german states had so far failed to review the safety of plants based on the report . the plants include biblis a in the german state of hesse , which is operated by rwe , philipsburg 1 and obrigheim in baden-württemberg , which belong to energy company enbw , isar 1 in bavaria that 's part of power giant eon and brunsbüttel in schlwesig-holstein , which is operated by vattenfall europe and eon .
spokespeople for the companies could not be reached on saturday or did not want to comment on könig 's statements . environmentalists welcomed könig 's call to shut down the plants , saying that such a step was long overdue .
" a plane crash could lead to a worst case scenario at any german nuclear power plant , " walter jungbauer , a nuclear energy expert with german environmental organization bund , told dpa news service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stade plant has already been switched off .
germany has already passed a law that will phase out nuclear energy by 2020 .
each of the country 's nuclear plants will be closed down after operating for 32 years .
the first closure already happened last november , when the stade plant -lrb- photo -rrb- was removed from the power grid .
obrigheim is next in line , with shut-off scheduled for may 2005 . extending lifetime of safer plants ? könig suggested that energy companies could be compensated for closing down allegedly unsafe plants by extending the operating time on other , more secure sites .
" that 's economically justifiable and legally possible , " könig told the paper . he also criticized germany 's nuclear energy suppliers for failing to do more to protect plants from terror attacks .
könig said he believed the companies had not done what 's necessary after the sept .
11 attacks .
he added that he did n't think proposals to enclose plants in a cloud of fog in case of an attack would alleviate the public 's safety concerns . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts nuclear energy phase-out germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .

if german ports want to continue doing business with america , they have until july 1 to install comprehensive and high-tech security systems designed to keep out terrorists . over the past two years , hamburg 's massive port has begun to turn itself into a modern-day fortress .
germany 's largest shipping port - the eighth busiest in the world - has installed security cameras , id and x-ray scanners as part of the international ship and port facility security code , agreed on by the united states in 2002 .

if german ports want to continue doing business with america , they have until july 1 to install comprehensive and high-tech security systems designed to keep out terrorists . over the past two years , hamburg 's massive port has begun to turn itself into a modern-day fortress .
germany 's largest shipping port - the eighth busiest in the world - has installed security cameras , id and x-ray scanners as part of the international ship and port facility security code , agreed on by the united states in 2002 .
the code lays out security plans international ports must implement if they want to continue doing trade with the united states .
only ports that have given u.s. customs agents access to their facilities are allowed to ship freight to u.s. ports . " it 's very important to do this now , " jens weber , who is responsible for bringing the port 's security procedures in line with america 's demands , told dw-radio .
" the terminals are sheltered against theft , but to shelter a terminal against acts of terrorism , there is much more to be done . " high-tech , random checks all container trucks passing through the gates of the hamburg port are now subject to a security check .
port employees scan the truck 's documents and freight papers and cross check the information in a computer system and with the shipping company .
should there be any reason for suspicion , customs officers will check the container using new x-ray scanners . if everything checks out the driver is given a plastic id card that must then be presented at other check points until the container has been transferred the harbor ’ s satellite-controlled and fully automated loading system . customs officials are also on hand to examine container numbers and documentation .
inspectors look to see if there ’ s any damage to the steel container and they check the high security seal on the door . " they make random checks .
first they check the papers and if there ’ s any suggestion there ’ s anything wrong , they make an x-ray check and if they find something on the screen , they strip the container , ” said weber . major task ahead of them the companies that use the harbor bear the large brunt of the cost .
in order to get a security certificate from officials , companies have to invest at least € 30,000 -lrb- $ 37,580 -rrb- .
for large firms , the costs climb into the millions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 6 million containers went in and out of the port last year .
despite acknowledgement that their harbor is among the most modern in the world , hamburg city officials are realistic about the challenges that face them .
last year , more than six million containers moved in and out of the hamburg port .
the harbor has room for 300 ships . " “ if we checked each of the six million containers that we handle in hamburg each year – opened the doors or sent them to be x-rayed , we ’ d have a traffic jam all the way to the alps , " said heiko beller , of hamburg 's department of the interior in a dw-radio interview . port officials will have to learn how to keep security standards high without hampering the normal flow of business . “ we need to undertake measures that don ’ t strangle the port economy and traffic , " beller said .
" of course we want to promote trade .
if the measures became too strong , they would probably restrict it .

carnival in the rhineland culminates this week , but germany 's economic downturn has created problems for the region 's carnival associations .
with reduced government support and donations , many face an existential crisis . during the days of carnival , liquor flows freely as do the euros when millions are joining in the parades and street parties of germany 's largest public event .

that 's created a crisis for the groups . fewer sales , fewer subsidies " in cologne , where the biggest carnival celebrations are held , some groups are really having trouble this year , " said franz wolf , president of the german carnival association .

that 's created a crisis for the groups . fewer sales , fewer subsidies " in cologne , where the biggest carnival celebrations are held , some groups are really having trouble this year , " said franz wolf , president of the german carnival association .
" at some of the events only 80 percent of the tickets were sold and empty tables could be found .
those are the first indications that something is wrong . " wolf does n't believe the economy has anything to do with it . " in my opinion , what the hospitality industry did after the change from the deutsch mark to the euro was impossible , " he said .
" in many cases , they just kept the deutsche mark price and put a euro sign in front of it making things twice as expensive .
nobody can pay the new prices . " in some places there are empty halls , empty bars , and even empty cash registers .
with lower tax revenues pouring in , many cities have also reduced the amount of subsidies they give to the different carnival associations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then german labor minister walter riester is pictured tortured as he appears during the 2001carnival parade in düsseldorf .
donations to the groups have also dropped and they 're having trouble making ends meet .
the average carnival association spends about € 400,000 -lrb- $ 506,000 -rrb- each year for everything from candy that 's tossed to crowds during parades to portable restrooms . an industry worth billions in order to plug the holes in their budgets , the associations have started doing what sporting event organizers have long been doing : they 're charging tv stations for the rights to broadcast their annual parties , which are often filled with celebrities and politicians . public broadcaster wdr in north-rhine-westphalia recently purchased the exclusive rights to broadcast massive rose monday parade in cologne .
other broadcasters are limited to covering the event in news reports . wdr is rumored to have paid in the seven figures for those rights .
but wdr is n't telling . tough times or not , carnival is an event that brings in big money that reaches virtually every business in the region . " it starts out when the women go to the hairdresser , " wolf said .
" they then attend a carnival event and they take a taxi or public transportation to get there .
they also buy costumes , drinks , meals . " it 's even been the subject of mckinsey study .
the consulting company found that germany 's carnival is a € 4 billion industry . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cashing in at karneval as cologne gears up for its annual party ritual when millions of visitors descend upon the city for the karneval , local businesses are rubbing their hands in glee at the thought of big profits .

the federal office for radiation protection -lrb- bfs -rrb- has called for the shut-down of five german nuclear energy plants because they lack sufficient protection against terror attacks . of germany 's 18 nuclear power plants , the five plants are most vulnerable in case of a terror attack involving planes such as the sept .
11 attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon , bfs president wolfram könig said in an interview with berliner zeitung .
könig 's assessment is based on a report by the society for reactor safety -lrb- grs -rrb- , germany 's central expert institution on nuclear safety . the report however does not look at concrete , actual safety risks at particular plants , according to a statement by germany 's federal ministry for the environment , nature conservation and nuclear safety , which oversees the bfs .
the ministry 's statement added that german states had so far failed to review the safety of plants based on the report . the plants include biblis a in the german state of hesse , which is operated by rwe , philipsburg 1 and obrigheim in baden-württemberg , which belong to energy company enbw , isar 1 in bavaria that 's part of power giant eon and brunsbüttel in schlwesig-holstein , which is operated by vattenfall europe and eon .
spokespeople for the companies could not be reached on saturday or did not want to comment on könig 's statements . environmentalists welcomed könig 's call to shut down the plants , saying that such a step was long overdue .
" a plane crash could lead to a worst case scenario at any german nuclear power plant , " walter jungbauer , a nuclear energy expert with german environmental organization bund , told dpa news service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stade plant has already been switched off .
germany has already passed a law that will phase out nuclear energy by 2020 .
each of the country 's nuclear plants will be closed down after operating for 32 years .
the first closure already happened last november , when the stade plant -lrb- photo -rrb- was removed from the power grid .
obrigheim is next in line , with shut-off scheduled for may 2005 . extending lifetime of safer plants ? könig suggested that energy companies could be compensated for closing down allegedly unsafe plants by extending the operating time on other , more secure sites .
" that 's economically justifiable and legally possible , " könig told the paper . he also criticized germany 's nuclear energy suppliers for failing to do more to protect plants from terror attacks .
könig said he believed the companies had not done what 's necessary after the sept .

the moma exhibition opened in berlin on friday .
dw-tv talked to peter-klaus schuster , director general of the city of berlin 's state museums , about his work as well as the event . thanks very much for joining us today , mr schuster .
now if my math is up to much then you are in charge of no fewer than sixteen separate museums and galleries .
it ’ s an impressive total , among them are some of the most prestigious in the world .
it 's no surprise therefore , i 've got a quote , that you have been described by one source at least as being " the most powerful museum administrator in the world " .
is that how it feels to you ?
not really , we feel much more modest .
but you 're right , there are sixteen museums in one museum institution , this makes the state museum of berlin so unique .
if you compare it to london that would mean the british museum , the tate museum the national gallery all in one museum .
it 's a big job you 've got , and it 's a big year you 've got coming up in 2004 .
foremost amongst the attractions we can look forward to is the moma , the legendary museum of modern art based in new york is coming to berlin to put on display 200 masterpieces of modern european art .
it 's a very exciting prospect , how did it come about ?
the idea was to give the museum of modern art seven months somewhere and where should it be ?
and they said , let 's make tokyo , madrid and all this and then they considered it from the point of history and said let 's go back to berlin to a place where somehow our roots are .
the very beginning of the moma as an ideal concept was in berlin with the national gallery and with the bauhaus in germany .
so coming back and also coming back to mies van der rohe .
in this building , mies van der rohe is somehow the architect of the moma .
so the modernist project comes back to berlin .
that 's it and for seven and more months , this is much more than an exhibition .
it 's a manifestation of modernism .
the point is the moma is coming back to the beginning and berlin is coming back to modernism .
you see modernism or modern art in berlin , in germany too , is also a disaster with all that we had with the degenerated art and all that .
art described as degenerative by the nazis .
yes , and now we have the collection of modernism in this building , a temple of modernity . it 's a great prospect , but there 's more to it than meets the eye , perhaps because there 's also a political aspect to it all as well .
the co-patrons of the exhibition are joschka fischer , the german foreign minister , and colin powell , his american counter-part .
there 's been a lot of turbulence on the diplomatic level between germany and america in recent times let 's say .
is there an element of cultural fence mending going on here ?
it 's a manifestation of real understanding a deep friendship in the cultural field .
there 's not so much trouble and confusion as in the political field .
berlin is always looking with love to new york .
berlin always likes to be compared with new york , berlin likes to be the other new york .
and there 's more coming up in 2004 than just to moma exhibition , what else is bubbling ?
we will open the helmut newton museum , the helmut newton foundation .
it 's an artist coming from berlin and becoming international in paris , london , new york .
and so you see this cosmopolitan - this side of berlin , to re-establish this and this is in the middle of the year .
towards the end of the year we have the collection of frederic christian flick , the “ mick flick collection ” of very contemporary art in our museum of contemporary art , the hamburger bahnhof , and so you have the beginning of the classical modern with the moma and then you have how modernism ends with the very contemporary .
and so you could say that berlin is somehow a little bit of the cultural capital in 2004 - luckily . berlin the cultural capital of europe perhaps , berlin the cultural capital of germany maybe .
let me put another quote to you .
berlin , you have said yourself , is a showcase for the nation , for the german nation .
what does that mean ?
the awareness of germany is very difficult with the different länders . the federal states ?
yes , and this very important capital areas like munich , hamburg , stuttgart and all these .
and then almost you have the question where is germany ?
as what is really relevant or who can demonstrate a figure from germany .
and at the very end there is now berlin - the new capital of this united germany and this tremendously large museum complex .
and so you get an awareness of germany and it 's somehow that the international audience is expecting .
the international audience maybe , but there are many in germany in many of the other german cities hamburg , munich , frankfurt perhaps they 're not happy about berlin being the featured german city , not necessarily so .
well the point is that ten-fifteen years ago we always said berlin was the showcase of the free western society .
west berlin ?
yeah , and everybody was glad about this and now i think we have this free society and we should make the best of it and we should develop a good feeling .
and for all these other cities we are now somehow at the stage , for bavaria and saxony for example , in berlin , to be seen by an international audience .
see after the flood in dresden we made the large exhibitions and then it went to london to the royal academy .
so i think this works in a mutual friendship .
berlin is so big , berlin is so rich with the collections that there are so many other places for the others to be here and to be shown here .
so i think there is good competition but at the very end its the focus .
we 've talked about berlin as a national arts capital for germany perhaps , now what about berlin and international art ?
the point is we are a universal museum and our companion museum , is somehow the british museum and it 's more than le louvre and we would like really to establish a non-european collections also in the center of berlin , in what we call the " mitte of the mitte . "
the " middle of the middle . "
that 's it - and there 's a complete deserted area where the castle was in the centre .
the former hohenzollern palace in the center of berlin .
that 's it the berlin castle and we would like to establish a non-european museum there , so we have the european and the non-european - a touch of le louvre and a bit of the british museum all concentrated in this city and i think this will give a new aspect , dimension to berlin and the cultural role of this capital . one aspect of the berlin landscape that we have n't mentioned so far is the museum island .
it 's a world cultural heritage site since 1994 , unesco nominated it as such .
it 's a very impressive ensemble .
could you describe museum island and your vision for it .
the museum island is an island in the center of the town with five museum buildings or better put five museum temples built from 1830 to 1930 - and it 's unique to have five so completely different museums for european art history , from the very beginning till 1900 .
and as it 's in one spot , it 's like an acropolis of the arts - and it 's only for the arts , only for the visitors and to re-do this , one building is a complete ruin , the others have to be re-done and all this will be finished in ten years .
and now we 're on the way and we 're re-doing one building after the other and it 's a real surprise , you have historical monumental buildings that no-one would build now .
it 's a real luxury in museum crowd and to have this rich collection together with - it 's really unique , you should see it . interview conducted by peter craven send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moma in berlin back to deutsche welle 's complete coverage 9799 the dw-tv asia + quiz want to see if you have won ?

we will open the helmut newton museum , the helmut newton foundation .
it 's an artist coming from berlin and becoming international in paris , london , new york .
and so you see this cosmopolitan - this side of berlin , to re-establish this and this is in the middle of the year .
towards the end of the year we have the collection of frederic christian flick , the “ mick flick collection ” of very contemporary art in our museum of contemporary art , the hamburger bahnhof , and so you have the beginning of the classical modern with the moma and then you have how modernism ends with the very contemporary .
and so you could say that berlin is somehow a little bit of the cultural capital in 2004 - luckily . berlin the cultural capital of europe perhaps , berlin the cultural capital of germany maybe .
let me put another quote to you .
berlin , you have said yourself , is a showcase for the nation , for the german nation .
what does that mean ?
the awareness of germany is very difficult with the different länders . the federal states ?
yes , and this very important capital areas like munich , hamburg , stuttgart and all these .
and then almost you have the question where is germany ?
as what is really relevant or who can demonstrate a figure from germany .
and at the very end there is now berlin - the new capital of this united germany and this tremendously large museum complex .
and so you get an awareness of germany and it 's somehow that the international audience is expecting .
the international audience maybe , but there are many in germany in many of the other german cities hamburg , munich , frankfurt perhaps they 're not happy about berlin being the featured german city , not necessarily so .
well the point is that ten-fifteen years ago we always said berlin was the showcase of the free western society .
west berlin ?
yeah , and everybody was glad about this and now i think we have this free society and we should make the best of it and we should develop a good feeling .
and for all these other cities we are now somehow at the stage , for bavaria and saxony for example , in berlin , to be seen by an international audience .
see after the flood in dresden we made the large exhibitions and then it went to london to the royal academy .
so i think this works in a mutual friendship .
berlin is so big , berlin is so rich with the collections that there are so many other places for the others to be here and to be shown here .
so i think there is good competition but at the very end its the focus .
we 've talked about berlin as a national arts capital for germany perhaps , now what about berlin and international art ?
the point is we are a universal museum and our companion museum , is somehow the british museum and it 's more than le louvre and we would like really to establish a non-european collections also in the center of berlin , in what we call the " mitte of the mitte . "
the " middle of the middle . "
that 's it - and there 's a complete deserted area where the castle was in the centre .
the former hohenzollern palace in the center of berlin .
that 's it the berlin castle and we would like to establish a non-european museum there , so we have the european and the non-european - a touch of le louvre and a bit of the british museum all concentrated in this city and i think this will give a new aspect , dimension to berlin and the cultural role of this capital . one aspect of the berlin landscape that we have n't mentioned so far is the museum island .
it 's a world cultural heritage site since 1994 , unesco nominated it as such .
it 's a very impressive ensemble .
could you describe museum island and your vision for it .
the museum island is an island in the center of the town with five museum buildings or better put five museum temples built from 1830 to 1930 - and it 's unique to have five so completely different museums for european art history , from the very beginning till 1900 .
and as it 's in one spot , it 's like an acropolis of the arts - and it 's only for the arts , only for the visitors and to re-do this , one building is a complete ruin , the others have to be re-done and all this will be finished in ten years .
and now we 're on the way and we 're re-doing one building after the other and it 's a real surprise , you have historical monumental buildings that no-one would build now .
it 's a real luxury in museum crowd and to have this rich collection together with - it 's really unique , you should see it . interview conducted by peter craven send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moma in berlin back to deutsche welle 's complete coverage 9799 the dw-tv asia + quiz want to see if you have won ?

as the world celebrates international mother language day on saturday , germany 's language purists bemoan the relentless onslaught of denglish .
but a german watchdog has hinted that a turnabout might be in sight . when burger giant mcdonald 's recently dropped its famous english slogan " everytime a good time " for its tv advertisement in germany and replaced it with a very german " ich liebe es " -lrb- i 'm lovin ' it -rrb- , an audible whoop of joy was heard in the language purist camp in the country .
after years of all-out war against the rise of denglish -lrb- a mixture of german and english -rrb- , the institute for german language -lrb- vds -rrb- - self-appointed guardian of the sanctity of german language - is celebrating .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going german at mcdonald 's " we have detected a trend reversal , " walter krämer , chairman of the vds told dpa news agency .
" the fast-food chain mcdonald 's is once again advertising in german for its products , even other companies and concerns have rediscovered german for their slogans , " he said .
understand english ?
but rather than a sense of loyalty and pride towards its own native language - a sentiment more in keeping with international mother language day - it 's pragmatic concerns that have fuelled the german advertising industry 's recourse to german .
tobias mindner , vds press spokesman pointed out that advertising gurus in germany had found in a study that most of its target audience did n't understand slick english one-liners .
indeed the recent representative study concluded that 59 percent of those surveyed could n't correctly translate mcdonald 's every time a good time into german .
the same went for mitsubishi 's slogan drive alive .
just 18 percent understood it as " lively driving " in german , the rest interpreted it as " survive the drive in our car " - a potentially damaging promo for the carmaker .
the participants were all aged between 14 and 59 - a target group that 's considered the biggest spender and thus the most promising for the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw calls on customers to " dress your car , " but what 's that supposed to mean , exactly ?
" a much smaller percentage of people in germany speak english than is generally assumed , " mindner told dw-world .
" just about ten percent speak and really understand it well .
so you ca n't really just use snazzy english phrases and enthuse people for products , when they do n't really get the message , " he added .
spectacular moves to clean up german the vds has been up in arms against the encroachment of english words in the german language for the past six years and is known for its often eccentric ways to achieve its aim .
last year the watchdog symbolically auctioned the german language on ebay .
within two days , the highest bid lay above ten million euro , following which the internet auction site stopped the trade .
the organization also attempted to sue the supervisory board of deutsche telekom for its " nonsensical use " of english words like city call , holiday plus tarif and german call .
the institute also awards a prize for the sprachpanscher -lrb- language debaser -rrb- of the year .
" no to denglish " the onslaught of so-called denglish is apparent not just in germany 's advertising and business world , but increasingly in almost all walks of life and it is n't just irking language experts .
a group of senior citizens in the bavarian city of nuremberg recently started a " no to denglish " signature campaign .
magda schleip , a member , told daily süddeutsche zeitung , " older people only understand fragments of what politicians , advertising gurus and media tell them everyday . "
schleip added that the problem was even more acute for the unemployed .
" the federal labor agency only talks about job centers , cluster building , clearing offices , " she said .
" which unemployed person understands that ? "
awareness the key ?
though politicians - who are prey to denglish themselves -lrb- task force , road show , pre-events -rrb- - are clear it 's impossible to enforce laws to cleanse german , it 's generally agreed that awareness is the best way to counter the malaise .
thus the bavarian education ministry has announced that it has urged schools to " take special responsibility for the german language " on feb .

if german ports want to continue doing business with america , they have until july 1 to install comprehensive and high-tech security systems designed to keep out terrorists . over the past two years , hamburg 's massive port has begun to turn itself into a modern-day fortress .
germany 's largest shipping port - the eighth busiest in the world - has installed security cameras , id and x-ray scanners as part of the international ship and port facility security code , agreed on by the united states in 2002 .
the code lays out security plans international ports must implement if they want to continue doing trade with the united states .
only ports that have given u.s. customs agents access to their facilities are allowed to ship freight to u.s. ports . " it 's very important to do this now , " jens weber , who is responsible for bringing the port 's security procedures in line with america 's demands , told dw-radio .
" the terminals are sheltered against theft , but to shelter a terminal against acts of terrorism , there is much more to be done . " high-tech , random checks all container trucks passing through the gates of the hamburg port are now subject to a security check .
port employees scan the truck 's documents and freight papers and cross check the information in a computer system and with the shipping company .
should there be any reason for suspicion , customs officers will check the container using new x-ray scanners . if everything checks out the driver is given a plastic id card that must then be presented at other check points until the container has been transferred the harbor ’ s satellite-controlled and fully automated loading system . customs officials are also on hand to examine container numbers and documentation .
inspectors look to see if there ’ s any damage to the steel container and they check the high security seal on the door . " they make random checks .
first they check the papers and if there ’ s any suggestion there ’ s anything wrong , they make an x-ray check and if they find something on the screen , they strip the container , ” said weber . major task ahead of them the companies that use the harbor bear the large brunt of the cost .
in order to get a security certificate from officials , companies have to invest at least € 30,000 -lrb- $ 37,580 -rrb- .
for large firms , the costs climb into the millions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 6 million containers went in and out of the port last year .
despite acknowledgement that their harbor is among the most modern in the world , hamburg city officials are realistic about the challenges that face them .
last year , more than six million containers moved in and out of the hamburg port .
the harbor has room for 300 ships . " “ if we checked each of the six million containers that we handle in hamburg each year – opened the doors or sent them to be x-rayed , we ’ d have a traffic jam all the way to the alps , " said heiko beller , of hamburg 's department of the interior in a dw-radio interview . port officials will have to learn how to keep security standards high without hampering the normal flow of business . “ we need to undertake measures that don ’ t strangle the port economy and traffic , " beller said .
" of course we want to promote trade .
if the measures became too strong , they would probably restrict it .
but that ’ s a balancing act that has to be performed . ” dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. seeks to help secure european ports as america steps up measures to secure its ports , customs officials are now working with their counterparts in europe to scan container cargo for terrorist material before it reaches the u.s.

the moma exhibition opened in berlin on friday .
dw-tv talked to peter-klaus schuster , director general of the city of berlin 's state museums , about his work as well as the event . thanks very much for joining us today , mr schuster .
now if my math is up to much then you are in charge of no fewer than sixteen separate museums and galleries .
it ’ s an impressive total , among them are some of the most prestigious in the world .
it 's no surprise therefore , i 've got a quote , that you have been described by one source at least as being " the most powerful museum administrator in the world " .
is that how it feels to you ?
not really , we feel much more modest .
but you 're right , there are sixteen museums in one museum institution , this makes the state museum of berlin so unique .
if you compare it to london that would mean the british museum , the tate museum the national gallery all in one museum .
it 's a big job you 've got , and it 's a big year you 've got coming up in 2004 .
foremost amongst the attractions we can look forward to is the moma , the legendary museum of modern art based in new york is coming to berlin to put on display 200 masterpieces of modern european art .
it 's a very exciting prospect , how did it come about ?
the idea was to give the museum of modern art seven months somewhere and where should it be ?
and they said , let 's make tokyo , madrid and all this and then they considered it from the point of history and said let 's go back to berlin to a place where somehow our roots are .
the very beginning of the moma as an ideal concept was in berlin with the national gallery and with the bauhaus in germany .
so coming back and also coming back to mies van der rohe .
in this building , mies van der rohe is somehow the architect of the moma .
so the modernist project comes back to berlin .
that 's it and for seven and more months , this is much more than an exhibition .
it 's a manifestation of modernism .
the point is the moma is coming back to the beginning and berlin is coming back to modernism .
you see modernism or modern art in berlin , in germany too , is also a disaster with all that we had with the degenerated art and all that .
art described as degenerative by the nazis .
yes , and now we have the collection of modernism in this building , a temple of modernity . it 's a great prospect , but there 's more to it than meets the eye , perhaps because there 's also a political aspect to it all as well .
the co-patrons of the exhibition are joschka fischer , the german foreign minister , and colin powell , his american counter-part .
there 's been a lot of turbulence on the diplomatic level between germany and america in recent times let 's say .
is there an element of cultural fence mending going on here ?
it 's a manifestation of real understanding a deep friendship in the cultural field .
there 's not so much trouble and confusion as in the political field .
berlin is always looking with love to new york .
berlin always likes to be compared with new york , berlin likes to be the other new york .
and there 's more coming up in 2004 than just to moma exhibition , what else is bubbling ?
we will open the helmut newton museum , the helmut newton foundation .
it 's an artist coming from berlin and becoming international in paris , london , new york .
and so you see this cosmopolitan - this side of berlin , to re-establish this and this is in the middle of the year .
towards the end of the year we have the collection of frederic christian flick , the “ mick flick collection ” of very contemporary art in our museum of contemporary art , the hamburger bahnhof , and so you have the beginning of the classical modern with the moma and then you have how modernism ends with the very contemporary .
and so you could say that berlin is somehow a little bit of the cultural capital in 2004 - luckily . berlin the cultural capital of europe perhaps , berlin the cultural capital of germany maybe .
let me put another quote to you .
berlin , you have said yourself , is a showcase for the nation , for the german nation .
what does that mean ?
the awareness of germany is very difficult with the different länders . the federal states ?
yes , and this very important capital areas like munich , hamburg , stuttgart and all these .
and then almost you have the question where is germany ?
as what is really relevant or who can demonstrate a figure from germany .
and at the very end there is now berlin - the new capital of this united germany and this tremendously large museum complex .
and so you get an awareness of germany and it 's somehow that the international audience is expecting .
the international audience maybe , but there are many in germany in many of the other german cities hamburg , munich , frankfurt perhaps they 're not happy about berlin being the featured german city , not necessarily so .
well the point is that ten-fifteen years ago we always said berlin was the showcase of the free western society .
west berlin ?
yeah , and everybody was glad about this and now i think we have this free society and we should make the best of it and we should develop a good feeling .
and for all these other cities we are now somehow at the stage , for bavaria and saxony for example , in berlin , to be seen by an international audience .

so i think this works in a mutual friendship .
berlin is so big , berlin is so rich with the collections that there are so many other places for the others to be here and to be shown here .
so i think there is good competition but at the very end its the focus .
we 've talked about berlin as a national arts capital for germany perhaps , now what about berlin and international art ?
the point is we are a universal museum and our companion museum , is somehow the british museum and it 's more than le louvre and we would like really to establish a non-european collections also in the center of berlin , in what we call the " mitte of the mitte . "

the museum island is an island in the center of the town with five museum buildings or better put five museum temples built from 1830 to 1930 - and it 's unique to have five so completely different museums for european art history , from the very beginning till 1900 .

and now we 're on the way and we 're re-doing one building after the other and it 's a real surprise , you have historical monumental buildings that no-one would build now .

the moma exhibition opened in berlin on friday .
dw-tv talked to peter-klaus schuster , director general of the city of berlin 's state museums , about his work as well as the event . thanks very much for joining us today , mr schuster .
now if my math is up to much then you are in charge of no fewer than sixteen separate museums and galleries .
it ’ s an impressive total , among them are some of the most prestigious in the world .
it 's no surprise therefore , i 've got a quote , that you have been described by one source at least as being " the most powerful museum administrator in the world " .
is that how it feels to you ?
not really , we feel much more modest .
but you 're right , there are sixteen museums in one museum institution , this makes the state museum of berlin so unique .
if you compare it to london that would mean the british museum , the tate museum the national gallery all in one museum .
it 's a big job you 've got , and it 's a big year you 've got coming up in 2004 .
foremost amongst the attractions we can look forward to is the moma , the legendary museum of modern art based in new york is coming to berlin to put on display 200 masterpieces of modern european art .
it 's a very exciting prospect , how did it come about ?
the idea was to give the museum of modern art seven months somewhere and where should it be ?
and they said , let 's make tokyo , madrid and all this and then they considered it from the point of history and said let 's go back to berlin to a place where somehow our roots are .
the very beginning of the moma as an ideal concept was in berlin with the national gallery and with the bauhaus in germany .
so coming back and also coming back to mies van der rohe .
in this building , mies van der rohe is somehow the architect of the moma .
so the modernist project comes back to berlin .
that 's it and for seven and more months , this is much more than an exhibition .
it 's a manifestation of modernism .
the point is the moma is coming back to the beginning and berlin is coming back to modernism .
you see modernism or modern art in berlin , in germany too , is also a disaster with all that we had with the degenerated art and all that .
art described as degenerative by the nazis .
yes , and now we have the collection of modernism in this building , a temple of modernity . it 's a great prospect , but there 's more to it than meets the eye , perhaps because there 's also a political aspect to it all as well .
the co-patrons of the exhibition are joschka fischer , the german foreign minister , and colin powell , his american counter-part .
there 's been a lot of turbulence on the diplomatic level between germany and america in recent times let 's say .
is there an element of cultural fence mending going on here ?
it 's a manifestation of real understanding a deep friendship in the cultural field .
there 's not so much trouble and confusion as in the political field .
berlin is always looking with love to new york .
berlin always likes to be compared with new york , berlin likes to be the other new york .
and there 's more coming up in 2004 than just to moma exhibition , what else is bubbling ?
we will open the helmut newton museum , the helmut newton foundation .
it 's an artist coming from berlin and becoming international in paris , london , new york .
and so you see this cosmopolitan - this side of berlin , to re-establish this and this is in the middle of the year .
towards the end of the year we have the collection of frederic christian flick , the “ mick flick collection ” of very contemporary art in our museum of contemporary art , the hamburger bahnhof , and so you have the beginning of the classical modern with the moma and then you have how modernism ends with the very contemporary .
and so you could say that berlin is somehow a little bit of the cultural capital in 2004 - luckily . berlin the cultural capital of europe perhaps , berlin the cultural capital of germany maybe .
let me put another quote to you .
berlin , you have said yourself , is a showcase for the nation , for the german nation .
what does that mean ?
the awareness of germany is very difficult with the different länders . the federal states ?
yes , and this very important capital areas like munich , hamburg , stuttgart and all these .
and then almost you have the question where is germany ?
as what is really relevant or who can demonstrate a figure from germany .
and at the very end there is now berlin - the new capital of this united germany and this tremendously large museum complex .
and so you get an awareness of germany and it 's somehow that the international audience is expecting .
the international audience maybe , but there are many in germany in many of the other german cities hamburg , munich , frankfurt perhaps they 're not happy about berlin being the featured german city , not necessarily so .
well the point is that ten-fifteen years ago we always said berlin was the showcase of the free western society .
west berlin ?
yeah , and everybody was glad about this and now i think we have this free society and we should make the best of it and we should develop a good feeling .
and for all these other cities we are now somehow at the stage , for bavaria and saxony for example , in berlin , to be seen by an international audience .
see after the flood in dresden we made the large exhibitions and then it went to london to the royal academy .

opinion : desperately ditching denglish europe battles english invasion should german be cleansed of " denglish " ? culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.02.2004 deutsch please , we 're german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe bilingual is the way to go ?
as the world celebrates international mother language day on saturday , germany 's language purists bemoan the relentless onslaught of denglish .
but a german watchdog has hinted that a turnabout might be in sight . when burger giant mcdonald 's recently dropped its famous english slogan " everytime a good time " for its tv advertisement in germany and replaced it with a very german " ich liebe es " -lrb- i 'm lovin ' it -rrb- , an audible whoop of joy was heard in the language purist camp in the country .
after years of all-out war against the rise of denglish -lrb- a mixture of german and english -rrb- , the institute for german language -lrb- vds -rrb- - self-appointed guardian of the sanctity of german language - is celebrating .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going german at mcdonald 's " we have detected a trend reversal , " walter krämer , chairman of the vds told dpa news agency .
" the fast-food chain mcdonald 's is once again advertising in german for its products , even other companies and concerns have rediscovered german for their slogans , " he said .
understand english ?
but rather than a sense of loyalty and pride towards its own native language - a sentiment more in keeping with international mother language day - it 's pragmatic concerns that have fuelled the german advertising industry 's recourse to german .
tobias mindner , vds press spokesman pointed out that advertising gurus in germany had found in a study that most of its target audience did n't understand slick english one-liners .
indeed the recent representative study concluded that 59 percent of those surveyed could n't correctly translate mcdonald 's every time a good time into german .
the same went for mitsubishi 's slogan drive alive .
just 18 percent understood it as " lively driving " in german , the rest interpreted it as " survive the drive in our car " - a potentially damaging promo for the carmaker .
the participants were all aged between 14 and 59 - a target group that 's considered the biggest spender and thus the most promising for the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw calls on customers to " dress your car , " but what 's that supposed to mean , exactly ?
" a much smaller percentage of people in germany speak english than is generally assumed , " mindner told dw-world .
" just about ten percent speak and really understand it well .
so you ca n't really just use snazzy english phrases and enthuse people for products , when they do n't really get the message , " he added .
spectacular moves to clean up german the vds has been up in arms against the encroachment of english words in the german language for the past six years and is known for its often eccentric ways to achieve its aim .
last year the watchdog symbolically auctioned the german language on ebay .
within two days , the highest bid lay above ten million euro , following which the internet auction site stopped the trade .
the organization also attempted to sue the supervisory board of deutsche telekom for its " nonsensical use " of english words like city call , holiday plus tarif and german call .
the institute also awards a prize for the sprachpanscher -lrb- language debaser -rrb- of the year .
" no to denglish " the onslaught of so-called denglish is apparent not just in germany 's advertising and business world , but increasingly in almost all walks of life and it is n't just irking language experts .
a group of senior citizens in the bavarian city of nuremberg recently started a " no to denglish " signature campaign .
magda schleip , a member , told daily süddeutsche zeitung , " older people only understand fragments of what politicians , advertising gurus and media tell them everyday . "
schleip added that the problem was even more acute for the unemployed .
" the federal labor agency only talks about job centers , cluster building , clearing offices , " she said .
" which unemployed person understands that ? "
awareness the key ?
though politicians - who are prey to denglish themselves -lrb- task force , road show , pre-events -rrb- - are clear it 's impossible to enforce laws to cleanse german , it 's generally agreed that awareness is the best way to counter the malaise .
thus the bavarian education ministry has announced that it has urged schools to " take special responsibility for the german language " on feb .

carnival in the rhineland culminates this week , but germany 's economic downturn has created problems for the region 's carnival associations .
with reduced government support and donations , many face an existential crisis . during the days of carnival , liquor flows freely as do the euros when millions are joining in the parades and street parties of germany 's largest public event .
countless bars and restaurants are full and of visitors flock to the rhineland for the six days of festivities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the star attraction is always the carnival associations , with their elaborately decorated floats and extravagant costumes .
they include everything from neighborhood groups to social groups , including gays and lesbians .
most dress as 18th century french soldiers -lrb- photo -rrb- - a mocking gesture to the region 's former occupier . for a long time now , carnival has been an important part of the economy in the cities and towns in the rhineland and along the main river .
but with a flagging economy in germany and diminished purchasing power , people are more reluctant to shell out money for costumes , beer and the expensive parties hosted by carnival associations .
that 's created a crisis for the groups . fewer sales , fewer subsidies " in cologne , where the biggest carnival celebrations are held , some groups are really having trouble this year , " said franz wolf , president of the german carnival association .
" at some of the events only 80 percent of the tickets were sold and empty tables could be found .
those are the first indications that something is wrong . " wolf does n't believe the economy has anything to do with it . " in my opinion , what the hospitality industry did after the change from the deutsch mark to the euro was impossible , " he said .

carnival in the rhineland culminates this week , but germany 's economic downturn has created problems for the region 's carnival associations .
with reduced government support and donations , many face an existential crisis . during the days of carnival , liquor flows freely as do the euros when millions are joining in the parades and street parties of germany 's largest public event .
countless bars and restaurants are full and of visitors flock to the rhineland for the six days of festivities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the star attraction is always the carnival associations , with their elaborately decorated floats and extravagant costumes .
they include everything from neighborhood groups to social groups , including gays and lesbians .
most dress as 18th century french soldiers -lrb- photo -rrb- - a mocking gesture to the region 's former occupier . for a long time now , carnival has been an important part of the economy in the cities and towns in the rhineland and along the main river .
but with a flagging economy in germany and diminished purchasing power , people are more reluctant to shell out money for costumes , beer and the expensive parties hosted by carnival associations .
that 's created a crisis for the groups . fewer sales , fewer subsidies " in cologne , where the biggest carnival celebrations are held , some groups are really having trouble this year , " said franz wolf , president of the german carnival association .
" at some of the events only 80 percent of the tickets were sold and empty tables could be found .
those are the first indications that something is wrong . " wolf does n't believe the economy has anything to do with it . " in my opinion , what the hospitality industry did after the change from the deutsch mark to the euro was impossible , " he said .
" in many cases , they just kept the deutsche mark price and put a euro sign in front of it making things twice as expensive .
nobody can pay the new prices . " in some places there are empty halls , empty bars , and even empty cash registers .
with lower tax revenues pouring in , many cities have also reduced the amount of subsidies they give to the different carnival associations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then german labor minister walter riester is pictured tortured as he appears during the 2001carnival parade in düsseldorf .

charles , who played as a striker or centre-half , also starred for italian giants juventus and was never booked or sent off in his career .
charles : the gentle giant " john was without question the greatest footballer produced from wales , " said football association of wales general secretary david collins .

the notting hill of the film with its blue doors and bookshops is far removed from the area londoners step into from the notting hill gate tube stop .
a busy urban centre , the road is lined with take-aways , banks , sushi bars , art shops , music and retro clothing stores , the odd high-rise block and charity shops .
six lanes of traffic thunder through notting hill gate , leaving exhaust fumes in their wake .
like some of its inner london neighbours , the borough of kensington and chelsea is not likely to meet the government 's targets for urban air pollutants .
but breathing new life into an area sliced in two by one of the busiest routes into london , yet surrounded by conservation areas , is a tall order .
enter the notting hill gate improvement group -lrb- nhig -rrb- , which is using public art to brighten up this corner of west london .
art in notting hill gate " it 's very difficult to bring ambience and environmental character to what is basically an urban motorway , " said nhig founder john scott .
" we looked at it and thought : ' what can we do here to this awful mess ? " '
starting with the public lavatories on westbourne grove , now with a built-in florist , the group already has several major projects under its belt .
a mosaic by school children has given a former " muggers ' alley " off kensington church street a new lease of life and a moving wind sculpture , the climber , clings to the top of david game house on notting hill gate .
just down the road , the spinning eyes of a 10ft stainless steel carnival elephant by artist nadim karam have been keeping watch and attracting admiring glances outside waterstones since august 2003 .
now the group is trying to get its most eye-catching project yet off the ground - two glowing " eco halos " suspended over notting hill gate .
low-energy red , blue and green leds would be encased in two polycarbonate rings sculpted by artist dante leonelli and would change in response to their environment .
i think art can revive an area , it can lift people 's spirits and give it a sense of place john scott , nhig hooked up to monitoring equipment already in place , they would reflect air pollution levels - changing through the spectrum from white to red and raise awareness .
" they will define the centre of notting hill gate , which is in between the two halos , " said mr scott .
air quality analyst ben barratt , from king 's college , said inner london suffered from between 40 and 50 days of " moderate " air pollution in summer - about six in winter - but never reached the " very high " rating .
" it looks like traffic emissions are going down , traffic levels in london are stabilising and going down slowly , but ozone levels are increasing slightly - it depends on the length of the summer , " he said .
" it 's driven by the weather .
athens has day after day of smog , if we did n't have the traditional english weather things would be a lot worse . "
notting hill gate is split by six lanes of traffic if the pollution does not bring a technicolour display to notting hill gate , the rings can be switched to respond to other stimuli such as noise or heat .
the idea is to bring " a sense of harmony and identity to this well-known but ignored public place " , according to architect philip gumuchdjian .
after some concerns that notting hill residents would be running for cover when the halos turn red - indicating high pollution - the council granted the project planning permission last year .
the group is now working on finding a backer to provide £ 1m and said it had had " some interest " , but it was proving difficult to pin a sponsor down .
" it 's very difficult to raise £ 1m and we have n't been able to do it yet , " said mr scott , who , after three years working on the project , is determined to see it through .
" i think art can revive an area , it can lift people 's spirits and give it a sense of place , " he said .

just down the road , the spinning eyes of a 10ft stainless steel carnival elephant by artist nadim karam have been keeping watch and attracting admiring glances outside waterstones since august 2003 .
now the group is trying to get its most eye-catching project yet off the ground - two glowing " eco halos " suspended over notting hill gate .
low-energy red , blue and green leds would be encased in two polycarbonate rings sculpted by artist dante leonelli and would change in response to their environment .
i think art can revive an area , it can lift people 's spirits and give it a sense of place john scott , nhig hooked up to monitoring equipment already in place , they would reflect air pollution levels - changing through the spectrum from white to red and raise awareness .
" they will define the centre of notting hill gate , which is in between the two halos , " said mr scott .
air quality analyst ben barratt , from king 's college , said inner london suffered from between 40 and 50 days of " moderate " air pollution in summer - about six in winter - but never reached the " very high " rating .
" it looks like traffic emissions are going down , traffic levels in london are stabilising and going down slowly , but ozone levels are increasing slightly - it depends on the length of the summer , " he said .
" it 's driven by the weather .
athens has day after day of smog , if we did n't have the traditional english weather things would be a lot worse . "
notting hill gate is split by six lanes of traffic if the pollution does not bring a technicolour display to notting hill gate , the rings can be switched to respond to other stimuli such as noise or heat .
the idea is to bring " a sense of harmony and identity to this well-known but ignored public place " , according to architect philip gumuchdjian .
after some concerns that notting hill residents would be running for cover when the halos turn red - indicating high pollution - the council granted the project planning permission last year .
the group is now working on finding a backer to provide £ 1m and said it had had " some interest " , but it was proving difficult to pin a sponsor down .
" it 's very difficult to raise £ 1m and we have n't been able to do it yet , " said mr scott , who , after three years working on the project , is determined to see it through .
" i think art can revive an area , it can lift people 's spirits and give it a sense of place , " he said .

he ordered the state 's attorney-general to take immediate steps to get a court ruling against the same-sex weddings .
mr schwarzenegger said they represented " an imminent risk to civil order " .
more than 3,000 gay couples have been married in san francisco since the city 's new mayor decided to defy state law and allow such weddings .
on friday , a judge denied a request by the conservative group , campaign for california families , for an injunction halting the same-sex marriages .
he said the group had failed to show convincing evidence that allowing gay weddings to continue would cause irreparable harm .
it was the second failed attempt to secure an injunction barring the unions .
' rule of law ' hours after friday 's court hearing , mr schwarzenegger wrote to the state 's attorney general , bill lockyero .
we urge the governor to meet with some of the couples because what 's happening is both lawful and loving san francisco mayor 's spokesman " our civilised society and legal system is based upon a respect for and adherence to the rule of law , " he wrote .
" the city and county of san francisco 's unfortunate choice to disregard state law and grant marriage certificates to gay couples directly undermines this fundamental guarantee .
" because the city and county of san francisco 's actions are directly contrary to state law and present an imminent risk to civil order , i hereby direct you to take immediate steps to obtain a definitive judicial resolution of this controversy . "
san francisco 's mayor , gavin newsom , believes the state law requiring marriage to be the union of a man and a woman discriminates against gays and lesbians .
gay couples hope more cities will follow san francisco 's lead as well as issuing marriage licences , his officials are also suing the state in an attempt to the get the law overturned .
a spokesman for the mayor , reacting to mr schwarzenegger 's directive , said : " the truth is , thousands of people are involved in loving relationships and having them recognised for the first time .
" we urge the governor to meet with some of the couples because what 's happening is both lawful and loving . "
gay men and lesbians have travelled from across the us to get married in san francisco .
the bbc 's david willis in san francisco says some regard what is happening in the city as a landmark moment in the struggle for gay rights and have likened it to the campaign against racial segregation in america .
massachusetts case californians voted against gay and lesbian marriages under proposition 22 in 2000 , which says marriage is limited to one man and one woman .
only the state of vermont sanctions civil unions between same-sex couples , while massachusetts , after a state high court ruled that banning gay marriage was unconstitutional , is set to become the first state to approve same-sex marriage later this year .
on friday , a county in the western state of new mexico briefly issue marriage licences to dozens of gay couples .

he ordered the state 's attorney-general to take immediate steps to get a court ruling against the same-sex weddings .
mr schwarzenegger said they represented " an imminent risk to civil order " .
more than 3,000 gay couples have been married in san francisco since the city 's new mayor decided to defy state law and allow such weddings .
on friday , a judge denied a request by the conservative group , campaign for california families , for an injunction halting the same-sex marriages .
he said the group had failed to show convincing evidence that allowing gay weddings to continue would cause irreparable harm .
it was the second failed attempt to secure an injunction barring the unions .
' rule of law ' hours after friday 's court hearing , mr schwarzenegger wrote to the state 's attorney general , bill lockyero .
we urge the governor to meet with some of the couples because what 's happening is both lawful and loving san francisco mayor 's spokesman " our civilised society and legal system is based upon a respect for and adherence to the rule of law , " he wrote .
" the city and county of san francisco 's unfortunate choice to disregard state law and grant marriage certificates to gay couples directly undermines this fundamental guarantee .
" because the city and county of san francisco 's actions are directly contrary to state law and present an imminent risk to civil order , i hereby direct you to take immediate steps to obtain a definitive judicial resolution of this controversy . "
san francisco 's mayor , gavin newsom , believes the state law requiring marriage to be the union of a man and a woman discriminates against gays and lesbians .
gay couples hope more cities will follow san francisco 's lead as well as issuing marriage licences , his officials are also suing the state in an attempt to the get the law overturned .
a spokesman for the mayor , reacting to mr schwarzenegger 's directive , said : " the truth is , thousands of people are involved in loving relationships and having them recognised for the first time .
" we urge the governor to meet with some of the couples because what 's happening is both lawful and loving . "
gay men and lesbians have travelled from across the us to get married in san francisco .
the bbc 's david willis in san francisco says some regard what is happening in the city as a landmark moment in the struggle for gay rights and have likened it to the campaign against racial segregation in america .
massachusetts case californians voted against gay and lesbian marriages under proposition 22 in 2000 , which says marriage is limited to one man and one woman .
only the state of vermont sanctions civil unions between same-sex couples , while massachusetts , after a state high court ruled that banning gay marriage was unconstitutional , is set to become the first state to approve same-sex marriage later this year .
on friday , a county in the western state of new mexico briefly issue marriage licences to dozens of gay couples .

the actual location of the event is being kept firmly under wraps , but the singer laughed off the idea that justin timberlake and robbie williams would be among the guests .
" as if they would come to my little party , " she said , before revealing it would be a family affair .
wherever it is though , cardiff on saturday night is sure to be awash with papparazzi trying to get pictures of church with her new boyfriend kyle johnson .
in the second of a three-part series , bbc news online looks at how the teenager 's love-life has become a national obsession .
aside from her continued musical success , stories about church as she grew up were focussed on her high court battle with her manager , pictures of her smoking and the outrage that followed when a 16-year-old was named rear of the year .
charlotte 's mother did not approve of steven johnson but the frenzied interest in her boyfriends , began when she started going out with dj steven johnson , a dj from the grangetown area of cardiff , who did not have the approval of charlotte 's mother maria .
the relationship strained the close bond between mother and daughter , especially after the 19-year-old was accused of offering to sell sex secrets to tabloid reporters at a cardiff hotel .
since the couple split last december , church has been linked to suitors including with oxford student ed foy , who she met on holiday in st lucia , and teenager kyle johnson -lrb- no relation to steven -rrb- , who comes from the ely district of cardiff .
steven , meanwhile , is launching a modelling career and has appeared on a documentary talking about his relationship with the star .
maria church told news online she did not understand why her daughter attracted so much public interest .
maria church said media attention " drives her up the wall " " it drives me up the wall - but i suppose she has grown up in the public eye , and people have grown up with her , " she said .
she admitted she noticed the attention more than her daughter .
" she has got used to it - she says singing is her job " .
ms church admitted fame did have its up-sides , such as when she met tom cruise on a chat show in america .
" he actually asked to meet her .
they said no-one was to bother him , but he turned up at her dressing room with his kids .
" charlotte 's face was a picture . "
after her debut album , voice of an angel , was released on 9 november 1998 , church 's success spiralled on both sides of the atlantic .

trinity school in leamington spa wants all of its students to wear uniforms .
more than 200 children walked out of lessons last october in protest , claiming that the decision went against the ethos of the school .
but an appeal to the local education authority -lrb- lea -rrb- has been rejected on the grounds the school 's governors are within their rights to make the change .
a concerned parent asked warwickshire lea to investigate the school 's decision to re-introduce uniforms for the first time in 30 years .
many parents and pupils believe a uniform would go against the school 's ethos of individualism , which states : " we recognise and affirm the value of each pupil , irrespective of their various gifts , needs and abilities .
" children are unique individuals , equal in the sight of god , with all the rights , liberty and dignity of humankind , irrespective of gender , ethnic origin and belief . "

trinity school in leamington spa wants all of its students to wear uniforms .
more than 200 children walked out of lessons last october in protest , claiming that the decision went against the ethos of the school .
but an appeal to the local education authority -lrb- lea -rrb- has been rejected on the grounds the school 's governors are within their rights to make the change .
a concerned parent asked warwickshire lea to investigate the school 's decision to re-introduce uniforms for the first time in 30 years .
many parents and pupils believe a uniform would go against the school 's ethos of individualism , which states : " we recognise and affirm the value of each pupil , irrespective of their various gifts , needs and abilities .
" children are unique individuals , equal in the sight of god , with all the rights , liberty and dignity of humankind , irrespective of gender , ethnic origin and belief . "
but warwickshire education officer eric wood said there was nothing wrong with the uniform policy which was democratically decided by the governors .
pupils have held two walkouts - in 2001 and 2003 - to try to prevent the change taking place .

campaigners have argued the manuscripts should be housed on the holy island of lindisfarne , off the northumberland coast , where they were produced by monks in the seventh century .

they are thought to have been written at the same time as bede 's ecclesiastical history of the english people , according to the british library .
the complex and lavishly decorated gospels are widely recognised as the pinnacle of anglo saxon cultural achievement .

campaigners have been battling to move the gospels from their current home at the british library in london , to durham cathedral or holy island .
gateshead east mp joyce quinn is to raise the question at an adjournment debate on wednesday .
ms quinn said the move would have an important impact on the area 's image .
she added that the region 's economy would also benefit .
culture is not an optional add-on these days it is very much part of the intrinsic attraction of the region and the intrinsic image of a region joyce quinn , mp " having the originals in the region would be a huge boost to the region 's economy and to our growing tourist industry .
" we have put a lot of effort in recent years , particularly in areas like gateshead , showing the link between culture and economic regeneration .
" the return of the lindisfarne gospels would be a huge boost in this direction .
" culture is not an optional add-on these days it is very much part of the intrinsic attraction of the region and the intrinsic image of a region . "
campaigners have argued the manuscripts should be housed on the holy island of lindisfarne , off the northumberland coast , where they were produced by monks in the seventh century .
but the british library has insisted the gospels must stay in the capital , where more people can view them .
they are thought to have been written at the same time as bede 's ecclesiastical history of the english people , according to the british library .
the complex and lavishly decorated gospels are widely recognised as the pinnacle of anglo saxon cultural achievement .

south yorkshire 's police chief mike hedges , who retires in august , says motorists view the gadgets as tax-raising machines .
he said : " i believe we have lost a tremendous amount of goodwill from the public .
i think the biggest mistake we have made is getting money back . "
mr hedges added he felt police were " losing the argument " over cameras .
he had backed speed cameras when they first became widespread but said the latest digital cameras , which churn out hundreds of tickets in the space of a few hours , had turned the public mood against them .
his sentiments reflect a growing belief within the police that cameras are being used to raise revenues rather than reduce speeds .
britain 's most senior police officer , metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens has also expressed concern over speed cameras .
he said : " i do n't approve of the use of speed cameras as money-making devices .

roger vincent , of the royal society for the prevention of accidents -lrb- rospa -rrb- , said : " speed cameras save lives .

south yorkshire 's police chief mike hedges , who retires in august , says motorists view the gadgets as tax-raising machines .
he said : " i believe we have lost a tremendous amount of goodwill from the public .
i think the biggest mistake we have made is getting money back . "
mr hedges added he felt police were " losing the argument " over cameras .
he had backed speed cameras when they first became widespread but said the latest digital cameras , which churn out hundreds of tickets in the space of a few hours , had turned the public mood against them .
his sentiments reflect a growing belief within the police that cameras are being used to raise revenues rather than reduce speeds .
britain 's most senior police officer , metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens has also expressed concern over speed cameras .
he said : " i do n't approve of the use of speed cameras as money-making devices .
' road hogs ' " the proper use for speed cameras is as a measure to lower the accident rate .
" i am not after people on the school run exceeding the limit by five or six miles an hour .
" i want my traffic policing to target the dangerous drivers , the road hogs , and the menaces who are driving unlicensed and uninsured . "
roger vincent , of the royal society for the prevention of accidents -lrb- rospa -rrb- , said : " speed cameras save lives .
they should be placed in areas where there are proven accident problems - and as far as we know they are .
" there has been a 35 % reduction in deaths and serious injuries in areas where speed cameras have been placed . "
