program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : microsoft takes on eu microsoft pays record fine into eu coffers microsoft appeals eu anti-trust ruling microsoft gets reprieve from eu commission microsoft 's long road to brussels business -pipe- 24.03.2004 microsoft slapped with biggest fine in eu history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft founder bill gates the european union on wednesday levied the largest fine against any company in the bloc 's history , ruling that microsoft must pay a half billion euros for abusing its " near monopoly " status . the european union on wednesday fined microsoft € 497.2 million -lrb- $ 611 million -rrb- for abusing its " near monopoly " with its windows operating system to crush competitors and gain the upper hand in markets for digital media players and low-end servers .
" dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business does n't prevent competition ... and does not harm consumers and innovation , " eu competition commissioner mario monti said .
" today 's decision restores the conditions for fair competition in the markets concerned and establishes clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position . "
illegal behavior citing " illegal behavior " that is " ongoing , " the eu antitrust authority is calling for microsoft to implement a number of remedies .
the company has been ordered to offer a version of windows without its digital media player in three months and to release the " complete and accurate " interface code to rival companies in the server market within four month .
the commission said the release of the code , a demand heatedly contested by microsoft , was necessary in order for server products created by competing companies to have " full interoperability " with computers running windows .
the commission said it would appoint a monitoring trustee " to ensure effective and timely compliance . "
the ruling is the highest ever penalty imposed by the eu 's executive branch against a single company for violating competition regulations .
microsoft , the world 's biggest software firm , has denied it abuses the overwhelming dominance of its windows operating system to illegally crush competitors .
it said eu regulators were unjustified in proposing such a large fine .
" we worked hard to reach an agreement that would address the european commission 's concerns and still allow us to innovate and improve our products for consumers , " said steve ballmer , chief executive officer of microsoft .
" we respect the commission 's authority , but we believe that our settlement offer from last week would have offered far more choices and benefits to consumers . "
the company said it would file an appeal with the eu 's court of first instance in luxembourg .
painful remedies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commissioner for competition mario monti but chief executive steve ballmer is less worried about the financial penalties , which will probably not cause too much pain for the seattle-based company given its cash reserves of some $ 53 billion .
it 's more the list of " remedies " the eu competition authorities have handed down that is cause for concern for the company , which has sought to expand its operating system to incorporate almost all facets of the internet .
monti has said he fears that if unchecked , microsoft would continue to exploit its monopoly when it launches its windows successor , longhorn , which combines built-in search engine capabilities and 3-d graphics to compete with internet companies like google and yahoo .
but ballmer , who is currently in brussels , rejects such demands , saying it limits microsoft 's ability to develop new products and integrate them into the operating system in the future .
according to the company spokesman , the eu regulations serve only as a " stumbling block to the company 's capacity to innovate . "
monti , whose five-year term as competition commissioner ends in october , is not flinching on what is without a doubt the commission 's biggest anti-trust case .
despite hefty criticism that the verdict will do nothing for competition and everything to block innovation , the guardian of fair trade practices said ahead of wednesday 's decision : " it is essential to have a clear principle for the future conduct of a company which has such a strong dominant position in the market . "
a history of investigations this was n't the first time microsoft found itself under the watchful gaze of anti-trust investigators .
in a spectacular anti-trust case in the united states , the government threatened to split microsoft up into different companies at the turn of the century .
the company 's operating system can be found in 95 percent of the desktop computers worldwide , and u.s. courts determined that microsoft had repeatedly abused its monopoly status .
but after then-president bill clinton left office , microsoft cut a deal with the justice department and several states , effectively resolving the anti-trust case .
however , the european commission continued to follow up complaints from microsoft competitors filed five years ago .
sun microsystems , for example , charged that microsoft had integrated applications like the internet explorer web browser and digital media programs into its operating system in a way that largely banished any competition for the applications .
the commission later held that microsoft had violated competition laws and sought to negotiate a settlement with the redmond , washington-based company .
but talks failed earlier this week , setting the scene for the ruling .
fear of lawsuits micrsoft initially sought to avoid formal punishment from the european commission because , it feared , it could be used as a precedent for costly lawsuits against the company in other countries including the u.s. both microsoft and the commission agreed that the company had abused its monopoly status .
microsoft even agreed to decouple its internet explorer and windows xp software .
but that proposal did n't go far enough for monti .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : microsoft takes on eu microsoft pays record fine into eu coffers microsoft appeals eu anti-trust ruling microsoft gets reprieve from eu commission microsoft 's long road to brussels business -pipe- 24.03.2004 microsoft slapped with biggest fine in eu history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft founder bill gates the european union on wednesday levied the largest fine against any company in the bloc 's history , ruling that microsoft must pay a half billion euros for abusing its " near monopoly " status . the european union on wednesday fined microsoft € 497.2 million -lrb- $ 611 million -rrb- for abusing its " near monopoly " with its windows operating system to crush competitors and gain the upper hand in markets for digital media players and low-end servers .
" dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business does n't prevent competition ... and does not harm consumers and innovation , " eu competition commissioner mario monti said .
" today 's decision restores the conditions for fair competition in the markets concerned and establishes clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position . "
illegal behavior citing " illegal behavior " that is " ongoing , " the eu antitrust authority is calling for microsoft to implement a number of remedies .
the company has been ordered to offer a version of windows without its digital media player in three months and to release the " complete and accurate " interface code to rival companies in the server market within four month .
the commission said the release of the code , a demand heatedly contested by microsoft , was necessary in order for server products created by competing companies to have " full interoperability " with computers running windows .
the commission said it would appoint a monitoring trustee " to ensure effective and timely compliance . "
the ruling is the highest ever penalty imposed by the eu 's executive branch against a single company for violating competition regulations .
microsoft , the world 's biggest software firm , has denied it abuses the overwhelming dominance of its windows operating system to illegally crush competitors .
it said eu regulators were unjustified in proposing such a large fine .
" we worked hard to reach an agreement that would address the european commission 's concerns and still allow us to innovate and improve our products for consumers , " said steve ballmer , chief executive officer of microsoft .
" we respect the commission 's authority , but we believe that our settlement offer from last week would have offered far more choices and benefits to consumers . "
the company said it would file an appeal with the eu 's court of first instance in luxembourg .
painful remedies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commissioner for competition mario monti but chief executive steve ballmer is less worried about the financial penalties , which will probably not cause too much pain for the seattle-based company given its cash reserves of some $ 53 billion .
it 's more the list of " remedies " the eu competition authorities have handed down that is cause for concern for the company , which has sought to expand its operating system to incorporate almost all facets of the internet .
monti has said he fears that if unchecked , microsoft would continue to exploit its monopoly when it launches its windows successor , longhorn , which combines built-in search engine capabilities and 3-d graphics to compete with internet companies like google and yahoo .
but ballmer , who is currently in brussels , rejects such demands , saying it limits microsoft 's ability to develop new products and integrate them into the operating system in the future .
according to the company spokesman , the eu regulations serve only as a " stumbling block to the company 's capacity to innovate . "
monti , whose five-year term as competition commissioner ends in october , is not flinching on what is without a doubt the commission 's biggest anti-trust case .
despite hefty criticism that the verdict will do nothing for competition and everything to block innovation , the guardian of fair trade practices said ahead of wednesday 's decision : " it is essential to have a clear principle for the future conduct of a company which has such a strong dominant position in the market . "
a history of investigations this was n't the first time microsoft found itself under the watchful gaze of anti-trust investigators .
in a spectacular anti-trust case in the united states , the government threatened to split microsoft up into different companies at the turn of the century .
the company 's operating system can be found in 95 percent of the desktop computers worldwide , and u.s. courts determined that microsoft had repeatedly abused its monopoly status .
but after then-president bill clinton left office , microsoft cut a deal with the justice department and several states , effectively resolving the anti-trust case .
however , the european commission continued to follow up complaints from microsoft competitors filed five years ago .
sun microsystems , for example , charged that microsoft had integrated applications like the internet explorer web browser and digital media programs into its operating system in a way that largely banished any competition for the applications .

" dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business does n't prevent competition ... and does not harm consumers and innovation , " eu competition commissioner mario monti said .
" today 's decision restores the conditions for fair competition in the markets concerned and establishes clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position . "
illegal behavior citing " illegal behavior " that is " ongoing , " the eu antitrust authority is calling for microsoft to implement a number of remedies .
the company has been ordered to offer a version of windows without its digital media player in three months and to release the " complete and accurate " interface code to rival companies in the server market within four month .
the commission said the release of the code , a demand heatedly contested by microsoft , was necessary in order for server products created by competing companies to have " full interoperability " with computers running windows .
the commission said it would appoint a monitoring trustee " to ensure effective and timely compliance . "
the ruling is the highest ever penalty imposed by the eu 's executive branch against a single company for violating competition regulations .
microsoft , the world 's biggest software firm , has denied it abuses the overwhelming dominance of its windows operating system to illegally crush competitors .
it said eu regulators were unjustified in proposing such a large fine .
" we worked hard to reach an agreement that would address the european commission 's concerns and still allow us to innovate and improve our products for consumers , " said steve ballmer , chief executive officer of microsoft .
" we respect the commission 's authority , but we believe that our settlement offer from last week would have offered far more choices and benefits to consumers . "
the company said it would file an appeal with the eu 's court of first instance in luxembourg .
painful remedies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commissioner for competition mario monti but chief executive steve ballmer is less worried about the financial penalties , which will probably not cause too much pain for the seattle-based company given its cash reserves of some $ 53 billion .
it 's more the list of " remedies " the eu competition authorities have handed down that is cause for concern for the company , which has sought to expand its operating system to incorporate almost all facets of the internet .
monti has said he fears that if unchecked , microsoft would continue to exploit its monopoly when it launches its windows successor , longhorn , which combines built-in search engine capabilities and 3-d graphics to compete with internet companies like google and yahoo .
but ballmer , who is currently in brussels , rejects such demands , saying it limits microsoft 's ability to develop new products and integrate them into the operating system in the future .
according to the company spokesman , the eu regulations serve only as a " stumbling block to the company 's capacity to innovate . "
monti , whose five-year term as competition commissioner ends in october , is not flinching on what is without a doubt the commission 's biggest anti-trust case .
despite hefty criticism that the verdict will do nothing for competition and everything to block innovation , the guardian of fair trade practices said ahead of wednesday 's decision : " it is essential to have a clear principle for the future conduct of a company which has such a strong dominant position in the market . "
a history of investigations this was n't the first time microsoft found itself under the watchful gaze of anti-trust investigators .
in a spectacular anti-trust case in the united states , the government threatened to split microsoft up into different companies at the turn of the century .
the company 's operating system can be found in 95 percent of the desktop computers worldwide , and u.s. courts determined that microsoft had repeatedly abused its monopoly status .
but after then-president bill clinton left office , microsoft cut a deal with the justice department and several states , effectively resolving the anti-trust case .
however , the european commission continued to follow up complaints from microsoft competitors filed five years ago .
sun microsystems , for example , charged that microsoft had integrated applications like the internet explorer web browser and digital media programs into its operating system in a way that largely banished any competition for the applications .
the commission later held that microsoft had violated competition laws and sought to negotiate a settlement with the redmond , washington-based company .

" dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business does n't prevent competition ... and does not harm consumers and innovation , " eu competition commissioner mario monti said .
" today 's decision restores the conditions for fair competition in the markets concerned and establishes clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position . "
illegal behavior citing " illegal behavior " that is " ongoing , " the eu antitrust authority is calling for microsoft to implement a number of remedies .
the company has been ordered to offer a version of windows without its digital media player in three months and to release the " complete and accurate " interface code to rival companies in the server market within four month .
the commission said the release of the code , a demand heatedly contested by microsoft , was necessary in order for server products created by competing companies to have " full interoperability " with computers running windows .
the commission said it would appoint a monitoring trustee " to ensure effective and timely compliance . "
the ruling is the highest ever penalty imposed by the eu 's executive branch against a single company for violating competition regulations .
microsoft , the world 's biggest software firm , has denied it abuses the overwhelming dominance of its windows operating system to illegally crush competitors .
it said eu regulators were unjustified in proposing such a large fine .
" we worked hard to reach an agreement that would address the european commission 's concerns and still allow us to innovate and improve our products for consumers , " said steve ballmer , chief executive officer of microsoft .
" we respect the commission 's authority , but we believe that our settlement offer from last week would have offered far more choices and benefits to consumers . "
the company said it would file an appeal with the eu 's court of first instance in luxembourg .
painful remedies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commissioner for competition mario monti but chief executive steve ballmer is less worried about the financial penalties , which will probably not cause too much pain for the seattle-based company given its cash reserves of some $ 53 billion .
it 's more the list of " remedies " the eu competition authorities have handed down that is cause for concern for the company , which has sought to expand its operating system to incorporate almost all facets of the internet .
monti has said he fears that if unchecked , microsoft would continue to exploit its monopoly when it launches its windows successor , longhorn , which combines built-in search engine capabilities and 3-d graphics to compete with internet companies like google and yahoo .
but ballmer , who is currently in brussels , rejects such demands , saying it limits microsoft 's ability to develop new products and integrate them into the operating system in the future .
according to the company spokesman , the eu regulations serve only as a " stumbling block to the company 's capacity to innovate . "
monti , whose five-year term as competition commissioner ends in october , is not flinching on what is without a doubt the commission 's biggest anti-trust case .
despite hefty criticism that the verdict will do nothing for competition and everything to block innovation , the guardian of fair trade practices said ahead of wednesday 's decision : " it is essential to have a clear principle for the future conduct of a company which has such a strong dominant position in the market . "
a history of investigations this was n't the first time microsoft found itself under the watchful gaze of anti-trust investigators .
in a spectacular anti-trust case in the united states , the government threatened to split microsoft up into different companies at the turn of the century .
the company 's operating system can be found in 95 percent of the desktop computers worldwide , and u.s. courts determined that microsoft had repeatedly abused its monopoly status .
but after then-president bill clinton left office , microsoft cut a deal with the justice department and several states , effectively resolving the anti-trust case .
however , the european commission continued to follow up complaints from microsoft competitors filed five years ago .
sun microsystems , for example , charged that microsoft had integrated applications like the internet explorer web browser and digital media programs into its operating system in a way that largely banished any competition for the applications .
the commission later held that microsoft had violated competition laws and sought to negotiate a settlement with the redmond , washington-based company .
but talks failed earlier this week , setting the scene for the ruling .
fear of lawsuits micrsoft initially sought to avoid formal punishment from the european commission because , it feared , it could be used as a precedent for costly lawsuits against the company in other countries including the u.s. both microsoft and the commission agreed that the company had abused its monopoly status .
microsoft even agreed to decouple its internet explorer and windows xp software .
but that proposal did n't go far enough for monti .
" we made substantial progress towards resolving the problems but were unable to agree on commitments for future conduct , " monti said earlier this week . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de microsoft 's long road to brussels this week 's ruling should come as no surprise to microsoft .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : microsoft takes on eu microsoft pays record fine into eu coffers microsoft appeals eu anti-trust ruling microsoft gets reprieve from eu commission microsoft 's long road to brussels business -pipe- 24.03.2004 microsoft slapped with biggest fine in eu history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft founder bill gates the european union on wednesday levied the largest fine against any company in the bloc 's history , ruling that microsoft must pay a half billion euros for abusing its " near monopoly " status . the european union on wednesday fined microsoft € 497.2 million -lrb- $ 611 million -rrb- for abusing its " near monopoly " with its windows operating system to crush competitors and gain the upper hand in markets for digital media players and low-end servers .
" dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business does n't prevent competition ... and does not harm consumers and innovation , " eu competition commissioner mario monti said .
" today 's decision restores the conditions for fair competition in the markets concerned and establishes clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position . "
illegal behavior citing " illegal behavior " that is " ongoing , " the eu antitrust authority is calling for microsoft to implement a number of remedies .
the company has been ordered to offer a version of windows without its digital media player in three months and to release the " complete and accurate " interface code to rival companies in the server market within four month .
the commission said the release of the code , a demand heatedly contested by microsoft , was necessary in order for server products created by competing companies to have " full interoperability " with computers running windows .
the commission said it would appoint a monitoring trustee " to ensure effective and timely compliance . "
the ruling is the highest ever penalty imposed by the eu 's executive branch against a single company for violating competition regulations .
microsoft , the world 's biggest software firm , has denied it abuses the overwhelming dominance of its windows operating system to illegally crush competitors .
it said eu regulators were unjustified in proposing such a large fine .
" we worked hard to reach an agreement that would address the european commission 's concerns and still allow us to innovate and improve our products for consumers , " said steve ballmer , chief executive officer of microsoft .
" we respect the commission 's authority , but we believe that our settlement offer from last week would have offered far more choices and benefits to consumers . "
the company said it would file an appeal with the eu 's court of first instance in luxembourg .
painful remedies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commissioner for competition mario monti but chief executive steve ballmer is less worried about the financial penalties , which will probably not cause too much pain for the seattle-based company given its cash reserves of some $ 53 billion .
it 's more the list of " remedies " the eu competition authorities have handed down that is cause for concern for the company , which has sought to expand its operating system to incorporate almost all facets of the internet .
monti has said he fears that if unchecked , microsoft would continue to exploit its monopoly when it launches its windows successor , longhorn , which combines built-in search engine capabilities and 3-d graphics to compete with internet companies like google and yahoo .
but ballmer , who is currently in brussels , rejects such demands , saying it limits microsoft 's ability to develop new products and integrate them into the operating system in the future .
according to the company spokesman , the eu regulations serve only as a " stumbling block to the company 's capacity to innovate . "
monti , whose five-year term as competition commissioner ends in october , is not flinching on what is without a doubt the commission 's biggest anti-trust case .
despite hefty criticism that the verdict will do nothing for competition and everything to block innovation , the guardian of fair trade practices said ahead of wednesday 's decision : " it is essential to have a clear principle for the future conduct of a company which has such a strong dominant position in the market . "
a history of investigations this was n't the first time microsoft found itself under the watchful gaze of anti-trust investigators .
in a spectacular anti-trust case in the united states , the government threatened to split microsoft up into different companies at the turn of the century .
the company 's operating system can be found in 95 percent of the desktop computers worldwide , and u.s. courts determined that microsoft had repeatedly abused its monopoly status .
but after then-president bill clinton left office , microsoft cut a deal with the justice department and several states , effectively resolving the anti-trust case .
however , the european commission continued to follow up complaints from microsoft competitors filed five years ago .
sun microsystems , for example , charged that microsoft had integrated applications like the internet explorer web browser and digital media programs into its operating system in a way that largely banished any competition for the applications .
the commission later held that microsoft had violated competition laws and sought to negotiate a settlement with the redmond , washington-based company .
but talks failed earlier this week , setting the scene for the ruling .
fear of lawsuits micrsoft initially sought to avoid formal punishment from the european commission because , it feared , it could be used as a precedent for costly lawsuits against the company in other countries including the u.s. both microsoft and the commission agreed that the company had abused its monopoly status .
microsoft even agreed to decouple its internet explorer and windows xp software .
but that proposal did n't go far enough for monti .
" we made substantial progress towards resolving the problems but were unable to agree on commitments for future conduct , " monti said earlier this week . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de microsoft 's long road to brussels this week 's ruling should come as no surprise to microsoft .
already in 2001 the european commission began gathering evidence against the u.s. software giant .
back then it looked like a quick resolution was in sight .
-lrb- march 23 , 2004 -rrb- the highest corporate fines in eu history more than a dozen companies have been fined € 50 million or more by the european commission for anti-competitive practices including abuses of monopoly status and price fixing .
here 's a list of the biggest cases .

five years ago , nato began air raids on yugoslavia to stop violence in kosovo .
it was an important and controversial event for german foreign policy : for the first time since 1945 , german soldiers participated in combat . kosovo was n't the first postwar foreign mission for the bundeswehr , as the german military is called .
german soldiers had participated in un missions since the early 1990s , mainly offering humanitarian assistance . however , the use of military force abroad in kosovo helped redefine german foreign policy in a way that continues today .
germany 's leading role in the stabilization of afghanistan and deployment of naval power off the coast of africa to combat international terrorism are the best examples of how things have changed . only a decade ago , those missions would have been unthinkable . in 1994 , social democrats , who were in opposition at the time , and some free democrats , who formed part of the governing coalition , filed a complaint with the constitutional court against foreign missions by the bundeswehr .
helmut kohl , germany 's christian democratic chancellor at the time , and his cabinet of ministers had approved the missions without the parliament 's consent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers the plaintiffs asked the court to clarify the legislature 's rights in deciding about military missions .
they also wanted to know whether the constitution allowed german soldiers to participate in such actions at all , as the bundeswehr 's scope of activities had been limited to defending germany so far . clearing the way for germany 's participation in military strikes , the country 's highest judges ruled that such an involvement was constitutional as long as a un or nato mandate existed . warming up to military action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers in bosnia the bundeswehr went to the balkans , where german soldiers became part of nato 's ifor operation in bosnia from 1995 to 1996 .
the mission gave the bundeswehr a chance to get experience in conflict resolution , according to hans frank , a former vice admiral who now heads the federal college for security policy studies in berlin . " we participated in stabilization efforts after military action , but never in the action itself , " frank said .
" kosovo showed that sometimes the use of force is necessary to squelch a developing conflict and return to stability . " using military force was the point in question .
until that time , german soldiers abroad had only used their weapons for self-defense .
now nato decided to bomb yugoslavia to end the atrocities that state forces were committing against ethnic albanians in kosovo .
the german parliament voted in favor of bundeswehr participation in october 1998 , and the bombing began on march 24 , 1999 , exactly five years ago . a first for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder standing in front of a eurofighter jet .
germany was n't waging a war but had been called upon to secure peace in kosovo with military force , german chancellor gerhard schröder explained to the nation in a television speech . by doing so , he articulated a new and important basis of german foreign policy : the deployment of force and - german - soldiers can be a last resort to resolve a crisis . at the same time , the federal government turned reunified germany into an equal and serious nato partner .
fourteen bundeswehr tornado fighters took off on 500 missions - mostly for reconnaissance purposes but also against yugoslav anti-aircraft stations . it was a decisive and completely novel step for the bundeswehr , which has to be seen in the context of its history , frank said . " but first and foremost it was a political decision , and a very important one , " he said .

five years ago , nato began air raids on yugoslavia to stop violence in kosovo .
it was an important and controversial event for german foreign policy : for the first time since 1945 , german soldiers participated in combat . kosovo was n't the first postwar foreign mission for the bundeswehr , as the german military is called .
german soldiers had participated in un missions since the early 1990s , mainly offering humanitarian assistance . however , the use of military force abroad in kosovo helped redefine german foreign policy in a way that continues today .
germany 's leading role in the stabilization of afghanistan and deployment of naval power off the coast of africa to combat international terrorism are the best examples of how things have changed . only a decade ago , those missions would have been unthinkable . in 1994 , social democrats , who were in opposition at the time , and some free democrats , who formed part of the governing coalition , filed a complaint with the constitutional court against foreign missions by the bundeswehr .
helmut kohl , germany 's christian democratic chancellor at the time , and his cabinet of ministers had approved the missions without the parliament 's consent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers the plaintiffs asked the court to clarify the legislature 's rights in deciding about military missions .
they also wanted to know whether the constitution allowed german soldiers to participate in such actions at all , as the bundeswehr 's scope of activities had been limited to defending germany so far . clearing the way for germany 's participation in military strikes , the country 's highest judges ruled that such an involvement was constitutional as long as a un or nato mandate existed . warming up to military action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers in bosnia the bundeswehr went to the balkans , where german soldiers became part of nato 's ifor operation in bosnia from 1995 to 1996 .
the mission gave the bundeswehr a chance to get experience in conflict resolution , according to hans frank , a former vice admiral who now heads the federal college for security policy studies in berlin . " we participated in stabilization efforts after military action , but never in the action itself , " frank said .
" kosovo showed that sometimes the use of force is necessary to squelch a developing conflict and return to stability . " using military force was the point in question .
until that time , german soldiers abroad had only used their weapons for self-defense .
now nato decided to bomb yugoslavia to end the atrocities that state forces were committing against ethnic albanians in kosovo .
the german parliament voted in favor of bundeswehr participation in october 1998 , and the bombing began on march 24 , 1999 , exactly five years ago . a first for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder standing in front of a eurofighter jet .
germany was n't waging a war but had been called upon to secure peace in kosovo with military force , german chancellor gerhard schröder explained to the nation in a television speech . by doing so , he articulated a new and important basis of german foreign policy : the deployment of force and - german - soldiers can be a last resort to resolve a crisis . at the same time , the federal government turned reunified germany into an equal and serious nato partner .
fourteen bundeswehr tornado fighters took off on 500 missions - mostly for reconnaissance purposes but also against yugoslav anti-aircraft stations . it was a decisive and completely novel step for the bundeswehr , which has to be seen in the context of its history , frank said . " but first and foremost it was a political decision , and a very important one , " he said .

five years ago , nato began air raids on yugoslavia to stop violence in kosovo .
it was an important and controversial event for german foreign policy : for the first time since 1945 , german soldiers participated in combat . kosovo was n't the first postwar foreign mission for the bundeswehr , as the german military is called .
german soldiers had participated in un missions since the early 1990s , mainly offering humanitarian assistance . however , the use of military force abroad in kosovo helped redefine german foreign policy in a way that continues today .
germany 's leading role in the stabilization of afghanistan and deployment of naval power off the coast of africa to combat international terrorism are the best examples of how things have changed . only a decade ago , those missions would have been unthinkable . in 1994 , social democrats , who were in opposition at the time , and some free democrats , who formed part of the governing coalition , filed a complaint with the constitutional court against foreign missions by the bundeswehr .

" no government of the federal republic had been asked to make that decision to enter a war so far . " even after nato air raids began , all parties , except the post-communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , supported germany 's participation in the war .

five years after the war , kosovo remains troubled by ethnic tensions .
while albanians would like to become independent , serbs want more participation from belgrade to protect their rights . kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova on tuesday called for swift independence from serbia for the un-controlled province after last week 's violent clashes .
but un officials are demanding that democratic standards have to be introduced before that can happen . during last week 's bloodshed , 28 people were killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , were displaced from the homes .
nato has blamed extremist albanians for the violence and rugova promised a thorough investigation as well as actions to remedy the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova but un officials in kosovo expressed their disappointment that rugova -lrb- photo -rrb- and others had not explicitly condemned the attacks on serbs . " to my great astonishment and disappointment , something was left out , namely the condemnation of the violence against the serbs , " said harri holkeri , who heads the united nations interim administration mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- . jaap de hoop scheffer , nato 's secretary general , also condemned the clashes during a visit to kosovo on monday .
" what happened last week , orchestrated and organized by extremist factions in the albanian community , is unacceptable , " he said . war began five years ago bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of ethnic albanians fled the province in 1999 .
five years ago , on march 24 , 1999 , nato began air raids on yugoslavia with the goal of preventing a catastrophe by forcing slobodan milosevic to end military and police actions against ethnic albanians in kosovo . almost 80 days after the bombing began , the yugoslav president finally gave in .
international peacekeeping troops arrived in kosovo , which was put under un control .
slowly , democratic institutions were set up .
last year , the governments in serbia and kosovo began to talk to each other again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic albanians waiting to vote in the 2001 elections .
a lot has happened since then : kosovo elected a new president and a parliament , a government was formed , and the province got its own judiciary and police force .
the second parliamentary elections are scheduled for the fall . the unclear future status of kosovo is the biggest problem for ethnic albanians .
after the war , the un adopted resolution 1244 , which only called for a " substantial autonomy for the people of kosovo " and put the province under international control .
that 's not enough for the albanians , who want complete independence from belgrade . but the " decent and appropriate treatment of smaller ethnic groups " is one democratic standard un officials have demanded before agreeing to discuss the province 's future status .
the first to do so was michael steiner , who headed unmik until last july . he defined eight criteria , including functioning governmental institutions , freedom of movement , a functioning economy , as well as a working judiciary and police force .
those who fled from kosovo in 1999 would have to be allowed back too . negotiations possible in 2005 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harri holkeri steiner 's successor , harri holkeri -lrb- photo -rrb- fine-tuned the standards last december .
if these standards can be reached by mid-2005 , the international community has promised negotiations about kosovo 's status . serbia 's government and the serbs in kosovo fear that these standards and the deadline have made independence inevitable .
albanians in kosovo , on the other hand , are happy that a date has been set .
" it 's a great achievement as un resolution 1244 did n't set a date , " kosovo 's premier bajram rexhepi said . to ensure peaceful coexistence between albanians and serbs , unmik 's current efforts do n't suffice , according to some . " we have to try harder to correct our past mistakes , " said faruk spahija , the mayor of mitrovica .
" it 's possible to create a climate of peace in kosovo .
a lot more has to be done to adhere to the standards kosovo has been presented with .

five years ago , nato began air raids on yugoslavia to stop violence in kosovo .
it was an important and controversial event for german foreign policy : for the first time since 1945 , german soldiers participated in combat . kosovo was n't the first postwar foreign mission for the bundeswehr , as the german military is called .
german soldiers had participated in un missions since the early 1990s , mainly offering humanitarian assistance . however , the use of military force abroad in kosovo helped redefine german foreign policy in a way that continues today .
germany 's leading role in the stabilization of afghanistan and deployment of naval power off the coast of africa to combat international terrorism are the best examples of how things have changed . only a decade ago , those missions would have been unthinkable . in 1994 , social democrats , who were in opposition at the time , and some free democrats , who formed part of the governing coalition , filed a complaint with the constitutional court against foreign missions by the bundeswehr .
helmut kohl , germany 's christian democratic chancellor at the time , and his cabinet of ministers had approved the missions without the parliament 's consent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers the plaintiffs asked the court to clarify the legislature 's rights in deciding about military missions .
they also wanted to know whether the constitution allowed german soldiers to participate in such actions at all , as the bundeswehr 's scope of activities had been limited to defending germany so far . clearing the way for germany 's participation in military strikes , the country 's highest judges ruled that such an involvement was constitutional as long as a un or nato mandate existed . warming up to military action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers in bosnia the bundeswehr went to the balkans , where german soldiers became part of nato 's ifor operation in bosnia from 1995 to 1996 .
the mission gave the bundeswehr a chance to get experience in conflict resolution , according to hans frank , a former vice admiral who now heads the federal college for security policy studies in berlin . " we participated in stabilization efforts after military action , but never in the action itself , " frank said .
" kosovo showed that sometimes the use of force is necessary to squelch a developing conflict and return to stability . " using military force was the point in question .
until that time , german soldiers abroad had only used their weapons for self-defense .
now nato decided to bomb yugoslavia to end the atrocities that state forces were committing against ethnic albanians in kosovo .
the german parliament voted in favor of bundeswehr participation in october 1998 , and the bombing began on march 24 , 1999 , exactly five years ago . a first for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder standing in front of a eurofighter jet .
germany was n't waging a war but had been called upon to secure peace in kosovo with military force , german chancellor gerhard schröder explained to the nation in a television speech . by doing so , he articulated a new and important basis of german foreign policy : the deployment of force and - german - soldiers can be a last resort to resolve a crisis . at the same time , the federal government turned reunified germany into an equal and serious nato partner .
fourteen bundeswehr tornado fighters took off on 500 missions - mostly for reconnaissance purposes but also against yugoslav anti-aircraft stations . it was a decisive and completely novel step for the bundeswehr , which has to be seen in the context of its history , frank said . " but first and foremost it was a political decision , and a very important one , " he said .
" no government of the federal republic had been asked to make that decision to enter a war so far . " even after nato air raids began , all parties , except the post-communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , supported germany 's participation in the war .
seven of 47 green parliamentarians called for an immediate end to the mission , but the party leadership surrounding foreign minister joschka fischer backed the decision . after the war , the bundeswehr almost immediately went from taking military action to trying to stabilize the situation ; the un 's kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- peacekeepers took over once nato had ended the bombardments on june 10 , 1999 . shortly after , klaus reinhardt became the first german general to lead a nato mission outside the alliance 's territory .
today , the bundeswehr , which is sending an additional 600 troops to kosovo after last week 's violent clashes , remains one of the biggest forces within kfor . nina werkhäuser -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder rules out peacekeepers as iraqis ok constitution the iraqi governing council agreed on an interim constitution on monday which could pave the way to a return of sovereignty .
meanwhile , gerhard schröder again ruled out any german involvement in peacekeeping in iraq .
-lrb- march 1 , 2004 -rrb- why germany voted ' yes ' to invade yugoslavia but ' no ' to iraq chancellor gerhard schröder has ruled out german military participation in an iraq war .
but four years ago the bundeswehr took part in nato air strikes on yugoslavia without a u.n. mandate .
so why then and not now ?

ballendorf in southwestern germany has made headlines across the country : election officials annulled the recent mayoral election there after the winner admitted buying beers for 21 of the 660 villagers . when ballendorfers went to the polls a few weeks ago , they narrowly chose andreas benz , a 45-year-old farmer , as their new mayor .

after all , benz may have won the election because he paid for beer and gave money to a local group , as the informant had told officials . the mayor-elect readily confirmed and clarified the facts : over the course of two nights , he had bought 21 beers for people in ballendorf 's sports and singing clubs .
he had also given € 50 -lrb- $ 60 -rrb- to a youth group to repair the roof of their meeting place .
" that 's how it 's done , " he told dw-world . " this is crazy " calling it an illegal attempt to influence voters , the county 's election officials annulled the vote and the district attorney 's office announced it would investigate the case .
in the worst case scenario , benz could be punished with five years in prison for bribing voters . " this is crazy , " benz said , adding that neither he nor many other ballendorfers could understand the authorities .
" it 's not surprising that nothing works in this country any more .
do n't people have other things to worry about ? " ballendorfers will now have to choose a new mayor again , by september at the latest .
benz said he has n't decided whether he 's going to run for office again and added that he first has to digest what 's been happening .

the sharp fall in profits by € 5 billion amounts to one of the weakest showings in the bank 's financial history .
the bundesbank blamed the weak dollar and low interest rates for the fiasco .
the stark decline in the bundesbank 's profits is likely to mean a substantial cash shortfall for the german government .
the bundesbank transfers most of its annual profits to the government and berlin had been penciling in around € 3.5 billion for last year .
however german finance minister hans eichel put a brave face on the debacle wednesday and said berlin would manage to plug the gap without running up more debt . more briefs 23.03.2004 -pipe- deutsche post reveals top managers ' pay 23.03.2004 -pipe- strong euro dampens car industry profits 23.03.2004 -pipe- siemens denies outsourcing jobs 22.03.2004 -pipe- germany , france want european imf chief 22.03.2004 -pipe- hvb begins search for merger partners 22.03.2004 -pipe- axel springer joins bidding war for daily telegraph 22.03.2004 -pipe- holsten faces delisting after carlsberg takeover 22.03.2004 -pipe- kpn to offer umts for german businesses radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

ballendorf in southwestern germany has made headlines across the country : election officials annulled the recent mayoral election there after the winner admitted buying beers for 21 of the 660 villagers . when ballendorfers went to the polls a few weeks ago , they narrowly chose andreas benz , a 45-year-old farmer , as their new mayor .
he got 17 more votes than his opponent , manfred schlumpberger , an electrician from neighboring heuchlingen .
-lrb- in germany , people do n't have to be residents of a town to run for office there . -rrb- the narrow outcome of the election caused county officials in nearby ulm to listen carefully , when an unnamed informant - not schlumpberger - told them what had happened during ballendorf 's election campaign .
after all , benz may have won the election because he paid for beer and gave money to a local group , as the informant had told officials . the mayor-elect readily confirmed and clarified the facts : over the course of two nights , he had bought 21 beers for people in ballendorf 's sports and singing clubs .
he had also given € 50 -lrb- $ 60 -rrb- to a youth group to repair the roof of their meeting place .
" that 's how it 's done , " he told dw-world . " this is crazy " calling it an illegal attempt to influence voters , the county 's election officials annulled the vote and the district attorney 's office announced it would investigate the case .
in the worst case scenario , benz could be punished with five years in prison for bribing voters . " this is crazy , " benz said , adding that neither he nor many other ballendorfers could understand the authorities .
" it 's not surprising that nothing works in this country any more .
do n't people have other things to worry about ? " ballendorfers will now have to choose a new mayor again , by september at the latest .
benz said he has n't decided whether he 's going to run for office again and added that he first has to digest what 's been happening .
one thing 's for certain , though : it 's going to be a very dry campaign . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's favorite beverage : beer read dw-world 's collection of stories on the subject . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

five years after the war , kosovo remains troubled by ethnic tensions .
while albanians would like to become independent , serbs want more participation from belgrade to protect their rights . kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova on tuesday called for swift independence from serbia for the un-controlled province after last week 's violent clashes .
but un officials are demanding that democratic standards have to be introduced before that can happen . during last week 's bloodshed , 28 people were killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , were displaced from the homes .
nato has blamed extremist albanians for the violence and rugova promised a thorough investigation as well as actions to remedy the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova but un officials in kosovo expressed their disappointment that rugova -lrb- photo -rrb- and others had not explicitly condemned the attacks on serbs . " to my great astonishment and disappointment , something was left out , namely the condemnation of the violence against the serbs , " said harri holkeri , who heads the united nations interim administration mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- . jaap de hoop scheffer , nato 's secretary general , also condemned the clashes during a visit to kosovo on monday .
" what happened last week , orchestrated and organized by extremist factions in the albanian community , is unacceptable , " he said . war began five years ago bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of ethnic albanians fled the province in 1999 .
five years ago , on march 24 , 1999 , nato began air raids on yugoslavia with the goal of preventing a catastrophe by forcing slobodan milosevic to end military and police actions against ethnic albanians in kosovo . almost 80 days after the bombing began , the yugoslav president finally gave in .
international peacekeeping troops arrived in kosovo , which was put under un control .
slowly , democratic institutions were set up .
last year , the governments in serbia and kosovo began to talk to each other again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic albanians waiting to vote in the 2001 elections .
a lot has happened since then : kosovo elected a new president and a parliament , a government was formed , and the province got its own judiciary and police force .
the second parliamentary elections are scheduled for the fall . the unclear future status of kosovo is the biggest problem for ethnic albanians .
after the war , the un adopted resolution 1244 , which only called for a " substantial autonomy for the people of kosovo " and put the province under international control .
that 's not enough for the albanians , who want complete independence from belgrade . but the " decent and appropriate treatment of smaller ethnic groups " is one democratic standard un officials have demanded before agreeing to discuss the province 's future status .
the first to do so was michael steiner , who headed unmik until last july . he defined eight criteria , including functioning governmental institutions , freedom of movement , a functioning economy , as well as a working judiciary and police force .
those who fled from kosovo in 1999 would have to be allowed back too . negotiations possible in 2005 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harri holkeri steiner 's successor , harri holkeri -lrb- photo -rrb- fine-tuned the standards last december .
if these standards can be reached by mid-2005 , the international community has promised negotiations about kosovo 's status . serbia 's government and the serbs in kosovo fear that these standards and the deadline have made independence inevitable .
albanians in kosovo , on the other hand , are happy that a date has been set .
" it 's a great achievement as un resolution 1244 did n't set a date , " kosovo 's premier bajram rexhepi said . to ensure peaceful coexistence between albanians and serbs , unmik 's current efforts do n't suffice , according to some . " we have to try harder to correct our past mistakes , " said faruk spahija , the mayor of mitrovica .
" it 's possible to create a climate of peace in kosovo .
a lot more has to be done to adhere to the standards kosovo has been presented with .

ballendorf in southwestern germany has made headlines across the country : election officials annulled the recent mayoral election there after the winner admitted buying beers for 21 of the 660 villagers . when ballendorfers went to the polls a few weeks ago , they narrowly chose andreas benz , a 45-year-old farmer , as their new mayor .
he got 17 more votes than his opponent , manfred schlumpberger , an electrician from neighboring heuchlingen .
-lrb- in germany , people do n't have to be residents of a town to run for office there . -rrb- the narrow outcome of the election caused county officials in nearby ulm to listen carefully , when an unnamed informant - not schlumpberger - told them what had happened during ballendorf 's election campaign .
after all , benz may have won the election because he paid for beer and gave money to a local group , as the informant had told officials . the mayor-elect readily confirmed and clarified the facts : over the course of two nights , he had bought 21 beers for people in ballendorf 's sports and singing clubs .
he had also given € 50 -lrb- $ 60 -rrb- to a youth group to repair the roof of their meeting place .
" that 's how it 's done , " he told dw-world . " this is crazy " calling it an illegal attempt to influence voters , the county 's election officials annulled the vote and the district attorney 's office announced it would investigate the case .
in the worst case scenario , benz could be punished with five years in prison for bribing voters . " this is crazy , " benz said , adding that neither he nor many other ballendorfers could understand the authorities .
" it 's not surprising that nothing works in this country any more .
do n't people have other things to worry about ? " ballendorfers will now have to choose a new mayor again , by september at the latest .
benz said he has n't decided whether he 's going to run for office again and added that he first has to digest what 's been happening .

five years after the war , kosovo remains troubled by ethnic tensions .
while albanians would like to become independent , serbs want more participation from belgrade to protect their rights . kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova on tuesday called for swift independence from serbia for the un-controlled province after last week 's violent clashes .
but un officials are demanding that democratic standards have to be introduced before that can happen . during last week 's bloodshed , 28 people were killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , were displaced from the homes .
nato has blamed extremist albanians for the violence and rugova promised a thorough investigation as well as actions to remedy the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova but un officials in kosovo expressed their disappointment that rugova -lrb- photo -rrb- and others had not explicitly condemned the attacks on serbs . " to my great astonishment and disappointment , something was left out , namely the condemnation of the violence against the serbs , " said harri holkeri , who heads the united nations interim administration mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- . jaap de hoop scheffer , nato 's secretary general , also condemned the clashes during a visit to kosovo on monday .

five years ago , on march 24 , 1999 , nato began air raids on yugoslavia with the goal of preventing a catastrophe by forcing slobodan milosevic to end military and police actions against ethnic albanians in kosovo . almost 80 days after the bombing began , the yugoslav president finally gave in .

that 's not enough for the albanians , who want complete independence from belgrade . but the " decent and appropriate treatment of smaller ethnic groups " is one democratic standard un officials have demanded before agreeing to discuss the province 's future status .
the first to do so was michael steiner , who headed unmik until last july . he defined eight criteria , including functioning governmental institutions , freedom of movement , a functioning economy , as well as a working judiciary and police force .

albanians in kosovo , on the other hand , are happy that a date has been set .
" it 's a great achievement as un resolution 1244 did n't set a date , " kosovo 's premier bajram rexhepi said . to ensure peaceful coexistence between albanians and serbs , unmik 's current efforts do n't suffice , according to some . " we have to try harder to correct our past mistakes , " said faruk spahija , the mayor of mitrovica .

five years after the war , kosovo remains troubled by ethnic tensions .
while albanians would like to become independent , serbs want more participation from belgrade to protect their rights . kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova on tuesday called for swift independence from serbia for the un-controlled province after last week 's violent clashes .
but un officials are demanding that democratic standards have to be introduced before that can happen . during last week 's bloodshed , 28 people were killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , were displaced from the homes .
nato has blamed extremist albanians for the violence and rugova promised a thorough investigation as well as actions to remedy the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova but un officials in kosovo expressed their disappointment that rugova -lrb- photo -rrb- and others had not explicitly condemned the attacks on serbs . " to my great astonishment and disappointment , something was left out , namely the condemnation of the violence against the serbs , " said harri holkeri , who heads the united nations interim administration mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- . jaap de hoop scheffer , nato 's secretary general , also condemned the clashes during a visit to kosovo on monday .
" what happened last week , orchestrated and organized by extremist factions in the albanian community , is unacceptable , " he said . war began five years ago bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of ethnic albanians fled the province in 1999 .
five years ago , on march 24 , 1999 , nato began air raids on yugoslavia with the goal of preventing a catastrophe by forcing slobodan milosevic to end military and police actions against ethnic albanians in kosovo . almost 80 days after the bombing began , the yugoslav president finally gave in .
international peacekeeping troops arrived in kosovo , which was put under un control .
slowly , democratic institutions were set up .
last year , the governments in serbia and kosovo began to talk to each other again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic albanians waiting to vote in the 2001 elections .
a lot has happened since then : kosovo elected a new president and a parliament , a government was formed , and the province got its own judiciary and police force .
the second parliamentary elections are scheduled for the fall . the unclear future status of kosovo is the biggest problem for ethnic albanians .
after the war , the un adopted resolution 1244 , which only called for a " substantial autonomy for the people of kosovo " and put the province under international control .
that 's not enough for the albanians , who want complete independence from belgrade . but the " decent and appropriate treatment of smaller ethnic groups " is one democratic standard un officials have demanded before agreeing to discuss the province 's future status .
the first to do so was michael steiner , who headed unmik until last july . he defined eight criteria , including functioning governmental institutions , freedom of movement , a functioning economy , as well as a working judiciary and police force .
those who fled from kosovo in 1999 would have to be allowed back too . negotiations possible in 2005 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harri holkeri steiner 's successor , harri holkeri -lrb- photo -rrb- fine-tuned the standards last december .

but while steeped in history , it has more to offer than just past glories . england 's prince charles signs his name in the city 's " golden book . "
queen silvia and her husband karl gustav of sweden wave from the balcony of the coburger town hall .
and king albert ii of belgium and his wife stroll through the town center . sounds a bit like the figment of a royals-obsessed imagination , or wishful thinking on the part of some paparazzi ?
on the contrary , it 's reality - coburg style .
after all , relatives do tend to come and visit .
using clever marriages as their vehicle , the dukes of saxe-coburg-gotha began to install their relatives on the thrones of europe 's royal houses at the end of the 18th century .
when all was said and done , coburg ruled half of the world .
europe 's stud farm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schloss ehrenburg " others may make war , but clever coburg marries ! " was for a long time the saying that summed up the duchy 's politics .
this " marital offensive " earned coburg the title " europe 's stud farm . "
thus , coburg 's royal house is tied to those of sweden , norway , belgium , spain and england .
with so much blue blood around , it 's no wonder that the town has a " touch of buckingham " to it .
coburg is one of several historic towns in franconia , a predominantly rural part of bavaria that was politically important in the days of the holy roman empire .
neighboring and perhaps better known towns include bayreuth , bamberg and nuremberg .
starting in the mid 16th century , the dukes of saxe-coburg-gotha lived in the ehrenburg castle , in the city of coburg itself .
once purely done in the renaissance style , the building was overwhelmingly rebuilt in a neo-gothic style in the 19th century , following a fire .
a toilet for the queen the interior of schloss ehrenburg , however , is done in an elegant french empire style .
despite its high-toned beauty , its most interesting attribute is probably the flush toilet .
it was the first ever installed in germany , rigged up in time for a visit from queen victoria in 1860 .
probably the most impressive sight in the town is the veste coburg , a fortress on a hill that was once considered impervious to capture .
today , however , the fortress is regularly stormed - by tourists .
it is one of the biggest , most beautiful medieval castles in germany , and from afar , its towers , battlements and ramparts look like a crown over the roofs of the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin luther many famous people have spent time not only in the schloss ehrenburg , but in the fortress .
one of these was the church reformer martin luther .
a nun 's figurine for a period of nearly a half a century , coburg seemed to be far off the beaten path , snug up against the border of east germany .
but today , the city lies in the geographic middle of the country .
with this change has come a boost in the city 's economy .
young businesses are settling here , side by side with the area 's traditional artisans : breweries , wooden-puppet makers , basket makers , and one very , very well known porcelain manufacturer .
indeed , one of coburg 's greatest claims to fame is the world-famous collectible hummel figures . these were first created by berta hummel , an art student born in 1909 .
following her studies , she entered a cloister and taught drawing at a school .
the motif of her drawings became the daily life of children .
starting in 1935 , the hummel children were turned into porcelain figures .
unfortunately , the ordained nun did n't get to experience the meteoric success of her figures for long .
she died in 1946 .
today , there are more than 300,000 collectors in hummel figure clubs , and hummel figurines continue to be an important export object from coburg . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de herzogenaurach : more than adidas and puma the northern bavarian town of herzogenaurach is probably best known as the headquarter of sports brands adidas and puma , but there 's much more to explore .

using clever marriages as their vehicle , the dukes of saxe-coburg-gotha began to install their relatives on the thrones of europe 's royal houses at the end of the 18th century .
when all was said and done , coburg ruled half of the world .
europe 's stud farm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schloss ehrenburg " others may make war , but clever coburg marries ! " was for a long time the saying that summed up the duchy 's politics .
this " marital offensive " earned coburg the title " europe 's stud farm . "
thus , coburg 's royal house is tied to those of sweden , norway , belgium , spain and england .
with so much blue blood around , it 's no wonder that the town has a " touch of buckingham " to it .
coburg is one of several historic towns in franconia , a predominantly rural part of bavaria that was politically important in the days of the holy roman empire .
neighboring and perhaps better known towns include bayreuth , bamberg and nuremberg .
starting in the mid 16th century , the dukes of saxe-coburg-gotha lived in the ehrenburg castle , in the city of coburg itself .
once purely done in the renaissance style , the building was overwhelmingly rebuilt in a neo-gothic style in the 19th century , following a fire .
a toilet for the queen the interior of schloss ehrenburg , however , is done in an elegant french empire style .
despite its high-toned beauty , its most interesting attribute is probably the flush toilet .
it was the first ever installed in germany , rigged up in time for a visit from queen victoria in 1860 .
probably the most impressive sight in the town is the veste coburg , a fortress on a hill that was once considered impervious to capture .
today , however , the fortress is regularly stormed - by tourists .
it is one of the biggest , most beautiful medieval castles in germany , and from afar , its towers , battlements and ramparts look like a crown over the roofs of the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin luther many famous people have spent time not only in the schloss ehrenburg , but in the fortress .
one of these was the church reformer martin luther .
a nun 's figurine for a period of nearly a half a century , coburg seemed to be far off the beaten path , snug up against the border of east germany .
but today , the city lies in the geographic middle of the country .
with this change has come a boost in the city 's economy .
young businesses are settling here , side by side with the area 's traditional artisans : breweries , wooden-puppet makers , basket makers , and one very , very well known porcelain manufacturer .
indeed , one of coburg 's greatest claims to fame is the world-famous collectible hummel figures . these were first created by berta hummel , an art student born in 1909 .
following her studies , she entered a cloister and taught drawing at a school .
the motif of her drawings became the daily life of children .
starting in 1935 , the hummel children were turned into porcelain figures .
unfortunately , the ordained nun did n't get to experience the meteoric success of her figures for long .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.03.2004 debating kosovo 's future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the recent violence hurt calls for independence ?
five years after the war , kosovo remains troubled by ethnic tensions .
while albanians would like to become independent , serbs want more participation from belgrade to protect their rights . kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova on tuesday called for swift independence from serbia for the un-controlled province after last week 's violent clashes .
but un officials are demanding that democratic standards have to be introduced before that can happen . during last week 's bloodshed , 28 people were killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , were displaced from the homes .
nato has blamed extremist albanians for the violence and rugova promised a thorough investigation as well as actions to remedy the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova but un officials in kosovo expressed their disappointment that rugova -lrb- photo -rrb- and others had not explicitly condemned the attacks on serbs . " to my great astonishment and disappointment , something was left out , namely the condemnation of the violence against the serbs , " said harri holkeri , who heads the united nations interim administration mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- . jaap de hoop scheffer , nato 's secretary general , also condemned the clashes during a visit to kosovo on monday .
" what happened last week , orchestrated and organized by extremist factions in the albanian community , is unacceptable , " he said . war began five years ago bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of ethnic albanians fled the province in 1999 .
five years ago , on march 24 , 1999 , nato began air raids on yugoslavia with the goal of preventing a catastrophe by forcing slobodan milosevic to end military and police actions against ethnic albanians in kosovo . almost 80 days after the bombing began , the yugoslav president finally gave in .
international peacekeeping troops arrived in kosovo , which was put under un control .
slowly , democratic institutions were set up .
last year , the governments in serbia and kosovo began to talk to each other again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic albanians waiting to vote in the 2001 elections .
a lot has happened since then : kosovo elected a new president and a parliament , a government was formed , and the province got its own judiciary and police force .
the second parliamentary elections are scheduled for the fall . the unclear future status of kosovo is the biggest problem for ethnic albanians .
after the war , the un adopted resolution 1244 , which only called for a " substantial autonomy for the people of kosovo " and put the province under international control .
that 's not enough for the albanians , who want complete independence from belgrade . but the " decent and appropriate treatment of smaller ethnic groups " is one democratic standard un officials have demanded before agreeing to discuss the province 's future status .
the first to do so was michael steiner , who headed unmik until last july . he defined eight criteria , including functioning governmental institutions , freedom of movement , a functioning economy , as well as a working judiciary and police force .
those who fled from kosovo in 1999 would have to be allowed back too . negotiations possible in 2005 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harri holkeri steiner 's successor , harri holkeri -lrb- photo -rrb- fine-tuned the standards last december .
if these standards can be reached by mid-2005 , the international community has promised negotiations about kosovo 's status . serbia 's government and the serbs in kosovo fear that these standards and the deadline have made independence inevitable .
albanians in kosovo , on the other hand , are happy that a date has been set .
" it 's a great achievement as un resolution 1244 did n't set a date , " kosovo 's premier bajram rexhepi said . to ensure peaceful coexistence between albanians and serbs , unmik 's current efforts do n't suffice , according to some . " we have to try harder to correct our past mistakes , " said faruk spahija , the mayor of mitrovica .
" it 's possible to create a climate of peace in kosovo .
a lot more has to be done to adhere to the standards kosovo has been presented with .

five years after the war , kosovo remains troubled by ethnic tensions .
while albanians would like to become independent , serbs want more participation from belgrade to protect their rights . kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova on tuesday called for swift independence from serbia for the un-controlled province after last week 's violent clashes .
but un officials are demanding that democratic standards have to be introduced before that can happen . during last week 's bloodshed , 28 people were killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , were displaced from the homes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : microsoft takes on eu microsoft pays record fine into eu coffers microsoft appeals eu anti-trust ruling microsoft gets reprieve from eu commission microsoft 's long road to brussels business -pipe- 24.03.2004 microsoft slapped with biggest fine in eu history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft founder bill gates the european union on wednesday levied the largest fine against any company in the bloc 's history , ruling that microsoft must pay a half billion euros for abusing its " near monopoly " status . the european union on wednesday fined microsoft € 497.2 million -lrb- $ 611 million -rrb- for abusing its " near monopoly " with its windows operating system to crush competitors and gain the upper hand in markets for digital media players and low-end servers .
" dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business does n't prevent competition ... and does not harm consumers and innovation , " eu competition commissioner mario monti said .
" today 's decision restores the conditions for fair competition in the markets concerned and establishes clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position . "
illegal behavior citing " illegal behavior " that is " ongoing , " the eu antitrust authority is calling for microsoft to implement a number of remedies .
the company has been ordered to offer a version of windows without its digital media player in three months and to release the " complete and accurate " interface code to rival companies in the server market within four month .
the commission said the release of the code , a demand heatedly contested by microsoft , was necessary in order for server products created by competing companies to have " full interoperability " with computers running windows .
the commission said it would appoint a monitoring trustee " to ensure effective and timely compliance . "
the ruling is the highest ever penalty imposed by the eu 's executive branch against a single company for violating competition regulations .
microsoft , the world 's biggest software firm , has denied it abuses the overwhelming dominance of its windows operating system to illegally crush competitors .
it said eu regulators were unjustified in proposing such a large fine .
" we worked hard to reach an agreement that would address the european commission 's concerns and still allow us to innovate and improve our products for consumers , " said steve ballmer , chief executive officer of microsoft .
" we respect the commission 's authority , but we believe that our settlement offer from last week would have offered far more choices and benefits to consumers . "
the company said it would file an appeal with the eu 's court of first instance in luxembourg .
painful remedies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commissioner for competition mario monti but chief executive steve ballmer is less worried about the financial penalties , which will probably not cause too much pain for the seattle-based company given its cash reserves of some $ 53 billion .
it 's more the list of " remedies " the eu competition authorities have handed down that is cause for concern for the company , which has sought to expand its operating system to incorporate almost all facets of the internet .
monti has said he fears that if unchecked , microsoft would continue to exploit its monopoly when it launches its windows successor , longhorn , which combines built-in search engine capabilities and 3-d graphics to compete with internet companies like google and yahoo .
but ballmer , who is currently in brussels , rejects such demands , saying it limits microsoft 's ability to develop new products and integrate them into the operating system in the future .
according to the company spokesman , the eu regulations serve only as a " stumbling block to the company 's capacity to innovate . "
monti , whose five-year term as competition commissioner ends in october , is not flinching on what is without a doubt the commission 's biggest anti-trust case .
despite hefty criticism that the verdict will do nothing for competition and everything to block innovation , the guardian of fair trade practices said ahead of wednesday 's decision : " it is essential to have a clear principle for the future conduct of a company which has such a strong dominant position in the market . "
a history of investigations this was n't the first time microsoft found itself under the watchful gaze of anti-trust investigators .
in a spectacular anti-trust case in the united states , the government threatened to split microsoft up into different companies at the turn of the century .
the company 's operating system can be found in 95 percent of the desktop computers worldwide , and u.s. courts determined that microsoft had repeatedly abused its monopoly status .
but after then-president bill clinton left office , microsoft cut a deal with the justice department and several states , effectively resolving the anti-trust case .
however , the european commission continued to follow up complaints from microsoft competitors filed five years ago .
sun microsystems , for example , charged that microsoft had integrated applications like the internet explorer web browser and digital media programs into its operating system in a way that largely banished any competition for the applications .
the commission later held that microsoft had violated competition laws and sought to negotiate a settlement with the redmond , washington-based company .
but talks failed earlier this week , setting the scene for the ruling .
fear of lawsuits micrsoft initially sought to avoid formal punishment from the european commission because , it feared , it could be used as a precedent for costly lawsuits against the company in other countries including the u.s. both microsoft and the commission agreed that the company had abused its monopoly status .
microsoft even agreed to decouple its internet explorer and windows xp software .
but that proposal did n't go far enough for monti .
" we made substantial progress towards resolving the problems but were unable to agree on commitments for future conduct , " monti said earlier this week . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de microsoft 's long road to brussels this week 's ruling should come as no surprise to microsoft .
already in 2001 the european commission began gathering evidence against the u.s. software giant .
back then it looked like a quick resolution was in sight .
-lrb- march 23 , 2004 -rrb- the highest corporate fines in eu history more than a dozen companies have been fined € 50 million or more by the european commission for anti-competitive practices including abuses of monopoly status and price fixing .

" dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business does n't prevent competition ... and does not harm consumers and innovation , " eu competition commissioner mario monti said .
" today 's decision restores the conditions for fair competition in the markets concerned and establishes clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position . "
illegal behavior citing " illegal behavior " that is " ongoing , " the eu antitrust authority is calling for microsoft to implement a number of remedies .
the company has been ordered to offer a version of windows without its digital media player in three months and to release the " complete and accurate " interface code to rival companies in the server market within four month .
the commission said the release of the code , a demand heatedly contested by microsoft , was necessary in order for server products created by competing companies to have " full interoperability " with computers running windows .
the commission said it would appoint a monitoring trustee " to ensure effective and timely compliance . "
the ruling is the highest ever penalty imposed by the eu 's executive branch against a single company for violating competition regulations .
microsoft , the world 's biggest software firm , has denied it abuses the overwhelming dominance of its windows operating system to illegally crush competitors .
it said eu regulators were unjustified in proposing such a large fine .
" we worked hard to reach an agreement that would address the european commission 's concerns and still allow us to innovate and improve our products for consumers , " said steve ballmer , chief executive officer of microsoft .
" we respect the commission 's authority , but we believe that our settlement offer from last week would have offered far more choices and benefits to consumers . "
the company said it would file an appeal with the eu 's court of first instance in luxembourg .
painful remedies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commissioner for competition mario monti but chief executive steve ballmer is less worried about the financial penalties , which will probably not cause too much pain for the seattle-based company given its cash reserves of some $ 53 billion .
it 's more the list of " remedies " the eu competition authorities have handed down that is cause for concern for the company , which has sought to expand its operating system to incorporate almost all facets of the internet .
monti has said he fears that if unchecked , microsoft would continue to exploit its monopoly when it launches its windows successor , longhorn , which combines built-in search engine capabilities and 3-d graphics to compete with internet companies like google and yahoo .
but ballmer , who is currently in brussels , rejects such demands , saying it limits microsoft 's ability to develop new products and integrate them into the operating system in the future .
according to the company spokesman , the eu regulations serve only as a " stumbling block to the company 's capacity to innovate . "
monti , whose five-year term as competition commissioner ends in october , is not flinching on what is without a doubt the commission 's biggest anti-trust case .
despite hefty criticism that the verdict will do nothing for competition and everything to block innovation , the guardian of fair trade practices said ahead of wednesday 's decision : " it is essential to have a clear principle for the future conduct of a company which has such a strong dominant position in the market . "
a history of investigations this was n't the first time microsoft found itself under the watchful gaze of anti-trust investigators .
in a spectacular anti-trust case in the united states , the government threatened to split microsoft up into different companies at the turn of the century .
the company 's operating system can be found in 95 percent of the desktop computers worldwide , and u.s. courts determined that microsoft had repeatedly abused its monopoly status .
but after then-president bill clinton left office , microsoft cut a deal with the justice department and several states , effectively resolving the anti-trust case .
however , the european commission continued to follow up complaints from microsoft competitors filed five years ago .
sun microsystems , for example , charged that microsoft had integrated applications like the internet explorer web browser and digital media programs into its operating system in a way that largely banished any competition for the applications .
the commission later held that microsoft had violated competition laws and sought to negotiate a settlement with the redmond , washington-based company .
but talks failed earlier this week , setting the scene for the ruling .
fear of lawsuits micrsoft initially sought to avoid formal punishment from the european commission because , it feared , it could be used as a precedent for costly lawsuits against the company in other countries including the u.s. both microsoft and the commission agreed that the company had abused its monopoly status .
microsoft even agreed to decouple its internet explorer and windows xp software .
but that proposal did n't go far enough for monti .
" we made substantial progress towards resolving the problems but were unable to agree on commitments for future conduct , " monti said earlier this week . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de microsoft 's long road to brussels this week 's ruling should come as no surprise to microsoft .
already in 2001 the european commission began gathering evidence against the u.s. software giant .
back then it looked like a quick resolution was in sight .

" dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business does n't prevent competition ... and does not harm consumers and innovation , " eu competition commissioner mario monti said .
" today 's decision restores the conditions for fair competition in the markets concerned and establishes clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position . "
illegal behavior citing " illegal behavior " that is " ongoing , " the eu antitrust authority is calling for microsoft to implement a number of remedies .
the company has been ordered to offer a version of windows without its digital media player in three months and to release the " complete and accurate " interface code to rival companies in the server market within four month .
the commission said the release of the code , a demand heatedly contested by microsoft , was necessary in order for server products created by competing companies to have " full interoperability " with computers running windows .
the commission said it would appoint a monitoring trustee " to ensure effective and timely compliance . "
the ruling is the highest ever penalty imposed by the eu 's executive branch against a single company for violating competition regulations .
microsoft , the world 's biggest software firm , has denied it abuses the overwhelming dominance of its windows operating system to illegally crush competitors .
it said eu regulators were unjustified in proposing such a large fine .
" we worked hard to reach an agreement that would address the european commission 's concerns and still allow us to innovate and improve our products for consumers , " said steve ballmer , chief executive officer of microsoft .
" we respect the commission 's authority , but we believe that our settlement offer from last week would have offered far more choices and benefits to consumers . "
the company said it would file an appeal with the eu 's court of first instance in luxembourg .
painful remedies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commissioner for competition mario monti but chief executive steve ballmer is less worried about the financial penalties , which will probably not cause too much pain for the seattle-based company given its cash reserves of some $ 53 billion .
it 's more the list of " remedies " the eu competition authorities have handed down that is cause for concern for the company , which has sought to expand its operating system to incorporate almost all facets of the internet .
monti has said he fears that if unchecked , microsoft would continue to exploit its monopoly when it launches its windows successor , longhorn , which combines built-in search engine capabilities and 3-d graphics to compete with internet companies like google and yahoo .
but ballmer , who is currently in brussels , rejects such demands , saying it limits microsoft 's ability to develop new products and integrate them into the operating system in the future .
according to the company spokesman , the eu regulations serve only as a " stumbling block to the company 's capacity to innovate . "
monti , whose five-year term as competition commissioner ends in october , is not flinching on what is without a doubt the commission 's biggest anti-trust case .
despite hefty criticism that the verdict will do nothing for competition and everything to block innovation , the guardian of fair trade practices said ahead of wednesday 's decision : " it is essential to have a clear principle for the future conduct of a company which has such a strong dominant position in the market . "
a history of investigations this was n't the first time microsoft found itself under the watchful gaze of anti-trust investigators .
in a spectacular anti-trust case in the united states , the government threatened to split microsoft up into different companies at the turn of the century .
the company 's operating system can be found in 95 percent of the desktop computers worldwide , and u.s. courts determined that microsoft had repeatedly abused its monopoly status .
but after then-president bill clinton left office , microsoft cut a deal with the justice department and several states , effectively resolving the anti-trust case .
however , the european commission continued to follow up complaints from microsoft competitors filed five years ago .
sun microsystems , for example , charged that microsoft had integrated applications like the internet explorer web browser and digital media programs into its operating system in a way that largely banished any competition for the applications .
the commission later held that microsoft had violated competition laws and sought to negotiate a settlement with the redmond , washington-based company .
but talks failed earlier this week , setting the scene for the ruling .
fear of lawsuits micrsoft initially sought to avoid formal punishment from the european commission because , it feared , it could be used as a precedent for costly lawsuits against the company in other countries including the u.s. both microsoft and the commission agreed that the company had abused its monopoly status .
microsoft even agreed to decouple its internet explorer and windows xp software .
but that proposal did n't go far enough for monti .
" we made substantial progress towards resolving the problems but were unable to agree on commitments for future conduct , " monti said earlier this week . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de microsoft 's long road to brussels this week 's ruling should come as no surprise to microsoft .
already in 2001 the european commission began gathering evidence against the u.s. software giant .
back then it looked like a quick resolution was in sight .

five years ago , nato began air raids on yugoslavia to stop violence in kosovo .
it was an important and controversial event for german foreign policy : for the first time since 1945 , german soldiers participated in combat . kosovo was n't the first postwar foreign mission for the bundeswehr , as the german military is called .
german soldiers had participated in un missions since the early 1990s , mainly offering humanitarian assistance . however , the use of military force abroad in kosovo helped redefine german foreign policy in a way that continues today .
germany 's leading role in the stabilization of afghanistan and deployment of naval power off the coast of africa to combat international terrorism are the best examples of how things have changed . only a decade ago , those missions would have been unthinkable . in 1994 , social democrats , who were in opposition at the time , and some free democrats , who formed part of the governing coalition , filed a complaint with the constitutional court against foreign missions by the bundeswehr .
helmut kohl , germany 's christian democratic chancellor at the time , and his cabinet of ministers had approved the missions without the parliament 's consent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers the plaintiffs asked the court to clarify the legislature 's rights in deciding about military missions .
they also wanted to know whether the constitution allowed german soldiers to participate in such actions at all , as the bundeswehr 's scope of activities had been limited to defending germany so far . clearing the way for germany 's participation in military strikes , the country 's highest judges ruled that such an involvement was constitutional as long as a un or nato mandate existed . warming up to military action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers in bosnia the bundeswehr went to the balkans , where german soldiers became part of nato 's ifor operation in bosnia from 1995 to 1996 .
the mission gave the bundeswehr a chance to get experience in conflict resolution , according to hans frank , a former vice admiral who now heads the federal college for security policy studies in berlin . " we participated in stabilization efforts after military action , but never in the action itself , " frank said .
" kosovo showed that sometimes the use of force is necessary to squelch a developing conflict and return to stability . " using military force was the point in question .
until that time , german soldiers abroad had only used their weapons for self-defense .
now nato decided to bomb yugoslavia to end the atrocities that state forces were committing against ethnic albanians in kosovo .
the german parliament voted in favor of bundeswehr participation in october 1998 , and the bombing began on march 24 , 1999 , exactly five years ago . a first for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder standing in front of a eurofighter jet .
germany was n't waging a war but had been called upon to secure peace in kosovo with military force , german chancellor gerhard schröder explained to the nation in a television speech . by doing so , he articulated a new and important basis of german foreign policy : the deployment of force and - german - soldiers can be a last resort to resolve a crisis . at the same time , the federal government turned reunified germany into an equal and serious nato partner .
fourteen bundeswehr tornado fighters took off on 500 missions - mostly for reconnaissance purposes but also against yugoslav anti-aircraft stations . it was a decisive and completely novel step for the bundeswehr , which has to be seen in the context of its history , frank said . " but first and foremost it was a political decision , and a very important one , " he said .
" no government of the federal republic had been asked to make that decision to enter a war so far . " even after nato air raids began , all parties , except the post-communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , supported germany 's participation in the war .
seven of 47 green parliamentarians called for an immediate end to the mission , but the party leadership surrounding foreign minister joschka fischer backed the decision . after the war , the bundeswehr almost immediately went from taking military action to trying to stabilize the situation ; the un 's kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- peacekeepers took over once nato had ended the bombardments on june 10 , 1999 . shortly after , klaus reinhardt became the first german general to lead a nato mission outside the alliance 's territory .
today , the bundeswehr , which is sending an additional 600 troops to kosovo after last week 's violent clashes , remains one of the biggest forces within kfor . nina werkhäuser -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder rules out peacekeepers as iraqis ok constitution the iraqi governing council agreed on an interim constitution on monday which could pave the way to a return of sovereignty .

five years after the war , kosovo remains troubled by ethnic tensions .
while albanians would like to become independent , serbs want more participation from belgrade to protect their rights . kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova on tuesday called for swift independence from serbia for the un-controlled province after last week 's violent clashes .
but un officials are demanding that democratic standards have to be introduced before that can happen . during last week 's bloodshed , 28 people were killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , were displaced from the homes .
nato has blamed extremist albanians for the violence and rugova promised a thorough investigation as well as actions to remedy the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova but un officials in kosovo expressed their disappointment that rugova -lrb- photo -rrb- and others had not explicitly condemned the attacks on serbs . " to my great astonishment and disappointment , something was left out , namely the condemnation of the violence against the serbs , " said harri holkeri , who heads the united nations interim administration mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- . jaap de hoop scheffer , nato 's secretary general , also condemned the clashes during a visit to kosovo on monday .
" what happened last week , orchestrated and organized by extremist factions in the albanian community , is unacceptable , " he said . war began five years ago bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of ethnic albanians fled the province in 1999 .
five years ago , on march 24 , 1999 , nato began air raids on yugoslavia with the goal of preventing a catastrophe by forcing slobodan milosevic to end military and police actions against ethnic albanians in kosovo . almost 80 days after the bombing began , the yugoslav president finally gave in .
international peacekeeping troops arrived in kosovo , which was put under un control .
slowly , democratic institutions were set up .
last year , the governments in serbia and kosovo began to talk to each other again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic albanians waiting to vote in the 2001 elections .
a lot has happened since then : kosovo elected a new president and a parliament , a government was formed , and the province got its own judiciary and police force .
the second parliamentary elections are scheduled for the fall . the unclear future status of kosovo is the biggest problem for ethnic albanians .
after the war , the un adopted resolution 1244 , which only called for a " substantial autonomy for the people of kosovo " and put the province under international control .
that 's not enough for the albanians , who want complete independence from belgrade . but the " decent and appropriate treatment of smaller ethnic groups " is one democratic standard un officials have demanded before agreeing to discuss the province 's future status .
the first to do so was michael steiner , who headed unmik until last july . he defined eight criteria , including functioning governmental institutions , freedom of movement , a functioning economy , as well as a working judiciary and police force .
those who fled from kosovo in 1999 would have to be allowed back too . negotiations possible in 2005 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harri holkeri steiner 's successor , harri holkeri -lrb- photo -rrb- fine-tuned the standards last december .
if these standards can be reached by mid-2005 , the international community has promised negotiations about kosovo 's status . serbia 's government and the serbs in kosovo fear that these standards and the deadline have made independence inevitable .
albanians in kosovo , on the other hand , are happy that a date has been set .
" it 's a great achievement as un resolution 1244 did n't set a date , " kosovo 's premier bajram rexhepi said . to ensure peaceful coexistence between albanians and serbs , unmik 's current efforts do n't suffice , according to some . " we have to try harder to correct our past mistakes , " said faruk spahija , the mayor of mitrovica .
" it 's possible to create a climate of peace in kosovo .
a lot more has to be done to adhere to the standards kosovo has been presented with .

they also wanted to know whether the constitution allowed german soldiers to participate in such actions at all , as the bundeswehr 's scope of activities had been limited to defending germany so far . clearing the way for germany 's participation in military strikes , the country 's highest judges ruled that such an involvement was constitutional as long as a un or nato mandate existed . warming up to military action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers in bosnia the bundeswehr went to the balkans , where german soldiers became part of nato 's ifor operation in bosnia from 1995 to 1996 .
the mission gave the bundeswehr a chance to get experience in conflict resolution , according to hans frank , a former vice admiral who now heads the federal college for security policy studies in berlin . " we participated in stabilization efforts after military action , but never in the action itself , " frank said .
" kosovo showed that sometimes the use of force is necessary to squelch a developing conflict and return to stability . " using military force was the point in question .
until that time , german soldiers abroad had only used their weapons for self-defense .
now nato decided to bomb yugoslavia to end the atrocities that state forces were committing against ethnic albanians in kosovo .
the german parliament voted in favor of bundeswehr participation in october 1998 , and the bombing began on march 24 , 1999 , exactly five years ago . a first for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder standing in front of a eurofighter jet .
germany was n't waging a war but had been called upon to secure peace in kosovo with military force , german chancellor gerhard schröder explained to the nation in a television speech . by doing so , he articulated a new and important basis of german foreign policy : the deployment of force and - german - soldiers can be a last resort to resolve a crisis . at the same time , the federal government turned reunified germany into an equal and serious nato partner .
fourteen bundeswehr tornado fighters took off on 500 missions - mostly for reconnaissance purposes but also against yugoslav anti-aircraft stations . it was a decisive and completely novel step for the bundeswehr , which has to be seen in the context of its history , frank said . " but first and foremost it was a political decision , and a very important one , " he said .
" no government of the federal republic had been asked to make that decision to enter a war so far . " even after nato air raids began , all parties , except the post-communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , supported germany 's participation in the war .
seven of 47 green parliamentarians called for an immediate end to the mission , but the party leadership surrounding foreign minister joschka fischer backed the decision . after the war , the bundeswehr almost immediately went from taking military action to trying to stabilize the situation ; the un 's kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- peacekeepers took over once nato had ended the bombardments on june 10 , 1999 . shortly after , klaus reinhardt became the first german general to lead a nato mission outside the alliance 's territory .
today , the bundeswehr , which is sending an additional 600 troops to kosovo after last week 's violent clashes , remains one of the biggest forces within kfor . nina werkhäuser -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder rules out peacekeepers as iraqis ok constitution the iraqi governing council agreed on an interim constitution on monday which could pave the way to a return of sovereignty .
meanwhile , gerhard schröder again ruled out any german involvement in peacekeeping in iraq .
-lrb- march 1 , 2004 -rrb- why germany voted ' yes ' to invade yugoslavia but ' no ' to iraq chancellor gerhard schröder has ruled out german military participation in an iraq war .
but four years ago the bundeswehr took part in nato air strikes on yugoslavia without a u.n. mandate .
so why then and not now ?

" dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business does n't prevent competition ... and does not harm consumers and innovation , " eu competition commissioner mario monti said .
" today 's decision restores the conditions for fair competition in the markets concerned and establishes clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position . "

the company has been ordered to offer a version of windows without its digital media player in three months and to release the " complete and accurate " interface code to rival companies in the server market within four month .
the commission said the release of the code , a demand heatedly contested by microsoft , was necessary in order for server products created by competing companies to have " full interoperability " with computers running windows .
the commission said it would appoint a monitoring trustee " to ensure effective and timely compliance . "
the ruling is the highest ever penalty imposed by the eu 's executive branch against a single company for violating competition regulations .
microsoft , the world 's biggest software firm , has denied it abuses the overwhelming dominance of its windows operating system to illegally crush competitors .
it said eu regulators were unjustified in proposing such a large fine .
" we worked hard to reach an agreement that would address the european commission 's concerns and still allow us to innovate and improve our products for consumers , " said steve ballmer , chief executive officer of microsoft .
" we respect the commission 's authority , but we believe that our settlement offer from last week would have offered far more choices and benefits to consumers . "

but ballmer , who is currently in brussels , rejects such demands , saying it limits microsoft 's ability to develop new products and integrate them into the operating system in the future .
according to the company spokesman , the eu regulations serve only as a " stumbling block to the company 's capacity to innovate . "
monti , whose five-year term as competition commissioner ends in october , is not flinching on what is without a doubt the commission 's biggest anti-trust case .

but after then-president bill clinton left office , microsoft cut a deal with the justice department and several states , effectively resolving the anti-trust case .
however , the european commission continued to follow up complaints from microsoft competitors filed five years ago .
sun microsystems , for example , charged that microsoft had integrated applications like the internet explorer web browser and digital media programs into its operating system in a way that largely banished any competition for the applications .

painful remedies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commissioner for competition mario monti but chief executive steve ballmer is less worried about the financial penalties , which will probably not cause too much pain for the seattle-based company given its cash reserves of some $ 53 billion .
it 's more the list of " remedies " the eu competition authorities have handed down that is cause for concern for the company , which has sought to expand its operating system to incorporate almost all facets of the internet .
monti has said he fears that if unchecked , microsoft would continue to exploit its monopoly when it launches its windows successor , longhorn , which combines built-in search engine capabilities and 3-d graphics to compete with internet companies like google and yahoo .
but ballmer , who is currently in brussels , rejects such demands , saying it limits microsoft 's ability to develop new products and integrate them into the operating system in the future .
according to the company spokesman , the eu regulations serve only as a " stumbling block to the company 's capacity to innovate . "
monti , whose five-year term as competition commissioner ends in october , is not flinching on what is without a doubt the commission 's biggest anti-trust case .
despite hefty criticism that the verdict will do nothing for competition and everything to block innovation , the guardian of fair trade practices said ahead of wednesday 's decision : " it is essential to have a clear principle for the future conduct of a company which has such a strong dominant position in the market . "
a history of investigations this was n't the first time microsoft found itself under the watchful gaze of anti-trust investigators .
in a spectacular anti-trust case in the united states , the government threatened to split microsoft up into different companies at the turn of the century .
the company 's operating system can be found in 95 percent of the desktop computers worldwide , and u.s. courts determined that microsoft had repeatedly abused its monopoly status .
but after then-president bill clinton left office , microsoft cut a deal with the justice department and several states , effectively resolving the anti-trust case .
however , the european commission continued to follow up complaints from microsoft competitors filed five years ago .
sun microsystems , for example , charged that microsoft had integrated applications like the internet explorer web browser and digital media programs into its operating system in a way that largely banished any competition for the applications .
the commission later held that microsoft had violated competition laws and sought to negotiate a settlement with the redmond , washington-based company .
but talks failed earlier this week , setting the scene for the ruling .
fear of lawsuits micrsoft initially sought to avoid formal punishment from the european commission because , it feared , it could be used as a precedent for costly lawsuits against the company in other countries including the u.s. both microsoft and the commission agreed that the company had abused its monopoly status .
microsoft even agreed to decouple its internet explorer and windows xp software .
but that proposal did n't go far enough for monti .
" we made substantial progress towards resolving the problems but were unable to agree on commitments for future conduct , " monti said earlier this week . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de microsoft 's long road to brussels this week 's ruling should come as no surprise to microsoft .
already in 2001 the european commission began gathering evidence against the u.s. software giant .
back then it looked like a quick resolution was in sight .

five years after the war , kosovo remains troubled by ethnic tensions .
while albanians would like to become independent , serbs want more participation from belgrade to protect their rights . kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova on tuesday called for swift independence from serbia for the un-controlled province after last week 's violent clashes .
but un officials are demanding that democratic standards have to be introduced before that can happen . during last week 's bloodshed , 28 people were killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , were displaced from the homes .
nato has blamed extremist albanians for the violence and rugova promised a thorough investigation as well as actions to remedy the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova but un officials in kosovo expressed their disappointment that rugova -lrb- photo -rrb- and others had not explicitly condemned the attacks on serbs . " to my great astonishment and disappointment , something was left out , namely the condemnation of the violence against the serbs , " said harri holkeri , who heads the united nations interim administration mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- . jaap de hoop scheffer , nato 's secretary general , also condemned the clashes during a visit to kosovo on monday .
" what happened last week , orchestrated and organized by extremist factions in the albanian community , is unacceptable , " he said . war began five years ago bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of ethnic albanians fled the province in 1999 .
five years ago , on march 24 , 1999 , nato began air raids on yugoslavia with the goal of preventing a catastrophe by forcing slobodan milosevic to end military and police actions against ethnic albanians in kosovo . almost 80 days after the bombing began , the yugoslav president finally gave in .
international peacekeeping troops arrived in kosovo , which was put under un control .
slowly , democratic institutions were set up .
last year , the governments in serbia and kosovo began to talk to each other again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic albanians waiting to vote in the 2001 elections .
a lot has happened since then : kosovo elected a new president and a parliament , a government was formed , and the province got its own judiciary and police force .
the second parliamentary elections are scheduled for the fall . the unclear future status of kosovo is the biggest problem for ethnic albanians .
after the war , the un adopted resolution 1244 , which only called for a " substantial autonomy for the people of kosovo " and put the province under international control .
that 's not enough for the albanians , who want complete independence from belgrade . but the " decent and appropriate treatment of smaller ethnic groups " is one democratic standard un officials have demanded before agreeing to discuss the province 's future status .
the first to do so was michael steiner , who headed unmik until last july . he defined eight criteria , including functioning governmental institutions , freedom of movement , a functioning economy , as well as a working judiciary and police force .
those who fled from kosovo in 1999 would have to be allowed back too . negotiations possible in 2005 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harri holkeri steiner 's successor , harri holkeri -lrb- photo -rrb- fine-tuned the standards last december .
if these standards can be reached by mid-2005 , the international community has promised negotiations about kosovo 's status . serbia 's government and the serbs in kosovo fear that these standards and the deadline have made independence inevitable .
albanians in kosovo , on the other hand , are happy that a date has been set .
" it 's a great achievement as un resolution 1244 did n't set a date , " kosovo 's premier bajram rexhepi said . to ensure peaceful coexistence between albanians and serbs , unmik 's current efforts do n't suffice , according to some . " we have to try harder to correct our past mistakes , " said faruk spahija , the mayor of mitrovica .
" it 's possible to create a climate of peace in kosovo .
a lot more has to be done to adhere to the standards kosovo has been presented with .

five years after the war , kosovo remains troubled by ethnic tensions .
while albanians would like to become independent , serbs want more participation from belgrade to protect their rights . kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova on tuesday called for swift independence from serbia for the un-controlled province after last week 's violent clashes .
but un officials are demanding that democratic standards have to be introduced before that can happen . during last week 's bloodshed , 28 people were killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , were displaced from the homes .
nato has blamed extremist albanians for the violence and rugova promised a thorough investigation as well as actions to remedy the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova but un officials in kosovo expressed their disappointment that rugova -lrb- photo -rrb- and others had not explicitly condemned the attacks on serbs . " to my great astonishment and disappointment , something was left out , namely the condemnation of the violence against the serbs , " said harri holkeri , who heads the united nations interim administration mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- . jaap de hoop scheffer , nato 's secretary general , also condemned the clashes during a visit to kosovo on monday .
" what happened last week , orchestrated and organized by extremist factions in the albanian community , is unacceptable , " he said . war began five years ago bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of ethnic albanians fled the province in 1999 .
five years ago , on march 24 , 1999 , nato began air raids on yugoslavia with the goal of preventing a catastrophe by forcing slobodan milosevic to end military and police actions against ethnic albanians in kosovo . almost 80 days after the bombing began , the yugoslav president finally gave in .
international peacekeeping troops arrived in kosovo , which was put under un control .
slowly , democratic institutions were set up .
last year , the governments in serbia and kosovo began to talk to each other again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic albanians waiting to vote in the 2001 elections .
a lot has happened since then : kosovo elected a new president and a parliament , a government was formed , and the province got its own judiciary and police force .
the second parliamentary elections are scheduled for the fall . the unclear future status of kosovo is the biggest problem for ethnic albanians .
after the war , the un adopted resolution 1244 , which only called for a " substantial autonomy for the people of kosovo " and put the province under international control .
that 's not enough for the albanians , who want complete independence from belgrade . but the " decent and appropriate treatment of smaller ethnic groups " is one democratic standard un officials have demanded before agreeing to discuss the province 's future status .
the first to do so was michael steiner , who headed unmik until last july . he defined eight criteria , including functioning governmental institutions , freedom of movement , a functioning economy , as well as a working judiciary and police force .
those who fled from kosovo in 1999 would have to be allowed back too . negotiations possible in 2005 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harri holkeri steiner 's successor , harri holkeri -lrb- photo -rrb- fine-tuned the standards last december .
if these standards can be reached by mid-2005 , the international community has promised negotiations about kosovo 's status . serbia 's government and the serbs in kosovo fear that these standards and the deadline have made independence inevitable .
albanians in kosovo , on the other hand , are happy that a date has been set .
" it 's a great achievement as un resolution 1244 did n't set a date , " kosovo 's premier bajram rexhepi said . to ensure peaceful coexistence between albanians and serbs , unmik 's current efforts do n't suffice , according to some . " we have to try harder to correct our past mistakes , " said faruk spahija , the mayor of mitrovica .
" it 's possible to create a climate of peace in kosovo .
a lot more has to be done to adhere to the standards kosovo has been presented with .

five years ago , nato began air raids on yugoslavia to stop violence in kosovo .
it was an important and controversial event for german foreign policy : for the first time since 1945 , german soldiers participated in combat . kosovo was n't the first postwar foreign mission for the bundeswehr , as the german military is called .
german soldiers had participated in un missions since the early 1990s , mainly offering humanitarian assistance . however , the use of military force abroad in kosovo helped redefine german foreign policy in a way that continues today .
germany 's leading role in the stabilization of afghanistan and deployment of naval power off the coast of africa to combat international terrorism are the best examples of how things have changed . only a decade ago , those missions would have been unthinkable . in 1994 , social democrats , who were in opposition at the time , and some free democrats , who formed part of the governing coalition , filed a complaint with the constitutional court against foreign missions by the bundeswehr .
helmut kohl , germany 's christian democratic chancellor at the time , and his cabinet of ministers had approved the missions without the parliament 's consent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers the plaintiffs asked the court to clarify the legislature 's rights in deciding about military missions .
they also wanted to know whether the constitution allowed german soldiers to participate in such actions at all , as the bundeswehr 's scope of activities had been limited to defending germany so far . clearing the way for germany 's participation in military strikes , the country 's highest judges ruled that such an involvement was constitutional as long as a un or nato mandate existed . warming up to military action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers in bosnia the bundeswehr went to the balkans , where german soldiers became part of nato 's ifor operation in bosnia from 1995 to 1996 .
the mission gave the bundeswehr a chance to get experience in conflict resolution , according to hans frank , a former vice admiral who now heads the federal college for security policy studies in berlin . " we participated in stabilization efforts after military action , but never in the action itself , " frank said .
" kosovo showed that sometimes the use of force is necessary to squelch a developing conflict and return to stability . " using military force was the point in question .
until that time , german soldiers abroad had only used their weapons for self-defense .
now nato decided to bomb yugoslavia to end the atrocities that state forces were committing against ethnic albanians in kosovo .
the german parliament voted in favor of bundeswehr participation in october 1998 , and the bombing began on march 24 , 1999 , exactly five years ago . a first for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder standing in front of a eurofighter jet .
germany was n't waging a war but had been called upon to secure peace in kosovo with military force , german chancellor gerhard schröder explained to the nation in a television speech . by doing so , he articulated a new and important basis of german foreign policy : the deployment of force and - german - soldiers can be a last resort to resolve a crisis . at the same time , the federal government turned reunified germany into an equal and serious nato partner .
fourteen bundeswehr tornado fighters took off on 500 missions - mostly for reconnaissance purposes but also against yugoslav anti-aircraft stations . it was a decisive and completely novel step for the bundeswehr , which has to be seen in the context of its history , frank said . " but first and foremost it was a political decision , and a very important one , " he said .
" no government of the federal republic had been asked to make that decision to enter a war so far . " even after nato air raids began , all parties , except the post-communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , supported germany 's participation in the war .
seven of 47 green parliamentarians called for an immediate end to the mission , but the party leadership surrounding foreign minister joschka fischer backed the decision . after the war , the bundeswehr almost immediately went from taking military action to trying to stabilize the situation ; the un 's kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- peacekeepers took over once nato had ended the bombardments on june 10 , 1999 . shortly after , klaus reinhardt became the first german general to lead a nato mission outside the alliance 's territory .

five years ago , nato began air raids on yugoslavia to stop violence in kosovo .
it was an important and controversial event for german foreign policy : for the first time since 1945 , german soldiers participated in combat . kosovo was n't the first postwar foreign mission for the bundeswehr , as the german military is called .
german soldiers had participated in un missions since the early 1990s , mainly offering humanitarian assistance . however , the use of military force abroad in kosovo helped redefine german foreign policy in a way that continues today .
germany 's leading role in the stabilization of afghanistan and deployment of naval power off the coast of africa to combat international terrorism are the best examples of how things have changed . only a decade ago , those missions would have been unthinkable . in 1994 , social democrats , who were in opposition at the time , and some free democrats , who formed part of the governing coalition , filed a complaint with the constitutional court against foreign missions by the bundeswehr .
helmut kohl , germany 's christian democratic chancellor at the time , and his cabinet of ministers had approved the missions without the parliament 's consent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers the plaintiffs asked the court to clarify the legislature 's rights in deciding about military missions .
they also wanted to know whether the constitution allowed german soldiers to participate in such actions at all , as the bundeswehr 's scope of activities had been limited to defending germany so far . clearing the way for germany 's participation in military strikes , the country 's highest judges ruled that such an involvement was constitutional as long as a un or nato mandate existed . warming up to military action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers in bosnia the bundeswehr went to the balkans , where german soldiers became part of nato 's ifor operation in bosnia from 1995 to 1996 .
the mission gave the bundeswehr a chance to get experience in conflict resolution , according to hans frank , a former vice admiral who now heads the federal college for security policy studies in berlin . " we participated in stabilization efforts after military action , but never in the action itself , " frank said .
" kosovo showed that sometimes the use of force is necessary to squelch a developing conflict and return to stability . " using military force was the point in question .
until that time , german soldiers abroad had only used their weapons for self-defense .
now nato decided to bomb yugoslavia to end the atrocities that state forces were committing against ethnic albanians in kosovo .
the german parliament voted in favor of bundeswehr participation in october 1998 , and the bombing began on march 24 , 1999 , exactly five years ago . a first for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder standing in front of a eurofighter jet .
germany was n't waging a war but had been called upon to secure peace in kosovo with military force , german chancellor gerhard schröder explained to the nation in a television speech . by doing so , he articulated a new and important basis of german foreign policy : the deployment of force and - german - soldiers can be a last resort to resolve a crisis . at the same time , the federal government turned reunified germany into an equal and serious nato partner .
fourteen bundeswehr tornado fighters took off on 500 missions - mostly for reconnaissance purposes but also against yugoslav anti-aircraft stations . it was a decisive and completely novel step for the bundeswehr , which has to be seen in the context of its history , frank said . " but first and foremost it was a political decision , and a very important one , " he said .
" no government of the federal republic had been asked to make that decision to enter a war so far . " even after nato air raids began , all parties , except the post-communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , supported germany 's participation in the war .
seven of 47 green parliamentarians called for an immediate end to the mission , but the party leadership surrounding foreign minister joschka fischer backed the decision . after the war , the bundeswehr almost immediately went from taking military action to trying to stabilize the situation ; the un 's kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- peacekeepers took over once nato had ended the bombardments on june 10 , 1999 . shortly after , klaus reinhardt became the first german general to lead a nato mission outside the alliance 's territory .
today , the bundeswehr , which is sending an additional 600 troops to kosovo after last week 's violent clashes , remains one of the biggest forces within kfor . nina werkhäuser -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder rules out peacekeepers as iraqis ok constitution the iraqi governing council agreed on an interim constitution on monday which could pave the way to a return of sovereignty .

five years after the war , kosovo remains troubled by ethnic tensions .
while albanians would like to become independent , serbs want more participation from belgrade to protect their rights . kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova on tuesday called for swift independence from serbia for the un-controlled province after last week 's violent clashes .
but un officials are demanding that democratic standards have to be introduced before that can happen . during last week 's bloodshed , 28 people were killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , were displaced from the homes .
nato has blamed extremist albanians for the violence and rugova promised a thorough investigation as well as actions to remedy the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova but un officials in kosovo expressed their disappointment that rugova -lrb- photo -rrb- and others had not explicitly condemned the attacks on serbs . " to my great astonishment and disappointment , something was left out , namely the condemnation of the violence against the serbs , " said harri holkeri , who heads the united nations interim administration mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- . jaap de hoop scheffer , nato 's secretary general , also condemned the clashes during a visit to kosovo on monday .
" what happened last week , orchestrated and organized by extremist factions in the albanian community , is unacceptable , " he said . war began five years ago bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of ethnic albanians fled the province in 1999 .
five years ago , on march 24 , 1999 , nato began air raids on yugoslavia with the goal of preventing a catastrophe by forcing slobodan milosevic to end military and police actions against ethnic albanians in kosovo . almost 80 days after the bombing began , the yugoslav president finally gave in .
international peacekeeping troops arrived in kosovo , which was put under un control .
slowly , democratic institutions were set up .
last year , the governments in serbia and kosovo began to talk to each other again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic albanians waiting to vote in the 2001 elections .
a lot has happened since then : kosovo elected a new president and a parliament , a government was formed , and the province got its own judiciary and police force .
the second parliamentary elections are scheduled for the fall . the unclear future status of kosovo is the biggest problem for ethnic albanians .
after the war , the un adopted resolution 1244 , which only called for a " substantial autonomy for the people of kosovo " and put the province under international control .
that 's not enough for the albanians , who want complete independence from belgrade . but the " decent and appropriate treatment of smaller ethnic groups " is one democratic standard un officials have demanded before agreeing to discuss the province 's future status .
the first to do so was michael steiner , who headed unmik until last july . he defined eight criteria , including functioning governmental institutions , freedom of movement , a functioning economy , as well as a working judiciary and police force .
those who fled from kosovo in 1999 would have to be allowed back too . negotiations possible in 2005 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harri holkeri steiner 's successor , harri holkeri -lrb- photo -rrb- fine-tuned the standards last december .
if these standards can be reached by mid-2005 , the international community has promised negotiations about kosovo 's status . serbia 's government and the serbs in kosovo fear that these standards and the deadline have made independence inevitable .
albanians in kosovo , on the other hand , are happy that a date has been set .
" it 's a great achievement as un resolution 1244 did n't set a date , " kosovo 's premier bajram rexhepi said . to ensure peaceful coexistence between albanians and serbs , unmik 's current efforts do n't suffice , according to some . " we have to try harder to correct our past mistakes , " said faruk spahija , the mayor of mitrovica .

five years after the war , kosovo remains troubled by ethnic tensions .
while albanians would like to become independent , serbs want more participation from belgrade to protect their rights . kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova on tuesday called for swift independence from serbia for the un-controlled province after last week 's violent clashes .
but un officials are demanding that democratic standards have to be introduced before that can happen . during last week 's bloodshed , 28 people were killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , were displaced from the homes .
nato has blamed extremist albanians for the violence and rugova promised a thorough investigation as well as actions to remedy the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova but un officials in kosovo expressed their disappointment that rugova -lrb- photo -rrb- and others had not explicitly condemned the attacks on serbs .

" dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business does n't prevent competition ... and does not harm consumers and innovation , " eu competition commissioner mario monti said .
" today 's decision restores the conditions for fair competition in the markets concerned and establishes clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position . "
illegal behavior citing " illegal behavior " that is " ongoing , " the eu antitrust authority is calling for microsoft to implement a number of remedies .
the company has been ordered to offer a version of windows without its digital media player in three months and to release the " complete and accurate " interface code to rival companies in the server market within four month .
the commission said the release of the code , a demand heatedly contested by microsoft , was necessary in order for server products created by competing companies to have " full interoperability " with computers running windows .
the commission said it would appoint a monitoring trustee " to ensure effective and timely compliance . "
the ruling is the highest ever penalty imposed by the eu 's executive branch against a single company for violating competition regulations .
microsoft , the world 's biggest software firm , has denied it abuses the overwhelming dominance of its windows operating system to illegally crush competitors .
it said eu regulators were unjustified in proposing such a large fine .
" we worked hard to reach an agreement that would address the european commission 's concerns and still allow us to innovate and improve our products for consumers , " said steve ballmer , chief executive officer of microsoft .
" we respect the commission 's authority , but we believe that our settlement offer from last week would have offered far more choices and benefits to consumers . "
the company said it would file an appeal with the eu 's court of first instance in luxembourg .
painful remedies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commissioner for competition mario monti but chief executive steve ballmer is less worried about the financial penalties , which will probably not cause too much pain for the seattle-based company given its cash reserves of some $ 53 billion .
it 's more the list of " remedies " the eu competition authorities have handed down that is cause for concern for the company , which has sought to expand its operating system to incorporate almost all facets of the internet .
monti has said he fears that if unchecked , microsoft would continue to exploit its monopoly when it launches its windows successor , longhorn , which combines built-in search engine capabilities and 3-d graphics to compete with internet companies like google and yahoo .
but ballmer , who is currently in brussels , rejects such demands , saying it limits microsoft 's ability to develop new products and integrate them into the operating system in the future .
according to the company spokesman , the eu regulations serve only as a " stumbling block to the company 's capacity to innovate . "
monti , whose five-year term as competition commissioner ends in october , is not flinching on what is without a doubt the commission 's biggest anti-trust case .
despite hefty criticism that the verdict will do nothing for competition and everything to block innovation , the guardian of fair trade practices said ahead of wednesday 's decision : " it is essential to have a clear principle for the future conduct of a company which has such a strong dominant position in the market . "
a history of investigations this was n't the first time microsoft found itself under the watchful gaze of anti-trust investigators .
in a spectacular anti-trust case in the united states , the government threatened to split microsoft up into different companies at the turn of the century .
the company 's operating system can be found in 95 percent of the desktop computers worldwide , and u.s. courts determined that microsoft had repeatedly abused its monopoly status .
but after then-president bill clinton left office , microsoft cut a deal with the justice department and several states , effectively resolving the anti-trust case .
however , the european commission continued to follow up complaints from microsoft competitors filed five years ago .
sun microsystems , for example , charged that microsoft had integrated applications like the internet explorer web browser and digital media programs into its operating system in a way that largely banished any competition for the applications .
the commission later held that microsoft had violated competition laws and sought to negotiate a settlement with the redmond , washington-based company .
but talks failed earlier this week , setting the scene for the ruling .
fear of lawsuits micrsoft initially sought to avoid formal punishment from the european commission because , it feared , it could be used as a precedent for costly lawsuits against the company in other countries including the u.s. both microsoft and the commission agreed that the company had abused its monopoly status .
microsoft even agreed to decouple its internet explorer and windows xp software .
but that proposal did n't go far enough for monti .
" we made substantial progress towards resolving the problems but were unable to agree on commitments for future conduct , " monti said earlier this week . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de microsoft 's long road to brussels this week 's ruling should come as no surprise to microsoft .
already in 2001 the european commission began gathering evidence against the u.s. software giant .
back then it looked like a quick resolution was in sight .
-lrb- march 23 , 2004 -rrb- the highest corporate fines in eu history more than a dozen companies have been fined € 50 million or more by the european commission for anti-competitive practices including abuses of monopoly status and price fixing .

ballendorf in southwestern germany has made headlines across the country : election officials annulled the recent mayoral election there after the winner admitted buying beers for 21 of the 660 villagers . when ballendorfers went to the polls a few weeks ago , they narrowly chose andreas benz , a 45-year-old farmer , as their new mayor .

after all , benz may have won the election because he paid for beer and gave money to a local group , as the informant had told officials . the mayor-elect readily confirmed and clarified the facts : over the course of two nights , he had bought 21 beers for people in ballendorf 's sports and singing clubs .
he had also given € 50 -lrb- $ 60 -rrb- to a youth group to repair the roof of their meeting place .
" that 's how it 's done , " he told dw-world . " this is crazy " calling it an illegal attempt to influence voters , the county 's election officials annulled the vote and the district attorney 's office announced it would investigate the case .

" dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business does n't prevent competition ... and does not harm consumers and innovation , " eu competition commissioner mario monti said .
" today 's decision restores the conditions for fair competition in the markets concerned and establishes clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position . "
illegal behavior citing " illegal behavior " that is " ongoing , " the eu antitrust authority is calling for microsoft to implement a number of remedies .
the company has been ordered to offer a version of windows without its digital media player in three months and to release the " complete and accurate " interface code to rival companies in the server market within four month .
the commission said the release of the code , a demand heatedly contested by microsoft , was necessary in order for server products created by competing companies to have " full interoperability " with computers running windows .
the commission said it would appoint a monitoring trustee " to ensure effective and timely compliance . "
the ruling is the highest ever penalty imposed by the eu 's executive branch against a single company for violating competition regulations .
microsoft , the world 's biggest software firm , has denied it abuses the overwhelming dominance of its windows operating system to illegally crush competitors .
it said eu regulators were unjustified in proposing such a large fine .
" we worked hard to reach an agreement that would address the european commission 's concerns and still allow us to innovate and improve our products for consumers , " said steve ballmer , chief executive officer of microsoft .
" we respect the commission 's authority , but we believe that our settlement offer from last week would have offered far more choices and benefits to consumers . "
the company said it would file an appeal with the eu 's court of first instance in luxembourg .
painful remedies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commissioner for competition mario monti but chief executive steve ballmer is less worried about the financial penalties , which will probably not cause too much pain for the seattle-based company given its cash reserves of some $ 53 billion .
it 's more the list of " remedies " the eu competition authorities have handed down that is cause for concern for the company , which has sought to expand its operating system to incorporate almost all facets of the internet .
monti has said he fears that if unchecked , microsoft would continue to exploit its monopoly when it launches its windows successor , longhorn , which combines built-in search engine capabilities and 3-d graphics to compete with internet companies like google and yahoo .
but ballmer , who is currently in brussels , rejects such demands , saying it limits microsoft 's ability to develop new products and integrate them into the operating system in the future .
according to the company spokesman , the eu regulations serve only as a " stumbling block to the company 's capacity to innovate . "
monti , whose five-year term as competition commissioner ends in october , is not flinching on what is without a doubt the commission 's biggest anti-trust case .
despite hefty criticism that the verdict will do nothing for competition and everything to block innovation , the guardian of fair trade practices said ahead of wednesday 's decision : " it is essential to have a clear principle for the future conduct of a company which has such a strong dominant position in the market . "
a history of investigations this was n't the first time microsoft found itself under the watchful gaze of anti-trust investigators .
in a spectacular anti-trust case in the united states , the government threatened to split microsoft up into different companies at the turn of the century .
the company 's operating system can be found in 95 percent of the desktop computers worldwide , and u.s. courts determined that microsoft had repeatedly abused its monopoly status .
but after then-president bill clinton left office , microsoft cut a deal with the justice department and several states , effectively resolving the anti-trust case .
however , the european commission continued to follow up complaints from microsoft competitors filed five years ago .
sun microsystems , for example , charged that microsoft had integrated applications like the internet explorer web browser and digital media programs into its operating system in a way that largely banished any competition for the applications .
the commission later held that microsoft had violated competition laws and sought to negotiate a settlement with the redmond , washington-based company .
but talks failed earlier this week , setting the scene for the ruling .
fear of lawsuits micrsoft initially sought to avoid formal punishment from the european commission because , it feared , it could be used as a precedent for costly lawsuits against the company in other countries including the u.s. both microsoft and the commission agreed that the company had abused its monopoly status .
microsoft even agreed to decouple its internet explorer and windows xp software .
but that proposal did n't go far enough for monti .

it said eu regulators were unjustified in proposing such a large fine .
" we worked hard to reach an agreement that would address the european commission 's concerns and still allow us to innovate and improve our products for consumers , " said steve ballmer , chief executive officer of microsoft .
" we respect the commission 's authority , but we believe that our settlement offer from last week would have offered far more choices and benefits to consumers . "
the company said it would file an appeal with the eu 's court of first instance in luxembourg .
painful remedies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commissioner for competition mario monti but chief executive steve ballmer is less worried about the financial penalties , which will probably not cause too much pain for the seattle-based company given its cash reserves of some $ 53 billion .
it 's more the list of " remedies " the eu competition authorities have handed down that is cause for concern for the company , which has sought to expand its operating system to incorporate almost all facets of the internet .
monti has said he fears that if unchecked , microsoft would continue to exploit its monopoly when it launches its windows successor , longhorn , which combines built-in search engine capabilities and 3-d graphics to compete with internet companies like google and yahoo .
but ballmer , who is currently in brussels , rejects such demands , saying it limits microsoft 's ability to develop new products and integrate them into the operating system in the future .
according to the company spokesman , the eu regulations serve only as a " stumbling block to the company 's capacity to innovate . "
monti , whose five-year term as competition commissioner ends in october , is not flinching on what is without a doubt the commission 's biggest anti-trust case .
despite hefty criticism that the verdict will do nothing for competition and everything to block innovation , the guardian of fair trade practices said ahead of wednesday 's decision : " it is essential to have a clear principle for the future conduct of a company which has such a strong dominant position in the market . "
a history of investigations this was n't the first time microsoft found itself under the watchful gaze of anti-trust investigators .
in a spectacular anti-trust case in the united states , the government threatened to split microsoft up into different companies at the turn of the century .
the company 's operating system can be found in 95 percent of the desktop computers worldwide , and u.s. courts determined that microsoft had repeatedly abused its monopoly status .
but after then-president bill clinton left office , microsoft cut a deal with the justice department and several states , effectively resolving the anti-trust case .
however , the european commission continued to follow up complaints from microsoft competitors filed five years ago .
sun microsystems , for example , charged that microsoft had integrated applications like the internet explorer web browser and digital media programs into its operating system in a way that largely banished any competition for the applications .
the commission later held that microsoft had violated competition laws and sought to negotiate a settlement with the redmond , washington-based company .
but talks failed earlier this week , setting the scene for the ruling .
fear of lawsuits micrsoft initially sought to avoid formal punishment from the european commission because , it feared , it could be used as a precedent for costly lawsuits against the company in other countries including the u.s. both microsoft and the commission agreed that the company had abused its monopoly status .
microsoft even agreed to decouple its internet explorer and windows xp software .
but that proposal did n't go far enough for monti .

the company has been ordered to offer a version of windows without its digital media player in three months and to release the " complete and accurate " interface code to rival companies in the server market within four month .

five years ago , nato began air raids on yugoslavia to stop violence in kosovo .
it was an important and controversial event for german foreign policy : for the first time since 1945 , german soldiers participated in combat . kosovo was n't the first postwar foreign mission for the bundeswehr , as the german military is called .
german soldiers had participated in un missions since the early 1990s , mainly offering humanitarian assistance . however , the use of military force abroad in kosovo helped redefine german foreign policy in a way that continues today .
germany 's leading role in the stabilization of afghanistan and deployment of naval power off the coast of africa to combat international terrorism are the best examples of how things have changed . only a decade ago , those missions would have been unthinkable . in 1994 , social democrats , who were in opposition at the time , and some free democrats , who formed part of the governing coalition , filed a complaint with the constitutional court against foreign missions by the bundeswehr .
helmut kohl , germany 's christian democratic chancellor at the time , and his cabinet of ministers had approved the missions without the parliament 's consent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers the plaintiffs asked the court to clarify the legislature 's rights in deciding about military missions .
they also wanted to know whether the constitution allowed german soldiers to participate in such actions at all , as the bundeswehr 's scope of activities had been limited to defending germany so far . clearing the way for germany 's participation in military strikes , the country 's highest judges ruled that such an involvement was constitutional as long as a un or nato mandate existed . warming up to military action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers in bosnia the bundeswehr went to the balkans , where german soldiers became part of nato 's ifor operation in bosnia from 1995 to 1996 .
the mission gave the bundeswehr a chance to get experience in conflict resolution , according to hans frank , a former vice admiral who now heads the federal college for security policy studies in berlin . " we participated in stabilization efforts after military action , but never in the action itself , " frank said .
" kosovo showed that sometimes the use of force is necessary to squelch a developing conflict and return to stability . " using military force was the point in question .
until that time , german soldiers abroad had only used their weapons for self-defense .
now nato decided to bomb yugoslavia to end the atrocities that state forces were committing against ethnic albanians in kosovo .
the german parliament voted in favor of bundeswehr participation in october 1998 , and the bombing began on march 24 , 1999 , exactly five years ago . a first for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder standing in front of a eurofighter jet .
germany was n't waging a war but had been called upon to secure peace in kosovo with military force , german chancellor gerhard schröder explained to the nation in a television speech . by doing so , he articulated a new and important basis of german foreign policy : the deployment of force and - german - soldiers can be a last resort to resolve a crisis . at the same time , the federal government turned reunified germany into an equal and serious nato partner .
fourteen bundeswehr tornado fighters took off on 500 missions - mostly for reconnaissance purposes but also against yugoslav anti-aircraft stations . it was a decisive and completely novel step for the bundeswehr , which has to be seen in the context of its history , frank said . " but first and foremost it was a political decision , and a very important one , " he said .
" no government of the federal republic had been asked to make that decision to enter a war so far . " even after nato air raids began , all parties , except the post-communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , supported germany 's participation in the war .
seven of 47 green parliamentarians called for an immediate end to the mission , but the party leadership surrounding foreign minister joschka fischer backed the decision . after the war , the bundeswehr almost immediately went from taking military action to trying to stabilize the situation ; the un 's kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- peacekeepers took over once nato had ended the bombardments on june 10 , 1999 . shortly after , klaus reinhardt became the first german general to lead a nato mission outside the alliance 's territory .

five years ago , nato began air raids on yugoslavia to stop violence in kosovo .
it was an important and controversial event for german foreign policy : for the first time since 1945 , german soldiers participated in combat . kosovo was n't the first postwar foreign mission for the bundeswehr , as the german military is called .
german soldiers had participated in un missions since the early 1990s , mainly offering humanitarian assistance . however , the use of military force abroad in kosovo helped redefine german foreign policy in a way that continues today .
germany 's leading role in the stabilization of afghanistan and deployment of naval power off the coast of africa to combat international terrorism are the best examples of how things have changed . only a decade ago , those missions would have been unthinkable . in 1994 , social democrats , who were in opposition at the time , and some free democrats , who formed part of the governing coalition , filed a complaint with the constitutional court against foreign missions by the bundeswehr .
helmut kohl , germany 's christian democratic chancellor at the time , and his cabinet of ministers had approved the missions without the parliament 's consent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers the plaintiffs asked the court to clarify the legislature 's rights in deciding about military missions .
they also wanted to know whether the constitution allowed german soldiers to participate in such actions at all , as the bundeswehr 's scope of activities had been limited to defending germany so far . clearing the way for germany 's participation in military strikes , the country 's highest judges ruled that such an involvement was constitutional as long as a un or nato mandate existed . warming up to military action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers in bosnia the bundeswehr went to the balkans , where german soldiers became part of nato 's ifor operation in bosnia from 1995 to 1996 .
the mission gave the bundeswehr a chance to get experience in conflict resolution , according to hans frank , a former vice admiral who now heads the federal college for security policy studies in berlin . " we participated in stabilization efforts after military action , but never in the action itself , " frank said .
" kosovo showed that sometimes the use of force is necessary to squelch a developing conflict and return to stability . " using military force was the point in question .
until that time , german soldiers abroad had only used their weapons for self-defense .
now nato decided to bomb yugoslavia to end the atrocities that state forces were committing against ethnic albanians in kosovo .
the german parliament voted in favor of bundeswehr participation in october 1998 , and the bombing began on march 24 , 1999 , exactly five years ago . a first for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder standing in front of a eurofighter jet .
germany was n't waging a war but had been called upon to secure peace in kosovo with military force , german chancellor gerhard schröder explained to the nation in a television speech . by doing so , he articulated a new and important basis of german foreign policy : the deployment of force and - german - soldiers can be a last resort to resolve a crisis . at the same time , the federal government turned reunified germany into an equal and serious nato partner .
fourteen bundeswehr tornado fighters took off on 500 missions - mostly for reconnaissance purposes but also against yugoslav anti-aircraft stations . it was a decisive and completely novel step for the bundeswehr , which has to be seen in the context of its history , frank said . " but first and foremost it was a political decision , and a very important one , " he said .
" no government of the federal republic had been asked to make that decision to enter a war so far . " even after nato air raids began , all parties , except the post-communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , supported germany 's participation in the war .
seven of 47 green parliamentarians called for an immediate end to the mission , but the party leadership surrounding foreign minister joschka fischer backed the decision . after the war , the bundeswehr almost immediately went from taking military action to trying to stabilize the situation ; the un 's kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- peacekeepers took over once nato had ended the bombardments on june 10 , 1999 . shortly after , klaus reinhardt became the first german general to lead a nato mission outside the alliance 's territory .

german soldiers had participated in un missions since the early 1990s , mainly offering humanitarian assistance . however , the use of military force abroad in kosovo helped redefine german foreign policy in a way that continues today .
germany 's leading role in the stabilization of afghanistan and deployment of naval power off the coast of africa to combat international terrorism are the best examples of how things have changed . only a decade ago , those missions would have been unthinkable . in 1994 , social democrats , who were in opposition at the time , and some free democrats , who formed part of the governing coalition , filed a complaint with the constitutional court against foreign missions by the bundeswehr .
helmut kohl , germany 's christian democratic chancellor at the time , and his cabinet of ministers had approved the missions without the parliament 's consent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers the plaintiffs asked the court to clarify the legislature 's rights in deciding about military missions .
they also wanted to know whether the constitution allowed german soldiers to participate in such actions at all , as the bundeswehr 's scope of activities had been limited to defending germany so far . clearing the way for germany 's participation in military strikes , the country 's highest judges ruled that such an involvement was constitutional as long as a un or nato mandate existed . warming up to military action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers in bosnia the bundeswehr went to the balkans , where german soldiers became part of nato 's ifor operation in bosnia from 1995 to 1996 .
the mission gave the bundeswehr a chance to get experience in conflict resolution , according to hans frank , a former vice admiral who now heads the federal college for security policy studies in berlin . " we participated in stabilization efforts after military action , but never in the action itself , " frank said .
" kosovo showed that sometimes the use of force is necessary to squelch a developing conflict and return to stability . " using military force was the point in question .
until that time , german soldiers abroad had only used their weapons for self-defense .
now nato decided to bomb yugoslavia to end the atrocities that state forces were committing against ethnic albanians in kosovo .
the german parliament voted in favor of bundeswehr participation in october 1998 , and the bombing began on march 24 , 1999 , exactly five years ago . a first for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder standing in front of a eurofighter jet .
germany was n't waging a war but had been called upon to secure peace in kosovo with military force , german chancellor gerhard schröder explained to the nation in a television speech . by doing so , he articulated a new and important basis of german foreign policy : the deployment of force and - german - soldiers can be a last resort to resolve a crisis . at the same time , the federal government turned reunified germany into an equal and serious nato partner .
fourteen bundeswehr tornado fighters took off on 500 missions - mostly for reconnaissance purposes but also against yugoslav anti-aircraft stations . it was a decisive and completely novel step for the bundeswehr , which has to be seen in the context of its history , frank said . " but first and foremost it was a political decision , and a very important one , " he said .
" no government of the federal republic had been asked to make that decision to enter a war so far . " even after nato air raids began , all parties , except the post-communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , supported germany 's participation in the war .
seven of 47 green parliamentarians called for an immediate end to the mission , but the party leadership surrounding foreign minister joschka fischer backed the decision . after the war , the bundeswehr almost immediately went from taking military action to trying to stabilize the situation ; the un 's kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- peacekeepers took over once nato had ended the bombardments on june 10 , 1999 . shortly after , klaus reinhardt became the first german general to lead a nato mission outside the alliance 's territory .
today , the bundeswehr , which is sending an additional 600 troops to kosovo after last week 's violent clashes , remains one of the biggest forces within kfor . nina werkhäuser -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder rules out peacekeepers as iraqis ok constitution the iraqi governing council agreed on an interim constitution on monday which could pave the way to a return of sovereignty .

five years after the war , kosovo remains troubled by ethnic tensions .
while albanians would like to become independent , serbs want more participation from belgrade to protect their rights . kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova on tuesday called for swift independence from serbia for the un-controlled province after last week 's violent clashes .
but un officials are demanding that democratic standards have to be introduced before that can happen . during last week 's bloodshed , 28 people were killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , were displaced from the homes .
nato has blamed extremist albanians for the violence and rugova promised a thorough investigation as well as actions to remedy the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova but un officials in kosovo expressed their disappointment that rugova -lrb- photo -rrb- and others had not explicitly condemned the attacks on serbs . " to my great astonishment and disappointment , something was left out , namely the condemnation of the violence against the serbs , " said harri holkeri , who heads the united nations interim administration mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- . jaap de hoop scheffer , nato 's secretary general , also condemned the clashes during a visit to kosovo on monday .
" what happened last week , orchestrated and organized by extremist factions in the albanian community , is unacceptable , " he said . war began five years ago bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of ethnic albanians fled the province in 1999 .
five years ago , on march 24 , 1999 , nato began air raids on yugoslavia with the goal of preventing a catastrophe by forcing slobodan milosevic to end military and police actions against ethnic albanians in kosovo . almost 80 days after the bombing began , the yugoslav president finally gave in .
international peacekeeping troops arrived in kosovo , which was put under un control .
slowly , democratic institutions were set up .
last year , the governments in serbia and kosovo began to talk to each other again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic albanians waiting to vote in the 2001 elections .
a lot has happened since then : kosovo elected a new president and a parliament , a government was formed , and the province got its own judiciary and police force .
the second parliamentary elections are scheduled for the fall . the unclear future status of kosovo is the biggest problem for ethnic albanians .
after the war , the un adopted resolution 1244 , which only called for a " substantial autonomy for the people of kosovo " and put the province under international control .
that 's not enough for the albanians , who want complete independence from belgrade . but the " decent and appropriate treatment of smaller ethnic groups " is one democratic standard un officials have demanded before agreeing to discuss the province 's future status .
the first to do so was michael steiner , who headed unmik until last july . he defined eight criteria , including functioning governmental institutions , freedom of movement , a functioning economy , as well as a working judiciary and police force .
those who fled from kosovo in 1999 would have to be allowed back too . negotiations possible in 2005 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harri holkeri steiner 's successor , harri holkeri -lrb- photo -rrb- fine-tuned the standards last december .
if these standards can be reached by mid-2005 , the international community has promised negotiations about kosovo 's status . serbia 's government and the serbs in kosovo fear that these standards and the deadline have made independence inevitable .
albanians in kosovo , on the other hand , are happy that a date has been set .
" it 's a great achievement as un resolution 1244 did n't set a date , " kosovo 's premier bajram rexhepi said . to ensure peaceful coexistence between albanians and serbs , unmik 's current efforts do n't suffice , according to some . " we have to try harder to correct our past mistakes , " said faruk spahija , the mayor of mitrovica .
" it 's possible to create a climate of peace in kosovo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.03.2004 debating kosovo 's future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the recent violence hurt calls for independence ?
five years after the war , kosovo remains troubled by ethnic tensions .
while albanians would like to become independent , serbs want more participation from belgrade to protect their rights . kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova on tuesday called for swift independence from serbia for the un-controlled province after last week 's violent clashes .
but un officials are demanding that democratic standards have to be introduced before that can happen . during last week 's bloodshed , 28 people were killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , were displaced from the homes .
nato has blamed extremist albanians for the violence and rugova promised a thorough investigation as well as actions to remedy the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova but un officials in kosovo expressed their disappointment that rugova -lrb- photo -rrb- and others had not explicitly condemned the attacks on serbs . " to my great astonishment and disappointment , something was left out , namely the condemnation of the violence against the serbs , " said harri holkeri , who heads the united nations interim administration mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- . jaap de hoop scheffer , nato 's secretary general , also condemned the clashes during a visit to kosovo on monday .
" what happened last week , orchestrated and organized by extremist factions in the albanian community , is unacceptable , " he said . war began five years ago bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of ethnic albanians fled the province in 1999 .
five years ago , on march 24 , 1999 , nato began air raids on yugoslavia with the goal of preventing a catastrophe by forcing slobodan milosevic to end military and police actions against ethnic albanians in kosovo . almost 80 days after the bombing began , the yugoslav president finally gave in .
international peacekeeping troops arrived in kosovo , which was put under un control .
slowly , democratic institutions were set up .
last year , the governments in serbia and kosovo began to talk to each other again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic albanians waiting to vote in the 2001 elections .
a lot has happened since then : kosovo elected a new president and a parliament , a government was formed , and the province got its own judiciary and police force .
the second parliamentary elections are scheduled for the fall . the unclear future status of kosovo is the biggest problem for ethnic albanians .
after the war , the un adopted resolution 1244 , which only called for a " substantial autonomy for the people of kosovo " and put the province under international control .
that 's not enough for the albanians , who want complete independence from belgrade . but the " decent and appropriate treatment of smaller ethnic groups " is one democratic standard un officials have demanded before agreeing to discuss the province 's future status .
the first to do so was michael steiner , who headed unmik until last july . he defined eight criteria , including functioning governmental institutions , freedom of movement , a functioning economy , as well as a working judiciary and police force .
those who fled from kosovo in 1999 would have to be allowed back too . negotiations possible in 2005 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harri holkeri steiner 's successor , harri holkeri -lrb- photo -rrb- fine-tuned the standards last december .
if these standards can be reached by mid-2005 , the international community has promised negotiations about kosovo 's status . serbia 's government and the serbs in kosovo fear that these standards and the deadline have made independence inevitable .
albanians in kosovo , on the other hand , are happy that a date has been set .
" it 's a great achievement as un resolution 1244 did n't set a date , " kosovo 's premier bajram rexhepi said . to ensure peaceful coexistence between albanians and serbs , unmik 's current efforts do n't suffice , according to some . " we have to try harder to correct our past mistakes , " said faruk spahija , the mayor of mitrovica .
" it 's possible to create a climate of peace in kosovo .
a lot more has to be done to adhere to the standards kosovo has been presented with .

five years after the war , kosovo remains troubled by ethnic tensions .
while albanians would like to become independent , serbs want more participation from belgrade to protect their rights . kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova on tuesday called for swift independence from serbia for the un-controlled province after last week 's violent clashes .
but un officials are demanding that democratic standards have to be introduced before that can happen . during last week 's bloodshed , 28 people were killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , were displaced from the homes .
nato has blamed extremist albanians for the violence and rugova promised a thorough investigation as well as actions to remedy the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova but un officials in kosovo expressed their disappointment that rugova -lrb- photo -rrb- and others had not explicitly condemned the attacks on serbs . " to my great astonishment and disappointment , something was left out , namely the condemnation of the violence against the serbs , " said harri holkeri , who heads the united nations interim administration mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- . jaap de hoop scheffer , nato 's secretary general , also condemned the clashes during a visit to kosovo on monday .
" what happened last week , orchestrated and organized by extremist factions in the albanian community , is unacceptable , " he said . war began five years ago bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of ethnic albanians fled the province in 1999 .
five years ago , on march 24 , 1999 , nato began air raids on yugoslavia with the goal of preventing a catastrophe by forcing slobodan milosevic to end military and police actions against ethnic albanians in kosovo . almost 80 days after the bombing began , the yugoslav president finally gave in .
international peacekeeping troops arrived in kosovo , which was put under un control .
slowly , democratic institutions were set up .
last year , the governments in serbia and kosovo began to talk to each other again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic albanians waiting to vote in the 2001 elections .
a lot has happened since then : kosovo elected a new president and a parliament , a government was formed , and the province got its own judiciary and police force .
the second parliamentary elections are scheduled for the fall . the unclear future status of kosovo is the biggest problem for ethnic albanians .
after the war , the un adopted resolution 1244 , which only called for a " substantial autonomy for the people of kosovo " and put the province under international control .
that 's not enough for the albanians , who want complete independence from belgrade . but the " decent and appropriate treatment of smaller ethnic groups " is one democratic standard un officials have demanded before agreeing to discuss the province 's future status .
the first to do so was michael steiner , who headed unmik until last july . he defined eight criteria , including functioning governmental institutions , freedom of movement , a functioning economy , as well as a working judiciary and police force .
those who fled from kosovo in 1999 would have to be allowed back too . negotiations possible in 2005 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harri holkeri steiner 's successor , harri holkeri -lrb- photo -rrb- fine-tuned the standards last december .
if these standards can be reached by mid-2005 , the international community has promised negotiations about kosovo 's status . serbia 's government and the serbs in kosovo fear that these standards and the deadline have made independence inevitable .
albanians in kosovo , on the other hand , are happy that a date has been set .
" it 's a great achievement as un resolution 1244 did n't set a date , " kosovo 's premier bajram rexhepi said . to ensure peaceful coexistence between albanians and serbs , unmik 's current efforts do n't suffice , according to some . " we have to try harder to correct our past mistakes , " said faruk spahija , the mayor of mitrovica .
" it 's possible to create a climate of peace in kosovo .
a lot more has to be done to adhere to the standards kosovo has been presented with .

" dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business does n't prevent competition ... and does not harm consumers and innovation , " eu competition commissioner mario monti said .
" today 's decision restores the conditions for fair competition in the markets concerned and establishes clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position . "
illegal behavior citing " illegal behavior " that is " ongoing , " the eu antitrust authority is calling for microsoft to implement a number of remedies .
the company has been ordered to offer a version of windows without its digital media player in three months and to release the " complete and accurate " interface code to rival companies in the server market within four month .
the commission said the release of the code , a demand heatedly contested by microsoft , was necessary in order for server products created by competing companies to have " full interoperability " with computers running windows .
the commission said it would appoint a monitoring trustee " to ensure effective and timely compliance . "
the ruling is the highest ever penalty imposed by the eu 's executive branch against a single company for violating competition regulations .
microsoft , the world 's biggest software firm , has denied it abuses the overwhelming dominance of its windows operating system to illegally crush competitors .
it said eu regulators were unjustified in proposing such a large fine .
" we worked hard to reach an agreement that would address the european commission 's concerns and still allow us to innovate and improve our products for consumers , " said steve ballmer , chief executive officer of microsoft .
" we respect the commission 's authority , but we believe that our settlement offer from last week would have offered far more choices and benefits to consumers . "
the company said it would file an appeal with the eu 's court of first instance in luxembourg .
painful remedies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commissioner for competition mario monti but chief executive steve ballmer is less worried about the financial penalties , which will probably not cause too much pain for the seattle-based company given its cash reserves of some $ 53 billion .
it 's more the list of " remedies " the eu competition authorities have handed down that is cause for concern for the company , which has sought to expand its operating system to incorporate almost all facets of the internet .
monti has said he fears that if unchecked , microsoft would continue to exploit its monopoly when it launches its windows successor , longhorn , which combines built-in search engine capabilities and 3-d graphics to compete with internet companies like google and yahoo .
but ballmer , who is currently in brussels , rejects such demands , saying it limits microsoft 's ability to develop new products and integrate them into the operating system in the future .
according to the company spokesman , the eu regulations serve only as a " stumbling block to the company 's capacity to innovate . "
monti , whose five-year term as competition commissioner ends in october , is not flinching on what is without a doubt the commission 's biggest anti-trust case .
despite hefty criticism that the verdict will do nothing for competition and everything to block innovation , the guardian of fair trade practices said ahead of wednesday 's decision : " it is essential to have a clear principle for the future conduct of a company which has such a strong dominant position in the market . "
a history of investigations this was n't the first time microsoft found itself under the watchful gaze of anti-trust investigators .
in a spectacular anti-trust case in the united states , the government threatened to split microsoft up into different companies at the turn of the century .
the company 's operating system can be found in 95 percent of the desktop computers worldwide , and u.s. courts determined that microsoft had repeatedly abused its monopoly status .
but after then-president bill clinton left office , microsoft cut a deal with the justice department and several states , effectively resolving the anti-trust case .
however , the european commission continued to follow up complaints from microsoft competitors filed five years ago .
sun microsystems , for example , charged that microsoft had integrated applications like the internet explorer web browser and digital media programs into its operating system in a way that largely banished any competition for the applications .
the commission later held that microsoft had violated competition laws and sought to negotiate a settlement with the redmond , washington-based company .
but talks failed earlier this week , setting the scene for the ruling .
fear of lawsuits micrsoft initially sought to avoid formal punishment from the european commission because , it feared , it could be used as a precedent for costly lawsuits against the company in other countries including the u.s. both microsoft and the commission agreed that the company had abused its monopoly status .
microsoft even agreed to decouple its internet explorer and windows xp software .

" dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business does n't prevent competition ... and does not harm consumers and innovation , " eu competition commissioner mario monti said .
" today 's decision restores the conditions for fair competition in the markets concerned and establishes clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position . "
illegal behavior citing " illegal behavior " that is " ongoing , " the eu antitrust authority is calling for microsoft to implement a number of remedies .
the company has been ordered to offer a version of windows without its digital media player in three months and to release the " complete and accurate " interface code to rival companies in the server market within four month .
the commission said the release of the code , a demand heatedly contested by microsoft , was necessary in order for server products created by competing companies to have " full interoperability " with computers running windows .
the commission said it would appoint a monitoring trustee " to ensure effective and timely compliance . "
the ruling is the highest ever penalty imposed by the eu 's executive branch against a single company for violating competition regulations .
microsoft , the world 's biggest software firm , has denied it abuses the overwhelming dominance of its windows operating system to illegally crush competitors .
it said eu regulators were unjustified in proposing such a large fine .
" we worked hard to reach an agreement that would address the european commission 's concerns and still allow us to innovate and improve our products for consumers , " said steve ballmer , chief executive officer of microsoft .
" we respect the commission 's authority , but we believe that our settlement offer from last week would have offered far more choices and benefits to consumers . "
the company said it would file an appeal with the eu 's court of first instance in luxembourg .
painful remedies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commissioner for competition mario monti but chief executive steve ballmer is less worried about the financial penalties , which will probably not cause too much pain for the seattle-based company given its cash reserves of some $ 53 billion .
it 's more the list of " remedies " the eu competition authorities have handed down that is cause for concern for the company , which has sought to expand its operating system to incorporate almost all facets of the internet .
monti has said he fears that if unchecked , microsoft would continue to exploit its monopoly when it launches its windows successor , longhorn , which combines built-in search engine capabilities and 3-d graphics to compete with internet companies like google and yahoo .
but ballmer , who is currently in brussels , rejects such demands , saying it limits microsoft 's ability to develop new products and integrate them into the operating system in the future .
according to the company spokesman , the eu regulations serve only as a " stumbling block to the company 's capacity to innovate . "
monti , whose five-year term as competition commissioner ends in october , is not flinching on what is without a doubt the commission 's biggest anti-trust case .
despite hefty criticism that the verdict will do nothing for competition and everything to block innovation , the guardian of fair trade practices said ahead of wednesday 's decision : " it is essential to have a clear principle for the future conduct of a company which has such a strong dominant position in the market . "
a history of investigations this was n't the first time microsoft found itself under the watchful gaze of anti-trust investigators .
in a spectacular anti-trust case in the united states , the government threatened to split microsoft up into different companies at the turn of the century .
the company 's operating system can be found in 95 percent of the desktop computers worldwide , and u.s. courts determined that microsoft had repeatedly abused its monopoly status .
but after then-president bill clinton left office , microsoft cut a deal with the justice department and several states , effectively resolving the anti-trust case .
however , the european commission continued to follow up complaints from microsoft competitors filed five years ago .
sun microsystems , for example , charged that microsoft had integrated applications like the internet explorer web browser and digital media programs into its operating system in a way that largely banished any competition for the applications .
the commission later held that microsoft had violated competition laws and sought to negotiate a settlement with the redmond , washington-based company .
but talks failed earlier this week , setting the scene for the ruling .
fear of lawsuits micrsoft initially sought to avoid formal punishment from the european commission because , it feared , it could be used as a precedent for costly lawsuits against the company in other countries including the u.s. both microsoft and the commission agreed that the company had abused its monopoly status .
microsoft even agreed to decouple its internet explorer and windows xp software .
but that proposal did n't go far enough for monti .

five years after the war , kosovo remains troubled by ethnic tensions .
while albanians would like to become independent , serbs want more participation from belgrade to protect their rights . kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova on tuesday called for swift independence from serbia for the un-controlled province after last week 's violent clashes .
but un officials are demanding that democratic standards have to be introduced before that can happen . during last week 's bloodshed , 28 people were killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , were displaced from the homes .
nato has blamed extremist albanians for the violence and rugova promised a thorough investigation as well as actions to remedy the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova but un officials in kosovo expressed their disappointment that rugova -lrb- photo -rrb- and others had not explicitly condemned the attacks on serbs . " to my great astonishment and disappointment , something was left out , namely the condemnation of the violence against the serbs , " said harri holkeri , who heads the united nations interim administration mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- . jaap de hoop scheffer , nato 's secretary general , also condemned the clashes during a visit to kosovo on monday .
" what happened last week , orchestrated and organized by extremist factions in the albanian community , is unacceptable , " he said . war began five years ago bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of ethnic albanians fled the province in 1999 .
five years ago , on march 24 , 1999 , nato began air raids on yugoslavia with the goal of preventing a catastrophe by forcing slobodan milosevic to end military and police actions against ethnic albanians in kosovo . almost 80 days after the bombing began , the yugoslav president finally gave in .
international peacekeeping troops arrived in kosovo , which was put under un control .
slowly , democratic institutions were set up .
last year , the governments in serbia and kosovo began to talk to each other again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic albanians waiting to vote in the 2001 elections .
a lot has happened since then : kosovo elected a new president and a parliament , a government was formed , and the province got its own judiciary and police force .
the second parliamentary elections are scheduled for the fall . the unclear future status of kosovo is the biggest problem for ethnic albanians .
after the war , the un adopted resolution 1244 , which only called for a " substantial autonomy for the people of kosovo " and put the province under international control .
that 's not enough for the albanians , who want complete independence from belgrade . but the " decent and appropriate treatment of smaller ethnic groups " is one democratic standard un officials have demanded before agreeing to discuss the province 's future status .
the first to do so was michael steiner , who headed unmik until last july . he defined eight criteria , including functioning governmental institutions , freedom of movement , a functioning economy , as well as a working judiciary and police force .
those who fled from kosovo in 1999 would have to be allowed back too . negotiations possible in 2005 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harri holkeri steiner 's successor , harri holkeri -lrb- photo -rrb- fine-tuned the standards last december .
if these standards can be reached by mid-2005 , the international community has promised negotiations about kosovo 's status . serbia 's government and the serbs in kosovo fear that these standards and the deadline have made independence inevitable .
albanians in kosovo , on the other hand , are happy that a date has been set .
" it 's a great achievement as un resolution 1244 did n't set a date , " kosovo 's premier bajram rexhepi said . to ensure peaceful coexistence between albanians and serbs , unmik 's current efforts do n't suffice , according to some . " we have to try harder to correct our past mistakes , " said faruk spahija , the mayor of mitrovica .
" it 's possible to create a climate of peace in kosovo .
a lot more has to be done to adhere to the standards kosovo has been presented with .

five years ago , nato began air raids on yugoslavia to stop violence in kosovo .
it was an important and controversial event for german foreign policy : for the first time since 1945 , german soldiers participated in combat . kosovo was n't the first postwar foreign mission for the bundeswehr , as the german military is called .
german soldiers had participated in un missions since the early 1990s , mainly offering humanitarian assistance . however , the use of military force abroad in kosovo helped redefine german foreign policy in a way that continues today .
germany 's leading role in the stabilization of afghanistan and deployment of naval power off the coast of africa to combat international terrorism are the best examples of how things have changed . only a decade ago , those missions would have been unthinkable . in 1994 , social democrats , who were in opposition at the time , and some free democrats , who formed part of the governing coalition , filed a complaint with the constitutional court against foreign missions by the bundeswehr .
helmut kohl , germany 's christian democratic chancellor at the time , and his cabinet of ministers had approved the missions without the parliament 's consent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers the plaintiffs asked the court to clarify the legislature 's rights in deciding about military missions .
they also wanted to know whether the constitution allowed german soldiers to participate in such actions at all , as the bundeswehr 's scope of activities had been limited to defending germany so far . clearing the way for germany 's participation in military strikes , the country 's highest judges ruled that such an involvement was constitutional as long as a un or nato mandate existed . warming up to military action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers in bosnia the bundeswehr went to the balkans , where german soldiers became part of nato 's ifor operation in bosnia from 1995 to 1996 .
the mission gave the bundeswehr a chance to get experience in conflict resolution , according to hans frank , a former vice admiral who now heads the federal college for security policy studies in berlin . " we participated in stabilization efforts after military action , but never in the action itself , " frank said .
" kosovo showed that sometimes the use of force is necessary to squelch a developing conflict and return to stability . " using military force was the point in question .
until that time , german soldiers abroad had only used their weapons for self-defense .
now nato decided to bomb yugoslavia to end the atrocities that state forces were committing against ethnic albanians in kosovo .
the german parliament voted in favor of bundeswehr participation in october 1998 , and the bombing began on march 24 , 1999 , exactly five years ago . a first for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder standing in front of a eurofighter jet .
germany was n't waging a war but had been called upon to secure peace in kosovo with military force , german chancellor gerhard schröder explained to the nation in a television speech . by doing so , he articulated a new and important basis of german foreign policy : the deployment of force and - german - soldiers can be a last resort to resolve a crisis . at the same time , the federal government turned reunified germany into an equal and serious nato partner .
fourteen bundeswehr tornado fighters took off on 500 missions - mostly for reconnaissance purposes but also against yugoslav anti-aircraft stations . it was a decisive and completely novel step for the bundeswehr , which has to be seen in the context of its history , frank said . " but first and foremost it was a political decision , and a very important one , " he said .
" no government of the federal republic had been asked to make that decision to enter a war so far . " even after nato air raids began , all parties , except the post-communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , supported germany 's participation in the war .
seven of 47 green parliamentarians called for an immediate end to the mission , but the party leadership surrounding foreign minister joschka fischer backed the decision . after the war , the bundeswehr almost immediately went from taking military action to trying to stabilize the situation ; the un 's kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- peacekeepers took over once nato had ended the bombardments on june 10 , 1999 . shortly after , klaus reinhardt became the first german general to lead a nato mission outside the alliance 's territory .
today , the bundeswehr , which is sending an additional 600 troops to kosovo after last week 's violent clashes , remains one of the biggest forces within kfor . nina werkhäuser -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder rules out peacekeepers as iraqis ok constitution the iraqi governing council agreed on an interim constitution on monday which could pave the way to a return of sovereignty .
meanwhile , gerhard schröder again ruled out any german involvement in peacekeeping in iraq .
-lrb- march 1 , 2004 -rrb- why germany voted ' yes ' to invade yugoslavia but ' no ' to iraq chancellor gerhard schröder has ruled out german military participation in an iraq war .
but four years ago the bundeswehr took part in nato air strikes on yugoslavia without a u.n. mandate .
so why then and not now ?

ballendorf in southwestern germany has made headlines across the country : election officials annulled the recent mayoral election there after the winner admitted buying beers for 21 of the 660 villagers . when ballendorfers went to the polls a few weeks ago , they narrowly chose andreas benz , a 45-year-old farmer , as their new mayor .
he got 17 more votes than his opponent , manfred schlumpberger , an electrician from neighboring heuchlingen .
-lrb- in germany , people do n't have to be residents of a town to run for office there . -rrb- the narrow outcome of the election caused county officials in nearby ulm to listen carefully , when an unnamed informant - not schlumpberger - told them what had happened during ballendorf 's election campaign .
after all , benz may have won the election because he paid for beer and gave money to a local group , as the informant had told officials . the mayor-elect readily confirmed and clarified the facts : over the course of two nights , he had bought 21 beers for people in ballendorf 's sports and singing clubs .
he had also given € 50 -lrb- $ 60 -rrb- to a youth group to repair the roof of their meeting place .
" that 's how it 's done , " he told dw-world . " this is crazy " calling it an illegal attempt to influence voters , the county 's election officials annulled the vote and the district attorney 's office announced it would investigate the case .
in the worst case scenario , benz could be punished with five years in prison for bribing voters . " this is crazy , " benz said , adding that neither he nor many other ballendorfers could understand the authorities .
" it 's not surprising that nothing works in this country any more .
do n't people have other things to worry about ? " ballendorfers will now have to choose a new mayor again , by september at the latest .
benz said he has n't decided whether he 's going to run for office again and added that he first has to digest what 's been happening .

five years after the war , kosovo remains troubled by ethnic tensions .
while albanians would like to become independent , serbs want more participation from belgrade to protect their rights . kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova on tuesday called for swift independence from serbia for the un-controlled province after last week 's violent clashes .
but un officials are demanding that democratic standards have to be introduced before that can happen . during last week 's bloodshed , 28 people were killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , were displaced from the homes .

that 's not enough for the albanians , who want complete independence from belgrade . but the " decent and appropriate treatment of smaller ethnic groups " is one democratic standard un officials have demanded before agreeing to discuss the province 's future status .

ballendorf in southwestern germany has made headlines across the country : election officials annulled the recent mayoral election there after the winner admitted buying beers for 21 of the 660 villagers . when ballendorfers went to the polls a few weeks ago , they narrowly chose andreas benz , a 45-year-old farmer , as their new mayor .
he got 17 more votes than his opponent , manfred schlumpberger , an electrician from neighboring heuchlingen .
-lrb- in germany , people do n't have to be residents of a town to run for office there . -rrb- the narrow outcome of the election caused county officials in nearby ulm to listen carefully , when an unnamed informant - not schlumpberger - told them what had happened during ballendorf 's election campaign .
after all , benz may have won the election because he paid for beer and gave money to a local group , as the informant had told officials . the mayor-elect readily confirmed and clarified the facts : over the course of two nights , he had bought 21 beers for people in ballendorf 's sports and singing clubs .
he had also given € 50 -lrb- $ 60 -rrb- to a youth group to repair the roof of their meeting place .
" that 's how it 's done , " he told dw-world . " this is crazy " calling it an illegal attempt to influence voters , the county 's election officials annulled the vote and the district attorney 's office announced it would investigate the case .
in the worst case scenario , benz could be punished with five years in prison for bribing voters . " this is crazy , " benz said , adding that neither he nor many other ballendorfers could understand the authorities .
" it 's not surprising that nothing works in this country any more .
do n't people have other things to worry about ? " ballendorfers will now have to choose a new mayor again , by september at the latest .
benz said he has n't decided whether he 's going to run for office again and added that he first has to digest what 's been happening .
one thing 's for certain , though : it 's going to be a very dry campaign . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's favorite beverage : beer read dw-world 's collection of stories on the subject .

five years ago , nato began air raids on yugoslavia to stop violence in kosovo .
it was an important and controversial event for german foreign policy : for the first time since 1945 , german soldiers participated in combat . kosovo was n't the first postwar foreign mission for the bundeswehr , as the german military is called .
german soldiers had participated in un missions since the early 1990s , mainly offering humanitarian assistance . however , the use of military force abroad in kosovo helped redefine german foreign policy in a way that continues today .
germany 's leading role in the stabilization of afghanistan and deployment of naval power off the coast of africa to combat international terrorism are the best examples of how things have changed . only a decade ago , those missions would have been unthinkable . in 1994 , social democrats , who were in opposition at the time , and some free democrats , who formed part of the governing coalition , filed a complaint with the constitutional court against foreign missions by the bundeswehr .
helmut kohl , germany 's christian democratic chancellor at the time , and his cabinet of ministers had approved the missions without the parliament 's consent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers the plaintiffs asked the court to clarify the legislature 's rights in deciding about military missions .
they also wanted to know whether the constitution allowed german soldiers to participate in such actions at all , as the bundeswehr 's scope of activities had been limited to defending germany so far . clearing the way for germany 's participation in military strikes , the country 's highest judges ruled that such an involvement was constitutional as long as a un or nato mandate existed . warming up to military action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers in bosnia the bundeswehr went to the balkans , where german soldiers became part of nato 's ifor operation in bosnia from 1995 to 1996 .
the mission gave the bundeswehr a chance to get experience in conflict resolution , according to hans frank , a former vice admiral who now heads the federal college for security policy studies in berlin . " we participated in stabilization efforts after military action , but never in the action itself , " frank said .
" kosovo showed that sometimes the use of force is necessary to squelch a developing conflict and return to stability . " using military force was the point in question .
until that time , german soldiers abroad had only used their weapons for self-defense .
now nato decided to bomb yugoslavia to end the atrocities that state forces were committing against ethnic albanians in kosovo .
the german parliament voted in favor of bundeswehr participation in october 1998 , and the bombing began on march 24 , 1999 , exactly five years ago . a first for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder standing in front of a eurofighter jet .
germany was n't waging a war but had been called upon to secure peace in kosovo with military force , german chancellor gerhard schröder explained to the nation in a television speech . by doing so , he articulated a new and important basis of german foreign policy : the deployment of force and - german - soldiers can be a last resort to resolve a crisis . at the same time , the federal government turned reunified germany into an equal and serious nato partner .
fourteen bundeswehr tornado fighters took off on 500 missions - mostly for reconnaissance purposes but also against yugoslav anti-aircraft stations . it was a decisive and completely novel step for the bundeswehr , which has to be seen in the context of its history , frank said . " but first and foremost it was a political decision , and a very important one , " he said .
" no government of the federal republic had been asked to make that decision to enter a war so far . " even after nato air raids began , all parties , except the post-communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , supported germany 's participation in the war .
seven of 47 green parliamentarians called for an immediate end to the mission , but the party leadership surrounding foreign minister joschka fischer backed the decision . after the war , the bundeswehr almost immediately went from taking military action to trying to stabilize the situation ; the un 's kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- peacekeepers took over once nato had ended the bombardments on june 10 , 1999 . shortly after , klaus reinhardt became the first german general to lead a nato mission outside the alliance 's territory .
today , the bundeswehr , which is sending an additional 600 troops to kosovo after last week 's violent clashes , remains one of the biggest forces within kfor . nina werkhäuser -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder rules out peacekeepers as iraqis ok constitution the iraqi governing council agreed on an interim constitution on monday which could pave the way to a return of sovereignty .
meanwhile , gerhard schröder again ruled out any german involvement in peacekeeping in iraq .
-lrb- march 1 , 2004 -rrb- why germany voted ' yes ' to invade yugoslavia but ' no ' to iraq chancellor gerhard schröder has ruled out german military participation in an iraq war .
but four years ago the bundeswehr took part in nato air strikes on yugoslavia without a u.n. mandate .
so why then and not now ?

ballendorf in southwestern germany has made headlines across the country : election officials annulled the recent mayoral election there after the winner admitted buying beers for 21 of the 660 villagers . when ballendorfers went to the polls a few weeks ago , they narrowly chose andreas benz , a 45-year-old farmer , as their new mayor .
he got 17 more votes than his opponent , manfred schlumpberger , an electrician from neighboring heuchlingen .
-lrb- in germany , people do n't have to be residents of a town to run for office there . -rrb- the narrow outcome of the election caused county officials in nearby ulm to listen carefully , when an unnamed informant - not schlumpberger - told them what had happened during ballendorf 's election campaign .
after all , benz may have won the election because he paid for beer and gave money to a local group , as the informant had told officials . the mayor-elect readily confirmed and clarified the facts : over the course of two nights , he had bought 21 beers for people in ballendorf 's sports and singing clubs .
he had also given € 50 -lrb- $ 60 -rrb- to a youth group to repair the roof of their meeting place .
" that 's how it 's done , " he told dw-world . " this is crazy " calling it an illegal attempt to influence voters , the county 's election officials annulled the vote and the district attorney 's office announced it would investigate the case .
in the worst case scenario , benz could be punished with five years in prison for bribing voters . " this is crazy , " benz said , adding that neither he nor many other ballendorfers could understand the authorities .
" it 's not surprising that nothing works in this country any more .
do n't people have other things to worry about ? " ballendorfers will now have to choose a new mayor again , by september at the latest .
benz said he has n't decided whether he 's going to run for office again and added that he first has to digest what 's been happening .
one thing 's for certain , though : it 's going to be a very dry campaign . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's favorite beverage : beer read dw-world 's collection of stories on the subject .
feedback do you think county officials did the right thing when they annulled the election ?

five years ago , nato began air raids on yugoslavia to stop violence in kosovo .
it was an important and controversial event for german foreign policy : for the first time since 1945 , german soldiers participated in combat . kosovo was n't the first postwar foreign mission for the bundeswehr , as the german military is called .
german soldiers had participated in un missions since the early 1990s , mainly offering humanitarian assistance . however , the use of military force abroad in kosovo helped redefine german foreign policy in a way that continues today .
germany 's leading role in the stabilization of afghanistan and deployment of naval power off the coast of africa to combat international terrorism are the best examples of how things have changed . only a decade ago , those missions would have been unthinkable . in 1994 , social democrats , who were in opposition at the time , and some free democrats , who formed part of the governing coalition , filed a complaint with the constitutional court against foreign missions by the bundeswehr .
helmut kohl , germany 's christian democratic chancellor at the time , and his cabinet of ministers had approved the missions without the parliament 's consent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers the plaintiffs asked the court to clarify the legislature 's rights in deciding about military missions .
they also wanted to know whether the constitution allowed german soldiers to participate in such actions at all , as the bundeswehr 's scope of activities had been limited to defending germany so far . clearing the way for germany 's participation in military strikes , the country 's highest judges ruled that such an involvement was constitutional as long as a un or nato mandate existed . warming up to military action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers in bosnia the bundeswehr went to the balkans , where german soldiers became part of nato 's ifor operation in bosnia from 1995 to 1996 .
the mission gave the bundeswehr a chance to get experience in conflict resolution , according to hans frank , a former vice admiral who now heads the federal college for security policy studies in berlin . " we participated in stabilization efforts after military action , but never in the action itself , " frank said .
" kosovo showed that sometimes the use of force is necessary to squelch a developing conflict and return to stability . " using military force was the point in question .
until that time , german soldiers abroad had only used their weapons for self-defense .
now nato decided to bomb yugoslavia to end the atrocities that state forces were committing against ethnic albanians in kosovo .
the german parliament voted in favor of bundeswehr participation in october 1998 , and the bombing began on march 24 , 1999 , exactly five years ago . a first for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder standing in front of a eurofighter jet .
germany was n't waging a war but had been called upon to secure peace in kosovo with military force , german chancellor gerhard schröder explained to the nation in a television speech . by doing so , he articulated a new and important basis of german foreign policy : the deployment of force and - german - soldiers can be a last resort to resolve a crisis . at the same time , the federal government turned reunified germany into an equal and serious nato partner .
fourteen bundeswehr tornado fighters took off on 500 missions - mostly for reconnaissance purposes but also against yugoslav anti-aircraft stations . it was a decisive and completely novel step for the bundeswehr , which has to be seen in the context of its history , frank said . " but first and foremost it was a political decision , and a very important one , " he said .
" no government of the federal republic had been asked to make that decision to enter a war so far . " even after nato air raids began , all parties , except the post-communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , supported germany 's participation in the war .
seven of 47 green parliamentarians called for an immediate end to the mission , but the party leadership surrounding foreign minister joschka fischer backed the decision . after the war , the bundeswehr almost immediately went from taking military action to trying to stabilize the situation ; the un 's kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- peacekeepers took over once nato had ended the bombardments on june 10 , 1999 . shortly after , klaus reinhardt became the first german general to lead a nato mission outside the alliance 's territory .

five years ago , nato began air raids on yugoslavia to stop violence in kosovo .
it was an important and controversial event for german foreign policy : for the first time since 1945 , german soldiers participated in combat . kosovo was n't the first postwar foreign mission for the bundeswehr , as the german military is called .
german soldiers had participated in un missions since the early 1990s , mainly offering humanitarian assistance . however , the use of military force abroad in kosovo helped redefine german foreign policy in a way that continues today .
germany 's leading role in the stabilization of afghanistan and deployment of naval power off the coast of africa to combat international terrorism are the best examples of how things have changed . only a decade ago , those missions would have been unthinkable . in 1994 , social democrats , who were in opposition at the time , and some free democrats , who formed part of the governing coalition , filed a complaint with the constitutional court against foreign missions by the bundeswehr .
helmut kohl , germany 's christian democratic chancellor at the time , and his cabinet of ministers had approved the missions without the parliament 's consent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers the plaintiffs asked the court to clarify the legislature 's rights in deciding about military missions .
they also wanted to know whether the constitution allowed german soldiers to participate in such actions at all , as the bundeswehr 's scope of activities had been limited to defending germany so far . clearing the way for germany 's participation in military strikes , the country 's highest judges ruled that such an involvement was constitutional as long as a un or nato mandate existed . warming up to military action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr soldiers in bosnia the bundeswehr went to the balkans , where german soldiers became part of nato 's ifor operation in bosnia from 1995 to 1996 .
the mission gave the bundeswehr a chance to get experience in conflict resolution , according to hans frank , a former vice admiral who now heads the federal college for security policy studies in berlin . " we participated in stabilization efforts after military action , but never in the action itself , " frank said .
" kosovo showed that sometimes the use of force is necessary to squelch a developing conflict and return to stability . " using military force was the point in question .
until that time , german soldiers abroad had only used their weapons for self-defense .
now nato decided to bomb yugoslavia to end the atrocities that state forces were committing against ethnic albanians in kosovo .
the german parliament voted in favor of bundeswehr participation in october 1998 , and the bombing began on march 24 , 1999 , exactly five years ago . a first for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder standing in front of a eurofighter jet .
germany was n't waging a war but had been called upon to secure peace in kosovo with military force , german chancellor gerhard schröder explained to the nation in a television speech . by doing so , he articulated a new and important basis of german foreign policy : the deployment of force and - german - soldiers can be a last resort to resolve a crisis . at the same time , the federal government turned reunified germany into an equal and serious nato partner .
fourteen bundeswehr tornado fighters took off on 500 missions - mostly for reconnaissance purposes but also against yugoslav anti-aircraft stations . it was a decisive and completely novel step for the bundeswehr , which has to be seen in the context of its history , frank said . " but first and foremost it was a political decision , and a very important one , " he said .
" no government of the federal republic had been asked to make that decision to enter a war so far . " even after nato air raids began , all parties , except the post-communist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , supported germany 's participation in the war .
seven of 47 green parliamentarians called for an immediate end to the mission , but the party leadership surrounding foreign minister joschka fischer backed the decision . after the war , the bundeswehr almost immediately went from taking military action to trying to stabilize the situation ; the un 's kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- peacekeepers took over once nato had ended the bombardments on june 10 , 1999 . shortly after , klaus reinhardt became the first german general to lead a nato mission outside the alliance 's territory .
today , the bundeswehr , which is sending an additional 600 troops to kosovo after last week 's violent clashes , remains one of the biggest forces within kfor . nina werkhäuser -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder rules out peacekeepers as iraqis ok constitution the iraqi governing council agreed on an interim constitution on monday which could pave the way to a return of sovereignty .

five years after the war , kosovo remains troubled by ethnic tensions .
while albanians would like to become independent , serbs want more participation from belgrade to protect their rights . kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova on tuesday called for swift independence from serbia for the un-controlled province after last week 's violent clashes .
but un officials are demanding that democratic standards have to be introduced before that can happen . during last week 's bloodshed , 28 people were killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , were displaced from the homes .
nato has blamed extremist albanians for the violence and rugova promised a thorough investigation as well as actions to remedy the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova but un officials in kosovo expressed their disappointment that rugova -lrb- photo -rrb- and others had not explicitly condemned the attacks on serbs . " to my great astonishment and disappointment , something was left out , namely the condemnation of the violence against the serbs , " said harri holkeri , who heads the united nations interim administration mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- . jaap de hoop scheffer , nato 's secretary general , also condemned the clashes during a visit to kosovo on monday .
" what happened last week , orchestrated and organized by extremist factions in the albanian community , is unacceptable , " he said . war began five years ago bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of ethnic albanians fled the province in 1999 .
five years ago , on march 24 , 1999 , nato began air raids on yugoslavia with the goal of preventing a catastrophe by forcing slobodan milosevic to end military and police actions against ethnic albanians in kosovo . almost 80 days after the bombing began , the yugoslav president finally gave in .
international peacekeeping troops arrived in kosovo , which was put under un control .
slowly , democratic institutions were set up .
last year , the governments in serbia and kosovo began to talk to each other again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic albanians waiting to vote in the 2001 elections .
a lot has happened since then : kosovo elected a new president and a parliament , a government was formed , and the province got its own judiciary and police force .
the second parliamentary elections are scheduled for the fall . the unclear future status of kosovo is the biggest problem for ethnic albanians .
after the war , the un adopted resolution 1244 , which only called for a " substantial autonomy for the people of kosovo " and put the province under international control .
that 's not enough for the albanians , who want complete independence from belgrade . but the " decent and appropriate treatment of smaller ethnic groups " is one democratic standard un officials have demanded before agreeing to discuss the province 's future status .
the first to do so was michael steiner , who headed unmik until last july . he defined eight criteria , including functioning governmental institutions , freedom of movement , a functioning economy , as well as a working judiciary and police force .
those who fled from kosovo in 1999 would have to be allowed back too . negotiations possible in 2005 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harri holkeri steiner 's successor , harri holkeri -lrb- photo -rrb- fine-tuned the standards last december .
if these standards can be reached by mid-2005 , the international community has promised negotiations about kosovo 's status . serbia 's government and the serbs in kosovo fear that these standards and the deadline have made independence inevitable .
albanians in kosovo , on the other hand , are happy that a date has been set .
" it 's a great achievement as un resolution 1244 did n't set a date , " kosovo 's premier bajram rexhepi said . to ensure peaceful coexistence between albanians and serbs , unmik 's current efforts do n't suffice , according to some . " we have to try harder to correct our past mistakes , " said faruk spahija , the mayor of mitrovica .
" it 's possible to create a climate of peace in kosovo .

" dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business does n't prevent competition ... and does not harm consumers and innovation , " eu competition commissioner mario monti said .
" today 's decision restores the conditions for fair competition in the markets concerned and establishes clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position . "
illegal behavior citing " illegal behavior " that is " ongoing , " the eu antitrust authority is calling for microsoft to implement a number of remedies .
the company has been ordered to offer a version of windows without its digital media player in three months and to release the " complete and accurate " interface code to rival companies in the server market within four month .
the commission said the release of the code , a demand heatedly contested by microsoft , was necessary in order for server products created by competing companies to have " full interoperability " with computers running windows .
the commission said it would appoint a monitoring trustee " to ensure effective and timely compliance . "
the ruling is the highest ever penalty imposed by the eu 's executive branch against a single company for violating competition regulations .
microsoft , the world 's biggest software firm , has denied it abuses the overwhelming dominance of its windows operating system to illegally crush competitors .
it said eu regulators were unjustified in proposing such a large fine .
" we worked hard to reach an agreement that would address the european commission 's concerns and still allow us to innovate and improve our products for consumers , " said steve ballmer , chief executive officer of microsoft .
" we respect the commission 's authority , but we believe that our settlement offer from last week would have offered far more choices and benefits to consumers . "
the company said it would file an appeal with the eu 's court of first instance in luxembourg .

it 's more the list of " remedies " the eu competition authorities have handed down that is cause for concern for the company , which has sought to expand its operating system to incorporate almost all facets of the internet .
monti has said he fears that if unchecked , microsoft would continue to exploit its monopoly when it launches its windows successor , longhorn , which combines built-in search engine capabilities and 3-d graphics to compete with internet companies like google and yahoo .
but ballmer , who is currently in brussels , rejects such demands , saying it limits microsoft 's ability to develop new products and integrate them into the operating system in the future .
according to the company spokesman , the eu regulations serve only as a " stumbling block to the company 's capacity to innovate . "
monti , whose five-year term as competition commissioner ends in october , is not flinching on what is without a doubt the commission 's biggest anti-trust case .
despite hefty criticism that the verdict will do nothing for competition and everything to block innovation , the guardian of fair trade practices said ahead of wednesday 's decision : " it is essential to have a clear principle for the future conduct of a company which has such a strong dominant position in the market . "
a history of investigations this was n't the first time microsoft found itself under the watchful gaze of anti-trust investigators .
in a spectacular anti-trust case in the united states , the government threatened to split microsoft up into different companies at the turn of the century .
the company 's operating system can be found in 95 percent of the desktop computers worldwide , and u.s. courts determined that microsoft had repeatedly abused its monopoly status .
but after then-president bill clinton left office , microsoft cut a deal with the justice department and several states , effectively resolving the anti-trust case .
however , the european commission continued to follow up complaints from microsoft competitors filed five years ago .
sun microsystems , for example , charged that microsoft had integrated applications like the internet explorer web browser and digital media programs into its operating system in a way that largely banished any competition for the applications .
the commission later held that microsoft had violated competition laws and sought to negotiate a settlement with the redmond , washington-based company .
but talks failed earlier this week , setting the scene for the ruling .

while albanians would like to become independent , serbs want more participation from belgrade to protect their rights . kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova on tuesday called for swift independence from serbia for the un-controlled province after last week 's violent clashes .
but un officials are demanding that democratic standards have to be introduced before that can happen . during last week 's bloodshed , 28 people were killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , were displaced from the homes .
nato has blamed extremist albanians for the violence and rugova promised a thorough investigation as well as actions to remedy the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova but un officials in kosovo expressed their disappointment that rugova -lrb- photo -rrb- and others had not explicitly condemned the attacks on serbs . " to my great astonishment and disappointment , something was left out , namely the condemnation of the violence against the serbs , " said harri holkeri , who heads the united nations interim administration mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- . jaap de hoop scheffer , nato 's secretary general , also condemned the clashes during a visit to kosovo on monday .
" what happened last week , orchestrated and organized by extremist factions in the albanian community , is unacceptable , " he said . war began five years ago bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of ethnic albanians fled the province in 1999 .
five years ago , on march 24 , 1999 , nato began air raids on yugoslavia with the goal of preventing a catastrophe by forcing slobodan milosevic to end military and police actions against ethnic albanians in kosovo . almost 80 days after the bombing began , the yugoslav president finally gave in .
international peacekeeping troops arrived in kosovo , which was put under un control .
slowly , democratic institutions were set up .
last year , the governments in serbia and kosovo began to talk to each other again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic albanians waiting to vote in the 2001 elections .
a lot has happened since then : kosovo elected a new president and a parliament , a government was formed , and the province got its own judiciary and police force .
the second parliamentary elections are scheduled for the fall . the unclear future status of kosovo is the biggest problem for ethnic albanians .
after the war , the un adopted resolution 1244 , which only called for a " substantial autonomy for the people of kosovo " and put the province under international control .
that 's not enough for the albanians , who want complete independence from belgrade . but the " decent and appropriate treatment of smaller ethnic groups " is one democratic standard un officials have demanded before agreeing to discuss the province 's future status .
the first to do so was michael steiner , who headed unmik until last july . he defined eight criteria , including functioning governmental institutions , freedom of movement , a functioning economy , as well as a working judiciary and police force .
those who fled from kosovo in 1999 would have to be allowed back too . negotiations possible in 2005 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harri holkeri steiner 's successor , harri holkeri -lrb- photo -rrb- fine-tuned the standards last december .
if these standards can be reached by mid-2005 , the international community has promised negotiations about kosovo 's status . serbia 's government and the serbs in kosovo fear that these standards and the deadline have made independence inevitable .
albanians in kosovo , on the other hand , are happy that a date has been set .
" it 's a great achievement as un resolution 1244 did n't set a date , " kosovo 's premier bajram rexhepi said . to ensure peaceful coexistence between albanians and serbs , unmik 's current efforts do n't suffice , according to some . " we have to try harder to correct our past mistakes , " said faruk spahija , the mayor of mitrovica .
" it 's possible to create a climate of peace in kosovo .
a lot more has to be done to adhere to the standards kosovo has been presented with .

five years ago , nato began air raids on yugoslavia to stop violence in kosovo .
it was an important and controversial event for german foreign policy : for the first time since 1945 , german soldiers participated in combat . kosovo was n't the first postwar foreign mission for the bundeswehr , as the german military is called .
german soldiers had participated in un missions since the early 1990s , mainly offering humanitarian assistance . however , the use of military force abroad in kosovo helped redefine german foreign policy in a way that continues today .
germany 's leading role in the stabilization of afghanistan and deployment of naval power off the coast of africa to combat international terrorism are the best examples of how things have changed . only a decade ago , those missions would have been unthinkable . in 1994 , social democrats , who were in opposition at the time , and some free democrats , who formed part of the governing coalition , filed a complaint with the constitutional court against foreign missions by the bundeswehr .

" we participated in stabilization efforts after military action , but never in the action itself , " frank said .
" kosovo showed that sometimes the use of force is necessary to squelch a developing conflict and return to stability . " using military force was the point in question .
until that time , german soldiers abroad had only used their weapons for self-defense .
now nato decided to bomb yugoslavia to end the atrocities that state forces were committing against ethnic albanians in kosovo .

fourteen bundeswehr tornado fighters took off on 500 missions - mostly for reconnaissance purposes but also against yugoslav anti-aircraft stations . it was a decisive and completely novel step for the bundeswehr , which has to be seen in the context of its history , frank said .

ballendorf in southwestern germany has made headlines across the country : election officials annulled the recent mayoral election there after the winner admitted buying beers for 21 of the 660 villagers . when ballendorfers went to the polls a few weeks ago , they narrowly chose andreas benz , a 45-year-old farmer , as their new mayor .
he got 17 more votes than his opponent , manfred schlumpberger , an electrician from neighboring heuchlingen .
-lrb- in germany , people do n't have to be residents of a town to run for office there . -rrb- the narrow outcome of the election caused county officials in nearby ulm to listen carefully , when an unnamed informant - not schlumpberger - told them what had happened during ballendorf 's election campaign .
after all , benz may have won the election because he paid for beer and gave money to a local group , as the informant had told officials . the mayor-elect readily confirmed and clarified the facts : over the course of two nights , he had bought 21 beers for people in ballendorf 's sports and singing clubs .

five years ago , nato began air raids on yugoslavia to stop violence in kosovo .
it was an important and controversial event for german foreign policy : for the first time since 1945 , german soldiers participated in combat . kosovo was n't the first postwar foreign mission for the bundeswehr , as the german military is called .
german soldiers had participated in un missions since the early 1990s , mainly offering humanitarian assistance . however , the use of military force abroad in kosovo helped redefine german foreign policy in a way that continues today .
germany 's leading role in the stabilization of afghanistan and deployment of naval power off the coast of africa to combat international terrorism are the best examples of how things have changed . only a decade ago , those missions would have been unthinkable . in 1994 , social democrats , who were in opposition at the time , and some free democrats , who formed part of the governing coalition , filed a complaint with the constitutional court against foreign missions by the bundeswehr .

" kosovo showed that sometimes the use of force is necessary to squelch a developing conflict and return to stability . " using military force was the point in question .

five years after the war , kosovo remains troubled by ethnic tensions .
while albanians would like to become independent , serbs want more participation from belgrade to protect their rights . kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova on tuesday called for swift independence from serbia for the un-controlled province after last week 's violent clashes .
but un officials are demanding that democratic standards have to be introduced before that can happen . during last week 's bloodshed , 28 people were killed , 870 injured and thousands , mainly ethnic serbs , were displaced from the homes .
nato has blamed extremist albanians for the violence and rugova promised a thorough investigation as well as actions to remedy the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's president ibrahim rugova but un officials in kosovo expressed their disappointment that rugova -lrb- photo -rrb- and others had not explicitly condemned the attacks on serbs . " to my great astonishment and disappointment , something was left out , namely the condemnation of the violence against the serbs , " said harri holkeri , who heads the united nations interim administration mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- . jaap de hoop scheffer , nato 's secretary general , also condemned the clashes during a visit to kosovo on monday .
" what happened last week , orchestrated and organized by extremist factions in the albanian community , is unacceptable , " he said . war began five years ago bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of ethnic albanians fled the province in 1999 .
five years ago , on march 24 , 1999 , nato began air raids on yugoslavia with the goal of preventing a catastrophe by forcing slobodan milosevic to end military and police actions against ethnic albanians in kosovo . almost 80 days after the bombing began , the yugoslav president finally gave in .
international peacekeeping troops arrived in kosovo , which was put under un control .
slowly , democratic institutions were set up .
last year , the governments in serbia and kosovo began to talk to each other again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic albanians waiting to vote in the 2001 elections .
a lot has happened since then : kosovo elected a new president and a parliament , a government was formed , and the province got its own judiciary and police force .
the second parliamentary elections are scheduled for the fall . the unclear future status of kosovo is the biggest problem for ethnic albanians .
after the war , the un adopted resolution 1244 , which only called for a " substantial autonomy for the people of kosovo " and put the province under international control .
that 's not enough for the albanians , who want complete independence from belgrade . but the " decent and appropriate treatment of smaller ethnic groups " is one democratic standard un officials have demanded before agreeing to discuss the province 's future status .
the first to do so was michael steiner , who headed unmik until last july . he defined eight criteria , including functioning governmental institutions , freedom of movement , a functioning economy , as well as a working judiciary and police force .
those who fled from kosovo in 1999 would have to be allowed back too . negotiations possible in 2005 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harri holkeri steiner 's successor , harri holkeri -lrb- photo -rrb- fine-tuned the standards last december .
if these standards can be reached by mid-2005 , the international community has promised negotiations about kosovo 's status . serbia 's government and the serbs in kosovo fear that these standards and the deadline have made independence inevitable .
albanians in kosovo , on the other hand , are happy that a date has been set .
" it 's a great achievement as un resolution 1244 did n't set a date , " kosovo 's premier bajram rexhepi said . to ensure peaceful coexistence between albanians and serbs , unmik 's current efforts do n't suffice , according to some . " we have to try harder to correct our past mistakes , " said faruk spahija , the mayor of mitrovica .
" it 's possible to create a climate of peace in kosovo .

ballendorf in southwestern germany has made headlines across the country : election officials annulled the recent mayoral election there after the winner admitted buying beers for 21 of the 660 villagers . when ballendorfers went to the polls a few weeks ago , they narrowly chose andreas benz , a 45-year-old farmer , as their new mayor .
he got 17 more votes than his opponent , manfred schlumpberger , an electrician from neighboring heuchlingen .
-lrb- in germany , people do n't have to be residents of a town to run for office there . -rrb- the narrow outcome of the election caused county officials in nearby ulm to listen carefully , when an unnamed informant - not schlumpberger - told them what had happened during ballendorf 's election campaign .
after all , benz may have won the election because he paid for beer and gave money to a local group , as the informant had told officials . the mayor-elect readily confirmed and clarified the facts : over the course of two nights , he had bought 21 beers for people in ballendorf 's sports and singing clubs .
he had also given € 50 -lrb- $ 60 -rrb- to a youth group to repair the roof of their meeting place .
" that 's how it 's done , " he told dw-world . " this is crazy " calling it an illegal attempt to influence voters , the county 's election officials annulled the vote and the district attorney 's office announced it would investigate the case .
in the worst case scenario , benz could be punished with five years in prison for bribing voters . " this is crazy , " benz said , adding that neither he nor many other ballendorfers could understand the authorities .
" it 's not surprising that nothing works in this country any more .

" dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business does n't prevent competition ... and does not harm consumers and innovation , " eu competition commissioner mario monti said .
" today 's decision restores the conditions for fair competition in the markets concerned and establishes clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position . "
illegal behavior citing " illegal behavior " that is " ongoing , " the eu antitrust authority is calling for microsoft to implement a number of remedies .
the company has been ordered to offer a version of windows without its digital media player in three months and to release the " complete and accurate " interface code to rival companies in the server market within four month .
the commission said the release of the code , a demand heatedly contested by microsoft , was necessary in order for server products created by competing companies to have " full interoperability " with computers running windows .
the commission said it would appoint a monitoring trustee " to ensure effective and timely compliance . "
the ruling is the highest ever penalty imposed by the eu 's executive branch against a single company for violating competition regulations .
microsoft , the world 's biggest software firm , has denied it abuses the overwhelming dominance of its windows operating system to illegally crush competitors .
it said eu regulators were unjustified in proposing such a large fine .
" we worked hard to reach an agreement that would address the european commission 's concerns and still allow us to innovate and improve our products for consumers , " said steve ballmer , chief executive officer of microsoft .
" we respect the commission 's authority , but we believe that our settlement offer from last week would have offered far more choices and benefits to consumers . "
the company said it would file an appeal with the eu 's court of first instance in luxembourg .
painful remedies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commissioner for competition mario monti but chief executive steve ballmer is less worried about the financial penalties , which will probably not cause too much pain for the seattle-based company given its cash reserves of some $ 53 billion .
it 's more the list of " remedies " the eu competition authorities have handed down that is cause for concern for the company , which has sought to expand its operating system to incorporate almost all facets of the internet .
monti has said he fears that if unchecked , microsoft would continue to exploit its monopoly when it launches its windows successor , longhorn , which combines built-in search engine capabilities and 3-d graphics to compete with internet companies like google and yahoo .
but ballmer , who is currently in brussels , rejects such demands , saying it limits microsoft 's ability to develop new products and integrate them into the operating system in the future .
according to the company spokesman , the eu regulations serve only as a " stumbling block to the company 's capacity to innovate . "
monti , whose five-year term as competition commissioner ends in october , is not flinching on what is without a doubt the commission 's biggest anti-trust case .
despite hefty criticism that the verdict will do nothing for competition and everything to block innovation , the guardian of fair trade practices said ahead of wednesday 's decision : " it is essential to have a clear principle for the future conduct of a company which has such a strong dominant position in the market . "
a history of investigations this was n't the first time microsoft found itself under the watchful gaze of anti-trust investigators .
in a spectacular anti-trust case in the united states , the government threatened to split microsoft up into different companies at the turn of the century .
the company 's operating system can be found in 95 percent of the desktop computers worldwide , and u.s. courts determined that microsoft had repeatedly abused its monopoly status .
but after then-president bill clinton left office , microsoft cut a deal with the justice department and several states , effectively resolving the anti-trust case .
however , the european commission continued to follow up complaints from microsoft competitors filed five years ago .
sun microsystems , for example , charged that microsoft had integrated applications like the internet explorer web browser and digital media programs into its operating system in a way that largely banished any competition for the applications .
the commission later held that microsoft had violated competition laws and sought to negotiate a settlement with the redmond , washington-based company .
but talks failed earlier this week , setting the scene for the ruling .
fear of lawsuits micrsoft initially sought to avoid formal punishment from the european commission because , it feared , it could be used as a precedent for costly lawsuits against the company in other countries including the u.s. both microsoft and the commission agreed that the company had abused its monopoly status .
microsoft even agreed to decouple its internet explorer and windows xp software .
but that proposal did n't go far enough for monti .
" we made substantial progress towards resolving the problems but were unable to agree on commitments for future conduct , " monti said earlier this week . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de microsoft 's long road to brussels this week 's ruling should come as no surprise to microsoft .

" dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business does n't prevent competition ... and does not harm consumers and innovation , " eu competition commissioner mario monti said .
" today 's decision restores the conditions for fair competition in the markets concerned and establishes clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position . "
illegal behavior citing " illegal behavior " that is " ongoing , " the eu antitrust authority is calling for microsoft to implement a number of remedies .
the company has been ordered to offer a version of windows without its digital media player in three months and to release the " complete and accurate " interface code to rival companies in the server market within four month .
the commission said the release of the code , a demand heatedly contested by microsoft , was necessary in order for server products created by competing companies to have " full interoperability " with computers running windows .
the commission said it would appoint a monitoring trustee " to ensure effective and timely compliance . "
the ruling is the highest ever penalty imposed by the eu 's executive branch against a single company for violating competition regulations .
microsoft , the world 's biggest software firm , has denied it abuses the overwhelming dominance of its windows operating system to illegally crush competitors .
it said eu regulators were unjustified in proposing such a large fine .
" we worked hard to reach an agreement that would address the european commission 's concerns and still allow us to innovate and improve our products for consumers , " said steve ballmer , chief executive officer of microsoft .
" we respect the commission 's authority , but we believe that our settlement offer from last week would have offered far more choices and benefits to consumers . "
the company said it would file an appeal with the eu 's court of first instance in luxembourg .
painful remedies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commissioner for competition mario monti but chief executive steve ballmer is less worried about the financial penalties , which will probably not cause too much pain for the seattle-based company given its cash reserves of some $ 53 billion .
it 's more the list of " remedies " the eu competition authorities have handed down that is cause for concern for the company , which has sought to expand its operating system to incorporate almost all facets of the internet .
monti has said he fears that if unchecked , microsoft would continue to exploit its monopoly when it launches its windows successor , longhorn , which combines built-in search engine capabilities and 3-d graphics to compete with internet companies like google and yahoo .
but ballmer , who is currently in brussels , rejects such demands , saying it limits microsoft 's ability to develop new products and integrate them into the operating system in the future .
according to the company spokesman , the eu regulations serve only as a " stumbling block to the company 's capacity to innovate . "
monti , whose five-year term as competition commissioner ends in october , is not flinching on what is without a doubt the commission 's biggest anti-trust case .
despite hefty criticism that the verdict will do nothing for competition and everything to block innovation , the guardian of fair trade practices said ahead of wednesday 's decision : " it is essential to have a clear principle for the future conduct of a company which has such a strong dominant position in the market . "
a history of investigations this was n't the first time microsoft found itself under the watchful gaze of anti-trust investigators .
in a spectacular anti-trust case in the united states , the government threatened to split microsoft up into different companies at the turn of the century .
the company 's operating system can be found in 95 percent of the desktop computers worldwide , and u.s. courts determined that microsoft had repeatedly abused its monopoly status .
but after then-president bill clinton left office , microsoft cut a deal with the justice department and several states , effectively resolving the anti-trust case .
however , the european commission continued to follow up complaints from microsoft competitors filed five years ago .
sun microsystems , for example , charged that microsoft had integrated applications like the internet explorer web browser and digital media programs into its operating system in a way that largely banished any competition for the applications .
the commission later held that microsoft had violated competition laws and sought to negotiate a settlement with the redmond , washington-based company .
but talks failed earlier this week , setting the scene for the ruling .
fear of lawsuits micrsoft initially sought to avoid formal punishment from the european commission because , it feared , it could be used as a precedent for costly lawsuits against the company in other countries including the u.s. both microsoft and the commission agreed that the company had abused its monopoly status .
microsoft even agreed to decouple its internet explorer and windows xp software .
but that proposal did n't go far enough for monti .
" we made substantial progress towards resolving the problems but were unable to agree on commitments for future conduct , " monti said earlier this week . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de microsoft 's long road to brussels this week 's ruling should come as no surprise to microsoft .

on the contrary , it 's reality - coburg style .
after all , relatives do tend to come and visit .
using clever marriages as their vehicle , the dukes of saxe-coburg-gotha began to install their relatives on the thrones of europe 's royal houses at the end of the 18th century .
when all was said and done , coburg ruled half of the world .
europe 's stud farm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schloss ehrenburg " others may make war , but clever coburg marries ! " was for a long time the saying that summed up the duchy 's politics .
this " marital offensive " earned coburg the title " europe 's stud farm . "
thus , coburg 's royal house is tied to those of sweden , norway , belgium , spain and england .
with so much blue blood around , it 's no wonder that the town has a " touch of buckingham " to it .
coburg is one of several historic towns in franconia , a predominantly rural part of bavaria that was politically important in the days of the holy roman empire .
neighboring and perhaps better known towns include bayreuth , bamberg and nuremberg .
starting in the mid 16th century , the dukes of saxe-coburg-gotha lived in the ehrenburg castle , in the city of coburg itself .
once purely done in the renaissance style , the building was overwhelmingly rebuilt in a neo-gothic style in the 19th century , following a fire .
a toilet for the queen the interior of schloss ehrenburg , however , is done in an elegant french empire style .
despite its high-toned beauty , its most interesting attribute is probably the flush toilet .
it was the first ever installed in germany , rigged up in time for a visit from queen victoria in 1860 .
probably the most impressive sight in the town is the veste coburg , a fortress on a hill that was once considered impervious to capture .
today , however , the fortress is regularly stormed - by tourists .
it is one of the biggest , most beautiful medieval castles in germany , and from afar , its towers , battlements and ramparts look like a crown over the roofs of the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin luther many famous people have spent time not only in the schloss ehrenburg , but in the fortress .
one of these was the church reformer martin luther .
a nun 's figurine for a period of nearly a half a century , coburg seemed to be far off the beaten path , snug up against the border of east germany .
but today , the city lies in the geographic middle of the country .
with this change has come a boost in the city 's economy .
young businesses are settling here , side by side with the area 's traditional artisans : breweries , wooden-puppet makers , basket makers , and one very , very well known porcelain manufacturer .
indeed , one of coburg 's greatest claims to fame is the world-famous collectible hummel figures . these were first created by berta hummel , an art student born in 1909 .
following her studies , she entered a cloister and taught drawing at a school .
the motif of her drawings became the daily life of children .
starting in 1935 , the hummel children were turned into porcelain figures .
unfortunately , the ordained nun did n't get to experience the meteoric success of her figures for long .

using clever marriages as their vehicle , the dukes of saxe-coburg-gotha began to install their relatives on the thrones of europe 's royal houses at the end of the 18th century .

europe 's stud farm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schloss ehrenburg " others may make war , but clever coburg marries ! " was for a long time the saying that summed up the duchy 's politics .
this " marital offensive " earned coburg the title " europe 's stud farm . "
thus , coburg 's royal house is tied to those of sweden , norway , belgium , spain and england .
with so much blue blood around , it 's no wonder that the town has a " touch of buckingham " to it .
coburg is one of several historic towns in franconia , a predominantly rural part of bavaria that was politically important in the days of the holy roman empire .
neighboring and perhaps better known towns include bayreuth , bamberg and nuremberg .
starting in the mid 16th century , the dukes of saxe-coburg-gotha lived in the ehrenburg castle , in the city of coburg itself .
once purely done in the renaissance style , the building was overwhelmingly rebuilt in a neo-gothic style in the 19th century , following a fire .

despite its high-toned beauty , its most interesting attribute is probably the flush toilet .
it was the first ever installed in germany , rigged up in time for a visit from queen victoria in 1860 .
probably the most impressive sight in the town is the veste coburg , a fortress on a hill that was once considered impervious to capture .
today , however , the fortress is regularly stormed - by tourists .
it is one of the biggest , most beautiful medieval castles in germany , and from afar , its towers , battlements and ramparts look like a crown over the roofs of the city .

a nun 's figurine for a period of nearly a half a century , coburg seemed to be far off the beaten path , snug up against the border of east germany .

with this change has come a boost in the city 's economy .
young businesses are settling here , side by side with the area 's traditional artisans : breweries , wooden-puppet makers , basket makers , and one very , very well known porcelain manufacturer .
indeed , one of coburg 's greatest claims to fame is the world-famous collectible hummel figures . these were first created by berta hummel , an art student born in 1909 .
following her studies , she entered a cloister and taught drawing at a school .
the motif of her drawings became the daily life of children .
starting in 1935 , the hummel children were turned into porcelain figures .

europe 's stud farm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schloss ehrenburg " others may make war , but clever coburg marries ! " was for a long time the saying that summed up the duchy 's politics .
this " marital offensive " earned coburg the title " europe 's stud farm . "
thus , coburg 's royal house is tied to those of sweden , norway , belgium , spain and england .

coburg is one of several historic towns in franconia , a predominantly rural part of bavaria that was politically important in the days of the holy roman empire .
neighboring and perhaps better known towns include bayreuth , bamberg and nuremberg .
starting in the mid 16th century , the dukes of saxe-coburg-gotha lived in the ehrenburg castle , in the city of coburg itself .
once purely done in the renaissance style , the building was overwhelmingly rebuilt in a neo-gothic style in the 19th century , following a fire .

despite its high-toned beauty , its most interesting attribute is probably the flush toilet .

probably the most impressive sight in the town is the veste coburg , a fortress on a hill that was once considered impervious to capture .

on the contrary , it 's reality - coburg style .

thus , coburg 's royal house is tied to those of sweden , norway , belgium , spain and england .

coburg is one of several historic towns in franconia , a predominantly rural part of bavaria that was politically important in the days of the holy roman empire .

starting in the mid 16th century , the dukes of saxe-coburg-gotha lived in the ehrenburg castle , in the city of coburg itself .

probably the most impressive sight in the town is the veste coburg , a fortress on a hill that was once considered impervious to capture .

more than 9,000 people were polled for their views on public health issues .
there was also strong support -lrb- 81 % -rrb- for a ban on fast food and sweet adverts on television when children are watching .
some 72 % of respondents said crisps , chocolates and fizzy drinks machines should be banned from all school premises .
two-thirds -lrb- 65 % -rrb- said that bottles of alcohol should carry a government health warning .
the full results of the survey will be presented to the department of health , which announced details of its own major consultation on public health earlier this month .
the bbc survey found a lower level of support for the idea of an additional tax on high fat foods - however , this was still favoured by 54 % of respondents .
sexual health in the arena of sexual health 60 % of those who took part in the consultation said that regular , mandatory screening for sexually transmitted infections should not be provided by the nhs for all adults over the age of 16 .
however , a higher proportion of those aged 24 and under supported screening -lrb- 53 % -rrb- than those aged over 55 -lrb- 43 % -rrb- .
nearly two thirds of respondents -lrb- 64 % -rrb- said condoms should be freely available on demand to all secondary school pupils .
again those aged 24 and under were more supportive -lrb- 72 % -rrb- than those aged 55 plus -lrb- 39 % -rrb- .
despite widespread support for action to combat issues such as smoking and obesity , there was little backing for the idea that people should be penalised for contributing to their own ill-health .
just one third -lrb- 33 % -rrb- said that patients whose medical condition can be linked to smoking , drinking or obesity should be given a lower priority for treatment .
action needed ian willmore , of the anti-smoking charity action on smoking and health , said : " this poll shows that the public is demanding action to end smoking in the workplace and enclosed public places .
" this is the single most effective thing the government could do to cut smoking rates and protect smokers and non-smokers alike .
" it is time for the government to recognise the overwhelming public demand for action . "
simon clark , of the smokers ' rights organisation forest , said the findings of the poll contradicted those of other independent surveys .
" these show that the majority of people , while favouring restrictions on smoking , do not support a blanket ban , " he said .
" pubs , clubs and restaurants must be free to adopt a policy that they see best suits their business . "
neville rigby , of the international obesity task force , said : " we welcome the poll results which support the recommendations we have made to the government to take action along these lines .
" we recommended in submissions to the parliamentary sub-committee investigating obesity that exactly this should happen .
" there should be restrictions on the marketing to children through television and other media and there should be withdrawal of vending machines and other marketing to children in schools . "
the results of the survey were discussed in a bbc one special , ' your nhs : for better or worse ' broadcast at 2100 gmt on wednesday 24 march .
the consultation was not a scientific poll .
people were asked to answer questions by phone or online .
a total of 9,479 people responded .

the mayor 's transport for london -lrb- tfl -rrb- is responsible for tube , buses and trams but now mr livingstone wants to bring trains under his control as well .
a london regional rail authority would provide a more integrated service and raise standards , he said on tuesday .
but the strategic rail authority -lrb- sra -rrb- is sceptical and there are concerns about fragmenting the rail network .
twelve train operators carry passengers in and out of london - that could be cut to three and franchises could be shortened to five years under the plans .
mr livingstone says he wants a more simple fare structure - it currently costs £ 1.70 to go from zones one to three on the tube , but up to £ 3.70 on a train .
and he says a london rail authority would bring better services , shorter queues for the ticket office and better stations and security .
" it would mean we can start to bring major transport improvements to large parts of london not covered by the tube network , " he said .
" if we start with a shadow form of running the london rail authority , changes can start to be made relatively fast . "
he said the government had recognised the plans were practical .
transport secretary alistair darling told the bbc 's world at one programme they needed to look at whether bodies like tfl could take responsibility for local services .
but he said : " what you need to watch though , in all of this , is that you do n't end up balkanising the railways .
there is one railway .
it needs to be run in a way that is consistent .
" we need to ... make sure there is a simplified , streamlined organisation that can run the railways properly and control costs .
" now that means you do need to have a single guiding mind .
it does not mean you have got to have the same people owning the track as owning the railway trains . "
shadow transport secretary theresa may said she had doubts tfl had the " kind of top level experience " required to do the job .
and she questioned whether tax payers would end up compensating the companies currently operating franchises .

the mayor 's transport for london -lrb- tfl -rrb- is responsible for tube , buses and trams but now mr livingstone wants to bring trains under his control as well .
a london regional rail authority would provide a more integrated service and raise standards , he said on tuesday .
but the strategic rail authority -lrb- sra -rrb- is sceptical and there are concerns about fragmenting the rail network .
twelve train operators carry passengers in and out of london - that could be cut to three and franchises could be shortened to five years under the plans .
mr livingstone says he wants a more simple fare structure - it currently costs £ 1.70 to go from zones one to three on the tube , but up to £ 3.70 on a train .
and he says a london rail authority would bring better services , shorter queues for the ticket office and better stations and security .
" it would mean we can start to bring major transport improvements to large parts of london not covered by the tube network , " he said .
mr livingstone has made transport a priority " if we start with a shadow form of running the london rail authority , changes can start to be made relatively fast . "
he said the government had recognised the plans were practical .
transport secretary alistair darling told the bbc 's world at one programme they needed to look at whether bodies like tfl could take responsibility for local services .
but he said : " what you need to watch though , in all of this , is that you do n't end up balkanising the railways .
there is one railway .
it needs to be run in a way that is consistent .
" we need to ... make sure there is a simplified , streamlined organisation that can run the railways properly and control costs .
" now that means you do need to have a single guiding mind .
it does not mean you have got to have the same people owning the track as owning the railway trains . "
shadow transport secretary theresa may said she had doubts tfl had the " kind of top level experience " required to do the job .

the mayor 's transport for london -lrb- tfl -rrb- is responsible for tube , buses and trams but now mr livingstone wants to bring trains under his control as well .
a london regional rail authority would provide a more integrated service and raise standards , he said on tuesday .
but the strategic rail authority -lrb- sra -rrb- is sceptical and there are concerns about fragmenting the rail network .
twelve train operators carry passengers in and out of london - that could be cut to three and franchises could be shortened to five years under the plans .
mr livingstone says he wants a more simple fare structure - it currently costs £ 1.70 to go from zones one to three on the tube , but up to £ 3.70 on a train .
and he says a london rail authority would bring better services , shorter queues for the ticket office and better stations and security .
" it would mean we can start to bring major transport improvements to large parts of london not covered by the tube network , " he said .
mr livingstone has made transport a priority " if we start with a shadow form of running the london rail authority , changes can start to be made relatively fast . "
he said the government had recognised the plans were practical .
transport secretary alistair darling told the bbc 's world at one programme they needed to look at whether bodies like tfl could take responsibility for local services .
but he said : " what you need to watch though , in all of this , is that you do n't end up balkanising the railways .
there is one railway .
it needs to be run in a way that is consistent .
" we need to ... make sure there is a simplified , streamlined organisation that can run the railways properly and control costs .
" now that means you do need to have a single guiding mind .
it does not mean you have got to have the same people owning the track as owning the railway trains . "
shadow transport secretary theresa may said she had doubts tfl had the " kind of top level experience " required to do the job .
and she questioned whether tax payers would end up compensating the companies currently operating franchises .

the 400 cottenham residents at a public meeting on tuesday accused the council of failing to stop its expansion .
rick bristow , who is leading the protest , said the council had not looked after villagers ' interests .
south cambridgeshire district council said since 1999 it had turned down two planning applications for the site only to have them overturned on appeal .
mr bristow , of smithy fen residents ' association , who has lived opposite the site for six years , had collected 400 signatures on a protest petition before the public meeting .
he said the council had not looked after the villagers ' human rights or looked after the planning issues properly .
south cambridgeshire district council said since 1999 it had turned down 14 planning applications for expansion of the travellers ' site , which is about a mile from the heart of the commuter village near cambridge .
those decisions had all be overturned on appeal by planning inspectors .
south east cambridgeshire mp james paice said he obviously could not support illegal action but added he could understand the frustration of the villagers .
" these travellers have moved into the area and have more recently got planning consent not from the council who opposed it but from the department of the deputy prime minster 's planning inspectorate who have held inquiries , " he said .
a spokesman for the travellers said they paid for water , electricity and paid their poll tax .
" we do all that .
what more do they want ? " he asked .
south cambridgeshire district council has said if villagers do withhold their council tax , they will be taken to court .

like other local authorities in wales , ceredigion is faced with a severe shortage of nursing beds for elderly people .
three out of four of the private nursing homes in the county are for sale , and the shortage of local provision is forcing elderly and infirm people and their relatives to travel long distances .
the authority is considering setting up a new care home in aberystwyth , but discovered on tuesday that this would cost more than £ 1m a year to run .
the system is n't working and something has to be done to allow the elderly to have nursing care close to their families andrew clode , family member the situation in ceredigion reflects a general malaise across wales with the welsh assembly government pumping millions of pounds into care services for elderly people to try to reduce so-called bed blocking .
a report to ceredigion council on tuesday said there had been widespread concerns that people who are elderly and mentally infirm have had to travel considerable distances out of the county .
andrew clode of llanfihangel y creuddyn , near aberystwyth is one of those who has spoken out against the situation .
in august 2003 his 90-year-old mother was due to be transferred from bronglais hospital in aberystwyth to a nursing unit at cardigan .
this would have meant a round trip of nearly 100 miles for mr clode .
in the end , his mother was transferred to a facility about 20 miles away , where she died in september .
" i wanted to my mother to stay in the aberystwyth area but that was n't possible , " said mr clode .
" the system is n't working and something has to be done to allow the elderly to have nursing care close to their families . "
andrew clode had been faced with a 100-mile round trip to visit his mother in ceredigion , there are , on average , 15 people waiting in hospitals for a nursing home place of their choice .
although the new facility at aberystwyth would cost the council more , the authority is already paying for nursing care outside the county .
according to maureen wootton of age concern ceredigion a more imaginative approach is needed for elderly health care in the future .
" providing a mixture of sheltered accommodation and nursing care on one site is one option that should be considered , " she said .
a welsh assembly government spokeswoman said tackling bed blocking was a priority .
she added : " £ 4m has been allocated to local health boards specifically for this and in january we announced £ 19.5m for social services to increase capacity .
" there are a number of schemes across wales which are good examples of how people can be cared for at home or in the community . "

but these are tough times for the chocolate business .
in an industry dominated by multinational companies such as cadbury and nestle , the competition is fierce .
both the chocolate giants are fighting to keep hold of their lucrative chunks of this £ 4bn market .
and at the moment , market leader cadbury is increasing its lead .
gaining nearly a third of all the chocolate the british eat is made by cadbury , and the jewel in the crown is its dairy milk brand - worth about £ 250m every year .
kitkat : a design icon recently the company came up with the idea of repackaging all its major chocolate products and labelling them as part of the dairy milk brand - what it calls " masterbranding " .
cadbury believes this is why the brand has grown by 13 % in the last year .
" it 's made a bigger stronger platform upon which to grow our brand and buy growth for the future , " said managing director simon baldry .
declining in contrast , nestle 's sales have fallen by 1.7 % , or £ 10m in the last year .
" i think we 've let ourselves down a little bit in the last couple of years , so i think it 's been a bit soft , but i do n't think it 's going to be quite so soft in the future , " said marketing director sam hunter .
nestle 's major weapon in the fight is kitkat , described by mr hunter as a " design icon , just like the coke bottle , just like the ferrari " .
loyalty like cadbury , nestle has chosen to exploit the strength of its key brand by offering it in a number of new varieties , such as chunky , cubed and even orange flavour .
consumer loyalty to such brands has been built up over generations , and nine of the top-selling ten brands have been around since the first half of the twentieth century .
cadbury 's dairy milk was introduced in 1905 , kitkat in 1935 .
this makes launching a new brand into the chocolate market quite an undertaking .
premium but nestle , unperturbed , chose in 2002 to launch a direct competitor to cadbury 's dairy milk , called nestle double cream .
the chocolate bar is made from ecuadorian cocoa beans and double cream and is marketed as a premium chocolate .
obesity concerns could threaten the chocolate firms ' financial health " i think double cream has got a tough task , " said chris cleaver , director of the branding agency brandsmiths .
" cadbury 's killer blow is that they are directly linked to our hearts and double cream has got to work hard to get there , " he said .
fat tax but launching new brands is not the only challenge facing the industry .
the size of the chocolate market has been fairly static for the last decade , and now the industry is facing challenges from the health lobby over the question of obesity .
there has been talk of advertising bans , clearer labelling of fat and sugar content , and even a fat tax , all of which would hit the chocolate producers hard .
there have been rumours within the industry about the possibility of low fat , low sugar chocolate as a more healthy alternative .
but as yet , none of the big manufacturers has come up with anything concrete .
changing tastes the other major threat is the possibility that british consumers might be developing a more discerning palate .
just as many have learnt to appreciate better wines and may now choose a cappuccino over an instant coffee , some are also beginning to appreciate the taste of so-called premium chocolate .
british high streets have seen more and more exclusive chocolate shops spring up over the last decade , and premium chocolate has now become the fastest-growing part of the market .
this has always been a highly competitive industry .
it looks like things are just about to get even tougher .
" fat profits : choc tactics " will be broadcast on wednesday 24 march at 1930 gmt on bbc two .

democrats agitate for laws barring companies that " outsource " from getting government contracts at home .
republicans accuse democrats of protectionism .
both sides know it 's a hot issue in the " battleground states " which will determine who 'll be the next tenant of the white house .
vibrant but as the fog of election campaign descends , and claim clashes with counter-claim , we might remember that the united states is actually a big proponent of what it decries elsewhere : when other countries " out-source " work , they often send it to america , whether it be financial and legal advice or architectural design or the writing of software .
do chinese workers benefit from us exports ?
when the british authorities wanted engineers to build the jubilee line on the london underground , they " out-sourced " the work to bechtel in san francisco .
and when the authorities in new york wanted architects to design a new world trade centre , they contemplated " out-sourcing " the work to london or tokyo before choosing berlin .
it 's the way of a vibrant economic world .
deficit according to the us commerce department , american companies " exported " -lrb- sold to foreign buyers - " out-sourced " -rrb- services worth $ 131bn in 2003 .
that compares with " imports " of such services of $ 77bn .
in other words , america is more used by other countries for out-sourcing services than it uses other countries to do its work abroad .
of course , these figures only allude to services .
they do n't show the movement of manufacturing from america abroad , particularly to china .
last week , figures put the trade deficit with china in 2003 -lrb- $ 124 billion -rrb- as the highest deficit it 's had with any country ever .
not hiring the figures fed the political debate over whether " american jobs are being exported " so causing a " jobless recovery " .

made in china : are us jobs being exported ?
they 're hiring in beijing but not in birmingham , alabama .
it is not , though , quite like that .
the real explanation for the failure of the recovery to turn into a hiring fare is more to do with american innovation .
automation productivity in the united states is soaring , currently rising at a scorching rate of about 5 % a year .
output per worker is rising fast and employment is not .
it seems that some of the technological innovations of the late 90s are finally bearing fruit - or at least profits .
furthermore , the automation of the 80s and 90s transformed manufacturing , but the new machines are transforming services , whether it be in automated banks or self-check-out in supermarkets or e-tickets for planes .
structural change that , combined with relentless competitive pressure , means american companies are turning the increased output into profits not wage costs .
the figures tell the story : the big losers of jobs last year were manufacturing , certainly , but then department stores , telecommunications and hotels -lrb- not always the industries which had been out-sourced -rrb- also suffered .
employment rose most for temporary workers and in health-care and restaurants .
one estimate , by forrester research , reckons that of nearly three million american jobs that have vanished in the last three years , nearly nine-tenths of them went because of factors other than out-sourcing .
us expansion of course , the relationship between productivity growth or out-sourcing and employment creation is not a simple one .
the big losers of jobs last year were manufacturing it does not follow that faster innovation or a rush to set up call centres in india cuts american employment in the long run .
the pattern of the past is that innovation at home raises profits at home and then investment and employment at home .
and there is now some anecdotal evidence of american companies getting indian companies to do some of the paper-work and finding it so beneficial to their bottom line that they then expand to employ more americans .

motorcyclists make up just 1 % of traffic on roads but account for 14 % of deaths and serious injuries in crashes .
in 2003 , eight motorcyclists were killed on the county 's roads .
bikers are being asked for suggestions on how collisions can be reduced in surveys on a website and at a forum which is being set up .
powerful bikes in the wrong hands are a lethal weapon philip neale the cornwall motorcyclists ' forum will meet regularly and tell the police and county council what it thinks needs to be done to prevent any more fatalities and serious injuries .
experienced biker philip neale , from porthtowan , said the need to address the problem was overdue .
he said : " i 'm horrified at the number of accidents .
" motorcyclists do n't have the benefits of a safety cage around them .
if a rider comes unstuck because of bad riding , they 're more likely to get injured or even worse . . "
he said he believed that any driver , whether on two wheels or four , needed to sharpen up their road skills .
he said : " i think driving standards across the board need to be improved .
" but bike riders need to get as much experience as they can and improve their skills to the highest possible level .
" powerful bikes in the wrong hands are a lethal weapon . "
action points the county council has bought in road safety consultant alan tilly from the transport research laboratory in berkshire to work with the forum .
he said : " motorcyclists are legitimate road users , but often they 're overlooked .
" we 're going to consult with local riders , they know the issues and problems better than anybody else , ask what are their concerns are and what can be done to overcome them .
" we 'll come up with a series of action points that the council can implement to reduce casualties .
after that , we 'll come back and see if they are working . "
the county council 's head of transportation , colin jarvis , said : " speaking to the riders themselves directly will give a valuable insight into motorcycling from the riders ' point of view . "
the first meeting of the forum is being held on wednesday at 1830 gmt at new county hall in truro .

the severity and regularity of flash floods is expected to increase as more of london 's green spaces are concreted over and the population rises .
thames water said although the basic system was sound , new investment was needed to maintain and modernise it .
work to prevent sewage flooding during heavy rainfall is planned by the firm .
in 1859 sir joseph bazalgette used 318 million bricks to create an underground grid to transfer london 's sewage to the east of the city .
problems on the sewers about 100 tonnes of fat , oil and grease are dumped in london 's sewers each year half the 100,000 blockages thames water clears each year are caused in this way , which costs about £ 7m to remove " flushers " once cleared a 150ft solidified slug of hardened fat with pick axes from sewers in the leicester square area - it took them eight weeks it is now processed and turned into electricity at treatment works in beckton and crossness .
london 's unusual combined sewer system deals both with water flushed from homes and incoming rainfall from drains .
thames water says climate change is expected to increase the regularity and severity of flash floods , placing greater demands on the system .
this will be compounded by the vanishing areas of green spaces able to soak up rainfall and a 800,000 population increase predicted by 2016 .
up to £ 500m is already being invested by thames water to tackle the risk of properties being flooded with sewage when rainfall is heavy .
the firm also spends £ 7m every year removing solidified cooking fat from sewers which is a particular problem in soho , central london , where a 150ft slug of fat took eight weeks to remove recently .
on wednesday , environment minister elliot morley visited the 1,300-mile network of brick tunnels and cathedral like chambers that run under the city .
" it has been fascinating to see for myself the foresight and craftsmanship of the victorians in creating a network that has stood the test of time so well , " he said .

" at this moment in time " and " like " , used like a punctuation mark , shared second place and " with all due respect " came fourth .
the plain english campaign questioned 5,000 people in over 70 countries .
" using these terms in daily business is about professional as wearing a novelty tie or having a wacky ring tone on your phone , " the campaign concluded .
the problem with cliches is they 're things that were once fresh but are now so overused that , as soon as you hear it , your mind shifts your impression of the speaker plain english campaign spokesman john lister says footballers are partly to blame for " at the end of the day " coming top in the survey .
he told bbc radio five live : " i think people find it so irritating , partly because it 's so overused .
if you 've ever hear a football interview it seems to be used in place of a breath or a comma .
" it 's also partly because it 's so wrong - at the end of the day i go to sleep . "
he said it was time for people to start inventing new analogies .
" the problem with cliches is they 're things that were once fresh but are now so overused that , as soon as you hear it , your mind shifts your impression of the speaker , " he said .
" you 're thinking ' why are they using these phrases that are so old hat ?
you 're not david brent - he 's funny on the office but you 're not funny in real life ' . "
outside the box the plain english campaign is an independent group " fighting for crystal-clear language and against jargon , gobbledygook and other confusing language " .
the survey was compiled as part of the build-up to its 25th anniversary on 26 july .
in the survey , business phrases , in particular , received the bulk of the nominations .
they included " thinking outside the box " , " value-added " and " ballpark figure " .
other terms which received multiple nominations included " singing from the same hymn sheet " , " 24/7 " , " i hear what you 're saying " and " to be honest " .
mr lister urged people to follow george orwell 's advice to " never use a metaphor , simile , or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print " .
