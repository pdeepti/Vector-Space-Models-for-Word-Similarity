budget airlines have made it easier for people to take to the skies , but on the downside frequent air travel pollutes the environment .
a german initiative " atmosfair " aims to encourage passengers to restore the balance . it 's a known fact that frequent flyers - in addition to racking-up those handy little miles - damage the environment . air travel has increased five-fold since 1970 , with much of that growth taking place in the last few years due to the increasing popularity of budget airlines .
however , as the cost of tickets continues to decline , it has become increasingly clear that bargain prices do not account for the damage a single flight does to the environment . environmental groups say such air travel is a climate catastrophe in the making , since airplanes emit three times the amount of greenhouse gases that automobiles do .
the no-frills travel boom , according to germany ’ s green lobby , is the country ’ s “ number one climate killer ” . climate change , caused by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , is deemed by many experts to be the biggest long-term threat to mankind .
they predict rapidly rising temperatures prompting higher sea levels , devastating floods and droughts . the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates aviation causes 3.5 percent of man-made global warming and that figure could rise to 15 percent by 2050 . efforts to impose a tax on jet-engine fuel have been unsuccessful , and , thus far , the issue has not been addressed in the kyoto protocol , the international treaty aimed at preventing climate change .
but now , a german environmental initiative , atmosfair , hopes to encourage travellers to strike the right balance on a voluntary basis . making-up the difference the idea is simple : those who fly will make a contribution to finance an environmental project in a developing country . the idea occurred to germany 's environmental minister , jürgen trittin , when he attended the united nations ' conference on environment and development in 2002 . " we were trying to think of a way we could credibly attend the conference , given the fact that the transport of our delegation would result in 1280 tons of greenhouse gas , " said the minister .
of course , that would have to be made-up elsewhere , says trittin , so he and and his ministry financed a row of ecologically sensitive homes in a township . the concept has now been adopted on a larger scale by atmosfair , which is run by klaus töpfer , the director of the united nations ' environmental program .
töpfer doubts every flight guest will voluntarily contribute his or her share , but he hopes the project will create a greater awareness .

however , as the cost of tickets continues to decline , it has become increasingly clear that bargain prices do not account for the damage a single flight does to the environment . environmental groups say such air travel is a climate catastrophe in the making , since airplanes emit three times the amount of greenhouse gases that automobiles do .
the no-frills travel boom , according to germany ’ s green lobby , is the country ’ s “ number one climate killer ” . climate change , caused by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , is deemed by many experts to be the biggest long-term threat to mankind .
they predict rapidly rising temperatures prompting higher sea levels , devastating floods and droughts . the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates aviation causes 3.5 percent of man-made global warming and that figure could rise to 15 percent by 2050 . efforts to impose a tax on jet-engine fuel have been unsuccessful , and , thus far , the issue has not been addressed in the kyoto protocol , the international treaty aimed at preventing climate change .
but now , a german environmental initiative , atmosfair , hopes to encourage travellers to strike the right balance on a voluntary basis . making-up the difference the idea is simple : those who fly will make a contribution to finance an environmental project in a developing country . the idea occurred to germany 's environmental minister , jürgen trittin , when he attended the united nations ' conference on environment and development in 2002 . " we were trying to think of a way we could credibly attend the conference , given the fact that the transport of our delegation would result in 1280 tons of greenhouse gas , " said the minister .
of course , that would have to be made-up elsewhere , says trittin , so he and and his ministry financed a row of ecologically sensitive homes in a township . the concept has now been adopted on a larger scale by atmosfair , which is run by klaus töpfer , the director of the united nations ' environmental program .
töpfer doubts every flight guest will voluntarily contribute his or her share , but he hopes the project will create a greater awareness . " the costs must be carried by someone , " he told deutsche welle , " and in general , we pawn them off on those living in considerably poorer countries and on future generations . " the sponsor of the effort is the " forum for a different kind of travel " , an umbrella organization of 100 environmentally aware travel agencies with 60,000 customers per year , half of whom are frequent flyers . that 'll be € 74.70 to nairobi and back , please the forum has worked out a table , which can be used to calculate in euros the approximate cost of - if one can quantify such things in money - air travel of varying lengths does to the environment . for example , a flight from berlin to bonn and back - according to the table - costs € 8 .
a flight from berlin to nairobi , including a change in frankfurt , creates 4260 kilograms of carbon monoxide .
converted into euros , that comes to € 74.70 . ideally , airline passengers will calculate these expenses and contribute some or all of the sum towards the environmental projects sponsored by the forum , including the construction of solar community kitchens in india and an environmentally-friendly factories in brazil . töpfer , for one , has promised to make contributions for all of his flights this month , and considering how often this u.n. official jets around the world , that 's quite a bit . jens thurau -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are budget airlines killing the planet ?

the probe will have traveled 3.5 billion kilometers -lrb- 2.2 billion miles -rrb- , when it finally starts orbiting the ringed planet thursday . the critical moment , however , will come when cassini is set to fire its engines after flying through a gap in saturn 's rings , starting at 2:36 utc thursday morning .
that should use up 1.5 tons of fuel and slow the craft down enough for it to get caught in saturn 's gravity field and pulled into the planet 's orbit .
but with a delay of more than an hour , scientists on the earth will have no control over cassini , which will have to manage the tricky maneuver without colliding with any potentially damaging space particles on its own .
from there the probe will begin making 76 rounds of saturn over a period of at least four years , collecting data and images of the planet , its rings and its moons . " we 're right on track , " navigation team chief jeremy jones told a news conference tuesday at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory .
cassini program manager robert mitchell and other officials expressed confidence that the craft would successfully enter saturn 's orbit , but he admitted that the procedure was a " hair-graying " event , ap reported . named after the french astronomer who in 1675 discovered saturn 's rings , cassini is expected to start sending data and images from saturn on thursday . decades of work the mission has been in the works for nearly 30 years and has cost nasa and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- $ 3.3 billion -lrb- € 2.71 billion -rrb- and the energies of more than 5,000 scientists .
cassini , carrying the wok-shaped probe huygens on its back , was sent into space from cape canaveral in florida on october 1997 . huygens , named after the dutch astronomer who in 1659 first recognized the true shape of the ring around saturn , is meant to explore titan , the largest of the planet 's 31 known moons .
the craft is programmed to take leave of its host on christmas and parachute into titan 's atmosphere . the moon is particularly interesting to scientists because it 's thought to have conditions similar to those on earth before life emerged .
scientists estimate huygens will have around one and a half hours to relay data from titan 's atmosphere before its battery runs out in the minus 180 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 292 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- weather . " this is one of the most exciting projects we have going , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told dw-world .
" huygens will be the first time europe has landed in the outer solar system .

cassini , carrying the wok-shaped probe huygens on its back , was sent into space from cape canaveral in florida on october 1997 . huygens , named after the dutch astronomer who in 1659 first recognized the true shape of the ring around saturn , is meant to explore titan , the largest of the planet 's 31 known moons .
the craft is programmed to take leave of its host on christmas and parachute into titan 's atmosphere . the moon is particularly interesting to scientists because it 's thought to have conditions similar to those on earth before life emerged .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.06.2004 panel reveals plans to revive eastern germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infrastructure 's pretty good in eastern germany , the panel says a panel of german government advisors has presented a controversial catalogue of measures they consider necessary for readjusting berlin ’ s economic policy to promote sustainable growth in eastern germany . the experts around the former social democrat mayor of hamburg , klaus von dohnanyi , believe that the way the massive west-east financial transfers have been handled since reunification has been a complete failure .
the government itself brushed off the criticism as unfounded , but promised nonetheless to look into the panel ’ s recommendations .
fourteen out of the 16 members of the advisory panel agree that the government under german chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat , has ignored the real economic hardships in eastern germany since it came to power in 1998 . they claim that despite the fact that huge sums have been transferred from the affluent west to the depressed east , not a single core economic problem there has so far been resolved .
they point to eastern companies ’ weak capital stock and an unemployment rate twice as high as that in western germany . using funds more efficiently panel spokesman klaus von dohnanyi called on the government to quickly revise its fiscal policy towards the east .
he and most of his colleagues don ’ t want more money to be pumped there - they want the money to be used more efficiently . dohnanyi argues that it 's high time to stop making infrastructure projects in the east a top priority when a good proportion of regions in the east already have a better infrastructure than those in the west . " money is limited and we transfer from the powerhouse west to east germany per annum about € 90 billion to 95 billion -lrb- $ 109 billion to $ 115 billion , -rrb- " he said .
" the money should be targeted on clusters , it should be targeted on businesses and it should not be targeted primarily on infrastructure .
it should be targeted in a way that the federal state does not come into too much conflict with local interest . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at a computer chip plant in dresden in eastern germany the advisory panel suggested using the bulk of the transfer money to promote selected innovative industries .
many of these are believed to have the potential for creating sustainable jobs , for instance in the fields of biomedicine and environmental technologies .
the panel also called on the government to reconsider tax exemptions for newly founded companies in the east , particularly for small and medium sized firms . this , the experts argued , should in fact ensure their survival in a heavily contested market .
they say it makes no sense to boast of the number of start-ups when each year the number of new companies in the east consistently equals the number of new insolvencies . talk of a low-wage sector dohnanyi also said that more thought should be given to the promotion of the low-wage sector in the east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment rates continue to soar in eastern germany " we have a new competition also now from eastern europe and we must see that these people in east germany can make a living , " he said .
" therefore we discuss things like the earned tax credit systems in the united states , etc . - something that we should add to the wages in order to be competitive and at the same time have an adequate living in the comparatively high cost country germany . " dohnanyi raised eyebrows in the berlin cabinet by suggesting to reinstate a special commissioner for eastern germany .
this implicitly calls into question the work of transport minister manfred stolpe , who ’ s currently responsible for eastern germany ’ s economic development together with economics minister wolfgang clement . critique from eastern german politicians while saying that he agreed with most of the panel 's suggestions , stolpe made it clear that he did not want to turn over responsibility for eastern germany to a cabinet member who would focus on the reconstruction effort in eastern germany . " that 's clearly enticing , but he will have to beg and struggle to achieve something , " he told berlin public broadcaster rbb , adding that a ministry like his own had better resources to deal with the problems . other political leaders from eastern germany - stolpe himself served as premier of the federal state of brandenburg that surrounds berlin before joining the federal cabinet - also voiced their opposition to the panel 's suggestions . dieter althaus , the christian democratic premier of the state of thuringia , called the panel " superfluous " and added that proposed cuts to funding of local infrastructure improvements would have " fatal consequences . " it ’ s not yet clear to what extent the schröder government is willing to listen to the expert panel ’ s suggestions .
in fact , the very future of the panel seems to be at stake , as it has been heavily criticized in the past for indiscretion and infighting among the experts . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eastern germany 's eu funds in danger of drying up the eu 's competition commissioner met with the heads of germany 's eastern states to discuss future financial support for the region , which may no longer be a top priority following enlargement . ´ -lrb- may 24 , 2004 -rrb- silicon saxony : chip factory brings high-tech to dresden u.s. chipmaker amd has broken ground on a $ 2.4 billion factory in dresden that will manufacture silicon wafers .

the government itself brushed off the criticism as unfounded , but promised nonetheless to look into the panel ’ s recommendations .
fourteen out of the 16 members of the advisory panel agree that the government under german chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat , has ignored the real economic hardships in eastern germany since it came to power in 1998 . they claim that despite the fact that huge sums have been transferred from the affluent west to the depressed east , not a single core economic problem there has so far been resolved .
they point to eastern companies ’ weak capital stock and an unemployment rate twice as high as that in western germany . using funds more efficiently panel spokesman klaus von dohnanyi called on the government to quickly revise its fiscal policy towards the east .
he and most of his colleagues don ’ t want more money to be pumped there - they want the money to be used more efficiently . dohnanyi argues that it 's high time to stop making infrastructure projects in the east a top priority when a good proportion of regions in the east already have a better infrastructure than those in the west . " money is limited and we transfer from the powerhouse west to east germany per annum about € 90 billion to 95 billion -lrb- $ 109 billion to $ 115 billion , -rrb- " he said .
" the money should be targeted on clusters , it should be targeted on businesses and it should not be targeted primarily on infrastructure .
it should be targeted in a way that the federal state does not come into too much conflict with local interest . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at a computer chip plant in dresden in eastern germany the advisory panel suggested using the bulk of the transfer money to promote selected innovative industries .
many of these are believed to have the potential for creating sustainable jobs , for instance in the fields of biomedicine and environmental technologies .
the panel also called on the government to reconsider tax exemptions for newly founded companies in the east , particularly for small and medium sized firms . this , the experts argued , should in fact ensure their survival in a heavily contested market .
they say it makes no sense to boast of the number of start-ups when each year the number of new companies in the east consistently equals the number of new insolvencies . talk of a low-wage sector dohnanyi also said that more thought should be given to the promotion of the low-wage sector in the east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment rates continue to soar in eastern germany " we have a new competition also now from eastern europe and we must see that these people in east germany can make a living , " he said .
" therefore we discuss things like the earned tax credit systems in the united states , etc . - something that we should add to the wages in order to be competitive and at the same time have an adequate living in the comparatively high cost country germany . " dohnanyi raised eyebrows in the berlin cabinet by suggesting to reinstate a special commissioner for eastern germany .
this implicitly calls into question the work of transport minister manfred stolpe , who ’ s currently responsible for eastern germany ’ s economic development together with economics minister wolfgang clement . critique from eastern german politicians while saying that he agreed with most of the panel 's suggestions , stolpe made it clear that he did not want to turn over responsibility for eastern germany to a cabinet member who would focus on the reconstruction effort in eastern germany . " that 's clearly enticing , but he will have to beg and struggle to achieve something , " he told berlin public broadcaster rbb , adding that a ministry like his own had better resources to deal with the problems . other political leaders from eastern germany - stolpe himself served as premier of the federal state of brandenburg that surrounds berlin before joining the federal cabinet - also voiced their opposition to the panel 's suggestions . dieter althaus , the christian democratic premier of the state of thuringia , called the panel " superfluous " and added that proposed cuts to funding of local infrastructure improvements would have " fatal consequences . " it ’ s not yet clear to what extent the schröder government is willing to listen to the expert panel ’ s suggestions .
in fact , the very future of the panel seems to be at stake , as it has been heavily criticized in the past for indiscretion and infighting among the experts . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eastern germany 's eu funds in danger of drying up the eu 's competition commissioner met with the heads of germany 's eastern states to discuss future financial support for the region , which may no longer be a top priority following enlargement . ´ -lrb- may 24 , 2004 -rrb- silicon saxony : chip factory brings high-tech to dresden u.s. chipmaker amd has broken ground on a $ 2.4 billion factory in dresden that will manufacture silicon wafers .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at a computer chip plant in dresden in eastern germany the advisory panel suggested using the bulk of the transfer money to promote selected innovative industries .
many of these are believed to have the potential for creating sustainable jobs , for instance in the fields of biomedicine and environmental technologies .
the panel also called on the government to reconsider tax exemptions for newly founded companies in the east , particularly for small and medium sized firms . this , the experts argued , should in fact ensure their survival in a heavily contested market .
they say it makes no sense to boast of the number of start-ups when each year the number of new companies in the east consistently equals the number of new insolvencies . talk of a low-wage sector dohnanyi also said that more thought should be given to the promotion of the low-wage sector in the east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment rates continue to soar in eastern germany " we have a new competition also now from eastern europe and we must see that these people in east germany can make a living , " he said .
" therefore we discuss things like the earned tax credit systems in the united states , etc . - something that we should add to the wages in order to be competitive and at the same time have an adequate living in the comparatively high cost country germany . " dohnanyi raised eyebrows in the berlin cabinet by suggesting to reinstate a special commissioner for eastern germany .
this implicitly calls into question the work of transport minister manfred stolpe , who ’ s currently responsible for eastern germany ’ s economic development together with economics minister wolfgang clement . critique from eastern german politicians while saying that he agreed with most of the panel 's suggestions , stolpe made it clear that he did not want to turn over responsibility for eastern germany to a cabinet member who would focus on the reconstruction effort in eastern germany . " that 's clearly enticing , but he will have to beg and struggle to achieve something , " he told berlin public broadcaster rbb , adding that a ministry like his own had better resources to deal with the problems . other political leaders from eastern germany - stolpe himself served as premier of the federal state of brandenburg that surrounds berlin before joining the federal cabinet - also voiced their opposition to the panel 's suggestions . dieter althaus , the christian democratic premier of the state of thuringia , called the panel " superfluous " and added that proposed cuts to funding of local infrastructure improvements would have " fatal consequences . " it ’ s not yet clear to what extent the schröder government is willing to listen to the expert panel ’ s suggestions .
in fact , the very future of the panel seems to be at stake , as it has been heavily criticized in the past for indiscretion and infighting among the experts . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eastern germany 's eu funds in danger of drying up the eu 's competition commissioner met with the heads of germany 's eastern states to discuss future financial support for the region , which may no longer be a top priority following enlargement . ´ -lrb- may 24 , 2004 -rrb- silicon saxony : chip factory brings high-tech to dresden u.s. chipmaker amd has broken ground on a $ 2.4 billion factory in dresden that will manufacture silicon wafers .

the probe will have traveled 3.5 billion kilometers -lrb- 2.2 billion miles -rrb- , when it finally starts orbiting the ringed planet thursday . the critical moment , however , will come when cassini is set to fire its engines after flying through a gap in saturn 's rings , starting at 2:36 utc thursday morning .
that should use up 1.5 tons of fuel and slow the craft down enough for it to get caught in saturn 's gravity field and pulled into the planet 's orbit .
but with a delay of more than an hour , scientists on the earth will have no control over cassini , which will have to manage the tricky maneuver without colliding with any potentially damaging space particles on its own .
from there the probe will begin making 76 rounds of saturn over a period of at least four years , collecting data and images of the planet , its rings and its moons . " we 're right on track , " navigation team chief jeremy jones told a news conference tuesday at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory .
cassini program manager robert mitchell and other officials expressed confidence that the craft would successfully enter saturn 's orbit , but he admitted that the procedure was a " hair-graying " event , ap reported . named after the french astronomer who in 1675 discovered saturn 's rings , cassini is expected to start sending data and images from saturn on thursday . decades of work the mission has been in the works for nearly 30 years and has cost nasa and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- $ 3.3 billion -lrb- € 2.71 billion -rrb- and the energies of more than 5,000 scientists .
cassini , carrying the wok-shaped probe huygens on its back , was sent into space from cape canaveral in florida on october 1997 . huygens , named after the dutch astronomer who in 1659 first recognized the true shape of the ring around saturn , is meant to explore titan , the largest of the planet 's 31 known moons .
the craft is programmed to take leave of its host on christmas and parachute into titan 's atmosphere . the moon is particularly interesting to scientists because it 's thought to have conditions similar to those on earth before life emerged .
scientists estimate huygens will have around one and a half hours to relay data from titan 's atmosphere before its battery runs out in the minus 180 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 292 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- weather . " this is one of the most exciting projects we have going , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told dw-world .
" huygens will be the first time europe has landed in the outer solar system .
and perhaps the most exciting thing of all is that we do n't know whether it 's going to land or splash down , because titan is swathed in a thick , smoggy atmosphere and we ca n't see its surface .
it may have methane oceans .

the 48-year-old conservative lawyer was picked after nearly a dozen other candidates were rejected .
his nomination took only minutes , as he had the unanimous backing of his 24 fellow leaders . but reaching that level of consensus was n't easy .
horse-trading over who would take the top eu job intensified after eu leaders failed to agree on a candidate at their last summit in mid-june .
analysts say barroso 's first task will be to dispel the notion that he is the " lowest common denominator " - chosen only because the heads of government could n't agree on anyone else . german support over the weekend , it became clear that eu leaders were beginning to rally round barroso .
germany had originally backed belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt for the post , but britain blocked this choice , partly because verhofstadt was considered too critical of u.s. foreign policy .
on sunday , chancellor gerhard schröder stressed that barroso could count on his support , and said he saw a " convinced and dynamic " european in the portuguese leader . " i do n't go back on the fact that i was for guy verhofstadt .
but i think that europe is always about finding compromises , " schröder told reporters at a nato summit in istanbul . french president jacques chirac also had praise for barroso , in part , because of his nationality .
barroso will be the commission 's first portuguese president .
after the eastward expansion of the eu , chirac said it would be good to remember that the bloc also has a south . tough challenges ahead the european parliament still has to approve barroso 's appointment in a vote to be held on july 21 or 22 , after he outlines his policies .
speaking earlier on portuguese television , barroso vowed to make the eu " stronger , even more cohesive and just , and more intervening on the international scene . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquarters of the european commission among the key challenges facing barroso is a revision of the bloc 's budget rules .
last year , finance ministers suspended the rulebook - which stipulates that member countries must not have a budget deficit of more than 3 percent of gdp - after france and germany repeatedly breached the deficit limits . the commission also has to ensure that the 10 mainly eastern european nations that joined the bloc in may integrate properly , and prepare for the next wave of eu enlargement that could see countries in the balkans and southeastern europe join the family . in addition to nominating barroso , eu leaders also reappointed foreign policy high representative javier solana of spain for another five-year term and designated him as the eu 's future first foreign minister . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de luck o ' the eu ireland can be pleased with its eu presidency , which ends on wednesday : under the country 's leadership , the union welcomed 10 new members , agreed on a new constitution and found a new eu commission president .
-lrb- june 29 , 2004 -rrb- schröder 's man in brussels the german government wants eu commissioner for expansion , günter verheugen , to stay in brussels and become the first " super commissioner " for industry and economics .
but the conservative opposition is unenthusiastic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.06.2004 jetting around more responsibly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers are urged to compensate for environmental damage .
budget airlines have made it easier for people to take to the skies , but on the downside frequent air travel pollutes the environment .
a german initiative " atmosfair " aims to encourage passengers to restore the balance . it 's a known fact that frequent flyers - in addition to racking-up those handy little miles - damage the environment . air travel has increased five-fold since 1970 , with much of that growth taking place in the last few years due to the increasing popularity of budget airlines .
however , as the cost of tickets continues to decline , it has become increasingly clear that bargain prices do not account for the damage a single flight does to the environment . environmental groups say such air travel is a climate catastrophe in the making , since airplanes emit three times the amount of greenhouse gases that automobiles do .
the no-frills travel boom , according to germany ’ s green lobby , is the country ’ s “ number one climate killer ” . climate change , caused by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , is deemed by many experts to be the biggest long-term threat to mankind .
they predict rapidly rising temperatures prompting higher sea levels , devastating floods and droughts . the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates aviation causes 3.5 percent of man-made global warming and that figure could rise to 15 percent by 2050 . efforts to impose a tax on jet-engine fuel have been unsuccessful , and , thus far , the issue has not been addressed in the kyoto protocol , the international treaty aimed at preventing climate change .
but now , a german environmental initiative , atmosfair , hopes to encourage travellers to strike the right balance on a voluntary basis . making-up the difference the idea is simple : those who fly will make a contribution to finance an environmental project in a developing country . the idea occurred to germany 's environmental minister , jürgen trittin , when he attended the united nations ' conference on environment and development in 2002 . " we were trying to think of a way we could credibly attend the conference , given the fact that the transport of our delegation would result in 1280 tons of greenhouse gas , " said the minister .
of course , that would have to be made-up elsewhere , says trittin , so he and and his ministry financed a row of ecologically sensitive homes in a township . the concept has now been adopted on a larger scale by atmosfair , which is run by klaus töpfer , the director of the united nations ' environmental program .

a flight from berlin to nairobi , including a change in frankfurt , creates 4260 kilograms of carbon monoxide .
converted into euros , that comes to € 74.70 . ideally , airline passengers will calculate these expenses and contribute some or all of the sum towards the environmental projects sponsored by the forum , including the construction of solar community kitchens in india and an environmentally-friendly factories in brazil . töpfer , for one , has promised to make contributions for all of his flights this month , and considering how often this u.n. official jets around the world , that 's quite a bit . jens thurau -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are budget airlines killing the planet ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.06.2004 u.s.-european spacecraft nears goal of saturn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the craft will come within 80,230 km -lrb- 49,850 miles -rrb- of saturn launched by nasa and the european space agency , the cassini space probe is set to reach saturn thursday and start investigating the second largest planet in the solar system . after a nearly seven year journey , scientists in europe and the united states are waiting with bated breath for the cassini spacecraft to approach saturn .
the probe will have traveled 3.5 billion kilometers -lrb- 2.2 billion miles -rrb- , when it finally starts orbiting the ringed planet thursday . the critical moment , however , will come when cassini is set to fire its engines after flying through a gap in saturn 's rings , starting at 2:36 utc thursday morning .
that should use up 1.5 tons of fuel and slow the craft down enough for it to get caught in saturn 's gravity field and pulled into the planet 's orbit .
but with a delay of more than an hour , scientists on the earth will have no control over cassini , which will have to manage the tricky maneuver without colliding with any potentially damaging space particles on its own .
from there the probe will begin making 76 rounds of saturn over a period of at least four years , collecting data and images of the planet , its rings and its moons . " we 're right on track , " navigation team chief jeremy jones told a news conference tuesday at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory .
cassini program manager robert mitchell and other officials expressed confidence that the craft would successfully enter saturn 's orbit , but he admitted that the procedure was a " hair-graying " event , ap reported . named after the french astronomer who in 1675 discovered saturn 's rings , cassini is expected to start sending data and images from saturn on thursday . decades of work the mission has been in the works for nearly 30 years and has cost nasa and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- $ 3.3 billion -lrb- € 2.71 billion -rrb- and the energies of more than 5,000 scientists .
cassini , carrying the wok-shaped probe huygens on its back , was sent into space from cape canaveral in florida on october 1997 . huygens , named after the dutch astronomer who in 1659 first recognized the true shape of the ring around saturn , is meant to explore titan , the largest of the planet 's 31 known moons .
the craft is programmed to take leave of its host on christmas and parachute into titan 's atmosphere . the moon is particularly interesting to scientists because it 's thought to have conditions similar to those on earth before life emerged .
scientists estimate huygens will have around one and a half hours to relay data from titan 's atmosphere before its battery runs out in the minus 180 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 292 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- weather . " this is one of the most exciting projects we have going , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told dw-world .
" huygens will be the first time europe has landed in the outer solar system .
and perhaps the most exciting thing of all is that we do n't know whether it 's going to land or splash down , because titan is swathed in a thick , smoggy atmosphere and we ca n't see its surface .
it may have methane oceans .

the probe will have traveled 3.5 billion kilometers -lrb- 2.2 billion miles -rrb- , when it finally starts orbiting the ringed planet thursday . the critical moment , however , will come when cassini is set to fire its engines after flying through a gap in saturn 's rings , starting at 2:36 utc thursday morning .
that should use up 1.5 tons of fuel and slow the craft down enough for it to get caught in saturn 's gravity field and pulled into the planet 's orbit .
but with a delay of more than an hour , scientists on the earth will have no control over cassini , which will have to manage the tricky maneuver without colliding with any potentially damaging space particles on its own .
from there the probe will begin making 76 rounds of saturn over a period of at least four years , collecting data and images of the planet , its rings and its moons . " we 're right on track , " navigation team chief jeremy jones told a news conference tuesday at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory .
cassini program manager robert mitchell and other officials expressed confidence that the craft would successfully enter saturn 's orbit , but he admitted that the procedure was a " hair-graying " event , ap reported . named after the french astronomer who in 1675 discovered saturn 's rings , cassini is expected to start sending data and images from saturn on thursday . decades of work the mission has been in the works for nearly 30 years and has cost nasa and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- $ 3.3 billion -lrb- € 2.71 billion -rrb- and the energies of more than 5,000 scientists .
cassini , carrying the wok-shaped probe huygens on its back , was sent into space from cape canaveral in florida on october 1997 . huygens , named after the dutch astronomer who in 1659 first recognized the true shape of the ring around saturn , is meant to explore titan , the largest of the planet 's 31 known moons .
the craft is programmed to take leave of its host on christmas and parachute into titan 's atmosphere . the moon is particularly interesting to scientists because it 's thought to have conditions similar to those on earth before life emerged .
scientists estimate huygens will have around one and a half hours to relay data from titan 's atmosphere before its battery runs out in the minus 180 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 292 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- weather . " this is one of the most exciting projects we have going , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told dw-world .
" huygens will be the first time europe has landed in the outer solar system .
and perhaps the most exciting thing of all is that we do n't know whether it 's going to land or splash down , because titan is swathed in a thick , smoggy atmosphere and we ca n't see its surface .
it may have methane oceans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.06.2004 panel reveals plans to revive eastern germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infrastructure 's pretty good in eastern germany , the panel says a panel of german government advisors has presented a controversial catalogue of measures they consider necessary for readjusting berlin ’ s economic policy to promote sustainable growth in eastern germany . the experts around the former social democrat mayor of hamburg , klaus von dohnanyi , believe that the way the massive west-east financial transfers have been handled since reunification has been a complete failure .
the government itself brushed off the criticism as unfounded , but promised nonetheless to look into the panel ’ s recommendations .
fourteen out of the 16 members of the advisory panel agree that the government under german chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat , has ignored the real economic hardships in eastern germany since it came to power in 1998 . they claim that despite the fact that huge sums have been transferred from the affluent west to the depressed east , not a single core economic problem there has so far been resolved .
they point to eastern companies ’ weak capital stock and an unemployment rate twice as high as that in western germany . using funds more efficiently panel spokesman klaus von dohnanyi called on the government to quickly revise its fiscal policy towards the east .
he and most of his colleagues don ’ t want more money to be pumped there - they want the money to be used more efficiently . dohnanyi argues that it 's high time to stop making infrastructure projects in the east a top priority when a good proportion of regions in the east already have a better infrastructure than those in the west . " money is limited and we transfer from the powerhouse west to east germany per annum about € 90 billion to 95 billion -lrb- $ 109 billion to $ 115 billion , -rrb- " he said .
" the money should be targeted on clusters , it should be targeted on businesses and it should not be targeted primarily on infrastructure .
it should be targeted in a way that the federal state does not come into too much conflict with local interest . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at a computer chip plant in dresden in eastern germany the advisory panel suggested using the bulk of the transfer money to promote selected innovative industries .
many of these are believed to have the potential for creating sustainable jobs , for instance in the fields of biomedicine and environmental technologies .
the panel also called on the government to reconsider tax exemptions for newly founded companies in the east , particularly for small and medium sized firms . this , the experts argued , should in fact ensure their survival in a heavily contested market .
they say it makes no sense to boast of the number of start-ups when each year the number of new companies in the east consistently equals the number of new insolvencies . talk of a low-wage sector dohnanyi also said that more thought should be given to the promotion of the low-wage sector in the east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment rates continue to soar in eastern germany " we have a new competition also now from eastern europe and we must see that these people in east germany can make a living , " he said .
" therefore we discuss things like the earned tax credit systems in the united states , etc . - something that we should add to the wages in order to be competitive and at the same time have an adequate living in the comparatively high cost country germany . " dohnanyi raised eyebrows in the berlin cabinet by suggesting to reinstate a special commissioner for eastern germany .
this implicitly calls into question the work of transport minister manfred stolpe , who ’ s currently responsible for eastern germany ’ s economic development together with economics minister wolfgang clement . critique from eastern german politicians while saying that he agreed with most of the panel 's suggestions , stolpe made it clear that he did not want to turn over responsibility for eastern germany to a cabinet member who would focus on the reconstruction effort in eastern germany . " that 's clearly enticing , but he will have to beg and struggle to achieve something , " he told berlin public broadcaster rbb , adding that a ministry like his own had better resources to deal with the problems . other political leaders from eastern germany - stolpe himself served as premier of the federal state of brandenburg that surrounds berlin before joining the federal cabinet - also voiced their opposition to the panel 's suggestions . dieter althaus , the christian democratic premier of the state of thuringia , called the panel " superfluous " and added that proposed cuts to funding of local infrastructure improvements would have " fatal consequences . " it ’ s not yet clear to what extent the schröder government is willing to listen to the expert panel ’ s suggestions .
in fact , the very future of the panel seems to be at stake , as it has been heavily criticized in the past for indiscretion and infighting among the experts . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eastern germany 's eu funds in danger of drying up the eu 's competition commissioner met with the heads of germany 's eastern states to discuss future financial support for the region , which may no longer be a top priority following enlargement . ´ -lrb- may 24 , 2004 -rrb- silicon saxony : chip factory brings high-tech to dresden u.s. chipmaker amd has broken ground on a $ 2.4 billion factory in dresden that will manufacture silicon wafers .

the government itself brushed off the criticism as unfounded , but promised nonetheless to look into the panel ’ s recommendations .
fourteen out of the 16 members of the advisory panel agree that the government under german chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat , has ignored the real economic hardships in eastern germany since it came to power in 1998 . they claim that despite the fact that huge sums have been transferred from the affluent west to the depressed east , not a single core economic problem there has so far been resolved .
they point to eastern companies ’ weak capital stock and an unemployment rate twice as high as that in western germany . using funds more efficiently panel spokesman klaus von dohnanyi called on the government to quickly revise its fiscal policy towards the east .
he and most of his colleagues don ’ t want more money to be pumped there - they want the money to be used more efficiently . dohnanyi argues that it 's high time to stop making infrastructure projects in the east a top priority when a good proportion of regions in the east already have a better infrastructure than those in the west . " money is limited and we transfer from the powerhouse west to east germany per annum about € 90 billion to 95 billion -lrb- $ 109 billion to $ 115 billion , -rrb- " he said .
" the money should be targeted on clusters , it should be targeted on businesses and it should not be targeted primarily on infrastructure .
it should be targeted in a way that the federal state does not come into too much conflict with local interest . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at a computer chip plant in dresden in eastern germany the advisory panel suggested using the bulk of the transfer money to promote selected innovative industries .
many of these are believed to have the potential for creating sustainable jobs , for instance in the fields of biomedicine and environmental technologies .
the panel also called on the government to reconsider tax exemptions for newly founded companies in the east , particularly for small and medium sized firms . this , the experts argued , should in fact ensure their survival in a heavily contested market .
they say it makes no sense to boast of the number of start-ups when each year the number of new companies in the east consistently equals the number of new insolvencies . talk of a low-wage sector dohnanyi also said that more thought should be given to the promotion of the low-wage sector in the east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment rates continue to soar in eastern germany " we have a new competition also now from eastern europe and we must see that these people in east germany can make a living , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.06.2004 jetting around more responsibly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers are urged to compensate for environmental damage .
budget airlines have made it easier for people to take to the skies , but on the downside frequent air travel pollutes the environment .
a german initiative " atmosfair " aims to encourage passengers to restore the balance . it 's a known fact that frequent flyers - in addition to racking-up those handy little miles - damage the environment . air travel has increased five-fold since 1970 , with much of that growth taking place in the last few years due to the increasing popularity of budget airlines .
however , as the cost of tickets continues to decline , it has become increasingly clear that bargain prices do not account for the damage a single flight does to the environment . environmental groups say such air travel is a climate catastrophe in the making , since airplanes emit three times the amount of greenhouse gases that automobiles do .
the no-frills travel boom , according to germany ’ s green lobby , is the country ’ s “ number one climate killer ” . climate change , caused by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , is deemed by many experts to be the biggest long-term threat to mankind .
they predict rapidly rising temperatures prompting higher sea levels , devastating floods and droughts . the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates aviation causes 3.5 percent of man-made global warming and that figure could rise to 15 percent by 2050 . efforts to impose a tax on jet-engine fuel have been unsuccessful , and , thus far , the issue has not been addressed in the kyoto protocol , the international treaty aimed at preventing climate change .
but now , a german environmental initiative , atmosfair , hopes to encourage travellers to strike the right balance on a voluntary basis . making-up the difference the idea is simple : those who fly will make a contribution to finance an environmental project in a developing country . the idea occurred to germany 's environmental minister , jürgen trittin , when he attended the united nations ' conference on environment and development in 2002 . " we were trying to think of a way we could credibly attend the conference , given the fact that the transport of our delegation would result in 1280 tons of greenhouse gas , " said the minister .
of course , that would have to be made-up elsewhere , says trittin , so he and and his ministry financed a row of ecologically sensitive homes in a township . the concept has now been adopted on a larger scale by atmosfair , which is run by klaus töpfer , the director of the united nations ' environmental program .
töpfer doubts every flight guest will voluntarily contribute his or her share , but he hopes the project will create a greater awareness . " the costs must be carried by someone , " he told deutsche welle , " and in general , we pawn them off on those living in considerably poorer countries and on future generations . " the sponsor of the effort is the " forum for a different kind of travel " , an umbrella organization of 100 environmentally aware travel agencies with 60,000 customers per year , half of whom are frequent flyers . that 'll be € 74.70 to nairobi and back , please the forum has worked out a table , which can be used to calculate in euros the approximate cost of - if one can quantify such things in money - air travel of varying lengths does to the environment . for example , a flight from berlin to bonn and back - according to the table - costs € 8 .
a flight from berlin to nairobi , including a change in frankfurt , creates 4260 kilograms of carbon monoxide .
converted into euros , that comes to € 74.70 . ideally , airline passengers will calculate these expenses and contribute some or all of the sum towards the environmental projects sponsored by the forum , including the construction of solar community kitchens in india and an environmentally-friendly factories in brazil . töpfer , for one , has promised to make contributions for all of his flights this month , and considering how often this u.n. official jets around the world , that 's quite a bit . jens thurau -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are budget airlines killing the planet ?
they 're cheap , easy and disastrous for the environment , according to german environmentalists .

budget airlines have made it easier for people to take to the skies , but on the downside frequent air travel pollutes the environment .
a german initiative " atmosfair " aims to encourage passengers to restore the balance . it 's a known fact that frequent flyers - in addition to racking-up those handy little miles - damage the environment . air travel has increased five-fold since 1970 , with much of that growth taking place in the last few years due to the increasing popularity of budget airlines .
however , as the cost of tickets continues to decline , it has become increasingly clear that bargain prices do not account for the damage a single flight does to the environment . environmental groups say such air travel is a climate catastrophe in the making , since airplanes emit three times the amount of greenhouse gases that automobiles do .
the no-frills travel boom , according to germany ’ s green lobby , is the country ’ s “ number one climate killer ” . climate change , caused by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , is deemed by many experts to be the biggest long-term threat to mankind .
they predict rapidly rising temperatures prompting higher sea levels , devastating floods and droughts . the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates aviation causes 3.5 percent of man-made global warming and that figure could rise to 15 percent by 2050 . efforts to impose a tax on jet-engine fuel have been unsuccessful , and , thus far , the issue has not been addressed in the kyoto protocol , the international treaty aimed at preventing climate change .
but now , a german environmental initiative , atmosfair , hopes to encourage travellers to strike the right balance on a voluntary basis . making-up the difference the idea is simple : those who fly will make a contribution to finance an environmental project in a developing country . the idea occurred to germany 's environmental minister , jürgen trittin , when he attended the united nations ' conference on environment and development in 2002 . " we were trying to think of a way we could credibly attend the conference , given the fact that the transport of our delegation would result in 1280 tons of greenhouse gas , " said the minister .
of course , that would have to be made-up elsewhere , says trittin , so he and and his ministry financed a row of ecologically sensitive homes in a township . the concept has now been adopted on a larger scale by atmosfair , which is run by klaus töpfer , the director of the united nations ' environmental program .
töpfer doubts every flight guest will voluntarily contribute his or her share , but he hopes the project will create a greater awareness . " the costs must be carried by someone , " he told deutsche welle , " and in general , we pawn them off on those living in considerably poorer countries and on future generations .

a german initiative " atmosfair " aims to encourage passengers to restore the balance . it 's a known fact that frequent flyers - in addition to racking-up those handy little miles - damage the environment . air travel has increased five-fold since 1970 , with much of that growth taking place in the last few years due to the increasing popularity of budget airlines .
however , as the cost of tickets continues to decline , it has become increasingly clear that bargain prices do not account for the damage a single flight does to the environment . environmental groups say such air travel is a climate catastrophe in the making , since airplanes emit three times the amount of greenhouse gases that automobiles do .
the no-frills travel boom , according to germany ’ s green lobby , is the country ’ s “ number one climate killer ” . climate change , caused by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , is deemed by many experts to be the biggest long-term threat to mankind .
they predict rapidly rising temperatures prompting higher sea levels , devastating floods and droughts . the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates aviation causes 3.5 percent of man-made global warming and that figure could rise to 15 percent by 2050 . efforts to impose a tax on jet-engine fuel have been unsuccessful , and , thus far , the issue has not been addressed in the kyoto protocol , the international treaty aimed at preventing climate change .
but now , a german environmental initiative , atmosfair , hopes to encourage travellers to strike the right balance on a voluntary basis . making-up the difference the idea is simple : those who fly will make a contribution to finance an environmental project in a developing country . the idea occurred to germany 's environmental minister , jürgen trittin , when he attended the united nations ' conference on environment and development in 2002 . " we were trying to think of a way we could credibly attend the conference , given the fact that the transport of our delegation would result in 1280 tons of greenhouse gas , " said the minister .
of course , that would have to be made-up elsewhere , says trittin , so he and and his ministry financed a row of ecologically sensitive homes in a township . the concept has now been adopted on a larger scale by atmosfair , which is run by klaus töpfer , the director of the united nations ' environmental program .
töpfer doubts every flight guest will voluntarily contribute his or her share , but he hopes the project will create a greater awareness . " the costs must be carried by someone , " he told deutsche welle , " and in general , we pawn them off on those living in considerably poorer countries and on future generations . " the sponsor of the effort is the " forum for a different kind of travel " , an umbrella organization of 100 environmentally aware travel agencies with 60,000 customers per year , half of whom are frequent flyers . that 'll be € 74.70 to nairobi and back , please the forum has worked out a table , which can be used to calculate in euros the approximate cost of - if one can quantify such things in money - air travel of varying lengths does to the environment . for example , a flight from berlin to bonn and back - according to the table - costs € 8 .
a flight from berlin to nairobi , including a change in frankfurt , creates 4260 kilograms of carbon monoxide .
converted into euros , that comes to € 74.70 . ideally , airline passengers will calculate these expenses and contribute some or all of the sum towards the environmental projects sponsored by the forum , including the construction of solar community kitchens in india and an environmentally-friendly factories in brazil . töpfer , for one , has promised to make contributions for all of his flights this month , and considering how often this u.n. official jets around the world , that 's quite a bit . jens thurau -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are budget airlines killing the planet ?
they 're cheap , easy and disastrous for the environment , according to german environmentalists .
no-frills airlines are under attack in a new awareness-raising campaign .

the probe will have traveled 3.5 billion kilometers -lrb- 2.2 billion miles -rrb- , when it finally starts orbiting the ringed planet thursday . the critical moment , however , will come when cassini is set to fire its engines after flying through a gap in saturn 's rings , starting at 2:36 utc thursday morning .
that should use up 1.5 tons of fuel and slow the craft down enough for it to get caught in saturn 's gravity field and pulled into the planet 's orbit .
but with a delay of more than an hour , scientists on the earth will have no control over cassini , which will have to manage the tricky maneuver without colliding with any potentially damaging space particles on its own .
from there the probe will begin making 76 rounds of saturn over a period of at least four years , collecting data and images of the planet , its rings and its moons . " we 're right on track , " navigation team chief jeremy jones told a news conference tuesday at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory .
cassini program manager robert mitchell and other officials expressed confidence that the craft would successfully enter saturn 's orbit , but he admitted that the procedure was a " hair-graying " event , ap reported . named after the french astronomer who in 1675 discovered saturn 's rings , cassini is expected to start sending data and images from saturn on thursday . decades of work the mission has been in the works for nearly 30 years and has cost nasa and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- $ 3.3 billion -lrb- € 2.71 billion -rrb- and the energies of more than 5,000 scientists .
cassini , carrying the wok-shaped probe huygens on its back , was sent into space from cape canaveral in florida on october 1997 . huygens , named after the dutch astronomer who in 1659 first recognized the true shape of the ring around saturn , is meant to explore titan , the largest of the planet 's 31 known moons .
the craft is programmed to take leave of its host on christmas and parachute into titan 's atmosphere . the moon is particularly interesting to scientists because it 's thought to have conditions similar to those on earth before life emerged .
scientists estimate huygens will have around one and a half hours to relay data from titan 's atmosphere before its battery runs out in the minus 180 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 292 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- weather . " this is one of the most exciting projects we have going , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told dw-world .
" huygens will be the first time europe has landed in the outer solar system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.06.2004 barroso appointed eu commission president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's official european union leaders officially named portuguese prime minister durao barroso as the next european commission president at a special summit in brussels . barroso 's appointment ends weeks of deadlock , haggling , and rumors about who would succeed outgoing commission president romano prodi .
the 48-year-old conservative lawyer was picked after nearly a dozen other candidates were rejected .
his nomination took only minutes , as he had the unanimous backing of his 24 fellow leaders . but reaching that level of consensus was n't easy .
horse-trading over who would take the top eu job intensified after eu leaders failed to agree on a candidate at their last summit in mid-june .
analysts say barroso 's first task will be to dispel the notion that he is the " lowest common denominator " - chosen only because the heads of government could n't agree on anyone else . german support over the weekend , it became clear that eu leaders were beginning to rally round barroso .
germany had originally backed belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt for the post , but britain blocked this choice , partly because verhofstadt was considered too critical of u.s. foreign policy .
on sunday , chancellor gerhard schröder stressed that barroso could count on his support , and said he saw a " convinced and dynamic " european in the portuguese leader . " i do n't go back on the fact that i was for guy verhofstadt .
but i think that europe is always about finding compromises , " schröder told reporters at a nato summit in istanbul . french president jacques chirac also had praise for barroso , in part , because of his nationality .
barroso will be the commission 's first portuguese president .
after the eastward expansion of the eu , chirac said it would be good to remember that the bloc also has a south . tough challenges ahead the european parliament still has to approve barroso 's appointment in a vote to be held on july 21 or 22 , after he outlines his policies .
speaking earlier on portuguese television , barroso vowed to make the eu " stronger , even more cohesive and just , and more intervening on the international scene . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquarters of the european commission among the key challenges facing barroso is a revision of the bloc 's budget rules .
last year , finance ministers suspended the rulebook - which stipulates that member countries must not have a budget deficit of more than 3 percent of gdp - after france and germany repeatedly breached the deficit limits . the commission also has to ensure that the 10 mainly eastern european nations that joined the bloc in may integrate properly , and prepare for the next wave of eu enlargement that could see countries in the balkans and southeastern europe join the family . in addition to nominating barroso , eu leaders also reappointed foreign policy high representative javier solana of spain for another five-year term and designated him as the eu 's future first foreign minister . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de luck o ' the eu ireland can be pleased with its eu presidency , which ends on wednesday : under the country 's leadership , the union welcomed 10 new members , agreed on a new constitution and found a new eu commission president .
-lrb- june 29 , 2004 -rrb- schröder 's man in brussels the german government wants eu commissioner for expansion , günter verheugen , to stay in brussels and become the first " super commissioner " for industry and economics .
but the conservative opposition is unenthusiastic .
-lrb- june 29 , 2004 -rrb- portuguese prime minister likely to head eu commission the search for a new european commission president seems finally to have come to an end .
portuguese prime minister durao barroso is expected to fill a position with prerequisites few candidates can satisfy .

the european parliament had called for the text to be adopted in madrid as a tribute to the victims of the terrorist attacks on the city on march 11 .
after failing to get the text agreed on time during the italian presidency at the end of last year , the italian prime minister silvio berlusconi pressed successfully for the text to be adopted in rome in any instance .
traditionally the treaties have been signed in the country that holds the presidency of the council at the time it is agreed , in this case ireland .
but rome has great symbolic power , since it was where the original treaty of rome was signed in 1957 .
the new constitution would replace that historic document .

the european parliament had called for the text to be adopted in madrid as a tribute to the victims of the terrorist attacks on the city on march 11 .
after failing to get the text agreed on time during the italian presidency at the end of last year , the italian prime minister silvio berlusconi pressed successfully for the text to be adopted in rome in any instance .
traditionally the treaties have been signed in the country that holds the presidency of the council at the time it is agreed , in this case ireland .
but rome has great symbolic power , since it was where the original treaty of rome was signed in 1957 .
the new constitution would replace that historic document .

the government itself brushed off the criticism as unfounded , but promised nonetheless to look into the panel ’ s recommendations .
fourteen out of the 16 members of the advisory panel agree that the government under german chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat , has ignored the real economic hardships in eastern germany since it came to power in 1998 . they claim that despite the fact that huge sums have been transferred from the affluent west to the depressed east , not a single core economic problem there has so far been resolved .
they point to eastern companies ’ weak capital stock and an unemployment rate twice as high as that in western germany . using funds more efficiently panel spokesman klaus von dohnanyi called on the government to quickly revise its fiscal policy towards the east .
he and most of his colleagues don ’ t want more money to be pumped there - they want the money to be used more efficiently . dohnanyi argues that it 's high time to stop making infrastructure projects in the east a top priority when a good proportion of regions in the east already have a better infrastructure than those in the west . " money is limited and we transfer from the powerhouse west to east germany per annum about € 90 billion to 95 billion -lrb- $ 109 billion to $ 115 billion , -rrb- " he said .
" the money should be targeted on clusters , it should be targeted on businesses and it should not be targeted primarily on infrastructure .
it should be targeted in a way that the federal state does not come into too much conflict with local interest . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at a computer chip plant in dresden in eastern germany the advisory panel suggested using the bulk of the transfer money to promote selected innovative industries .
many of these are believed to have the potential for creating sustainable jobs , for instance in the fields of biomedicine and environmental technologies .
the panel also called on the government to reconsider tax exemptions for newly founded companies in the east , particularly for small and medium sized firms . this , the experts argued , should in fact ensure their survival in a heavily contested market .
they say it makes no sense to boast of the number of start-ups when each year the number of new companies in the east consistently equals the number of new insolvencies . talk of a low-wage sector dohnanyi also said that more thought should be given to the promotion of the low-wage sector in the east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment rates continue to soar in eastern germany " we have a new competition also now from eastern europe and we must see that these people in east germany can make a living , " he said .
" therefore we discuss things like the earned tax credit systems in the united states , etc . - something that we should add to the wages in order to be competitive and at the same time have an adequate living in the comparatively high cost country germany . " dohnanyi raised eyebrows in the berlin cabinet by suggesting to reinstate a special commissioner for eastern germany .
this implicitly calls into question the work of transport minister manfred stolpe , who ’ s currently responsible for eastern germany ’ s economic development together with economics minister wolfgang clement . critique from eastern german politicians while saying that he agreed with most of the panel 's suggestions , stolpe made it clear that he did not want to turn over responsibility for eastern germany to a cabinet member who would focus on the reconstruction effort in eastern germany . " that 's clearly enticing , but he will have to beg and struggle to achieve something , " he told berlin public broadcaster rbb , adding that a ministry like his own had better resources to deal with the problems . other political leaders from eastern germany - stolpe himself served as premier of the federal state of brandenburg that surrounds berlin before joining the federal cabinet - also voiced their opposition to the panel 's suggestions . dieter althaus , the christian democratic premier of the state of thuringia , called the panel " superfluous " and added that proposed cuts to funding of local infrastructure improvements would have " fatal consequences . " it ’ s not yet clear to what extent the schröder government is willing to listen to the expert panel ’ s suggestions .
in fact , the very future of the panel seems to be at stake , as it has been heavily criticized in the past for indiscretion and infighting among the experts . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eastern germany 's eu funds in danger of drying up the eu 's competition commissioner met with the heads of germany 's eastern states to discuss future financial support for the region , which may no longer be a top priority following enlargement . ´ -lrb- may 24 , 2004 -rrb- silicon saxony : chip factory brings high-tech to dresden u.s. chipmaker amd has broken ground on a $ 2.4 billion factory in dresden that will manufacture silicon wafers .

many of these are believed to have the potential for creating sustainable jobs , for instance in the fields of biomedicine and environmental technologies .
the panel also called on the government to reconsider tax exemptions for newly founded companies in the east , particularly for small and medium sized firms . this , the experts argued , should in fact ensure their survival in a heavily contested market .
they say it makes no sense to boast of the number of start-ups when each year the number of new companies in the east consistently equals the number of new insolvencies . talk of a low-wage sector dohnanyi also said that more thought should be given to the promotion of the low-wage sector in the east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment rates continue to soar in eastern germany " we have a new competition also now from eastern europe and we must see that these people in east germany can make a living , " he said .
" therefore we discuss things like the earned tax credit systems in the united states , etc . - something that we should add to the wages in order to be competitive and at the same time have an adequate living in the comparatively high cost country germany . " dohnanyi raised eyebrows in the berlin cabinet by suggesting to reinstate a special commissioner for eastern germany .
this implicitly calls into question the work of transport minister manfred stolpe , who ’ s currently responsible for eastern germany ’ s economic development together with economics minister wolfgang clement . critique from eastern german politicians while saying that he agreed with most of the panel 's suggestions , stolpe made it clear that he did not want to turn over responsibility for eastern germany to a cabinet member who would focus on the reconstruction effort in eastern germany . " that 's clearly enticing , but he will have to beg and struggle to achieve something , " he told berlin public broadcaster rbb , adding that a ministry like his own had better resources to deal with the problems . other political leaders from eastern germany - stolpe himself served as premier of the federal state of brandenburg that surrounds berlin before joining the federal cabinet - also voiced their opposition to the panel 's suggestions . dieter althaus , the christian democratic premier of the state of thuringia , called the panel " superfluous " and added that proposed cuts to funding of local infrastructure improvements would have " fatal consequences . " it ’ s not yet clear to what extent the schröder government is willing to listen to the expert panel ’ s suggestions .
in fact , the very future of the panel seems to be at stake , as it has been heavily criticized in the past for indiscretion and infighting among the experts . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eastern germany 's eu funds in danger of drying up the eu 's competition commissioner met with the heads of germany 's eastern states to discuss future financial support for the region , which may no longer be a top priority following enlargement . ´ -lrb- may 24 , 2004 -rrb- silicon saxony : chip factory brings high-tech to dresden u.s. chipmaker amd has broken ground on a $ 2.4 billion factory in dresden that will manufacture silicon wafers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.06.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc constitution to be adopted in rome eu leaders meeting in brussels on tuesday agreed that the european constitution agreed on earlier this month in brussels should be officially adopted in rome in november .
the european parliament had called for the text to be adopted in madrid as a tribute to the victims of the terrorist attacks on the city on march 11 .
after failing to get the text agreed on time during the italian presidency at the end of last year , the italian prime minister silvio berlusconi pressed successfully for the text to be adopted in rome in any instance .
traditionally the treaties have been signed in the country that holds the presidency of the council at the time it is agreed , in this case ireland .

two similar cases were brought to the strasbourg court by turkish female students complaining that a ban on their wearing a headscarf was an unjustified interference with their right to education .
however , in a unanimous judgment , the seven judges in strasbourg pointed to the turkish constitutional court ’ s case law , which says secularism in turkey is , among other things , the guarantor of democratic values .
" restrictions could be placed on freedom to manifest one ’ s religion in order to defend those values and principles , " the court of human rights ruled .
the ruling might help the french government , which is facing several cases against a headscarf ban it plans to impose in state high schools , reported the independent .
rulings from the court in strasbourg take precedence over national court rulings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.06.2004 panel reveals plans to revive eastern germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infrastructure 's pretty good in eastern germany , the panel says a panel of german government advisors has presented a controversial catalogue of measures they consider necessary for readjusting berlin ’ s economic policy to promote sustainable growth in eastern germany . the experts around the former social democrat mayor of hamburg , klaus von dohnanyi , believe that the way the massive west-east financial transfers have been handled since reunification has been a complete failure .
the government itself brushed off the criticism as unfounded , but promised nonetheless to look into the panel ’ s recommendations .
fourteen out of the 16 members of the advisory panel agree that the government under german chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat , has ignored the real economic hardships in eastern germany since it came to power in 1998 . they claim that despite the fact that huge sums have been transferred from the affluent west to the depressed east , not a single core economic problem there has so far been resolved .
they point to eastern companies ’ weak capital stock and an unemployment rate twice as high as that in western germany . using funds more efficiently panel spokesman klaus von dohnanyi called on the government to quickly revise its fiscal policy towards the east .
he and most of his colleagues don ’ t want more money to be pumped there - they want the money to be used more efficiently . dohnanyi argues that it 's high time to stop making infrastructure projects in the east a top priority when a good proportion of regions in the east already have a better infrastructure than those in the west . " money is limited and we transfer from the powerhouse west to east germany per annum about € 90 billion to 95 billion -lrb- $ 109 billion to $ 115 billion , -rrb- " he said .
" the money should be targeted on clusters , it should be targeted on businesses and it should not be targeted primarily on infrastructure .
it should be targeted in a way that the federal state does not come into too much conflict with local interest . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at a computer chip plant in dresden in eastern germany the advisory panel suggested using the bulk of the transfer money to promote selected innovative industries .
many of these are believed to have the potential for creating sustainable jobs , for instance in the fields of biomedicine and environmental technologies .
the panel also called on the government to reconsider tax exemptions for newly founded companies in the east , particularly for small and medium sized firms . this , the experts argued , should in fact ensure their survival in a heavily contested market .
they say it makes no sense to boast of the number of start-ups when each year the number of new companies in the east consistently equals the number of new insolvencies . talk of a low-wage sector dohnanyi also said that more thought should be given to the promotion of the low-wage sector in the east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment rates continue to soar in eastern germany " we have a new competition also now from eastern europe and we must see that these people in east germany can make a living , " he said .
" therefore we discuss things like the earned tax credit systems in the united states , etc . - something that we should add to the wages in order to be competitive and at the same time have an adequate living in the comparatively high cost country germany . " dohnanyi raised eyebrows in the berlin cabinet by suggesting to reinstate a special commissioner for eastern germany .
this implicitly calls into question the work of transport minister manfred stolpe , who ’ s currently responsible for eastern germany ’ s economic development together with economics minister wolfgang clement . critique from eastern german politicians while saying that he agreed with most of the panel 's suggestions , stolpe made it clear that he did not want to turn over responsibility for eastern germany to a cabinet member who would focus on the reconstruction effort in eastern germany . " that 's clearly enticing , but he will have to beg and struggle to achieve something , " he told berlin public broadcaster rbb , adding that a ministry like his own had better resources to deal with the problems . other political leaders from eastern germany - stolpe himself served as premier of the federal state of brandenburg that surrounds berlin before joining the federal cabinet - also voiced their opposition to the panel 's suggestions . dieter althaus , the christian democratic premier of the state of thuringia , called the panel " superfluous " and added that proposed cuts to funding of local infrastructure improvements would have " fatal consequences . " it ’ s not yet clear to what extent the schröder government is willing to listen to the expert panel ’ s suggestions .
in fact , the very future of the panel seems to be at stake , as it has been heavily criticized in the past for indiscretion and infighting among the experts . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eastern germany 's eu funds in danger of drying up the eu 's competition commissioner met with the heads of germany 's eastern states to discuss future financial support for the region , which may no longer be a top priority following enlargement . ´ -lrb- may 24 , 2004 -rrb- silicon saxony : chip factory brings high-tech to dresden u.s. chipmaker amd has broken ground on a $ 2.4 billion factory in dresden that will manufacture silicon wafers .

however , the bill would ban all sunday shopping , except for two specially planned " sale sundays " per year .
the move is a reaction to a ruling by germany 's constitutional court earlier this month that a new law governing shop opening times could be decided individually by the country 's 16 states .
baden-württemberg 's social minister , friedhelm repnik , stressed that the conservative government , led by the christian democratic union and the free democrats , had sought a balance between the liberalization of shop opening times on weekdays and the preservation of cultural tradition on sundays .
the legislation is expected to be passed by the opposition-dominated bundesrat , the upper house of parliament representing the states , in july . more briefs 30.06.2004 -pipe- court says deutsche post ca n't film employees 29.06.2004 -pipe- karstadt-quelle moves on rewe joint venture 29.06.2004 -pipe- economy to grow 1.8 percent in 2004 29.06.2004 -pipe- competition in the beauty business hots up 29.06.2004 -pipe- german machinery orders up 28.06.2004 -pipe- ge opens european research center in germany 28.06.2004 -pipe- german consumer confidence rises in june 25.06.2004 -pipe- ifo business indicator shows unexpected drop in may radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.06.2004 panel reveals plans to revive eastern germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infrastructure 's pretty good in eastern germany , the panel says a panel of german government advisors has presented a controversial catalogue of measures they consider necessary for readjusting berlin ’ s economic policy to promote sustainable growth in eastern germany . the experts around the former social democrat mayor of hamburg , klaus von dohnanyi , believe that the way the massive west-east financial transfers have been handled since reunification has been a complete failure .
the government itself brushed off the criticism as unfounded , but promised nonetheless to look into the panel ’ s recommendations .
fourteen out of the 16 members of the advisory panel agree that the government under german chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat , has ignored the real economic hardships in eastern germany since it came to power in 1998 . they claim that despite the fact that huge sums have been transferred from the affluent west to the depressed east , not a single core economic problem there has so far been resolved .
they point to eastern companies ’ weak capital stock and an unemployment rate twice as high as that in western germany . using funds more efficiently panel spokesman klaus von dohnanyi called on the government to quickly revise its fiscal policy towards the east .
he and most of his colleagues don ’ t want more money to be pumped there - they want the money to be used more efficiently . dohnanyi argues that it 's high time to stop making infrastructure projects in the east a top priority when a good proportion of regions in the east already have a better infrastructure than those in the west . " money is limited and we transfer from the powerhouse west to east germany per annum about € 90 billion to 95 billion -lrb- $ 109 billion to $ 115 billion , -rrb- " he said .
" the money should be targeted on clusters , it should be targeted on businesses and it should not be targeted primarily on infrastructure .
it should be targeted in a way that the federal state does not come into too much conflict with local interest . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at a computer chip plant in dresden in eastern germany the advisory panel suggested using the bulk of the transfer money to promote selected innovative industries .
many of these are believed to have the potential for creating sustainable jobs , for instance in the fields of biomedicine and environmental technologies .
the panel also called on the government to reconsider tax exemptions for newly founded companies in the east , particularly for small and medium sized firms . this , the experts argued , should in fact ensure their survival in a heavily contested market .
they say it makes no sense to boast of the number of start-ups when each year the number of new companies in the east consistently equals the number of new insolvencies . talk of a low-wage sector dohnanyi also said that more thought should be given to the promotion of the low-wage sector in the east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment rates continue to soar in eastern germany " we have a new competition also now from eastern europe and we must see that these people in east germany can make a living , " he said .
" therefore we discuss things like the earned tax credit systems in the united states , etc . - something that we should add to the wages in order to be competitive and at the same time have an adequate living in the comparatively high cost country germany . " dohnanyi raised eyebrows in the berlin cabinet by suggesting to reinstate a special commissioner for eastern germany .
this implicitly calls into question the work of transport minister manfred stolpe , who ’ s currently responsible for eastern germany ’ s economic development together with economics minister wolfgang clement . critique from eastern german politicians while saying that he agreed with most of the panel 's suggestions , stolpe made it clear that he did not want to turn over responsibility for eastern germany to a cabinet member who would focus on the reconstruction effort in eastern germany . " that 's clearly enticing , but he will have to beg and struggle to achieve something , " he told berlin public broadcaster rbb , adding that a ministry like his own had better resources to deal with the problems . other political leaders from eastern germany - stolpe himself served as premier of the federal state of brandenburg that surrounds berlin before joining the federal cabinet - also voiced their opposition to the panel 's suggestions . dieter althaus , the christian democratic premier of the state of thuringia , called the panel " superfluous " and added that proposed cuts to funding of local infrastructure improvements would have " fatal consequences . " it ’ s not yet clear to what extent the schröder government is willing to listen to the expert panel ’ s suggestions .
in fact , the very future of the panel seems to be at stake , as it has been heavily criticized in the past for indiscretion and infighting among the experts . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eastern germany 's eu funds in danger of drying up the eu 's competition commissioner met with the heads of germany 's eastern states to discuss future financial support for the region , which may no longer be a top priority following enlargement . ´ -lrb- may 24 , 2004 -rrb- silicon saxony : chip factory brings high-tech to dresden u.s. chipmaker amd has broken ground on a $ 2.4 billion factory in dresden that will manufacture silicon wafers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.06.2004 panel reveals plans to revive eastern germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infrastructure 's pretty good in eastern germany , the panel says a panel of german government advisors has presented a controversial catalogue of measures they consider necessary for readjusting berlin ’ s economic policy to promote sustainable growth in eastern germany . the experts around the former social democrat mayor of hamburg , klaus von dohnanyi , believe that the way the massive west-east financial transfers have been handled since reunification has been a complete failure .
the government itself brushed off the criticism as unfounded , but promised nonetheless to look into the panel ’ s recommendations .
fourteen out of the 16 members of the advisory panel agree that the government under german chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat , has ignored the real economic hardships in eastern germany since it came to power in 1998 . they claim that despite the fact that huge sums have been transferred from the affluent west to the depressed east , not a single core economic problem there has so far been resolved .
they point to eastern companies ’ weak capital stock and an unemployment rate twice as high as that in western germany . using funds more efficiently panel spokesman klaus von dohnanyi called on the government to quickly revise its fiscal policy towards the east .
he and most of his colleagues don ’ t want more money to be pumped there - they want the money to be used more efficiently . dohnanyi argues that it 's high time to stop making infrastructure projects in the east a top priority when a good proportion of regions in the east already have a better infrastructure than those in the west . " money is limited and we transfer from the powerhouse west to east germany per annum about € 90 billion to 95 billion -lrb- $ 109 billion to $ 115 billion , -rrb- " he said .
" the money should be targeted on clusters , it should be targeted on businesses and it should not be targeted primarily on infrastructure .
it should be targeted in a way that the federal state does not come into too much conflict with local interest . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at a computer chip plant in dresden in eastern germany the advisory panel suggested using the bulk of the transfer money to promote selected innovative industries .
many of these are believed to have the potential for creating sustainable jobs , for instance in the fields of biomedicine and environmental technologies .
the panel also called on the government to reconsider tax exemptions for newly founded companies in the east , particularly for small and medium sized firms . this , the experts argued , should in fact ensure their survival in a heavily contested market .
they say it makes no sense to boast of the number of start-ups when each year the number of new companies in the east consistently equals the number of new insolvencies . talk of a low-wage sector dohnanyi also said that more thought should be given to the promotion of the low-wage sector in the east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment rates continue to soar in eastern germany " we have a new competition also now from eastern europe and we must see that these people in east germany can make a living , " he said .
" therefore we discuss things like the earned tax credit systems in the united states , etc . - something that we should add to the wages in order to be competitive and at the same time have an adequate living in the comparatively high cost country germany . " dohnanyi raised eyebrows in the berlin cabinet by suggesting to reinstate a special commissioner for eastern germany .
this implicitly calls into question the work of transport minister manfred stolpe , who ’ s currently responsible for eastern germany ’ s economic development together with economics minister wolfgang clement . critique from eastern german politicians while saying that he agreed with most of the panel 's suggestions , stolpe made it clear that he did not want to turn over responsibility for eastern germany to a cabinet member who would focus on the reconstruction effort in eastern germany . " that 's clearly enticing , but he will have to beg and struggle to achieve something , " he told berlin public broadcaster rbb , adding that a ministry like his own had better resources to deal with the problems . other political leaders from eastern germany - stolpe himself served as premier of the federal state of brandenburg that surrounds berlin before joining the federal cabinet - also voiced their opposition to the panel 's suggestions . dieter althaus , the christian democratic premier of the state of thuringia , called the panel " superfluous " and added that proposed cuts to funding of local infrastructure improvements would have " fatal consequences . " it ’ s not yet clear to what extent the schröder government is willing to listen to the expert panel ’ s suggestions .
in fact , the very future of the panel seems to be at stake , as it has been heavily criticized in the past for indiscretion and infighting among the experts . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eastern germany 's eu funds in danger of drying up the eu 's competition commissioner met with the heads of germany 's eastern states to discuss future financial support for the region , which may no longer be a top priority following enlargement . ´ -lrb- may 24 , 2004 -rrb- silicon saxony : chip factory brings high-tech to dresden u.s. chipmaker amd has broken ground on a $ 2.4 billion factory in dresden that will manufacture silicon wafers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.06.2004 jetting around more responsibly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers are urged to compensate for environmental damage .
budget airlines have made it easier for people to take to the skies , but on the downside frequent air travel pollutes the environment .
a german initiative " atmosfair " aims to encourage passengers to restore the balance . it 's a known fact that frequent flyers - in addition to racking-up those handy little miles - damage the environment . air travel has increased five-fold since 1970 , with much of that growth taking place in the last few years due to the increasing popularity of budget airlines .
however , as the cost of tickets continues to decline , it has become increasingly clear that bargain prices do not account for the damage a single flight does to the environment . environmental groups say such air travel is a climate catastrophe in the making , since airplanes emit three times the amount of greenhouse gases that automobiles do .
the no-frills travel boom , according to germany ’ s green lobby , is the country ’ s “ number one climate killer ” . climate change , caused by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , is deemed by many experts to be the biggest long-term threat to mankind .
they predict rapidly rising temperatures prompting higher sea levels , devastating floods and droughts . the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates aviation causes 3.5 percent of man-made global warming and that figure could rise to 15 percent by 2050 . efforts to impose a tax on jet-engine fuel have been unsuccessful , and , thus far , the issue has not been addressed in the kyoto protocol , the international treaty aimed at preventing climate change .
but now , a german environmental initiative , atmosfair , hopes to encourage travellers to strike the right balance on a voluntary basis . making-up the difference the idea is simple : those who fly will make a contribution to finance an environmental project in a developing country . the idea occurred to germany 's environmental minister , jürgen trittin , when he attended the united nations ' conference on environment and development in 2002 . " we were trying to think of a way we could credibly attend the conference , given the fact that the transport of our delegation would result in 1280 tons of greenhouse gas , " said the minister .
of course , that would have to be made-up elsewhere , says trittin , so he and and his ministry financed a row of ecologically sensitive homes in a township . the concept has now been adopted on a larger scale by atmosfair , which is run by klaus töpfer , the director of the united nations ' environmental program .
töpfer doubts every flight guest will voluntarily contribute his or her share , but he hopes the project will create a greater awareness . " the costs must be carried by someone , " he told deutsche welle , " and in general , we pawn them off on those living in considerably poorer countries and on future generations . " the sponsor of the effort is the " forum for a different kind of travel " , an umbrella organization of 100 environmentally aware travel agencies with 60,000 customers per year , half of whom are frequent flyers . that 'll be € 74.70 to nairobi and back , please the forum has worked out a table , which can be used to calculate in euros the approximate cost of - if one can quantify such things in money - air travel of varying lengths does to the environment . for example , a flight from berlin to bonn and back - according to the table - costs € 8 .
a flight from berlin to nairobi , including a change in frankfurt , creates 4260 kilograms of carbon monoxide .
converted into euros , that comes to € 74.70 . ideally , airline passengers will calculate these expenses and contribute some or all of the sum towards the environmental projects sponsored by the forum , including the construction of solar community kitchens in india and an environmentally-friendly factories in brazil . töpfer , for one , has promised to make contributions for all of his flights this month , and considering how often this u.n. official jets around the world , that 's quite a bit . jens thurau -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are budget airlines killing the planet ?
they 're cheap , easy and disastrous for the environment , according to german environmentalists .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.06.2004 panel reveals plans to revive eastern germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infrastructure 's pretty good in eastern germany , the panel says a panel of german government advisors has presented a controversial catalogue of measures they consider necessary for readjusting berlin ’ s economic policy to promote sustainable growth in eastern germany . the experts around the former social democrat mayor of hamburg , klaus von dohnanyi , believe that the way the massive west-east financial transfers have been handled since reunification has been a complete failure .
the government itself brushed off the criticism as unfounded , but promised nonetheless to look into the panel ’ s recommendations .
fourteen out of the 16 members of the advisory panel agree that the government under german chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat , has ignored the real economic hardships in eastern germany since it came to power in 1998 . they claim that despite the fact that huge sums have been transferred from the affluent west to the depressed east , not a single core economic problem there has so far been resolved .
they point to eastern companies ’ weak capital stock and an unemployment rate twice as high as that in western germany . using funds more efficiently panel spokesman klaus von dohnanyi called on the government to quickly revise its fiscal policy towards the east .
he and most of his colleagues don ’ t want more money to be pumped there - they want the money to be used more efficiently . dohnanyi argues that it 's high time to stop making infrastructure projects in the east a top priority when a good proportion of regions in the east already have a better infrastructure than those in the west . " money is limited and we transfer from the powerhouse west to east germany per annum about € 90 billion to 95 billion -lrb- $ 109 billion to $ 115 billion , -rrb- " he said .
" the money should be targeted on clusters , it should be targeted on businesses and it should not be targeted primarily on infrastructure .
it should be targeted in a way that the federal state does not come into too much conflict with local interest . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at a computer chip plant in dresden in eastern germany the advisory panel suggested using the bulk of the transfer money to promote selected innovative industries .
many of these are believed to have the potential for creating sustainable jobs , for instance in the fields of biomedicine and environmental technologies .
the panel also called on the government to reconsider tax exemptions for newly founded companies in the east , particularly for small and medium sized firms . this , the experts argued , should in fact ensure their survival in a heavily contested market .
they say it makes no sense to boast of the number of start-ups when each year the number of new companies in the east consistently equals the number of new insolvencies . talk of a low-wage sector dohnanyi also said that more thought should be given to the promotion of the low-wage sector in the east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment rates continue to soar in eastern germany " we have a new competition also now from eastern europe and we must see that these people in east germany can make a living , " he said .
" therefore we discuss things like the earned tax credit systems in the united states , etc . - something that we should add to the wages in order to be competitive and at the same time have an adequate living in the comparatively high cost country germany . " dohnanyi raised eyebrows in the berlin cabinet by suggesting to reinstate a special commissioner for eastern germany .
this implicitly calls into question the work of transport minister manfred stolpe , who ’ s currently responsible for eastern germany ’ s economic development together with economics minister wolfgang clement . critique from eastern german politicians while saying that he agreed with most of the panel 's suggestions , stolpe made it clear that he did not want to turn over responsibility for eastern germany to a cabinet member who would focus on the reconstruction effort in eastern germany . " that 's clearly enticing , but he will have to beg and struggle to achieve something , " he told berlin public broadcaster rbb , adding that a ministry like his own had better resources to deal with the problems . other political leaders from eastern germany - stolpe himself served as premier of the federal state of brandenburg that surrounds berlin before joining the federal cabinet - also voiced their opposition to the panel 's suggestions . dieter althaus , the christian democratic premier of the state of thuringia , called the panel " superfluous " and added that proposed cuts to funding of local infrastructure improvements would have " fatal consequences . " it ’ s not yet clear to what extent the schröder government is willing to listen to the expert panel ’ s suggestions .
in fact , the very future of the panel seems to be at stake , as it has been heavily criticized in the past for indiscretion and infighting among the experts . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eastern germany 's eu funds in danger of drying up the eu 's competition commissioner met with the heads of germany 's eastern states to discuss future financial support for the region , which may no longer be a top priority following enlargement . ´ -lrb- may 24 , 2004 -rrb- silicon saxony : chip factory brings high-tech to dresden u.s. chipmaker amd has broken ground on a $ 2.4 billion factory in dresden that will manufacture silicon wafers .

budget airlines have made it easier for people to take to the skies , but on the downside frequent air travel pollutes the environment .
a german initiative " atmosfair " aims to encourage passengers to restore the balance . it 's a known fact that frequent flyers - in addition to racking-up those handy little miles - damage the environment . air travel has increased five-fold since 1970 , with much of that growth taking place in the last few years due to the increasing popularity of budget airlines .
however , as the cost of tickets continues to decline , it has become increasingly clear that bargain prices do not account for the damage a single flight does to the environment . environmental groups say such air travel is a climate catastrophe in the making , since airplanes emit three times the amount of greenhouse gases that automobiles do .
the no-frills travel boom , according to germany ’ s green lobby , is the country ’ s “ number one climate killer ” . climate change , caused by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , is deemed by many experts to be the biggest long-term threat to mankind .
they predict rapidly rising temperatures prompting higher sea levels , devastating floods and droughts . the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates aviation causes 3.5 percent of man-made global warming and that figure could rise to 15 percent by 2050 . efforts to impose a tax on jet-engine fuel have been unsuccessful , and , thus far , the issue has not been addressed in the kyoto protocol , the international treaty aimed at preventing climate change .
but now , a german environmental initiative , atmosfair , hopes to encourage travellers to strike the right balance on a voluntary basis . making-up the difference the idea is simple : those who fly will make a contribution to finance an environmental project in a developing country . the idea occurred to germany 's environmental minister , jürgen trittin , when he attended the united nations ' conference on environment and development in 2002 . " we were trying to think of a way we could credibly attend the conference , given the fact that the transport of our delegation would result in 1280 tons of greenhouse gas , " said the minister .
of course , that would have to be made-up elsewhere , says trittin , so he and and his ministry financed a row of ecologically sensitive homes in a township . the concept has now been adopted on a larger scale by atmosfair , which is run by klaus töpfer , the director of the united nations ' environmental program .
töpfer doubts every flight guest will voluntarily contribute his or her share , but he hopes the project will create a greater awareness . " the costs must be carried by someone , " he told deutsche welle , " and in general , we pawn them off on those living in considerably poorer countries and on future generations . " the sponsor of the effort is the " forum for a different kind of travel " , an umbrella organization of 100 environmentally aware travel agencies with 60,000 customers per year , half of whom are frequent flyers . that 'll be € 74.70 to nairobi and back , please the forum has worked out a table , which can be used to calculate in euros the approximate cost of - if one can quantify such things in money - air travel of varying lengths does to the environment . for example , a flight from berlin to bonn and back - according to the table - costs € 8 .
a flight from berlin to nairobi , including a change in frankfurt , creates 4260 kilograms of carbon monoxide .
converted into euros , that comes to € 74.70 . ideally , airline passengers will calculate these expenses and contribute some or all of the sum towards the environmental projects sponsored by the forum , including the construction of solar community kitchens in india and an environmentally-friendly factories in brazil . töpfer , for one , has promised to make contributions for all of his flights this month , and considering how often this u.n. official jets around the world , that 's quite a bit . jens thurau -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are budget airlines killing the planet ?

the 48-year-old conservative lawyer was picked after nearly a dozen other candidates were rejected .
his nomination took only minutes , as he had the unanimous backing of his 24 fellow leaders . but reaching that level of consensus was n't easy .
horse-trading over who would take the top eu job intensified after eu leaders failed to agree on a candidate at their last summit in mid-june .
analysts say barroso 's first task will be to dispel the notion that he is the " lowest common denominator " - chosen only because the heads of government could n't agree on anyone else . german support over the weekend , it became clear that eu leaders were beginning to rally round barroso .
germany had originally backed belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt for the post , but britain blocked this choice , partly because verhofstadt was considered too critical of u.s. foreign policy .
on sunday , chancellor gerhard schröder stressed that barroso could count on his support , and said he saw a " convinced and dynamic " european in the portuguese leader . " i do n't go back on the fact that i was for guy verhofstadt .
but i think that europe is always about finding compromises , " schröder told reporters at a nato summit in istanbul . french president jacques chirac also had praise for barroso , in part , because of his nationality .
barroso will be the commission 's first portuguese president .
after the eastward expansion of the eu , chirac said it would be good to remember that the bloc also has a south . tough challenges ahead the european parliament still has to approve barroso 's appointment in a vote to be held on july 21 or 22 , after he outlines his policies .

last year , finance ministers suspended the rulebook - which stipulates that member countries must not have a budget deficit of more than 3 percent of gdp - after france and germany repeatedly breached the deficit limits . the commission also has to ensure that the 10 mainly eastern european nations that joined the bloc in may integrate properly , and prepare for the next wave of eu enlargement that could see countries in the balkans and southeastern europe join the family . in addition to nominating barroso , eu leaders also reappointed foreign policy high representative javier solana of spain for another five-year term and designated him as the eu 's future first foreign minister . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de luck o ' the eu ireland can be pleased with its eu presidency , which ends on wednesday : under the country 's leadership , the union welcomed 10 new members , agreed on a new constitution and found a new eu commission president .

the government itself brushed off the criticism as unfounded , but promised nonetheless to look into the panel ’ s recommendations .
fourteen out of the 16 members of the advisory panel agree that the government under german chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat , has ignored the real economic hardships in eastern germany since it came to power in 1998 . they claim that despite the fact that huge sums have been transferred from the affluent west to the depressed east , not a single core economic problem there has so far been resolved .
they point to eastern companies ’ weak capital stock and an unemployment rate twice as high as that in western germany . using funds more efficiently panel spokesman klaus von dohnanyi called on the government to quickly revise its fiscal policy towards the east .
he and most of his colleagues don ’ t want more money to be pumped there - they want the money to be used more efficiently . dohnanyi argues that it 's high time to stop making infrastructure projects in the east a top priority when a good proportion of regions in the east already have a better infrastructure than those in the west . " money is limited and we transfer from the powerhouse west to east germany per annum about € 90 billion to 95 billion -lrb- $ 109 billion to $ 115 billion , -rrb- " he said .
" the money should be targeted on clusters , it should be targeted on businesses and it should not be targeted primarily on infrastructure .
it should be targeted in a way that the federal state does not come into too much conflict with local interest . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at a computer chip plant in dresden in eastern germany the advisory panel suggested using the bulk of the transfer money to promote selected innovative industries .
many of these are believed to have the potential for creating sustainable jobs , for instance in the fields of biomedicine and environmental technologies .
the panel also called on the government to reconsider tax exemptions for newly founded companies in the east , particularly for small and medium sized firms . this , the experts argued , should in fact ensure their survival in a heavily contested market .
they say it makes no sense to boast of the number of start-ups when each year the number of new companies in the east consistently equals the number of new insolvencies . talk of a low-wage sector dohnanyi also said that more thought should be given to the promotion of the low-wage sector in the east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment rates continue to soar in eastern germany " we have a new competition also now from eastern europe and we must see that these people in east germany can make a living , " he said .
" therefore we discuss things like the earned tax credit systems in the united states , etc . - something that we should add to the wages in order to be competitive and at the same time have an adequate living in the comparatively high cost country germany . " dohnanyi raised eyebrows in the berlin cabinet by suggesting to reinstate a special commissioner for eastern germany .
this implicitly calls into question the work of transport minister manfred stolpe , who ’ s currently responsible for eastern germany ’ s economic development together with economics minister wolfgang clement . critique from eastern german politicians while saying that he agreed with most of the panel 's suggestions , stolpe made it clear that he did not want to turn over responsibility for eastern germany to a cabinet member who would focus on the reconstruction effort in eastern germany . " that 's clearly enticing , but he will have to beg and struggle to achieve something , " he told berlin public broadcaster rbb , adding that a ministry like his own had better resources to deal with the problems . other political leaders from eastern germany - stolpe himself served as premier of the federal state of brandenburg that surrounds berlin before joining the federal cabinet - also voiced their opposition to the panel 's suggestions . dieter althaus , the christian democratic premier of the state of thuringia , called the panel " superfluous " and added that proposed cuts to funding of local infrastructure improvements would have " fatal consequences . " it ’ s not yet clear to what extent the schröder government is willing to listen to the expert panel ’ s suggestions .

many of these are believed to have the potential for creating sustainable jobs , for instance in the fields of biomedicine and environmental technologies .
the panel also called on the government to reconsider tax exemptions for newly founded companies in the east , particularly for small and medium sized firms . this , the experts argued , should in fact ensure their survival in a heavily contested market .
they say it makes no sense to boast of the number of start-ups when each year the number of new companies in the east consistently equals the number of new insolvencies . talk of a low-wage sector dohnanyi also said that more thought should be given to the promotion of the low-wage sector in the east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment rates continue to soar in eastern germany " we have a new competition also now from eastern europe and we must see that these people in east germany can make a living , " he said .
" therefore we discuss things like the earned tax credit systems in the united states , etc . - something that we should add to the wages in order to be competitive and at the same time have an adequate living in the comparatively high cost country germany . " dohnanyi raised eyebrows in the berlin cabinet by suggesting to reinstate a special commissioner for eastern germany .
this implicitly calls into question the work of transport minister manfred stolpe , who ’ s currently responsible for eastern germany ’ s economic development together with economics minister wolfgang clement . critique from eastern german politicians while saying that he agreed with most of the panel 's suggestions , stolpe made it clear that he did not want to turn over responsibility for eastern germany to a cabinet member who would focus on the reconstruction effort in eastern germany . " that 's clearly enticing , but he will have to beg and struggle to achieve something , " he told berlin public broadcaster rbb , adding that a ministry like his own had better resources to deal with the problems . other political leaders from eastern germany - stolpe himself served as premier of the federal state of brandenburg that surrounds berlin before joining the federal cabinet - also voiced their opposition to the panel 's suggestions . dieter althaus , the christian democratic premier of the state of thuringia , called the panel " superfluous " and added that proposed cuts to funding of local infrastructure improvements would have " fatal consequences . " it ’ s not yet clear to what extent the schröder government is willing to listen to the expert panel ’ s suggestions .
in fact , the very future of the panel seems to be at stake , as it has been heavily criticized in the past for indiscretion and infighting among the experts . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eastern germany 's eu funds in danger of drying up the eu 's competition commissioner met with the heads of germany 's eastern states to discuss future financial support for the region , which may no longer be a top priority following enlargement . ´ -lrb- may 24 , 2004 -rrb- silicon saxony : chip factory brings high-tech to dresden u.s. chipmaker amd has broken ground on a $ 2.4 billion factory in dresden that will manufacture silicon wafers .

a german initiative " atmosfair " aims to encourage passengers to restore the balance . it 's a known fact that frequent flyers - in addition to racking-up those handy little miles - damage the environment . air travel has increased five-fold since 1970 , with much of that growth taking place in the last few years due to the increasing popularity of budget airlines .
however , as the cost of tickets continues to decline , it has become increasingly clear that bargain prices do not account for the damage a single flight does to the environment . environmental groups say such air travel is a climate catastrophe in the making , since airplanes emit three times the amount of greenhouse gases that automobiles do .
the no-frills travel boom , according to germany ’ s green lobby , is the country ’ s “ number one climate killer ” . climate change , caused by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , is deemed by many experts to be the biggest long-term threat to mankind .

but now , a german environmental initiative , atmosfair , hopes to encourage travellers to strike the right balance on a voluntary basis . making-up the difference the idea is simple : those who fly will make a contribution to finance an environmental project in a developing country . the idea occurred to germany 's environmental minister , jürgen trittin , when he attended the united nations ' conference on environment and development in 2002 . " we were trying to think of a way we could credibly attend the conference , given the fact that the transport of our delegation would result in 1280 tons of greenhouse gas , " said the minister .
of course , that would have to be made-up elsewhere , says trittin , so he and and his ministry financed a row of ecologically sensitive homes in a township . the concept has now been adopted on a larger scale by atmosfair , which is run by klaus töpfer , the director of the united nations ' environmental program .
töpfer doubts every flight guest will voluntarily contribute his or her share , but he hopes the project will create a greater awareness .

budget airlines have made it easier for people to take to the skies , but on the downside frequent air travel pollutes the environment .
a german initiative " atmosfair " aims to encourage passengers to restore the balance . it 's a known fact that frequent flyers - in addition to racking-up those handy little miles - damage the environment . air travel has increased five-fold since 1970 , with much of that growth taking place in the last few years due to the increasing popularity of budget airlines .
however , as the cost of tickets continues to decline , it has become increasingly clear that bargain prices do not account for the damage a single flight does to the environment . environmental groups say such air travel is a climate catastrophe in the making , since airplanes emit three times the amount of greenhouse gases that automobiles do .
the no-frills travel boom , according to germany ’ s green lobby , is the country ’ s “ number one climate killer ” . climate change , caused by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , is deemed by many experts to be the biggest long-term threat to mankind .
they predict rapidly rising temperatures prompting higher sea levels , devastating floods and droughts . the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates aviation causes 3.5 percent of man-made global warming and that figure could rise to 15 percent by 2050 . efforts to impose a tax on jet-engine fuel have been unsuccessful , and , thus far , the issue has not been addressed in the kyoto protocol , the international treaty aimed at preventing climate change .
but now , a german environmental initiative , atmosfair , hopes to encourage travellers to strike the right balance on a voluntary basis . making-up the difference the idea is simple : those who fly will make a contribution to finance an environmental project in a developing country . the idea occurred to germany 's environmental minister , jürgen trittin , when he attended the united nations ' conference on environment and development in 2002 . " we were trying to think of a way we could credibly attend the conference , given the fact that the transport of our delegation would result in 1280 tons of greenhouse gas , " said the minister .
of course , that would have to be made-up elsewhere , says trittin , so he and and his ministry financed a row of ecologically sensitive homes in a township . the concept has now been adopted on a larger scale by atmosfair , which is run by klaus töpfer , the director of the united nations ' environmental program .
töpfer doubts every flight guest will voluntarily contribute his or her share , but he hopes the project will create a greater awareness . " the costs must be carried by someone , " he told deutsche welle , " and in general , we pawn them off on those living in considerably poorer countries and on future generations . " the sponsor of the effort is the " forum for a different kind of travel " , an umbrella organization of 100 environmentally aware travel agencies with 60,000 customers per year , half of whom are frequent flyers . that 'll be € 74.70 to nairobi and back , please the forum has worked out a table , which can be used to calculate in euros the approximate cost of - if one can quantify such things in money - air travel of varying lengths does to the environment . for example , a flight from berlin to bonn and back - according to the table - costs € 8 .
a flight from berlin to nairobi , including a change in frankfurt , creates 4260 kilograms of carbon monoxide .
converted into euros , that comes to € 74.70 . ideally , airline passengers will calculate these expenses and contribute some or all of the sum towards the environmental projects sponsored by the forum , including the construction of solar community kitchens in india and an environmentally-friendly factories in brazil . töpfer , for one , has promised to make contributions for all of his flights this month , and considering how often this u.n. official jets around the world , that 's quite a bit . jens thurau -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are budget airlines killing the planet ?

the probe will have traveled 3.5 billion kilometers -lrb- 2.2 billion miles -rrb- , when it finally starts orbiting the ringed planet thursday . the critical moment , however , will come when cassini is set to fire its engines after flying through a gap in saturn 's rings , starting at 2:36 utc thursday morning .
that should use up 1.5 tons of fuel and slow the craft down enough for it to get caught in saturn 's gravity field and pulled into the planet 's orbit .
but with a delay of more than an hour , scientists on the earth will have no control over cassini , which will have to manage the tricky maneuver without colliding with any potentially damaging space particles on its own .
from there the probe will begin making 76 rounds of saturn over a period of at least four years , collecting data and images of the planet , its rings and its moons . " we 're right on track , " navigation team chief jeremy jones told a news conference tuesday at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory .
cassini program manager robert mitchell and other officials expressed confidence that the craft would successfully enter saturn 's orbit , but he admitted that the procedure was a " hair-graying " event , ap reported . named after the french astronomer who in 1675 discovered saturn 's rings , cassini is expected to start sending data and images from saturn on thursday . decades of work the mission has been in the works for nearly 30 years and has cost nasa and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- $ 3.3 billion -lrb- € 2.71 billion -rrb- and the energies of more than 5,000 scientists .
cassini , carrying the wok-shaped probe huygens on its back , was sent into space from cape canaveral in florida on october 1997 . huygens , named after the dutch astronomer who in 1659 first recognized the true shape of the ring around saturn , is meant to explore titan , the largest of the planet 's 31 known moons .
the craft is programmed to take leave of its host on christmas and parachute into titan 's atmosphere . the moon is particularly interesting to scientists because it 's thought to have conditions similar to those on earth before life emerged .
scientists estimate huygens will have around one and a half hours to relay data from titan 's atmosphere before its battery runs out in the minus 180 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 292 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- weather . " this is one of the most exciting projects we have going , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told dw-world .
" huygens will be the first time europe has landed in the outer solar system .

budget airlines have made it easier for people to take to the skies , but on the downside frequent air travel pollutes the environment .
a german initiative " atmosfair " aims to encourage passengers to restore the balance . it 's a known fact that frequent flyers - in addition to racking-up those handy little miles - damage the environment . air travel has increased five-fold since 1970 , with much of that growth taking place in the last few years due to the increasing popularity of budget airlines .
however , as the cost of tickets continues to decline , it has become increasingly clear that bargain prices do not account for the damage a single flight does to the environment . environmental groups say such air travel is a climate catastrophe in the making , since airplanes emit three times the amount of greenhouse gases that automobiles do .
the no-frills travel boom , according to germany ’ s green lobby , is the country ’ s “ number one climate killer ” . climate change , caused by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , is deemed by many experts to be the biggest long-term threat to mankind .
they predict rapidly rising temperatures prompting higher sea levels , devastating floods and droughts . the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates aviation causes 3.5 percent of man-made global warming and that figure could rise to 15 percent by 2050 . efforts to impose a tax on jet-engine fuel have been unsuccessful , and , thus far , the issue has not been addressed in the kyoto protocol , the international treaty aimed at preventing climate change .
but now , a german environmental initiative , atmosfair , hopes to encourage travellers to strike the right balance on a voluntary basis . making-up the difference the idea is simple : those who fly will make a contribution to finance an environmental project in a developing country . the idea occurred to germany 's environmental minister , jürgen trittin , when he attended the united nations ' conference on environment and development in 2002 . " we were trying to think of a way we could credibly attend the conference , given the fact that the transport of our delegation would result in 1280 tons of greenhouse gas , " said the minister .
of course , that would have to be made-up elsewhere , says trittin , so he and and his ministry financed a row of ecologically sensitive homes in a township . the concept has now been adopted on a larger scale by atmosfair , which is run by klaus töpfer , the director of the united nations ' environmental program .
töpfer doubts every flight guest will voluntarily contribute his or her share , but he hopes the project will create a greater awareness . " the costs must be carried by someone , " he told deutsche welle , " and in general , we pawn them off on those living in considerably poorer countries and on future generations . " the sponsor of the effort is the " forum for a different kind of travel " , an umbrella organization of 100 environmentally aware travel agencies with 60,000 customers per year , half of whom are frequent flyers . that 'll be € 74.70 to nairobi and back , please the forum has worked out a table , which can be used to calculate in euros the approximate cost of - if one can quantify such things in money - air travel of varying lengths does to the environment . for example , a flight from berlin to bonn and back - according to the table - costs € 8 .
a flight from berlin to nairobi , including a change in frankfurt , creates 4260 kilograms of carbon monoxide .
converted into euros , that comes to € 74.70 . ideally , airline passengers will calculate these expenses and contribute some or all of the sum towards the environmental projects sponsored by the forum , including the construction of solar community kitchens in india and an environmentally-friendly factories in brazil . töpfer , for one , has promised to make contributions for all of his flights this month , and considering how often this u.n. official jets around the world , that 's quite a bit . jens thurau -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are budget airlines killing the planet ?

the probe will have traveled 3.5 billion kilometers -lrb- 2.2 billion miles -rrb- , when it finally starts orbiting the ringed planet thursday . the critical moment , however , will come when cassini is set to fire its engines after flying through a gap in saturn 's rings , starting at 2:36 utc thursday morning .
that should use up 1.5 tons of fuel and slow the craft down enough for it to get caught in saturn 's gravity field and pulled into the planet 's orbit .
but with a delay of more than an hour , scientists on the earth will have no control over cassini , which will have to manage the tricky maneuver without colliding with any potentially damaging space particles on its own .
from there the probe will begin making 76 rounds of saturn over a period of at least four years , collecting data and images of the planet , its rings and its moons . " we 're right on track , " navigation team chief jeremy jones told a news conference tuesday at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory .
cassini program manager robert mitchell and other officials expressed confidence that the craft would successfully enter saturn 's orbit , but he admitted that the procedure was a " hair-graying " event , ap reported . named after the french astronomer who in 1675 discovered saturn 's rings , cassini is expected to start sending data and images from saturn on thursday . decades of work the mission has been in the works for nearly 30 years and has cost nasa and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- $ 3.3 billion -lrb- € 2.71 billion -rrb- and the energies of more than 5,000 scientists .
cassini , carrying the wok-shaped probe huygens on its back , was sent into space from cape canaveral in florida on october 1997 . huygens , named after the dutch astronomer who in 1659 first recognized the true shape of the ring around saturn , is meant to explore titan , the largest of the planet 's 31 known moons .
the craft is programmed to take leave of its host on christmas and parachute into titan 's atmosphere . the moon is particularly interesting to scientists because it 's thought to have conditions similar to those on earth before life emerged .
scientists estimate huygens will have around one and a half hours to relay data from titan 's atmosphere before its battery runs out in the minus 180 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 292 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- weather . " this is one of the most exciting projects we have going , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told dw-world .
" huygens will be the first time europe has landed in the outer solar system .

the probe will have traveled 3.5 billion kilometers -lrb- 2.2 billion miles -rrb- , when it finally starts orbiting the ringed planet thursday . the critical moment , however , will come when cassini is set to fire its engines after flying through a gap in saturn 's rings , starting at 2:36 utc thursday morning .
that should use up 1.5 tons of fuel and slow the craft down enough for it to get caught in saturn 's gravity field and pulled into the planet 's orbit .
but with a delay of more than an hour , scientists on the earth will have no control over cassini , which will have to manage the tricky maneuver without colliding with any potentially damaging space particles on its own .
from there the probe will begin making 76 rounds of saturn over a period of at least four years , collecting data and images of the planet , its rings and its moons . " we 're right on track , " navigation team chief jeremy jones told a news conference tuesday at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory .
cassini program manager robert mitchell and other officials expressed confidence that the craft would successfully enter saturn 's orbit , but he admitted that the procedure was a " hair-graying " event , ap reported . named after the french astronomer who in 1675 discovered saturn 's rings , cassini is expected to start sending data and images from saturn on thursday . decades of work the mission has been in the works for nearly 30 years and has cost nasa and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- $ 3.3 billion -lrb- € 2.71 billion -rrb- and the energies of more than 5,000 scientists .
cassini , carrying the wok-shaped probe huygens on its back , was sent into space from cape canaveral in florida on october 1997 . huygens , named after the dutch astronomer who in 1659 first recognized the true shape of the ring around saturn , is meant to explore titan , the largest of the planet 's 31 known moons .
the craft is programmed to take leave of its host on christmas and parachute into titan 's atmosphere . the moon is particularly interesting to scientists because it 's thought to have conditions similar to those on earth before life emerged .
scientists estimate huygens will have around one and a half hours to relay data from titan 's atmosphere before its battery runs out in the minus 180 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 292 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- weather . " this is one of the most exciting projects we have going , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told dw-world .
" huygens will be the first time europe has landed in the outer solar system .
and perhaps the most exciting thing of all is that we do n't know whether it 's going to land or splash down , because titan is swathed in a thick , smoggy atmosphere and we ca n't see its surface .
it may have methane oceans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.06.2004 panel reveals plans to revive eastern germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infrastructure 's pretty good in eastern germany , the panel says a panel of german government advisors has presented a controversial catalogue of measures they consider necessary for readjusting berlin ’ s economic policy to promote sustainable growth in eastern germany . the experts around the former social democrat mayor of hamburg , klaus von dohnanyi , believe that the way the massive west-east financial transfers have been handled since reunification has been a complete failure .
the government itself brushed off the criticism as unfounded , but promised nonetheless to look into the panel ’ s recommendations .
fourteen out of the 16 members of the advisory panel agree that the government under german chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat , has ignored the real economic hardships in eastern germany since it came to power in 1998 . they claim that despite the fact that huge sums have been transferred from the affluent west to the depressed east , not a single core economic problem there has so far been resolved .
they point to eastern companies ’ weak capital stock and an unemployment rate twice as high as that in western germany . using funds more efficiently panel spokesman klaus von dohnanyi called on the government to quickly revise its fiscal policy towards the east .
he and most of his colleagues don ’ t want more money to be pumped there - they want the money to be used more efficiently . dohnanyi argues that it 's high time to stop making infrastructure projects in the east a top priority when a good proportion of regions in the east already have a better infrastructure than those in the west . " money is limited and we transfer from the powerhouse west to east germany per annum about € 90 billion to 95 billion -lrb- $ 109 billion to $ 115 billion , -rrb- " he said .
" the money should be targeted on clusters , it should be targeted on businesses and it should not be targeted primarily on infrastructure .
it should be targeted in a way that the federal state does not come into too much conflict with local interest . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at a computer chip plant in dresden in eastern germany the advisory panel suggested using the bulk of the transfer money to promote selected innovative industries .
many of these are believed to have the potential for creating sustainable jobs , for instance in the fields of biomedicine and environmental technologies .
the panel also called on the government to reconsider tax exemptions for newly founded companies in the east , particularly for small and medium sized firms . this , the experts argued , should in fact ensure their survival in a heavily contested market .
they say it makes no sense to boast of the number of start-ups when each year the number of new companies in the east consistently equals the number of new insolvencies . talk of a low-wage sector dohnanyi also said that more thought should be given to the promotion of the low-wage sector in the east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment rates continue to soar in eastern germany " we have a new competition also now from eastern europe and we must see that these people in east germany can make a living , " he said .
" therefore we discuss things like the earned tax credit systems in the united states , etc . - something that we should add to the wages in order to be competitive and at the same time have an adequate living in the comparatively high cost country germany . " dohnanyi raised eyebrows in the berlin cabinet by suggesting to reinstate a special commissioner for eastern germany .
this implicitly calls into question the work of transport minister manfred stolpe , who ’ s currently responsible for eastern germany ’ s economic development together with economics minister wolfgang clement . critique from eastern german politicians while saying that he agreed with most of the panel 's suggestions , stolpe made it clear that he did not want to turn over responsibility for eastern germany to a cabinet member who would focus on the reconstruction effort in eastern germany . " that 's clearly enticing , but he will have to beg and struggle to achieve something , " he told berlin public broadcaster rbb , adding that a ministry like his own had better resources to deal with the problems . other political leaders from eastern germany - stolpe himself served as premier of the federal state of brandenburg that surrounds berlin before joining the federal cabinet - also voiced their opposition to the panel 's suggestions . dieter althaus , the christian democratic premier of the state of thuringia , called the panel " superfluous " and added that proposed cuts to funding of local infrastructure improvements would have " fatal consequences . " it ’ s not yet clear to what extent the schröder government is willing to listen to the expert panel ’ s suggestions .
in fact , the very future of the panel seems to be at stake , as it has been heavily criticized in the past for indiscretion and infighting among the experts . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eastern germany 's eu funds in danger of drying up the eu 's competition commissioner met with the heads of germany 's eastern states to discuss future financial support for the region , which may no longer be a top priority following enlargement . ´ -lrb- may 24 , 2004 -rrb- silicon saxony : chip factory brings high-tech to dresden u.s. chipmaker amd has broken ground on a $ 2.4 billion factory in dresden that will manufacture silicon wafers .

the government itself brushed off the criticism as unfounded , but promised nonetheless to look into the panel ’ s recommendations .
fourteen out of the 16 members of the advisory panel agree that the government under german chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat , has ignored the real economic hardships in eastern germany since it came to power in 1998 . they claim that despite the fact that huge sums have been transferred from the affluent west to the depressed east , not a single core economic problem there has so far been resolved .
they point to eastern companies ’ weak capital stock and an unemployment rate twice as high as that in western germany . using funds more efficiently panel spokesman klaus von dohnanyi called on the government to quickly revise its fiscal policy towards the east .
he and most of his colleagues don ’ t want more money to be pumped there - they want the money to be used more efficiently . dohnanyi argues that it 's high time to stop making infrastructure projects in the east a top priority when a good proportion of regions in the east already have a better infrastructure than those in the west . " money is limited and we transfer from the powerhouse west to east germany per annum about € 90 billion to 95 billion -lrb- $ 109 billion to $ 115 billion , -rrb- " he said .
" the money should be targeted on clusters , it should be targeted on businesses and it should not be targeted primarily on infrastructure .
it should be targeted in a way that the federal state does not come into too much conflict with local interest . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at a computer chip plant in dresden in eastern germany the advisory panel suggested using the bulk of the transfer money to promote selected innovative industries .
many of these are believed to have the potential for creating sustainable jobs , for instance in the fields of biomedicine and environmental technologies .

horse-trading over who would take the top eu job intensified after eu leaders failed to agree on a candidate at their last summit in mid-june .

germany had originally backed belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt for the post , but britain blocked this choice , partly because verhofstadt was considered too critical of u.s. foreign policy .

but i think that europe is always about finding compromises , " schröder told reporters at a nato summit in istanbul . french president jacques chirac also had praise for barroso , in part , because of his nationality .
barroso will be the commission 's first portuguese president .
after the eastward expansion of the eu , chirac said it would be good to remember that the bloc also has a south . tough challenges ahead the european parliament still has to approve barroso 's appointment in a vote to be held on july 21 or 22 , after he outlines his policies .

the probe will have traveled 3.5 billion kilometers -lrb- 2.2 billion miles -rrb- , when it finally starts orbiting the ringed planet thursday . the critical moment , however , will come when cassini is set to fire its engines after flying through a gap in saturn 's rings , starting at 2:36 utc thursday morning .
that should use up 1.5 tons of fuel and slow the craft down enough for it to get caught in saturn 's gravity field and pulled into the planet 's orbit .
but with a delay of more than an hour , scientists on the earth will have no control over cassini , which will have to manage the tricky maneuver without colliding with any potentially damaging space particles on its own .
from there the probe will begin making 76 rounds of saturn over a period of at least four years , collecting data and images of the planet , its rings and its moons . " we 're right on track , " navigation team chief jeremy jones told a news conference tuesday at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory .
cassini program manager robert mitchell and other officials expressed confidence that the craft would successfully enter saturn 's orbit , but he admitted that the procedure was a " hair-graying " event , ap reported . named after the french astronomer who in 1675 discovered saturn 's rings , cassini is expected to start sending data and images from saturn on thursday . decades of work the mission has been in the works for nearly 30 years and has cost nasa and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- $ 3.3 billion -lrb- € 2.71 billion -rrb- and the energies of more than 5,000 scientists .
cassini , carrying the wok-shaped probe huygens on its back , was sent into space from cape canaveral in florida on october 1997 . huygens , named after the dutch astronomer who in 1659 first recognized the true shape of the ring around saturn , is meant to explore titan , the largest of the planet 's 31 known moons .
the craft is programmed to take leave of its host on christmas and parachute into titan 's atmosphere . the moon is particularly interesting to scientists because it 's thought to have conditions similar to those on earth before life emerged .
scientists estimate huygens will have around one and a half hours to relay data from titan 's atmosphere before its battery runs out in the minus 180 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 292 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- weather . " this is one of the most exciting projects we have going , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told dw-world .
" huygens will be the first time europe has landed in the outer solar system .
and perhaps the most exciting thing of all is that we do n't know whether it 's going to land or splash down , because titan is swathed in a thick , smoggy atmosphere and we ca n't see its surface .
it may have methane oceans .

cassini program manager robert mitchell and other officials expressed confidence that the craft would successfully enter saturn 's orbit , but he admitted that the procedure was a " hair-graying " event , ap reported . named after the french astronomer who in 1675 discovered saturn 's rings , cassini is expected to start sending data and images from saturn on thursday . decades of work the mission has been in the works for nearly 30 years and has cost nasa and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- $ 3.3 billion -lrb- € 2.71 billion -rrb- and the energies of more than 5,000 scientists .
cassini , carrying the wok-shaped probe huygens on its back , was sent into space from cape canaveral in florida on october 1997 . huygens , named after the dutch astronomer who in 1659 first recognized the true shape of the ring around saturn , is meant to explore titan , the largest of the planet 's 31 known moons .
the craft is programmed to take leave of its host on christmas and parachute into titan 's atmosphere . the moon is particularly interesting to scientists because it 's thought to have conditions similar to those on earth before life emerged .
scientists estimate huygens will have around one and a half hours to relay data from titan 's atmosphere before its battery runs out in the minus 180 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 292 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- weather . " this is one of the most exciting projects we have going , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told dw-world .
" huygens will be the first time europe has landed in the outer solar system .
and perhaps the most exciting thing of all is that we do n't know whether it 's going to land or splash down , because titan is swathed in a thick , smoggy atmosphere and we ca n't see its surface .
it may have methane oceans .

budget airlines have made it easier for people to take to the skies , but on the downside frequent air travel pollutes the environment .
a german initiative " atmosfair " aims to encourage passengers to restore the balance . it 's a known fact that frequent flyers - in addition to racking-up those handy little miles - damage the environment . air travel has increased five-fold since 1970 , with much of that growth taking place in the last few years due to the increasing popularity of budget airlines .
however , as the cost of tickets continues to decline , it has become increasingly clear that bargain prices do not account for the damage a single flight does to the environment . environmental groups say such air travel is a climate catastrophe in the making , since airplanes emit three times the amount of greenhouse gases that automobiles do .
the no-frills travel boom , according to germany ’ s green lobby , is the country ’ s “ number one climate killer ” . climate change , caused by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , is deemed by many experts to be the biggest long-term threat to mankind .
they predict rapidly rising temperatures prompting higher sea levels , devastating floods and droughts . the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates aviation causes 3.5 percent of man-made global warming and that figure could rise to 15 percent by 2050 . efforts to impose a tax on jet-engine fuel have been unsuccessful , and , thus far , the issue has not been addressed in the kyoto protocol , the international treaty aimed at preventing climate change .
but now , a german environmental initiative , atmosfair , hopes to encourage travellers to strike the right balance on a voluntary basis . making-up the difference the idea is simple : those who fly will make a contribution to finance an environmental project in a developing country . the idea occurred to germany 's environmental minister , jürgen trittin , when he attended the united nations ' conference on environment and development in 2002 . " we were trying to think of a way we could credibly attend the conference , given the fact that the transport of our delegation would result in 1280 tons of greenhouse gas , " said the minister .
of course , that would have to be made-up elsewhere , says trittin , so he and and his ministry financed a row of ecologically sensitive homes in a township . the concept has now been adopted on a larger scale by atmosfair , which is run by klaus töpfer , the director of the united nations ' environmental program .
töpfer doubts every flight guest will voluntarily contribute his or her share , but he hopes the project will create a greater awareness . " the costs must be carried by someone , " he told deutsche welle , " and in general , we pawn them off on those living in considerably poorer countries and on future generations . " the sponsor of the effort is the " forum for a different kind of travel " , an umbrella organization of 100 environmentally aware travel agencies with 60,000 customers per year , half of whom are frequent flyers . that 'll be € 74.70 to nairobi and back , please the forum has worked out a table , which can be used to calculate in euros the approximate cost of - if one can quantify such things in money - air travel of varying lengths does to the environment . for example , a flight from berlin to bonn and back - according to the table - costs € 8 .
a flight from berlin to nairobi , including a change in frankfurt , creates 4260 kilograms of carbon monoxide .
converted into euros , that comes to € 74.70 . ideally , airline passengers will calculate these expenses and contribute some or all of the sum towards the environmental projects sponsored by the forum , including the construction of solar community kitchens in india and an environmentally-friendly factories in brazil . töpfer , for one , has promised to make contributions for all of his flights this month , and considering how often this u.n. official jets around the world , that 's quite a bit . jens thurau -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are budget airlines killing the planet ?

former mannesmann ceo klaus esser , ex-supervisory board chairman joachim funk , former director ackermann and three other managers and employees should be convicted for their involvement in more than 57 million euros in bonuses and other payments during the world 's biggest takeover , prosecutor dirk negenborn said during his final arguments bloomberg reported .
wednesday 's hearing was the last chance prosecutors had to sway the five judges , who in march said they 'd seen no evidence of a criminal breach of shareholders ' trust .
the verdict , due next month , will probably set a precedent for corporate governance in germany , lawyers have said .

budget airlines have made it easier for people to take to the skies , but on the downside frequent air travel pollutes the environment .
a german initiative " atmosfair " aims to encourage passengers to restore the balance . it 's a known fact that frequent flyers - in addition to racking-up those handy little miles - damage the environment . air travel has increased five-fold since 1970 , with much of that growth taking place in the last few years due to the increasing popularity of budget airlines .
however , as the cost of tickets continues to decline , it has become increasingly clear that bargain prices do not account for the damage a single flight does to the environment . environmental groups say such air travel is a climate catastrophe in the making , since airplanes emit three times the amount of greenhouse gases that automobiles do .
the no-frills travel boom , according to germany ’ s green lobby , is the country ’ s “ number one climate killer ” . climate change , caused by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , is deemed by many experts to be the biggest long-term threat to mankind .
they predict rapidly rising temperatures prompting higher sea levels , devastating floods and droughts . the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates aviation causes 3.5 percent of man-made global warming and that figure could rise to 15 percent by 2050 . efforts to impose a tax on jet-engine fuel have been unsuccessful , and , thus far , the issue has not been addressed in the kyoto protocol , the international treaty aimed at preventing climate change .
but now , a german environmental initiative , atmosfair , hopes to encourage travellers to strike the right balance on a voluntary basis . making-up the difference the idea is simple : those who fly will make a contribution to finance an environmental project in a developing country . the idea occurred to germany 's environmental minister , jürgen trittin , when he attended the united nations ' conference on environment and development in 2002 . " we were trying to think of a way we could credibly attend the conference , given the fact that the transport of our delegation would result in 1280 tons of greenhouse gas , " said the minister .
of course , that would have to be made-up elsewhere , says trittin , so he and and his ministry financed a row of ecologically sensitive homes in a township . the concept has now been adopted on a larger scale by atmosfair , which is run by klaus töpfer , the director of the united nations ' environmental program .
töpfer doubts every flight guest will voluntarily contribute his or her share , but he hopes the project will create a greater awareness .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.06.2004 jetting around more responsibly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers are urged to compensate for environmental damage .
budget airlines have made it easier for people to take to the skies , but on the downside frequent air travel pollutes the environment .
a german initiative " atmosfair " aims to encourage passengers to restore the balance . it 's a known fact that frequent flyers - in addition to racking-up those handy little miles - damage the environment . air travel has increased five-fold since 1970 , with much of that growth taking place in the last few years due to the increasing popularity of budget airlines .
however , as the cost of tickets continues to decline , it has become increasingly clear that bargain prices do not account for the damage a single flight does to the environment . environmental groups say such air travel is a climate catastrophe in the making , since airplanes emit three times the amount of greenhouse gases that automobiles do .
the no-frills travel boom , according to germany ’ s green lobby , is the country ’ s “ number one climate killer ” . climate change , caused by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , is deemed by many experts to be the biggest long-term threat to mankind .
they predict rapidly rising temperatures prompting higher sea levels , devastating floods and droughts . the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates aviation causes 3.5 percent of man-made global warming and that figure could rise to 15 percent by 2050 . efforts to impose a tax on jet-engine fuel have been unsuccessful , and , thus far , the issue has not been addressed in the kyoto protocol , the international treaty aimed at preventing climate change .
but now , a german environmental initiative , atmosfair , hopes to encourage travellers to strike the right balance on a voluntary basis . making-up the difference the idea is simple : those who fly will make a contribution to finance an environmental project in a developing country . the idea occurred to germany 's environmental minister , jürgen trittin , when he attended the united nations ' conference on environment and development in 2002 . " we were trying to think of a way we could credibly attend the conference , given the fact that the transport of our delegation would result in 1280 tons of greenhouse gas , " said the minister .
of course , that would have to be made-up elsewhere , says trittin , so he and and his ministry financed a row of ecologically sensitive homes in a township . the concept has now been adopted on a larger scale by atmosfair , which is run by klaus töpfer , the director of the united nations ' environmental program .
töpfer doubts every flight guest will voluntarily contribute his or her share , but he hopes the project will create a greater awareness . " the costs must be carried by someone , " he told deutsche welle , " and in general , we pawn them off on those living in considerably poorer countries and on future generations . " the sponsor of the effort is the " forum for a different kind of travel " , an umbrella organization of 100 environmentally aware travel agencies with 60,000 customers per year , half of whom are frequent flyers . that 'll be € 74.70 to nairobi and back , please the forum has worked out a table , which can be used to calculate in euros the approximate cost of - if one can quantify such things in money - air travel of varying lengths does to the environment . for example , a flight from berlin to bonn and back - according to the table - costs € 8 .
a flight from berlin to nairobi , including a change in frankfurt , creates 4260 kilograms of carbon monoxide .
converted into euros , that comes to € 74.70 . ideally , airline passengers will calculate these expenses and contribute some or all of the sum towards the environmental projects sponsored by the forum , including the construction of solar community kitchens in india and an environmentally-friendly factories in brazil . töpfer , for one , has promised to make contributions for all of his flights this month , and considering how often this u.n. official jets around the world , that 's quite a bit . jens thurau -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are budget airlines killing the planet ?

the probe will have traveled 3.5 billion kilometers -lrb- 2.2 billion miles -rrb- , when it finally starts orbiting the ringed planet thursday . the critical moment , however , will come when cassini is set to fire its engines after flying through a gap in saturn 's rings , starting at 2:36 utc thursday morning .
that should use up 1.5 tons of fuel and slow the craft down enough for it to get caught in saturn 's gravity field and pulled into the planet 's orbit .
but with a delay of more than an hour , scientists on the earth will have no control over cassini , which will have to manage the tricky maneuver without colliding with any potentially damaging space particles on its own .
from there the probe will begin making 76 rounds of saturn over a period of at least four years , collecting data and images of the planet , its rings and its moons . " we 're right on track , " navigation team chief jeremy jones told a news conference tuesday at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory .
cassini program manager robert mitchell and other officials expressed confidence that the craft would successfully enter saturn 's orbit , but he admitted that the procedure was a " hair-graying " event , ap reported . named after the french astronomer who in 1675 discovered saturn 's rings , cassini is expected to start sending data and images from saturn on thursday . decades of work the mission has been in the works for nearly 30 years and has cost nasa and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- $ 3.3 billion -lrb- € 2.71 billion -rrb- and the energies of more than 5,000 scientists .
cassini , carrying the wok-shaped probe huygens on its back , was sent into space from cape canaveral in florida on october 1997 . huygens , named after the dutch astronomer who in 1659 first recognized the true shape of the ring around saturn , is meant to explore titan , the largest of the planet 's 31 known moons .
the craft is programmed to take leave of its host on christmas and parachute into titan 's atmosphere . the moon is particularly interesting to scientists because it 's thought to have conditions similar to those on earth before life emerged .
scientists estimate huygens will have around one and a half hours to relay data from titan 's atmosphere before its battery runs out in the minus 180 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 292 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- weather . " this is one of the most exciting projects we have going , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told dw-world .
" huygens will be the first time europe has landed in the outer solar system .
and perhaps the most exciting thing of all is that we do n't know whether it 's going to land or splash down , because titan is swathed in a thick , smoggy atmosphere and we ca n't see its surface .

the probe will have traveled 3.5 billion kilometers -lrb- 2.2 billion miles -rrb- , when it finally starts orbiting the ringed planet thursday . the critical moment , however , will come when cassini is set to fire its engines after flying through a gap in saturn 's rings , starting at 2:36 utc thursday morning .
that should use up 1.5 tons of fuel and slow the craft down enough for it to get caught in saturn 's gravity field and pulled into the planet 's orbit .
but with a delay of more than an hour , scientists on the earth will have no control over cassini , which will have to manage the tricky maneuver without colliding with any potentially damaging space particles on its own .
from there the probe will begin making 76 rounds of saturn over a period of at least four years , collecting data and images of the planet , its rings and its moons . " we 're right on track , " navigation team chief jeremy jones told a news conference tuesday at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory .
cassini program manager robert mitchell and other officials expressed confidence that the craft would successfully enter saturn 's orbit , but he admitted that the procedure was a " hair-graying " event , ap reported . named after the french astronomer who in 1675 discovered saturn 's rings , cassini is expected to start sending data and images from saturn on thursday . decades of work the mission has been in the works for nearly 30 years and has cost nasa and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- $ 3.3 billion -lrb- € 2.71 billion -rrb- and the energies of more than 5,000 scientists .
cassini , carrying the wok-shaped probe huygens on its back , was sent into space from cape canaveral in florida on october 1997 . huygens , named after the dutch astronomer who in 1659 first recognized the true shape of the ring around saturn , is meant to explore titan , the largest of the planet 's 31 known moons .
the craft is programmed to take leave of its host on christmas and parachute into titan 's atmosphere . the moon is particularly interesting to scientists because it 's thought to have conditions similar to those on earth before life emerged .
scientists estimate huygens will have around one and a half hours to relay data from titan 's atmosphere before its battery runs out in the minus 180 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 292 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- weather . " this is one of the most exciting projects we have going , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told dw-world .
" huygens will be the first time europe has landed in the outer solar system .
and perhaps the most exciting thing of all is that we do n't know whether it 's going to land or splash down , because titan is swathed in a thick , smoggy atmosphere and we ca n't see its surface .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.06.2004 panel reveals plans to revive eastern germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infrastructure 's pretty good in eastern germany , the panel says a panel of german government advisors has presented a controversial catalogue of measures they consider necessary for readjusting berlin ’ s economic policy to promote sustainable growth in eastern germany . the experts around the former social democrat mayor of hamburg , klaus von dohnanyi , believe that the way the massive west-east financial transfers have been handled since reunification has been a complete failure .
the government itself brushed off the criticism as unfounded , but promised nonetheless to look into the panel ’ s recommendations .
fourteen out of the 16 members of the advisory panel agree that the government under german chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat , has ignored the real economic hardships in eastern germany since it came to power in 1998 . they claim that despite the fact that huge sums have been transferred from the affluent west to the depressed east , not a single core economic problem there has so far been resolved .
they point to eastern companies ’ weak capital stock and an unemployment rate twice as high as that in western germany . using funds more efficiently panel spokesman klaus von dohnanyi called on the government to quickly revise its fiscal policy towards the east .
he and most of his colleagues don ’ t want more money to be pumped there - they want the money to be used more efficiently . dohnanyi argues that it 's high time to stop making infrastructure projects in the east a top priority when a good proportion of regions in the east already have a better infrastructure than those in the west . " money is limited and we transfer from the powerhouse west to east germany per annum about € 90 billion to 95 billion -lrb- $ 109 billion to $ 115 billion , -rrb- " he said .
" the money should be targeted on clusters , it should be targeted on businesses and it should not be targeted primarily on infrastructure .
it should be targeted in a way that the federal state does not come into too much conflict with local interest . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at a computer chip plant in dresden in eastern germany the advisory panel suggested using the bulk of the transfer money to promote selected innovative industries .
many of these are believed to have the potential for creating sustainable jobs , for instance in the fields of biomedicine and environmental technologies .
the panel also called on the government to reconsider tax exemptions for newly founded companies in the east , particularly for small and medium sized firms . this , the experts argued , should in fact ensure their survival in a heavily contested market .
they say it makes no sense to boast of the number of start-ups when each year the number of new companies in the east consistently equals the number of new insolvencies . talk of a low-wage sector dohnanyi also said that more thought should be given to the promotion of the low-wage sector in the east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment rates continue to soar in eastern germany " we have a new competition also now from eastern europe and we must see that these people in east germany can make a living , " he said .
" therefore we discuss things like the earned tax credit systems in the united states , etc . - something that we should add to the wages in order to be competitive and at the same time have an adequate living in the comparatively high cost country germany . " dohnanyi raised eyebrows in the berlin cabinet by suggesting to reinstate a special commissioner for eastern germany .
this implicitly calls into question the work of transport minister manfred stolpe , who ’ s currently responsible for eastern germany ’ s economic development together with economics minister wolfgang clement . critique from eastern german politicians while saying that he agreed with most of the panel 's suggestions , stolpe made it clear that he did not want to turn over responsibility for eastern germany to a cabinet member who would focus on the reconstruction effort in eastern germany . " that 's clearly enticing , but he will have to beg and struggle to achieve something , " he told berlin public broadcaster rbb , adding that a ministry like his own had better resources to deal with the problems . other political leaders from eastern germany - stolpe himself served as premier of the federal state of brandenburg that surrounds berlin before joining the federal cabinet - also voiced their opposition to the panel 's suggestions . dieter althaus , the christian democratic premier of the state of thuringia , called the panel " superfluous " and added that proposed cuts to funding of local infrastructure improvements would have " fatal consequences . " it ’ s not yet clear to what extent the schröder government is willing to listen to the expert panel ’ s suggestions .
in fact , the very future of the panel seems to be at stake , as it has been heavily criticized in the past for indiscretion and infighting among the experts . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eastern germany 's eu funds in danger of drying up the eu 's competition commissioner met with the heads of germany 's eastern states to discuss future financial support for the region , which may no longer be a top priority following enlargement . ´ -lrb- may 24 , 2004 -rrb- silicon saxony : chip factory brings high-tech to dresden u.s. chipmaker amd has broken ground on a $ 2.4 billion factory in dresden that will manufacture silicon wafers .

the government itself brushed off the criticism as unfounded , but promised nonetheless to look into the panel ’ s recommendations .
fourteen out of the 16 members of the advisory panel agree that the government under german chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat , has ignored the real economic hardships in eastern germany since it came to power in 1998 . they claim that despite the fact that huge sums have been transferred from the affluent west to the depressed east , not a single core economic problem there has so far been resolved .
they point to eastern companies ’ weak capital stock and an unemployment rate twice as high as that in western germany . using funds more efficiently panel spokesman klaus von dohnanyi called on the government to quickly revise its fiscal policy towards the east .
he and most of his colleagues don ’ t want more money to be pumped there - they want the money to be used more efficiently . dohnanyi argues that it 's high time to stop making infrastructure projects in the east a top priority when a good proportion of regions in the east already have a better infrastructure than those in the west . " money is limited and we transfer from the powerhouse west to east germany per annum about € 90 billion to 95 billion -lrb- $ 109 billion to $ 115 billion , -rrb- " he said .
" the money should be targeted on clusters , it should be targeted on businesses and it should not be targeted primarily on infrastructure .
it should be targeted in a way that the federal state does not come into too much conflict with local interest . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at a computer chip plant in dresden in eastern germany the advisory panel suggested using the bulk of the transfer money to promote selected innovative industries .
many of these are believed to have the potential for creating sustainable jobs , for instance in the fields of biomedicine and environmental technologies .
the panel also called on the government to reconsider tax exemptions for newly founded companies in the east , particularly for small and medium sized firms . this , the experts argued , should in fact ensure their survival in a heavily contested market .
they say it makes no sense to boast of the number of start-ups when each year the number of new companies in the east consistently equals the number of new insolvencies . talk of a low-wage sector dohnanyi also said that more thought should be given to the promotion of the low-wage sector in the east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment rates continue to soar in eastern germany " we have a new competition also now from eastern europe and we must see that these people in east germany can make a living , " he said .
" therefore we discuss things like the earned tax credit systems in the united states , etc . - something that we should add to the wages in order to be competitive and at the same time have an adequate living in the comparatively high cost country germany . " dohnanyi raised eyebrows in the berlin cabinet by suggesting to reinstate a special commissioner for eastern germany .
this implicitly calls into question the work of transport minister manfred stolpe , who ’ s currently responsible for eastern germany ’ s economic development together with economics minister wolfgang clement . critique from eastern german politicians while saying that he agreed with most of the panel 's suggestions , stolpe made it clear that he did not want to turn over responsibility for eastern germany to a cabinet member who would focus on the reconstruction effort in eastern germany . " that 's clearly enticing , but he will have to beg and struggle to achieve something , " he told berlin public broadcaster rbb , adding that a ministry like his own had better resources to deal with the problems . other political leaders from eastern germany - stolpe himself served as premier of the federal state of brandenburg that surrounds berlin before joining the federal cabinet - also voiced their opposition to the panel 's suggestions . dieter althaus , the christian democratic premier of the state of thuringia , called the panel " superfluous " and added that proposed cuts to funding of local infrastructure improvements would have " fatal consequences . " it ’ s not yet clear to what extent the schröder government is willing to listen to the expert panel ’ s suggestions .

budget airlines have made it easier for people to take to the skies , but on the downside frequent air travel pollutes the environment .
a german initiative " atmosfair " aims to encourage passengers to restore the balance . it 's a known fact that frequent flyers - in addition to racking-up those handy little miles - damage the environment . air travel has increased five-fold since 1970 , with much of that growth taking place in the last few years due to the increasing popularity of budget airlines .
however , as the cost of tickets continues to decline , it has become increasingly clear that bargain prices do not account for the damage a single flight does to the environment . environmental groups say such air travel is a climate catastrophe in the making , since airplanes emit three times the amount of greenhouse gases that automobiles do .
the no-frills travel boom , according to germany ’ s green lobby , is the country ’ s “ number one climate killer ” . climate change , caused by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , is deemed by many experts to be the biggest long-term threat to mankind .
they predict rapidly rising temperatures prompting higher sea levels , devastating floods and droughts . the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates aviation causes 3.5 percent of man-made global warming and that figure could rise to 15 percent by 2050 . efforts to impose a tax on jet-engine fuel have been unsuccessful , and , thus far , the issue has not been addressed in the kyoto protocol , the international treaty aimed at preventing climate change .
but now , a german environmental initiative , atmosfair , hopes to encourage travellers to strike the right balance on a voluntary basis . making-up the difference the idea is simple : those who fly will make a contribution to finance an environmental project in a developing country . the idea occurred to germany 's environmental minister , jürgen trittin , when he attended the united nations ' conference on environment and development in 2002 . " we were trying to think of a way we could credibly attend the conference , given the fact that the transport of our delegation would result in 1280 tons of greenhouse gas , " said the minister .
of course , that would have to be made-up elsewhere , says trittin , so he and and his ministry financed a row of ecologically sensitive homes in a township . the concept has now been adopted on a larger scale by atmosfair , which is run by klaus töpfer , the director of the united nations ' environmental program .
töpfer doubts every flight guest will voluntarily contribute his or her share , but he hopes the project will create a greater awareness . " the costs must be carried by someone , " he told deutsche welle , " and in general , we pawn them off on those living in considerably poorer countries and on future generations . " the sponsor of the effort is the " forum for a different kind of travel " , an umbrella organization of 100 environmentally aware travel agencies with 60,000 customers per year , half of whom are frequent flyers . that 'll be € 74.70 to nairobi and back , please the forum has worked out a table , which can be used to calculate in euros the approximate cost of - if one can quantify such things in money - air travel of varying lengths does to the environment . for example , a flight from berlin to bonn and back - according to the table - costs € 8 .
a flight from berlin to nairobi , including a change in frankfurt , creates 4260 kilograms of carbon monoxide .
converted into euros , that comes to € 74.70 . ideally , airline passengers will calculate these expenses and contribute some or all of the sum towards the environmental projects sponsored by the forum , including the construction of solar community kitchens in india and an environmentally-friendly factories in brazil . töpfer , for one , has promised to make contributions for all of his flights this month , and considering how often this u.n. official jets around the world , that 's quite a bit . jens thurau -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are budget airlines killing the planet ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.06.2004 panel reveals plans to revive eastern germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infrastructure 's pretty good in eastern germany , the panel says a panel of german government advisors has presented a controversial catalogue of measures they consider necessary for readjusting berlin ’ s economic policy to promote sustainable growth in eastern germany . the experts around the former social democrat mayor of hamburg , klaus von dohnanyi , believe that the way the massive west-east financial transfers have been handled since reunification has been a complete failure .
the government itself brushed off the criticism as unfounded , but promised nonetheless to look into the panel ’ s recommendations .
fourteen out of the 16 members of the advisory panel agree that the government under german chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat , has ignored the real economic hardships in eastern germany since it came to power in 1998 . they claim that despite the fact that huge sums have been transferred from the affluent west to the depressed east , not a single core economic problem there has so far been resolved .
they point to eastern companies ’ weak capital stock and an unemployment rate twice as high as that in western germany . using funds more efficiently panel spokesman klaus von dohnanyi called on the government to quickly revise its fiscal policy towards the east .
he and most of his colleagues don ’ t want more money to be pumped there - they want the money to be used more efficiently . dohnanyi argues that it 's high time to stop making infrastructure projects in the east a top priority when a good proportion of regions in the east already have a better infrastructure than those in the west . " money is limited and we transfer from the powerhouse west to east germany per annum about € 90 billion to 95 billion -lrb- $ 109 billion to $ 115 billion , -rrb- " he said .
" the money should be targeted on clusters , it should be targeted on businesses and it should not be targeted primarily on infrastructure .
it should be targeted in a way that the federal state does not come into too much conflict with local interest . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at a computer chip plant in dresden in eastern germany the advisory panel suggested using the bulk of the transfer money to promote selected innovative industries .
many of these are believed to have the potential for creating sustainable jobs , for instance in the fields of biomedicine and environmental technologies .
the panel also called on the government to reconsider tax exemptions for newly founded companies in the east , particularly for small and medium sized firms . this , the experts argued , should in fact ensure their survival in a heavily contested market .
they say it makes no sense to boast of the number of start-ups when each year the number of new companies in the east consistently equals the number of new insolvencies . talk of a low-wage sector dohnanyi also said that more thought should be given to the promotion of the low-wage sector in the east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment rates continue to soar in eastern germany " we have a new competition also now from eastern europe and we must see that these people in east germany can make a living , " he said .
" therefore we discuss things like the earned tax credit systems in the united states , etc . - something that we should add to the wages in order to be competitive and at the same time have an adequate living in the comparatively high cost country germany . " dohnanyi raised eyebrows in the berlin cabinet by suggesting to reinstate a special commissioner for eastern germany .
this implicitly calls into question the work of transport minister manfred stolpe , who ’ s currently responsible for eastern germany ’ s economic development together with economics minister wolfgang clement . critique from eastern german politicians while saying that he agreed with most of the panel 's suggestions , stolpe made it clear that he did not want to turn over responsibility for eastern germany to a cabinet member who would focus on the reconstruction effort in eastern germany . " that 's clearly enticing , but he will have to beg and struggle to achieve something , " he told berlin public broadcaster rbb , adding that a ministry like his own had better resources to deal with the problems . other political leaders from eastern germany - stolpe himself served as premier of the federal state of brandenburg that surrounds berlin before joining the federal cabinet - also voiced their opposition to the panel 's suggestions . dieter althaus , the christian democratic premier of the state of thuringia , called the panel " superfluous " and added that proposed cuts to funding of local infrastructure improvements would have " fatal consequences . " it ’ s not yet clear to what extent the schröder government is willing to listen to the expert panel ’ s suggestions .
in fact , the very future of the panel seems to be at stake , as it has been heavily criticized in the past for indiscretion and infighting among the experts . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eastern germany 's eu funds in danger of drying up the eu 's competition commissioner met with the heads of germany 's eastern states to discuss future financial support for the region , which may no longer be a top priority following enlargement . ´ -lrb- may 24 , 2004 -rrb- silicon saxony : chip factory brings high-tech to dresden u.s. chipmaker amd has broken ground on a $ 2.4 billion factory in dresden that will manufacture silicon wafers .

budget airlines have made it easier for people to take to the skies , but on the downside frequent air travel pollutes the environment .
a german initiative " atmosfair " aims to encourage passengers to restore the balance . it 's a known fact that frequent flyers - in addition to racking-up those handy little miles - damage the environment . air travel has increased five-fold since 1970 , with much of that growth taking place in the last few years due to the increasing popularity of budget airlines .
however , as the cost of tickets continues to decline , it has become increasingly clear that bargain prices do not account for the damage a single flight does to the environment . environmental groups say such air travel is a climate catastrophe in the making , since airplanes emit three times the amount of greenhouse gases that automobiles do .
the no-frills travel boom , according to germany ’ s green lobby , is the country ’ s “ number one climate killer ” . climate change , caused by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , is deemed by many experts to be the biggest long-term threat to mankind .
they predict rapidly rising temperatures prompting higher sea levels , devastating floods and droughts . the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates aviation causes 3.5 percent of man-made global warming and that figure could rise to 15 percent by 2050 . efforts to impose a tax on jet-engine fuel have been unsuccessful , and , thus far , the issue has not been addressed in the kyoto protocol , the international treaty aimed at preventing climate change .
but now , a german environmental initiative , atmosfair , hopes to encourage travellers to strike the right balance on a voluntary basis . making-up the difference the idea is simple : those who fly will make a contribution to finance an environmental project in a developing country . the idea occurred to germany 's environmental minister , jürgen trittin , when he attended the united nations ' conference on environment and development in 2002 . " we were trying to think of a way we could credibly attend the conference , given the fact that the transport of our delegation would result in 1280 tons of greenhouse gas , " said the minister .
of course , that would have to be made-up elsewhere , says trittin , so he and and his ministry financed a row of ecologically sensitive homes in a township . the concept has now been adopted on a larger scale by atmosfair , which is run by klaus töpfer , the director of the united nations ' environmental program .
töpfer doubts every flight guest will voluntarily contribute his or her share , but he hopes the project will create a greater awareness . " the costs must be carried by someone , " he told deutsche welle , " and in general , we pawn them off on those living in considerably poorer countries and on future generations . " the sponsor of the effort is the " forum for a different kind of travel " , an umbrella organization of 100 environmentally aware travel agencies with 60,000 customers per year , half of whom are frequent flyers . that 'll be € 74.70 to nairobi and back , please the forum has worked out a table , which can be used to calculate in euros the approximate cost of - if one can quantify such things in money - air travel of varying lengths does to the environment . for example , a flight from berlin to bonn and back - according to the table - costs € 8 .
a flight from berlin to nairobi , including a change in frankfurt , creates 4260 kilograms of carbon monoxide .

budget airlines have made it easier for people to take to the skies , but on the downside frequent air travel pollutes the environment .
a german initiative " atmosfair " aims to encourage passengers to restore the balance . it 's a known fact that frequent flyers - in addition to racking-up those handy little miles - damage the environment . air travel has increased five-fold since 1970 , with much of that growth taking place in the last few years due to the increasing popularity of budget airlines .
however , as the cost of tickets continues to decline , it has become increasingly clear that bargain prices do not account for the damage a single flight does to the environment . environmental groups say such air travel is a climate catastrophe in the making , since airplanes emit three times the amount of greenhouse gases that automobiles do .
the no-frills travel boom , according to germany ’ s green lobby , is the country ’ s “ number one climate killer ” . climate change , caused by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , is deemed by many experts to be the biggest long-term threat to mankind .
they predict rapidly rising temperatures prompting higher sea levels , devastating floods and droughts . the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates aviation causes 3.5 percent of man-made global warming and that figure could rise to 15 percent by 2050 . efforts to impose a tax on jet-engine fuel have been unsuccessful , and , thus far , the issue has not been addressed in the kyoto protocol , the international treaty aimed at preventing climate change .
but now , a german environmental initiative , atmosfair , hopes to encourage travellers to strike the right balance on a voluntary basis . making-up the difference the idea is simple : those who fly will make a contribution to finance an environmental project in a developing country . the idea occurred to germany 's environmental minister , jürgen trittin , when he attended the united nations ' conference on environment and development in 2002 . " we were trying to think of a way we could credibly attend the conference , given the fact that the transport of our delegation would result in 1280 tons of greenhouse gas , " said the minister .
of course , that would have to be made-up elsewhere , says trittin , so he and and his ministry financed a row of ecologically sensitive homes in a township . the concept has now been adopted on a larger scale by atmosfair , which is run by klaus töpfer , the director of the united nations ' environmental program .
töpfer doubts every flight guest will voluntarily contribute his or her share , but he hopes the project will create a greater awareness .

budget airlines have made it easier for people to take to the skies , but on the downside frequent air travel pollutes the environment .
a german initiative " atmosfair " aims to encourage passengers to restore the balance . it 's a known fact that frequent flyers - in addition to racking-up those handy little miles - damage the environment . air travel has increased five-fold since 1970 , with much of that growth taking place in the last few years due to the increasing popularity of budget airlines .
however , as the cost of tickets continues to decline , it has become increasingly clear that bargain prices do not account for the damage a single flight does to the environment . environmental groups say such air travel is a climate catastrophe in the making , since airplanes emit three times the amount of greenhouse gases that automobiles do .
the no-frills travel boom , according to germany ’ s green lobby , is the country ’ s “ number one climate killer ” . climate change , caused by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , is deemed by many experts to be the biggest long-term threat to mankind .
they predict rapidly rising temperatures prompting higher sea levels , devastating floods and droughts . the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates aviation causes 3.5 percent of man-made global warming and that figure could rise to 15 percent by 2050 . efforts to impose a tax on jet-engine fuel have been unsuccessful , and , thus far , the issue has not been addressed in the kyoto protocol , the international treaty aimed at preventing climate change .
but now , a german environmental initiative , atmosfair , hopes to encourage travellers to strike the right balance on a voluntary basis . making-up the difference the idea is simple : those who fly will make a contribution to finance an environmental project in a developing country . the idea occurred to germany 's environmental minister , jürgen trittin , when he attended the united nations ' conference on environment and development in 2002 . " we were trying to think of a way we could credibly attend the conference , given the fact that the transport of our delegation would result in 1280 tons of greenhouse gas , " said the minister .
of course , that would have to be made-up elsewhere , says trittin , so he and and his ministry financed a row of ecologically sensitive homes in a township . the concept has now been adopted on a larger scale by atmosfair , which is run by klaus töpfer , the director of the united nations ' environmental program .
töpfer doubts every flight guest will voluntarily contribute his or her share , but he hopes the project will create a greater awareness . " the costs must be carried by someone , " he told deutsche welle , " and in general , we pawn them off on those living in considerably poorer countries and on future generations . " the sponsor of the effort is the " forum for a different kind of travel " , an umbrella organization of 100 environmentally aware travel agencies with 60,000 customers per year , half of whom are frequent flyers . that 'll be € 74.70 to nairobi and back , please the forum has worked out a table , which can be used to calculate in euros the approximate cost of - if one can quantify such things in money - air travel of varying lengths does to the environment . for example , a flight from berlin to bonn and back - according to the table - costs € 8 .
a flight from berlin to nairobi , including a change in frankfurt , creates 4260 kilograms of carbon monoxide .
converted into euros , that comes to € 74.70 . ideally , airline passengers will calculate these expenses and contribute some or all of the sum towards the environmental projects sponsored by the forum , including the construction of solar community kitchens in india and an environmentally-friendly factories in brazil . töpfer , for one , has promised to make contributions for all of his flights this month , and considering how often this u.n. official jets around the world , that 's quite a bit . jens thurau -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are budget airlines killing the planet ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.06.2004 profile : johannes rau , a life in politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rau and his wife christina bid farewell to public life outgoing german president johannes rau never finished high school , but after decades of service as a political leader , he has won the respect of a large majority of his countrymen . politics is the daily bread of german president johannes rau .
it always has been .
born in 1931 in wuppertal , in western germany , rau got elected to the state parliament in north rhine-westphalia at the age of 27 .
his simple beginnings did n't necessarily suggest he would end up in high office . though he is well read and has broad interests , rau is not an academic .
the son of a protestant preacher , rau left school without a university degree and instead got his training as a bookseller .
he also worked as a journalist .
life in the spd in 1957 he followed his political mentor , gustav heinemann , to the social democratic party .
in 1970 , he became the state 's science minister , eventually becoming north rhine-westphalia 's premier in 1978 .
rau , who is the father of three , held his office in the state until he was elected as germany 's head of state in 1999 .
though the presidency is germany 's highest political office on paper , the president lacks the power of the chancellor - an office rau sought unsuccessfully in 1987 when he was the deputy head of the spd 's national party .
it was n't his only defeat .
he failed in his first run to become president in 1994 against roman herzog .
but in 1999 , he finally won the election for the presidency , placing him at berlin 's bellevue palace for five years .
rau was only the second social democrat in german history to hold the office .
during his term , rau has depicted himself as a " president of the people , " one who brings people together and promotes tolerance in society .
from boring to beloved but during the first months of his term , many viewed rau as a rather staid politician .
his reputation however was then sullied through the so-called " flights scandal " in north rhine-westphalia in which rau and other top state officials used chartered jets for business travel on a number of occasions , at taxpayer expense .
it was only after he made a series of moving speeches before the israeli parliament in which he asked the jewish people to forgive germany for the holocaust that he was able to restore his domestic reputation and begin building it abroad .
rau 's hallmark efforts to promote equality , tolerance and respect are partly attributable to his christian background as well as the experiences of his youth .
" i was raised at a time when national socialism was still a subject in the schools , " rau said .
" now we 're a good neighbor -lrb- in europe -rrb- , we have open borders and germany has experienced the longest period of peace since 1945 - that 's never happened before - and i think it 's truly a development that we should protect . "
the idea of preserving values while at the same time accepting changes has long been a leitmotiv in rau 's so-called " berlin speeches . "
with the speeches , rau often put himself at the center of important debates on issues like immigration policy , genetics , and germany 's role and responsibility in the international community .
in the summer of 2003 , he spent four days with young people from all across germany discussing their plan 's for the future .
the president proved to be an attentive listener and fatherly conversationalist .
a presidency with teeth though generally a promoter of compromise , rau took the offensive in the bundesrat , germany 's upper chamber of parliament , when partisanship derailed the country 's first immigration bill in 2002 .

it always has been .
born in 1931 in wuppertal , in western germany , rau got elected to the state parliament in north rhine-westphalia at the age of 27 .
his simple beginnings did n't necessarily suggest he would end up in high office . though he is well read and has broad interests , rau is not an academic .
the son of a protestant preacher , rau left school without a university degree and instead got his training as a bookseller .
he also worked as a journalist .
life in the spd in 1957 he followed his political mentor , gustav heinemann , to the social democratic party .
in 1970 , he became the state 's science minister , eventually becoming north rhine-westphalia 's premier in 1978 .
rau , who is the father of three , held his office in the state until he was elected as germany 's head of state in 1999 .
though the presidency is germany 's highest political office on paper , the president lacks the power of the chancellor - an office rau sought unsuccessfully in 1987 when he was the deputy head of the spd 's national party .
it was n't his only defeat .
he failed in his first run to become president in 1994 against roman herzog .
but in 1999 , he finally won the election for the presidency , placing him at berlin 's bellevue palace for five years .
rau was only the second social democrat in german history to hold the office .
during his term , rau has depicted himself as a " president of the people , " one who brings people together and promotes tolerance in society .
from boring to beloved but during the first months of his term , many viewed rau as a rather staid politician .
his reputation however was then sullied through the so-called " flights scandal " in north rhine-westphalia in which rau and other top state officials used chartered jets for business travel on a number of occasions , at taxpayer expense .
it was only after he made a series of moving speeches before the israeli parliament in which he asked the jewish people to forgive germany for the holocaust that he was able to restore his domestic reputation and begin building it abroad .
rau 's hallmark efforts to promote equality , tolerance and respect are partly attributable to his christian background as well as the experiences of his youth .
" i was raised at a time when national socialism was still a subject in the schools , " rau said .
" now we 're a good neighbor -lrb- in europe -rrb- , we have open borders and germany has experienced the longest period of peace since 1945 - that 's never happened before - and i think it 's truly a development that we should protect . "
the idea of preserving values while at the same time accepting changes has long been a leitmotiv in rau 's so-called " berlin speeches . "
with the speeches , rau often put himself at the center of important debates on issues like immigration policy , genetics , and germany 's role and responsibility in the international community .
in the summer of 2003 , he spent four days with young people from all across germany discussing their plan 's for the future .
the president proved to be an attentive listener and fatherly conversationalist .
a presidency with teeth though generally a promoter of compromise , rau took the offensive in the bundesrat , germany 's upper chamber of parliament , when partisanship derailed the country 's first immigration bill in 2002 .
rau lashed out with unusually strong words .
he also issued harsh criticism in the diplomatic sparring leading up to the iraq war .

it always has been .
born in 1931 in wuppertal , in western germany , rau got elected to the state parliament in north rhine-westphalia at the age of 27 .
his simple beginnings did n't necessarily suggest he would end up in high office . though he is well read and has broad interests , rau is not an academic .
the son of a protestant preacher , rau left school without a university degree and instead got his training as a bookseller .
he also worked as a journalist .
life in the spd in 1957 he followed his political mentor , gustav heinemann , to the social democratic party .
in 1970 , he became the state 's science minister , eventually becoming north rhine-westphalia 's premier in 1978 .
rau , who is the father of three , held his office in the state until he was elected as germany 's head of state in 1999 .
though the presidency is germany 's highest political office on paper , the president lacks the power of the chancellor - an office rau sought unsuccessfully in 1987 when he was the deputy head of the spd 's national party .
it was n't his only defeat .
he failed in his first run to become president in 1994 against roman herzog .
but in 1999 , he finally won the election for the presidency , placing him at berlin 's bellevue palace for five years .
rau was only the second social democrat in german history to hold the office .
during his term , rau has depicted himself as a " president of the people , " one who brings people together and promotes tolerance in society .
from boring to beloved but during the first months of his term , many viewed rau as a rather staid politician .
his reputation however was then sullied through the so-called " flights scandal " in north rhine-westphalia in which rau and other top state officials used chartered jets for business travel on a number of occasions , at taxpayer expense .
it was only after he made a series of moving speeches before the israeli parliament in which he asked the jewish people to forgive germany for the holocaust that he was able to restore his domestic reputation and begin building it abroad .
rau 's hallmark efforts to promote equality , tolerance and respect are partly attributable to his christian background as well as the experiences of his youth .
" i was raised at a time when national socialism was still a subject in the schools , " rau said .
" now we 're a good neighbor -lrb- in europe -rrb- , we have open borders and germany has experienced the longest period of peace since 1945 - that 's never happened before - and i think it 's truly a development that we should protect . "
the idea of preserving values while at the same time accepting changes has long been a leitmotiv in rau 's so-called " berlin speeches . "
with the speeches , rau often put himself at the center of important debates on issues like immigration policy , genetics , and germany 's role and responsibility in the international community .
in the summer of 2003 , he spent four days with young people from all across germany discussing their plan 's for the future .
the president proved to be an attentive listener and fatherly conversationalist .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.06.2004 opinion : a voice among many großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bye for now after five years as germany 's head of state , president johannes rau will step down on wednesday .
by doing so , the 73-year-old also ends a political career that spanned almost half a century . it 's impossible and inappropriate to judge a politician 's significance and importance during his time in office : political considerations are bound to influence the decision-making process .
therefore people will have to decide in the future whether johannes rau was an outstanding president .
all that 's certain now is that he filled out the role without standing out . integrating foreigners into german society was one of the most important themes of rau 's presidency .
during his first speech as head of state , he already declared that he wanted to be not only the president of all germans , but also that of all people living in germany .
it was a positive statement that could hardly be missed : he wanted to be the person foreigners in germany could turn to as well . " unite rather than divide " - rau 's motto can be taken literally for his entire political career - was not a bad slogan to pick for a german head of state , who has little actual power and can only try to influence the political process through his speeches .
at the same time , it 's a motto that can lead to a level of detachment - a risk rau did n't always manage to avoid . lacking long-lasting success that might also be the reason why some people see rau as a president , who tried to stimulate debates but failed to do so with long-lasting success .
his critical remarks regarding the use of gene technology seem to fit in that category . he took an important position worthy of debate by admonishing people not to do the technically possible until all ethical concerns had been dispelled .
he participated in the discussion with the force of his personality and the authority of his office .
it was the right thing to do , but changed little about the fact that his voice remained only one of many on the subject . chancellor gerhard schröder probably did n't like rau 's remarks on the topic as he himself wants to move ahead more swiftly .
but schröder probably took some comfort in rau 's support in the area of foreign relations and especially germany 's opposition to the war in iraq .
still , rau never had a problem with the non-partisan role that comes with the office while not ignoring his social democratic roots . 50 years of public service rau 's departure will also be a departure from active political life .
almost 50 years ago , he entered that world on the municipal level before moving on to the legislature of north-rhine-westphalia and serving as premier of germany 's most populous state for two decades . in that position , rau became the exemplary landesvater , or father of the state .
he tried to continue in this role on the national stage - with moderate success .
that was n't his fault , however , and should rather be seen as a diminished need for a classic father figure to lead the country . people often say that germany has been lucky with her presidents so far .
that assertion might be debatable .

the probe will have traveled 3.5 billion kilometers -lrb- 2.2 billion miles -rrb- , when it finally starts orbiting the ringed planet thursday . the critical moment , however , will come when cassini is set to fire its engines after flying through a gap in saturn 's rings , starting at 2:36 utc thursday morning .
that should use up 1.5 tons of fuel and slow the craft down enough for it to get caught in saturn 's gravity field and pulled into the planet 's orbit .
but with a delay of more than an hour , scientists on the earth will have no control over cassini , which will have to manage the tricky maneuver without colliding with any potentially damaging space particles on its own .
from there the probe will begin making 76 rounds of saturn over a period of at least four years , collecting data and images of the planet , its rings and its moons . " we 're right on track , " navigation team chief jeremy jones told a news conference tuesday at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory .
cassini program manager robert mitchell and other officials expressed confidence that the craft would successfully enter saturn 's orbit , but he admitted that the procedure was a " hair-graying " event , ap reported . named after the french astronomer who in 1675 discovered saturn 's rings , cassini is expected to start sending data and images from saturn on thursday . decades of work the mission has been in the works for nearly 30 years and has cost nasa and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- $ 3.3 billion -lrb- € 2.71 billion -rrb- and the energies of more than 5,000 scientists .
cassini , carrying the wok-shaped probe huygens on its back , was sent into space from cape canaveral in florida on october 1997 . huygens , named after the dutch astronomer who in 1659 first recognized the true shape of the ring around saturn , is meant to explore titan , the largest of the planet 's 31 known moons .
the craft is programmed to take leave of its host on christmas and parachute into titan 's atmosphere . the moon is particularly interesting to scientists because it 's thought to have conditions similar to those on earth before life emerged .
scientists estimate huygens will have around one and a half hours to relay data from titan 's atmosphere before its battery runs out in the minus 180 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 292 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- weather . " this is one of the most exciting projects we have going , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told dw-world .
" huygens will be the first time europe has landed in the outer solar system .
and perhaps the most exciting thing of all is that we do n't know whether it 's going to land or splash down , because titan is swathed in a thick , smoggy atmosphere and we ca n't see its surface .
it may have methane oceans .

by doing so , the 73-year-old also ends a political career that spanned almost half a century . it 's impossible and inappropriate to judge a politician 's significance and importance during his time in office : political considerations are bound to influence the decision-making process .
therefore people will have to decide in the future whether johannes rau was an outstanding president .
all that 's certain now is that he filled out the role without standing out . integrating foreigners into german society was one of the most important themes of rau 's presidency .
during his first speech as head of state , he already declared that he wanted to be not only the president of all germans , but also that of all people living in germany .
it was a positive statement that could hardly be missed : he wanted to be the person foreigners in germany could turn to as well . " unite rather than divide " - rau 's motto can be taken literally for his entire political career - was not a bad slogan to pick for a german head of state , who has little actual power and can only try to influence the political process through his speeches .
at the same time , it 's a motto that can lead to a level of detachment - a risk rau did n't always manage to avoid . lacking long-lasting success that might also be the reason why some people see rau as a president , who tried to stimulate debates but failed to do so with long-lasting success .
his critical remarks regarding the use of gene technology seem to fit in that category . he took an important position worthy of debate by admonishing people not to do the technically possible until all ethical concerns had been dispelled .
he participated in the discussion with the force of his personality and the authority of his office .
it was the right thing to do , but changed little about the fact that his voice remained only one of many on the subject . chancellor gerhard schröder probably did n't like rau 's remarks on the topic as he himself wants to move ahead more swiftly .
but schröder probably took some comfort in rau 's support in the area of foreign relations and especially germany 's opposition to the war in iraq .
still , rau never had a problem with the non-partisan role that comes with the office while not ignoring his social democratic roots . 50 years of public service rau 's departure will also be a departure from active political life .
almost 50 years ago , he entered that world on the municipal level before moving on to the legislature of north-rhine-westphalia and serving as premier of germany 's most populous state for two decades . in that position , rau became the exemplary landesvater , or father of the state .
he tried to continue in this role on the national stage - with moderate success .
that was n't his fault , however , and should rather be seen as a diminished need for a classic father figure to lead the country . people often say that germany has been lucky with her presidents so far .
that assertion might be debatable .
but in rau 's case , it certainly was n't bad luck , either . heinz dylong -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president slams country 's elites german president johannes rau sharply criticized germany 's elite in politics and industry in his so-called " berlin speech " -lrb- may 12 , 2004 -rrb- profile : johannes rau , a life in politics outgoing german president johannes rau never finished high school , but after decades of service as a political leader , he has won the respect of a large majority of his countrymen .

if the amendments are passed by parliament , gay and lesbian " registered couples " will enjoy most of the same rights and responsibilities heterosexual spouses do , including pension rights and financial support responsibilities in the event of separation .
the governing social democratic-green coalition wants to introduce gay engagements , which would allow one partner to refuse to testify against the other in court .
the bill will also allow homosexuals to adopt the biological child of their partner , if the other biological parent consents .
however , general adoptions will continue to be banned .
the changes in adoption law have met with strong opposition from conservative parties .
however , the bill does not need approval from the upper house of parliament , where the conservatives have a majority .
the first reading in front of the lower house takes place on friday . more briefs 30.06.2004 -pipe- man arrested in jet bomb scare 29.06.2004 -pipe- germany pays tribute to officers killed in iraq 29.06.2004 -pipe- experts disagree on east german reconstruction 29.06.2004 -pipe- hamburg tanker collision injures 11 29.06.2004 -pipe- military ceremony marks president rau 's exit 28.06.2004 -pipe- schröder wants verheugen to remain eu commissioner 28.06.2004 -pipe- german dentist to referee euro 2004 final 28.06.2004 -pipe- economics minister threatens to quit if reforms fail radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the probe will have traveled 3.5 billion kilometers -lrb- 2.2 billion miles -rrb- , when it finally starts orbiting the ringed planet thursday . the critical moment , however , will come when cassini is set to fire its engines after flying through a gap in saturn 's rings , starting at 2:36 utc thursday morning .
that should use up 1.5 tons of fuel and slow the craft down enough for it to get caught in saturn 's gravity field and pulled into the planet 's orbit .
but with a delay of more than an hour , scientists on the earth will have no control over cassini , which will have to manage the tricky maneuver without colliding with any potentially damaging space particles on its own .
from there the probe will begin making 76 rounds of saturn over a period of at least four years , collecting data and images of the planet , its rings and its moons . " we 're right on track , " navigation team chief jeremy jones told a news conference tuesday at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory .
cassini program manager robert mitchell and other officials expressed confidence that the craft would successfully enter saturn 's orbit , but he admitted that the procedure was a " hair-graying " event , ap reported . named after the french astronomer who in 1675 discovered saturn 's rings , cassini is expected to start sending data and images from saturn on thursday . decades of work the mission has been in the works for nearly 30 years and has cost nasa and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- $ 3.3 billion -lrb- € 2.71 billion -rrb- and the energies of more than 5,000 scientists .
cassini , carrying the wok-shaped probe huygens on its back , was sent into space from cape canaveral in florida on october 1997 . huygens , named after the dutch astronomer who in 1659 first recognized the true shape of the ring around saturn , is meant to explore titan , the largest of the planet 's 31 known moons .
the craft is programmed to take leave of its host on christmas and parachute into titan 's atmosphere . the moon is particularly interesting to scientists because it 's thought to have conditions similar to those on earth before life emerged .
scientists estimate huygens will have around one and a half hours to relay data from titan 's atmosphere before its battery runs out in the minus 180 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 292 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- weather . " this is one of the most exciting projects we have going , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told dw-world .
" huygens will be the first time europe has landed in the outer solar system .
and perhaps the most exciting thing of all is that we do n't know whether it 's going to land or splash down , because titan is swathed in a thick , smoggy atmosphere and we ca n't see its surface .

the probe will have traveled 3.5 billion kilometers -lrb- 2.2 billion miles -rrb- , when it finally starts orbiting the ringed planet thursday . the critical moment , however , will come when cassini is set to fire its engines after flying through a gap in saturn 's rings , starting at 2:36 utc thursday morning .

" if you have too many foreign players in your own league , it becomes difficult to get your own players coming through , " olsson said according to reuters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.06.2004 u.s.-european spacecraft nears goal of saturn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the craft will come within 80,230 km -lrb- 49,850 miles -rrb- of saturn launched by nasa and the european space agency , the cassini space probe is set to reach saturn thursday and start investigating the second largest planet in the solar system . after a nearly seven year journey , scientists in europe and the united states are waiting with bated breath for the cassini spacecraft to approach saturn .
the probe will have traveled 3.5 billion kilometers -lrb- 2.2 billion miles -rrb- , when it finally starts orbiting the ringed planet thursday . the critical moment , however , will come when cassini is set to fire its engines after flying through a gap in saturn 's rings , starting at 2:36 utc thursday morning .
that should use up 1.5 tons of fuel and slow the craft down enough for it to get caught in saturn 's gravity field and pulled into the planet 's orbit .
but with a delay of more than an hour , scientists on the earth will have no control over cassini , which will have to manage the tricky maneuver without colliding with any potentially damaging space particles on its own .
from there the probe will begin making 76 rounds of saturn over a period of at least four years , collecting data and images of the planet , its rings and its moons . " we 're right on track , " navigation team chief jeremy jones told a news conference tuesday at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory .
cassini program manager robert mitchell and other officials expressed confidence that the craft would successfully enter saturn 's orbit , but he admitted that the procedure was a " hair-graying " event , ap reported . named after the french astronomer who in 1675 discovered saturn 's rings , cassini is expected to start sending data and images from saturn on thursday . decades of work the mission has been in the works for nearly 30 years and has cost nasa and the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- $ 3.3 billion -lrb- € 2.71 billion -rrb- and the energies of more than 5,000 scientists .
cassini , carrying the wok-shaped probe huygens on its back , was sent into space from cape canaveral in florida on october 1997 . huygens , named after the dutch astronomer who in 1659 first recognized the true shape of the ring around saturn , is meant to explore titan , the largest of the planet 's 31 known moons .
the craft is programmed to take leave of its host on christmas and parachute into titan 's atmosphere . the moon is particularly interesting to scientists because it 's thought to have conditions similar to those on earth before life emerged .
scientists estimate huygens will have around one and a half hours to relay data from titan 's atmosphere before its battery runs out in the minus 180 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 292 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- weather . " this is one of the most exciting projects we have going , " david southwood , esa 's director of science , told dw-world .
" huygens will be the first time europe has landed in the outer solar system .
and perhaps the most exciting thing of all is that we do n't know whether it 's going to land or splash down , because titan is swathed in a thick , smoggy atmosphere and we ca n't see its surface .
it may have methane oceans .

france , italy , spain , england and germany all crashed out of the tournament early to leave dark horse greece and three mid-sized soccer nations , the czech republic , the netherlands and portugal , in the semi-finals .
" if you have too many foreign players in your own league , it becomes difficult to get your own players coming through , " olsson said according to reuters .

it has been well-documented that only a fraction of alleged rapes result in conviction .
a research study , published in april 2002 , suggested that the proportion was about one in 13 .
other studies have indicated that it could be even smaller - if you include the number of allegations that never even get reported to the police .
of course there may be a small number of allegations that turn out to be false or malicious .
but the experience of women who have been through the process of reporting sexual assaults , making statements and giving evidence suggests the system itself is the main reason for the low conviction rate .
so one of the key issues for the attorney general and the director of public prosecutions has been to make procedures fairer for victims so that they feel more confident to report crimes to police and testify in court . "
the standard of rape prosecutions has remained a cause for concern " danny shaw the police have done their bit : in the 1980s and 90s there was a significant shift in the way officers dealt with rape cases .
specialist rape suites were set up and victims were taken more seriously .
in the last few years there have been more sexual assault referral centres set up .
they are run independently of the police and help victims who mistrust the authorities or are not sure that they want to make an official rape complaint .
the result has been that the message that rape victims will be treated properly appears to be getting through with an increase in the overall number of reported rapes .
but the standard of rape prosecutions has remained a cause for concern .
rape cases require great sensitivity on the part of lawyers .
high standards experience and determination may be called for if the evidence is weak ; a barrister with a strong presence in front of a judge and jury may be required if the defence employ bullying tactics .
so the appointment of specialist prosecutors to handle cases from start to finish will go some way to addressing those difficulties , as will the new policy to ensure that only the most senior barristers take charge .
there is also to be a new effort on gathering supporting evidence where the case depends on the word of the victim .
that may boost the number of successful prosecutions .
if the victim pulls out of the case , or refuses to testify , an investigation is to be carried out into the reasons why .
it could be that the alleged perpetrator is applying pressure on the victim to withdraw her allegation .

it has been well-documented that only a fraction of alleged rapes result in conviction .
new specialist prosecutors will tackle problems in court a research study , published in april 2002 , suggested that the proportion was about one in 13 .
other studies have indicated that it could be even smaller - if you include the number of allegations that never even get reported to the police .
of course there may be a small number of allegations that turn out to be false or malicious .
but the experience of women who have been through the process of reporting sexual assaults , making statements and giving evidence suggests the system itself is the main reason for the low conviction rate .
so one of the key issues for the attorney general and the director of public prosecutions has been to make procedures fairer for victims so that they feel more confident to report crimes to police and testify in court .
the standard of rape prosecutions has remained a cause for concern danny shaw the police have done their bit : in the 1980s and 90s there was a significant shift in the way officers dealt with rape cases .
specialist rape suites were set up and victims were taken more seriously .
in the last few years there have been more sexual assault referral centres set up .
they are run independently of the police and help victims who mistrust the authorities or are not sure that they want to make an official rape complaint .
the result has been that the message that rape victims will be treated properly appears to be getting through with an increase in the overall number of reported rapes .
but the standard of rape prosecutions has remained a cause for concern .
rape cases require great sensitivity on the part of lawyers .
high standards experience and determination may be called for if the evidence is weak ; a barrister with a strong presence in front of a judge and jury may be required if the defence employ bullying tactics .
so the appointment of specialist prosecutors to handle cases from start to finish will go some way to addressing those difficulties , as will the new policy to ensure that only the most senior barristers take charge .
there is also to be a new effort on gathering supporting evidence where the case depends on the word of the victim .
that may boost the number of successful prosecutions .
if the victim pulls out of the case , or refuses to testify , an investigation is to be carried out into the reasons why .
it could be that the alleged perpetrator is applying pressure on the victim to withdraw her allegation .
much of what is in the new cps policy has already been implemented .

of course there may be a small number of allegations that turn out to be false or malicious .
but the experience of women who have been through the process of reporting sexual assaults , making statements and giving evidence suggests the system itself is the main reason for the low conviction rate .
so one of the key issues for the attorney general and the director of public prosecutions has been to make procedures fairer for victims so that they feel more confident to report crimes to police and testify in court .
the standard of rape prosecutions has remained a cause for concern danny shaw the police have done their bit : in the 1980s and 90s there was a significant shift in the way officers dealt with rape cases .
specialist rape suites were set up and victims were taken more seriously .
in the last few years there have been more sexual assault referral centres set up .
they are run independently of the police and help victims who mistrust the authorities or are not sure that they want to make an official rape complaint .
the result has been that the message that rape victims will be treated properly appears to be getting through with an increase in the overall number of reported rapes .
but the standard of rape prosecutions has remained a cause for concern .
rape cases require great sensitivity on the part of lawyers .
high standards experience and determination may be called for if the evidence is weak ; a barrister with a strong presence in front of a judge and jury may be required if the defence employ bullying tactics .
so the appointment of specialist prosecutors to handle cases from start to finish will go some way to addressing those difficulties , as will the new policy to ensure that only the most senior barristers take charge .
there is also to be a new effort on gathering supporting evidence where the case depends on the word of the victim .
that may boost the number of successful prosecutions .
if the victim pulls out of the case , or refuses to testify , an investigation is to be carried out into the reasons why .
it could be that the alleged perpetrator is applying pressure on the victim to withdraw her allegation .
much of what is in the new cps policy has already been implemented .
but it is a clear and unequivocal declaration of the high standards that witnesses and victims can expect and deserve .

last year bristol zoo gardens released 70 water voles into the city 's royal portbury docks .
the animals , which have been bred from stock rescued from the wild more than five years ago , are now flourishing .
on wednesday , a further 83 water voles will be released at a new location at the dock to establish a new colony .
it is hoped the additions will help increase the chances of reversing the 96 % decline in numbers suffered by the species over the last century .
the dock location was chosen for its ideal waterways and absence of american mink .
the site underlines how voles can adapt and thrive in urban environments if the conditions are right .
however , wildlife campaigners warn that , faced with a plethora of different threats from habitat loss to poisoning , numbers continue to decline dramatically .
to enable the zoo to monitor the voles ' progress , some have been fitted with a radio collar .
the water voles have also been id-chipped , allowing individuals to be identified for ongoing studies into the effectiveness of the release .
the programme has also helped to re-establish water vole communities on the kennet and avon canal near bath .

wales ' three national parks have been described as " international treasures " and " the lungs of the nation " , but are you making the most of them ?
martin fitton , chief executive of the association of national park authorities , said all three parks were " exceedingly beautiful in very different ways " .
" wales is possibly the most beautiful country in the world due to its diverse geology , " he said .
" it gives such a wide range of scenery from the rugged grandeur of snowdonia / eryri , to the softer sand and limestone peaks of the brecon beacons to the incomparable coast of pembrokeshire and its islands . "
eryri / snowdonia the biggest of the parks by far is eryri / snowdonia , which covers 823 square miles from machynlleth and aberdyfi in the south to llanberis and conwy in the north .
there are 15 mountains over 3,000ft within the park and it is more than just an attraction - there are more than 26,000 people living in the midst of its breathtaking mountains , which have inspired artists including sir kyffin williams .
as the highest mountain in wales and england , snowdon , or yr wyddfa , itself attracts more than 500,000 visitors a year .
many of these make it to the summit cafe by fighting their way up one of the many trails , but if you can not face that ordeal , a railway has been running to the top since 1896 .
but snowdon is not the only big draw , there are 90 other peaks over 2,000 feet to explore , including cadair idris , near dolgellau .
opera singer bryn terfel is a big fan of the region 's " spectacular surroundings " .
" it is a constant reminder that we should cherish and protect this breathtaking landscape of deep valleys and rugged mountains for future generations , " he said .
pembrokeshire coast pembrokeshire coast , stretching from cardian right round to beyond tenby , spans 170 miles of dramatic coastline .
pop star david gray loves the pembrokeshire coast the park is distinctive for its majestic cliffs , beautiful beaches and a plethora of wildlife .
its highlights include the challenge of its coastal path , which is 186 miles long and attracts walkers from across the world , and britain 's smallest city st david 's .
but equally famous are colonies of seals and seabirds , and the rich range of wild flowers that have made the park their home .
it is enough to convince musician david gray , who was brought up nearby .
" pembrokeshire coast national park is my favourite place in the world and always will be , " he said .
the park celebrated its half-century in 2003 .
brecon beacons covering 520 square miles between hay-on-wye and llandeilo , the brecon beacons offer a range of mountains , lakes , forests and gorges .
brian blessed is president of the national parks the park incorporates the black mountains , the central beacons and fforest fawr , and is tough enough to be used as a testing ground by the sas , who are based in nearby hereford .
people have been living in the area for more than 5,000 years , and the sense of history is captured in the standing stones and cairns that dot the landscapes .
and actor brian blessed , who is president of the national parks , stressed its central location should also be a reason for visitors to sample its delights .
" these are beautiful mountains - they are not frightening , and they are accessible from london .
" you can reach here so quickly from the m4 . "

martin fitton , chief executive of the association of national park authorities , said all three parks were " exceedingly beautiful in very different ways " .
" wales is possibly the most beautiful country in the world due to its diverse geology , " he said .
" it gives such a wide range of scenery from the rugged grandeur of snowdonia / eryri , to the softer sand and limestone peaks of the brecon beacons to the incomparable coast of pembrokeshire and its islands . "
eryri / snowdonia the biggest of the parks by far is eryri / snowdonia , which covers 823 square miles from machynlleth and aberdyfi in the south to llanberis and conwy in the north .
there are 15 mountains over 3,000ft within the park and it is more than just an attraction - there are more than 26,000 people living in the midst of its breathtaking mountains , which have inspired artists including sir kyffin williams .
as the highest mountain in wales and england , snowdon , or yr wyddfa , itself attracts more than 500,000 visitors a year .
many of these make it to the summit cafe by fighting their way up one of the many trails , but if you can not face that ordeal , a railway has been running to the top since 1896 .
but snowdon is not the only big draw , there are 90 other peaks over 2,000 feet to explore , including cadair idris , near dolgellau .
opera singer bryn terfel is a big fan of the region 's " spectacular surroundings " .
" it is a constant reminder that we should cherish and protect this breathtaking landscape of deep valleys and rugged mountains for future generations , " he said .
pembrokeshire coast pembrokeshire coast , stretching from cardian right round to beyond tenby , spans 170 miles of dramatic coastline .
pop star david gray loves the pembrokeshire coast the park is distinctive for its majestic cliffs , beautiful beaches and a plethora of wildlife .
its highlights include the challenge of its coastal path , which is 186 miles long and attracts walkers from across the world , and britain 's smallest city st david 's .
but equally famous are colonies of seals and seabirds , and the rich range of wild flowers that have made the park their home .
it is enough to convince musician david gray , who was brought up nearby .
" pembrokeshire coast national park is my favourite place in the world and always will be , " he said .
the park celebrated its half-century in 2003 .
brecon beacons covering 520 square miles between hay-on-wye and llandeilo , the brecon beacons offer a range of mountains , lakes , forests and gorges .
brian blessed is president of the national parks the park incorporates the black mountains , the central beacons and fforest fawr , and is tough enough to be used as a testing ground by the sas , who are based in nearby hereford .
people have been living in the area for more than 5,000 years , and the sense of history is captured in the standing stones and cairns that dot the landscapes .
and actor brian blessed , who is president of the national parks , stressed its central location should also be a reason for visitors to sample its delights .
" these are beautiful mountains - they are not frightening , and they are accessible from london .
" you can reach here so quickly from the m4 . "
