the murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh plunged the country into a crisis last september .
now , with the confessed killer standing trial , swedes are hoping to draw a close to a dark moment in thier history . the man who admitted to killing lindh testified that voices in his head told him to stab the swedish minister repeatedly in the chest and arms .
" i couldn ’ t resist , " mijailo mijailovic confessed to the panel of judges in the packed stockholm courtroom on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mijailo mijailovic although he said he did indeed kill the widely popular anna lindh , the 25-year old swede of yugoslav origin denied it was for political reasons .
" i ’ m not interested in politics , " he told chief prosecutor krister petersson .
" i have nothing personal against anna lindh . "
mijailo ’ s lawyer , peter althin , has pushed for dropping the charges down to manslaughter rather than murder , arguing that his client had not planned the sept .
10 stabbing and that there was " no intent to kill . "
prosecutors , however , insist the attack was premeditated and argue that mijailovic stalked lindh for 14 minutes before stabbing her with a knife in a crowded department store .
given the killer ’ s confession and the prosecution ’ s overwhelming evidence , the court ’ s main task will be to determine whether mijailovic really intended to kill anna lindh or not .
why anna lindh ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the killer was caught on video tape in the department store when the prosecution asked whether he was specifically looking for lindh in the department store , mijailovic said he had been wandering aimlessly , without any reason .
" i just trotted around on different floors and visited all the departments , " he said .
he denied looking for anyone in particular .
he said he just saw lindh and voices in his head , including that of jesus , urged him to stab her - 10 times with a knife .
lindh died the next day in the hospital after doctors worked through the night to save her .
mijailovic , who was arrested sept .
24 , confessed last week , saying he wanted to end speculation about the motive , including media reports that he was upset over lindh ’ s support of the 1999 nato air strikes on serbia .
difficult search the death of one of the country ’ s best-loved politicians sent shock waves through sweden , and initially there were concerns that the murderer wouldn ’ t be found .
after a first suspect was detained and then quickly released without charge , public opinion against the police .
" we were under huge pressure to solve this murder , " said chief police investigator leif jennekvist .
" and we had to be careful to pass on the information in such a way that on the one had the public need for information would be satisfied , while on the other hand our work wouldn ’ t be hindered . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murder weapon it wasn ’ t until the end of september that mijailovic was arrested .
initially he denied the killing , however police managed to match his dna with that found at the murder scene and on the knife .
" only when we got the dna proof were we one hundred percent sure about the identity of the murder , " said jennekvist .
mijailovic , who has a history of mental problems and three previous convictions , including one for a 1996 stabbing of his father , could face a sentence of between 10 years and life in prison .
if found mentally unstable , he could also be sent to a mental hospital for mandatory treatment .
a previous psychiatric evaluation found him " in great need of psychiatric and psychotherapeutic efforts , " but concluded that there were no medical grounds to sentence him to psychiatric care .
painful recovery whichever way the sentence reads , the trial brings a sense of relief , a form of closure for sweden , said jennekvist .
bringing mijailovic to court will help heal national wounds surrounding the murder and the painful memories it evoked of the assassination of swedish prime minister olof palme in 1986 .
like lindh , palme was attacked while out in public without bodyguards .
to this day his murderers have not been found . anja von cysewski -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspect confesses in lindh killing the man suspected of killing swedish foreign minister anna lindh in a brutal stabbing incident last year has confessed to the crime , a prosecutor said wednesday .

germany 's railway celebrates a decade as a private company on wednesday .
the deutsche bahn chairman hopes it will be ready to go public in 2005 - but meanwhile , it continues accruing debt . just days after opening , berlin 's newest five-star hotel , the ritz-carlton , is warming up for a bash in honor of the 10th anniversary of germany 's state railway system going private . its host , deutsche bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn , predictably lauds the reform as " a huge success . " " after -lrb- the fall of the berlin wall -rrb- we had two train companies that were on their last legs economically , " mehdorn told the newspaper die welt on the eve of the celebration .
" we know we 're not done , but what this company and its employees have done is unparalleled . " but that has n't put a stop to harsh criticism of db from politicians , economists and passengers . a mountain of debt the trip to where the bahn stands today has been a long one .
based on the recommendations of a government-appointed commission in late 1991 , parliament decided it was time to reform the railway - and it promptly began amending around 130 laws to change its status . in january 1994 , the west and east german railway companies were merged into a stock corporation called deutsche bahn , with the federal government retaining full ownership . by that time , west germany 's railway alone had amassed € 34 billion -lrb- $ 43.5 billion -rrb- in debt .
its enormous losses - € 7.9 billion during its last year as a state agency - were paid for by taxpayers . germany could afford either the national train system or the army but not both , former chancellor helmut schmidt was quoted as saying at the time . but the government nonetheless assumed the mountain of debt , giving db a fresh start . since then , the government has taken a less hands-on approach to deutsche bahn . db , after all , became a private company that was expected to generate a profit .
while politicians no longer dictate the bahn 's day-to-day actions , the government does have a say in strategic decisions through infrastructural funding and members on the company 's supervisory board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn " the numbers speak for themselves , " mehdorn told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" we have saved german taxpayers around € 108 billion -lrb- since 1994 -rrb- , more than € 44 billion more than what independent experts forecasted at the time " for what the government would save if it made deutsche bahn an independent , self-sufficient company .
but mehdorn 's calculations are based on the assumption that the catastrophic pre-reform situation would have continued without change . no more clean slate mehdorn , deutsche bahn ceo since 1999 , can brag that db does n't pocket subsidies to cover its operating costs .
but it still receives around € 10 billion annually from federal and state sources to pay for commuter traffic and infrastructure development . and it 's incurring debts again .
in the first half of 2003 , operating loss after interest stood at € 143 million .
that was down from € 235 million a year earlier - and mehdorn has said he plans to get the company back into the black in 2004 . those plans precede tuesday 's news that mehdorn and co. are considering cost-cutting measures , including abandoning costly refurbishment and expansion plans for 2004 . for example , the long-awaited high-speed rail line between erfurt and nuremburg that would reduce total travel time between berlin and munich but would cost up to € 244 million to build could become the first victim of the cuts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worse yet , db appears to be one of the businesses german consumers most love to hate , along with deutsche post and deutsche telekom , which were also privatized in the 1990s .
last year , db introduced fare reforms that drew so many complaints that the railway gave in after about half a year and reinstated the old fare structure . the company 's byzantine new fare system - modeled after the airlines , with discounts for advance purchases but maximum fares for those purchased at the time of journey - remains not only confusing but often significantly more expensive than other forms of transportation .
indeed , a recent report claimed that as many as 25 percent of the flights by budget airlines within germany , like germanwings or hapag lloyd express , are taking customers away from deutsche bahn with lower prices and faster travel times . db announced drastic cuts in service personnel in late 2003 , including the closure of ticket counters that has led to longer lines at ticket and information counters .
only 85 percent of the trains are on time , which db defines as being no more than five minutes late - well below the company 's stated goal of 95 percent . going public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late trains abound but mehdorn , known for claiming that passenger lobbyists are whiners and even seeking to take legal action against them , is apparently not entirely oblivious to customers ' irritations .
" we have to get better at punctuality and information for our customers when there are irregularities , " he told die welt .
this is of special concern , since mehdorn has made it clear that he 's trying to get db in shape for an initial public offering by 2005 . he has his work cut out for him .
besides improving db 's image among passengers , mehdorn is faced with stiff competition from budget airlines in the passenger division and from trucking firms in the cargo field .
db 's cargo transport has been hit especially hard , with its market share dropping from 21 to 15.6 percent between 1990 and 2002 . it 's also hindered by its lack of punctuality and weak rail infrastructures in eastern europe . the company has also seen significant drops in its passenger traffic .
in a recent report , the european commission stated that since 1995 passenger rail traffic across europe rose 12 percent .
in germany , however , it fell by 7.6 percent - a sharp contrast to the 30 percent growth experienced in france . ten years after privatization the consensus seems to be that reforming the railways was the right thing to do .

germany 's railway celebrates a decade as a private company on wednesday .
the deutsche bahn chairman hopes it will be ready to go public in 2005 - but meanwhile , it continues accruing debt . just days after opening , berlin 's newest five-star hotel , the ritz-carlton , is warming up for a bash in honor of the 10th anniversary of germany 's state railway system going private . its host , deutsche bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn , predictably lauds the reform as " a huge success . " " after -lrb- the fall of the berlin wall -rrb- we had two train companies that were on their last legs economically , " mehdorn told the newspaper die welt on the eve of the celebration .
" we know we 're not done , but what this company and its employees have done is unparalleled . " but that has n't put a stop to harsh criticism of db from politicians , economists and passengers . a mountain of debt the trip to where the bahn stands today has been a long one .
based on the recommendations of a government-appointed commission in late 1991 , parliament decided it was time to reform the railway - and it promptly began amending around 130 laws to change its status . in january 1994 , the west and east german railway companies were merged into a stock corporation called deutsche bahn , with the federal government retaining full ownership . by that time , west germany 's railway alone had amassed € 34 billion -lrb- $ 43.5 billion -rrb- in debt .
its enormous losses - € 7.9 billion during its last year as a state agency - were paid for by taxpayers . germany could afford either the national train system or the army but not both , former chancellor helmut schmidt was quoted as saying at the time . but the government nonetheless assumed the mountain of debt , giving db a fresh start . since then , the government has taken a less hands-on approach to deutsche bahn . db , after all , became a private company that was expected to generate a profit .
while politicians no longer dictate the bahn 's day-to-day actions , the government does have a say in strategic decisions through infrastructural funding and members on the company 's supervisory board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn " the numbers speak for themselves , " mehdorn told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" we have saved german taxpayers around € 108 billion -lrb- since 1994 -rrb- , more than € 44 billion more than what independent experts forecasted at the time " for what the government would save if it made deutsche bahn an independent , self-sufficient company .
but mehdorn 's calculations are based on the assumption that the catastrophic pre-reform situation would have continued without change . no more clean slate mehdorn , deutsche bahn ceo since 1999 , can brag that db does n't pocket subsidies to cover its operating costs .
but it still receives around € 10 billion annually from federal and state sources to pay for commuter traffic and infrastructure development . and it 's incurring debts again .
in the first half of 2003 , operating loss after interest stood at € 143 million .
that was down from € 235 million a year earlier - and mehdorn has said he plans to get the company back into the black in 2004 . those plans precede tuesday 's news that mehdorn and co. are considering cost-cutting measures , including abandoning costly refurbishment and expansion plans for 2004 . for example , the long-awaited high-speed rail line between erfurt and nuremburg that would reduce total travel time between berlin and munich but would cost up to € 244 million to build could become the first victim of the cuts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worse yet , db appears to be one of the businesses german consumers most love to hate , along with deutsche post and deutsche telekom , which were also privatized in the 1990s .
last year , db introduced fare reforms that drew so many complaints that the railway gave in after about half a year and reinstated the old fare structure . the company 's byzantine new fare system - modeled after the airlines , with discounts for advance purchases but maximum fares for those purchased at the time of journey - remains not only confusing but often significantly more expensive than other forms of transportation .
indeed , a recent report claimed that as many as 25 percent of the flights by budget airlines within germany , like germanwings or hapag lloyd express , are taking customers away from deutsche bahn with lower prices and faster travel times . db announced drastic cuts in service personnel in late 2003 , including the closure of ticket counters that has led to longer lines at ticket and information counters .
only 85 percent of the trains are on time , which db defines as being no more than five minutes late - well below the company 's stated goal of 95 percent . going public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late trains abound but mehdorn , known for claiming that passenger lobbyists are whiners and even seeking to take legal action against them , is apparently not entirely oblivious to customers ' irritations .
" we have to get better at punctuality and information for our customers when there are irregularities , " he told die welt .
this is of special concern , since mehdorn has made it clear that he 's trying to get db in shape for an initial public offering by 2005 . he has his work cut out for him .
besides improving db 's image among passengers , mehdorn is faced with stiff competition from budget airlines in the passenger division and from trucking firms in the cargo field .
db 's cargo transport has been hit especially hard , with its market share dropping from 21 to 15.6 percent between 1990 and 2002 . it 's also hindered by its lack of punctuality and weak rail infrastructures in eastern europe . the company has also seen significant drops in its passenger traffic .

the european commission on tuesday decided to seek a court ruling to overturn finance ministers ’ suspension of eu budget rules for france and germany .
member states criticize the action , saying it ’ s a risky move . the eu executive , which is responsible for enforcing laws in the 15-member bloc , argued that taking finance ministers to court was vital to clarify disciplinary procedures for those who break the eu ’ s guidelines on deficit spending , as france and germany have done repeatedly .
but the unprecedented legal move is expected to generate a considerable amount of friction at a time when the eu is concerned about maintaining cohesion .
german finance minister hans eichel said the decision to go to the european court of justice was " hard to understand " and added that he saw no wrong doing in the finance minister ’ s nov .
25 decision to forego disciplinary action against berlin and paris for violating the stability pact .
the results of the ecofin -lrb- council of european finance ministers -rrb- meeting " correspond to the spirit and the letter of the stability and growth pact , " he said in a statement released on tuesday .
" the procedures that are foreseen -lrb- in the pact -rrb- were upheld . "
at the meeting , germany and france , europe ’ s two biggest economies , used their combined influence to convince ecofin to reject the commission ’ s recommendation to punish berlin and paris for running up excessive budget deficits by slapping them with steep fines and forcing them to make deeper deficit cuts in 2004 .
the commission is now seeking a ruling on whether the ministers violated procedure in taking an ad hoc decision against the eu executive branch .
brussels vs. brussels " not least with a view to the tasks the european union faces in the near future , it would be more helpful to aim for cooperation rather than confrontation , " eichel said in response to the commission ’ s legal challenge .
but eu monetary affairs commssioner pedro solbes , whose office oversees the stability pact , has argued that brussels has a duty to uphold the law and avoid a precedent that could legitimize rule-breaking in the future and ultimately undermine the eu treaty .
french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin acknowledged that it was the commission ’ s right to seek recourse in court , but insisted the finance minister ’ s decision was legal .
" i respect the decision of the commission , but i am not worried about the result , " he told reporters during a visit in brussels .
legal advisors to the member states in the eu council said the ministers had a discretionary power to overturn the commission ’ s recommendation and doubt the eu executive will come out a clear winner in court .
a house divided against itself the commission itself is divided over the decision to seek legal action .
the move is seen as a risky one , which could seriously undermine the authority of the executive branch if the eu ’ s top court rules the finance ministers ’ action legal .
solbes ' spokesman , gerassimos thomas , admitted there were possible risks involved in taking the case to court , but said " it had to be done , " and that it is the commission ’ s " role as guardian of the treaty to ensure that provisions are upheld . "
although nothing has been made public about internal discussion surrounding the commission ’ s action , thomas confirmed that tuesday ’ s decision had not been unanimous among the 20 commissioners .
sources in brussels say the french , german and british commissioners were against taking legal action .
it is also not certain whether the court of justice will agree to the commission ’ s request for a fast-track procedure that would lead to a decision in three to six months rather than the normal two years .
solbes , however , is convinced the risky legal move is the correct strategy for the commission .

the european commission on tuesday decided to seek a court ruling to overturn finance ministers ’ suspension of eu budget rules for france and germany .
member states criticize the action , saying it ’ s a risky move . the eu executive , which is responsible for enforcing laws in the 15-member bloc , argued that taking finance ministers to court was vital to clarify disciplinary procedures for those who break the eu ’ s guidelines on deficit spending , as france and germany have done repeatedly .
but the unprecedented legal move is expected to generate a considerable amount of friction at a time when the eu is concerned about maintaining cohesion .
german finance minister hans eichel said the decision to go to the european court of justice was " hard to understand " and added that he saw no wrong doing in the finance minister ’ s nov .
25 decision to forego disciplinary action against berlin and paris for violating the stability pact .
the results of the ecofin -lrb- council of european finance ministers -rrb- meeting " correspond to the spirit and the letter of the stability and growth pact , " he said in a statement released on tuesday .
" the procedures that are foreseen -lrb- in the pact -rrb- were upheld . "
at the meeting , germany and france , europe ’ s two biggest economies , used their combined influence to convince ecofin to reject the commission ’ s recommendation to punish berlin and paris for running up excessive budget deficits by slapping them with steep fines and forcing them to make deeper deficit cuts in 2004 .
the commission is now seeking a ruling on whether the ministers violated procedure in taking an ad hoc decision against the eu executive branch .
brussels vs. brussels " not least with a view to the tasks the european union faces in the near future , it would be more helpful to aim for cooperation rather than confrontation , " eichel said in response to the commission ’ s legal challenge .
but eu monetary affairs commssioner pedro solbes , whose office oversees the stability pact , has argued that brussels has a duty to uphold the law and avoid a precedent that could legitimize rule-breaking in the future and ultimately undermine the eu treaty .
french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin acknowledged that it was the commission ’ s right to seek recourse in court , but insisted the finance minister ’ s decision was legal .
" i respect the decision of the commission , but i am not worried about the result , " he told reporters during a visit in brussels .
legal advisors to the member states in the eu council said the ministers had a discretionary power to overturn the commission ’ s recommendation and doubt the eu executive will come out a clear winner in court .
a house divided against itself the commission itself is divided over the decision to seek legal action .
the move is seen as a risky one , which could seriously undermine the authority of the executive branch if the eu ’ s top court rules the finance ministers ’ action legal .
solbes ' spokesman , gerassimos thomas , admitted there were possible risks involved in taking the case to court , but said " it had to be done , " and that it is the commission ’ s " role as guardian of the treaty to ensure that provisions are upheld . "
although nothing has been made public about internal discussion surrounding the commission ’ s action , thomas confirmed that tuesday ’ s decision had not been unanimous among the 20 commissioners .
sources in brussels say the french , german and british commissioners were against taking legal action .
it is also not certain whether the court of justice will agree to the commission ’ s request for a fast-track procedure that would lead to a decision in three to six months rather than the normal two years .
solbes , however , is convinced the risky legal move is the correct strategy for the commission .

the murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh plunged the country into a crisis last september .
now , with the confessed killer standing trial , swedes are hoping to draw a close to a dark moment in thier history . the man who admitted to killing lindh testified that voices in his head told him to stab the swedish minister repeatedly in the chest and arms .
" i couldn ’ t resist , " mijailo mijailovic confessed to the panel of judges in the packed stockholm courtroom on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mijailo mijailovic although he said he did indeed kill the widely popular anna lindh , the 25-year old swede of yugoslav origin denied it was for political reasons .
" i ’ m not interested in politics , " he told chief prosecutor krister petersson .
" i have nothing personal against anna lindh . "
mijailo ’ s lawyer , peter althin , has pushed for dropping the charges down to manslaughter rather than murder , arguing that his client had not planned the sept .
10 stabbing and that there was " no intent to kill . "
prosecutors , however , insist the attack was premeditated and argue that mijailovic stalked lindh for 14 minutes before stabbing her with a knife in a crowded department store .
given the killer ’ s confession and the prosecution ’ s overwhelming evidence , the court ’ s main task will be to determine whether mijailovic really intended to kill anna lindh or not .
why anna lindh ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the killer was caught on video tape in the department store when the prosecution asked whether he was specifically looking for lindh in the department store , mijailovic said he had been wandering aimlessly , without any reason .
" i just trotted around on different floors and visited all the departments , " he said .
he denied looking for anyone in particular .
he said he just saw lindh and voices in his head , including that of jesus , urged him to stab her - 10 times with a knife .
lindh died the next day in the hospital after doctors worked through the night to save her .
mijailovic , who was arrested sept .
24 , confessed last week , saying he wanted to end speculation about the motive , including media reports that he was upset over lindh ’ s support of the 1999 nato air strikes on serbia .
difficult search the death of one of the country ’ s best-loved politicians sent shock waves through sweden , and initially there were concerns that the murderer wouldn ’ t be found .
after a first suspect was detained and then quickly released without charge , public opinion against the police .
" we were under huge pressure to solve this murder , " said chief police investigator leif jennekvist .
" and we had to be careful to pass on the information in such a way that on the one had the public need for information would be satisfied , while on the other hand our work wouldn ’ t be hindered . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murder weapon it wasn ’ t until the end of september that mijailovic was arrested .
initially he denied the killing , however police managed to match his dna with that found at the murder scene and on the knife .
" only when we got the dna proof were we one hundred percent sure about the identity of the murder , " said jennekvist .

the murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh plunged the country into a crisis last september .
now , with the confessed killer standing trial , swedes are hoping to draw a close to a dark moment in thier history . the man who admitted to killing lindh testified that voices in his head told him to stab the swedish minister repeatedly in the chest and arms .
" i couldn ’ t resist , " mijailo mijailovic confessed to the panel of judges in the packed stockholm courtroom on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mijailo mijailovic although he said he did indeed kill the widely popular anna lindh , the 25-year old swede of yugoslav origin denied it was for political reasons .
" i ’ m not interested in politics , " he told chief prosecutor krister petersson .
" i have nothing personal against anna lindh . "
mijailo ’ s lawyer , peter althin , has pushed for dropping the charges down to manslaughter rather than murder , arguing that his client had not planned the sept .
10 stabbing and that there was " no intent to kill . "
prosecutors , however , insist the attack was premeditated and argue that mijailovic stalked lindh for 14 minutes before stabbing her with a knife in a crowded department store .
given the killer ’ s confession and the prosecution ’ s overwhelming evidence , the court ’ s main task will be to determine whether mijailovic really intended to kill anna lindh or not .
why anna lindh ?

he denied looking for anyone in particular .
he said he just saw lindh and voices in his head , including that of jesus , urged him to stab her - 10 times with a knife .
lindh died the next day in the hospital after doctors worked through the night to save her .
mijailovic , who was arrested sept .
24 , confessed last week , saying he wanted to end speculation about the motive , including media reports that he was upset over lindh ’ s support of the 1999 nato air strikes on serbia .
difficult search the death of one of the country ’ s best-loved politicians sent shock waves through sweden , and initially there were concerns that the murderer wouldn ’ t be found .
after a first suspect was detained and then quickly released without charge , public opinion against the police .
" we were under huge pressure to solve this murder , " said chief police investigator leif jennekvist .
" and we had to be careful to pass on the information in such a way that on the one had the public need for information would be satisfied , while on the other hand our work wouldn ’ t be hindered . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murder weapon it wasn ’ t until the end of september that mijailovic was arrested .
initially he denied the killing , however police managed to match his dna with that found at the murder scene and on the knife .

a camera mounted on the mars express orbiter is expected to produce unprecedented images of the planet over the next years .
first images will be released next week .
dw-world took a look behind the scenes . berlin - ralf jaumann expects to feel a little edgy over the next two years .
the planetary geologist at the german aerospace center ’ s -lrb- dlr -rrb- institute for planetary research in berlin will be one of the first people to receive data collected by the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- .
“ every time we switch it on or off , i ’ m nervous , ” said jaumann , who will turn the data into raw images before sending the latter on for further analysis .
“ it will certainly become a matter of routine , but not completely . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf jaumann during a dw-tv interview .
last friday jaumann -lrb- photo -rrb- got another chance to jitter as the camera began searching for signs of the missing beagle 2 lander .
the robot probably crashed during touchdown on the martian surface . while beagle 2 was designed to conduct a small percentage of the mission ’ s ground experiments , focus is likely to shift now to the camera and other instruments mounted on the orbiter , such as marsis , a sub-surface sounding radar altimeter searching for water under the planet ’ s crust , or spicam , an ultraviolet and infrared spectrometer that will study the martian atmosphere . not all hope has been lost for finding the lander , however , and jaumann and his colleagues have been given a lot of data storage space on the orbiter to search for beagle 2 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.01.2004 eu takes eu to court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice for the european union - but which part of it ?
the european commission on tuesday decided to seek a court ruling to overturn finance ministers ’ suspension of eu budget rules for france and germany .
member states criticize the action , saying it ’ s a risky move . the eu executive , which is responsible for enforcing laws in the 15-member bloc , argued that taking finance ministers to court was vital to clarify disciplinary procedures for those who break the eu ’ s guidelines on deficit spending , as france and germany have done repeatedly .
but the unprecedented legal move is expected to generate a considerable amount of friction at a time when the eu is concerned about maintaining cohesion .
german finance minister hans eichel said the decision to go to the european court of justice was " hard to understand " and added that he saw no wrong doing in the finance minister ’ s nov .
25 decision to forego disciplinary action against berlin and paris for violating the stability pact .
the results of the ecofin -lrb- council of european finance ministers -rrb- meeting " correspond to the spirit and the letter of the stability and growth pact , " he said in a statement released on tuesday .
" the procedures that are foreseen -lrb- in the pact -rrb- were upheld . "
at the meeting , germany and france , europe ’ s two biggest economies , used their combined influence to convince ecofin to reject the commission ’ s recommendation to punish berlin and paris for running up excessive budget deficits by slapping them with steep fines and forcing them to make deeper deficit cuts in 2004 .
the commission is now seeking a ruling on whether the ministers violated procedure in taking an ad hoc decision against the eu executive branch .
brussels vs. brussels " not least with a view to the tasks the european union faces in the near future , it would be more helpful to aim for cooperation rather than confrontation , " eichel said in response to the commission ’ s legal challenge .
but eu monetary affairs commssioner pedro solbes , whose office oversees the stability pact , has argued that brussels has a duty to uphold the law and avoid a precedent that could legitimize rule-breaking in the future and ultimately undermine the eu treaty .
french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin acknowledged that it was the commission ’ s right to seek recourse in court , but insisted the finance minister ’ s decision was legal .
" i respect the decision of the commission , but i am not worried about the result , " he told reporters during a visit in brussels .
legal advisors to the member states in the eu council said the ministers had a discretionary power to overturn the commission ’ s recommendation and doubt the eu executive will come out a clear winner in court .
a house divided against itself the commission itself is divided over the decision to seek legal action .
the move is seen as a risky one , which could seriously undermine the authority of the executive branch if the eu ’ s top court rules the finance ministers ’ action legal .
solbes ' spokesman , gerassimos thomas , admitted there were possible risks involved in taking the case to court , but said " it had to be done , " and that it is the commission ’ s " role as guardian of the treaty to ensure that provisions are upheld . "
although nothing has been made public about internal discussion surrounding the commission ’ s action , thomas confirmed that tuesday ’ s decision had not been unanimous among the 20 commissioners .
sources in brussels say the french , german and british commissioners were against taking legal action .
it is also not certain whether the court of justice will agree to the commission ’ s request for a fast-track procedure that would lead to a decision in three to six months rather than the normal two years .
solbes , however , is convinced the risky legal move is the correct strategy for the commission .
speaking to reporters after the announcement was made , he said the court challenge " has had great support , even if not all commissioners have agreed on all different aspects of the strategy .

the european commission on tuesday decided to seek a court ruling to overturn finance ministers ’ suspension of eu budget rules for france and germany .
member states criticize the action , saying it ’ s a risky move . the eu executive , which is responsible for enforcing laws in the 15-member bloc , argued that taking finance ministers to court was vital to clarify disciplinary procedures for those who break the eu ’ s guidelines on deficit spending , as france and germany have done repeatedly .
but the unprecedented legal move is expected to generate a considerable amount of friction at a time when the eu is concerned about maintaining cohesion .
german finance minister hans eichel said the decision to go to the european court of justice was " hard to understand " and added that he saw no wrong doing in the finance minister ’ s nov .
25 decision to forego disciplinary action against berlin and paris for violating the stability pact .
the results of the ecofin -lrb- council of european finance ministers -rrb- meeting " correspond to the spirit and the letter of the stability and growth pact , " he said in a statement released on tuesday .
" the procedures that are foreseen -lrb- in the pact -rrb- were upheld . "
at the meeting , germany and france , europe ’ s two biggest economies , used their combined influence to convince ecofin to reject the commission ’ s recommendation to punish berlin and paris for running up excessive budget deficits by slapping them with steep fines and forcing them to make deeper deficit cuts in 2004 .
the commission is now seeking a ruling on whether the ministers violated procedure in taking an ad hoc decision against the eu executive branch .
brussels vs. brussels " not least with a view to the tasks the european union faces in the near future , it would be more helpful to aim for cooperation rather than confrontation , " eichel said in response to the commission ’ s legal challenge .
but eu monetary affairs commssioner pedro solbes , whose office oversees the stability pact , has argued that brussels has a duty to uphold the law and avoid a precedent that could legitimize rule-breaking in the future and ultimately undermine the eu treaty .

the ratings of a new reality tv show in germany are climbing as minor celebrities are put through daily hair-raising ‘ challenges ’ in the australian jungle .
but as the tests get crueler , criticism is starting to grow . germany ’ s private television channel rtl has hit ratings pay dirt with its version of the british and american show “ i ’ m a celebrity get me out of here . ”
called “ ich bin ein star holt mich hier raus ” in german , the show has dropped ten b-list celebrities into a jungle in australia for 12 days . despite being inundated by reality tv in recent years , german viewers are flocking to the program , which forces one member of the group to undertake a stunt testing their courage each day in order to earn food for all .
but after a singer of questionable talent was forced to lie in a " cockroach coffin " with 30,000 of the wriggly creatures and an out-of-work tv host was pecked nearly to tears by a band of aggressive ostriches , media watchdogs and other groups are beginning to question the show ’ s lack of moral grounding . “ i ’ ve really been blown over .
these are methods that are reminiscent of torture tactics , ” jo groebel , the director of the european institute for the media in düsseldorf , told the associated press on wednesday . alarm bells for many went off when daniel küblböck , who become a celebrity as a performer in the german version of " pop idol , " suffered a panic attack after putting his head in a “ terror aquarium ” filled with eels and water spiders .

and rtl has defended the program , saying all those taking part were aware of what they were getting into . “ the participants are acting of their own will and are public persons who know exactly what they are doing , ” said an rtl spokesman .

now the irish prime minister bertie ahern has set out his intentions before the european parliament in strasbourg . the irish premier left his audience in no doubt about his top priority over the next six months .
he promised to pick the failed talks on an eu constitution off the floor and do all he could to elicit a final agreement .
" i pledge to you that the irish presidency will spare no effort to make progress and to facilitate consensus during our term in office .
the issue will command the highest priority under our presidency , " he told parliament .
ahern was also at pains to point out that time is of the essence if the european union wishes to keep its reputation in tact .
" excessive delay will damage our credibility and weaken our standing .
stalemate is not an option any of us can contemplate , " he said .
ahern said he planned to hold intensive talks with the heads of state and government ahead of the next eu summit in march , in order to come up with a possible solution to the sticking point of voting weights .
" i can assure the parliament that if my consultations suggest that there is a real prospect of agreement i will immediately move to seize the opportunity , " he said .
the talks last december , which should have been the crowning glory of italy 's six months in the eu presidential hot seat , ground to a halt when spain and poland refused to give up powerful voting rights established in the earlier nice treaty . something to celebrate a further high point during the irish presidency will be the addition of the ten new member states on may 1st .
and to mark the occasion , the irish government is planning to invite them all to dublin for a party .
as far as ahern is concerned , it is a moment in history which is well worth a celebration .
he told parliament that the founding fathers of a unified europe had dreamed of a time when europeans would never again kill each other in the name of natural resources , land or beliefs .
and with ten new states poised to join the bloc , the irish prime minister said that 2004 was a year in which europe was moving closer to making those dreams come true . with the constitution talks and eu expansion , the new president has a fat agenda for the next half a year , but looking beyond his six-month stint , he is confident that membership talks for romania and bulgaria will be concluded this year .
he is also hoping to see progress in the unification of the divided mediterranean island of cyprus .
as it stands , only the greek southern part will join the eu in may , but ahern also praised turkey 's attempts to close the gap between itself and europe .
a rallying call looking beyond europe 's borders , ahern called on the eu member states to do more in the fight against poverty and aids in africa .
he said it was crucial for developing nations that they resume talks with the world trade organization .
several members of the european parliament called on ahern to push forward his initiative on debt relief for the poorest countries in the world .
ireland wants to stimulate economic development in europe and has pledged to work towards the goal of making it the most innovative economic power in the world by the end of the decade .
ahern believes in increasing competitiveness in the union , and he voiced his support for the latest eu commission initiative to completely do away with restraints on service sector competition for professions such as doctors , lawyers , architects and pharmacists .
he told parliament that europe had to be as competitive as possible and that the greatest challenge is the desperate need for more and better employment .
ahern , who likes to go by the gallic name of taoiseach - meaning prime minister - will be turning his own attention to matters of employment over the coming months .
during his term in the rotating presidency , he will have to suggest a possible replacement for eu commission president romano prodi , whose term of office expires in november . bernd riegert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi 's star-crossed eu presidency italian premier silvio berlusconi steps down as eu council president wednesday .

now the irish prime minister bertie ahern has set out his intentions before the european parliament in strasbourg . the irish premier left his audience in no doubt about his top priority over the next six months .
he promised to pick the failed talks on an eu constitution off the floor and do all he could to elicit a final agreement .
" i pledge to you that the irish presidency will spare no effort to make progress and to facilitate consensus during our term in office .
the issue will command the highest priority under our presidency , " he told parliament .
ahern was also at pains to point out that time is of the essence if the european union wishes to keep its reputation in tact .
" excessive delay will damage our credibility and weaken our standing .
stalemate is not an option any of us can contemplate , " he said .
ahern said he planned to hold intensive talks with the heads of state and government ahead of the next eu summit in march , in order to come up with a possible solution to the sticking point of voting weights .
" i can assure the parliament that if my consultations suggest that there is a real prospect of agreement i will immediately move to seize the opportunity , " he said .
the talks last december , which should have been the crowning glory of italy 's six months in the eu presidential hot seat , ground to a halt when spain and poland refused to give up powerful voting rights established in the earlier nice treaty . something to celebrate a further high point during the irish presidency will be the addition of the ten new member states on may 1st .
and to mark the occasion , the irish government is planning to invite them all to dublin for a party .
as far as ahern is concerned , it is a moment in history which is well worth a celebration .
he told parliament that the founding fathers of a unified europe had dreamed of a time when europeans would never again kill each other in the name of natural resources , land or beliefs .
and with ten new states poised to join the bloc , the irish prime minister said that 2004 was a year in which europe was moving closer to making those dreams come true . with the constitution talks and eu expansion , the new president has a fat agenda for the next half a year , but looking beyond his six-month stint , he is confident that membership talks for romania and bulgaria will be concluded this year .
he is also hoping to see progress in the unification of the divided mediterranean island of cyprus .
as it stands , only the greek southern part will join the eu in may , but ahern also praised turkey 's attempts to close the gap between itself and europe .
a rallying call looking beyond europe 's borders , ahern called on the eu member states to do more in the fight against poverty and aids in africa .
he said it was crucial for developing nations that they resume talks with the world trade organization .
several members of the european parliament called on ahern to push forward his initiative on debt relief for the poorest countries in the world .
ireland wants to stimulate economic development in europe and has pledged to work towards the goal of making it the most innovative economic power in the world by the end of the decade .
ahern believes in increasing competitiveness in the union , and he voiced his support for the latest eu commission initiative to completely do away with restraints on service sector competition for professions such as doctors , lawyers , architects and pharmacists .
he told parliament that europe had to be as competitive as possible and that the greatest challenge is the desperate need for more and better employment .

germany 's railway celebrates a decade as a private company on wednesday .
the deutsche bahn chairman hopes it will be ready to go public in 2005 - but meanwhile , it continues accruing debt . just days after opening , berlin 's newest five-star hotel , the ritz-carlton , is warming up for a bash in honor of the 10th anniversary of germany 's state railway system going private . its host , deutsche bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn , predictably lauds the reform as " a huge success . " " after -lrb- the fall of the berlin wall -rrb- we had two train companies that were on their last legs economically , " mehdorn told the newspaper die welt on the eve of the celebration .
" we know we 're not done , but what this company and its employees have done is unparalleled . " but that has n't put a stop to harsh criticism of db from politicians , economists and passengers . a mountain of debt the trip to where the bahn stands today has been a long one .
based on the recommendations of a government-appointed commission in late 1991 , parliament decided it was time to reform the railway - and it promptly began amending around 130 laws to change its status . in january 1994 , the west and east german railway companies were merged into a stock corporation called deutsche bahn , with the federal government retaining full ownership . by that time , west germany 's railway alone had amassed € 34 billion -lrb- $ 43.5 billion -rrb- in debt .
its enormous losses - € 7.9 billion during its last year as a state agency - were paid for by taxpayers . germany could afford either the national train system or the army but not both , former chancellor helmut schmidt was quoted as saying at the time . but the government nonetheless assumed the mountain of debt , giving db a fresh start . since then , the government has taken a less hands-on approach to deutsche bahn . db , after all , became a private company that was expected to generate a profit .
while politicians no longer dictate the bahn 's day-to-day actions , the government does have a say in strategic decisions through infrastructural funding and members on the company 's supervisory board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn " the numbers speak for themselves , " mehdorn told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" we have saved german taxpayers around € 108 billion -lrb- since 1994 -rrb- , more than € 44 billion more than what independent experts forecasted at the time " for what the government would save if it made deutsche bahn an independent , self-sufficient company .
but mehdorn 's calculations are based on the assumption that the catastrophic pre-reform situation would have continued without change . no more clean slate mehdorn , deutsche bahn ceo since 1999 , can brag that db does n't pocket subsidies to cover its operating costs .
but it still receives around € 10 billion annually from federal and state sources to pay for commuter traffic and infrastructure development . and it 's incurring debts again .
in the first half of 2003 , operating loss after interest stood at € 143 million .
that was down from € 235 million a year earlier - and mehdorn has said he plans to get the company back into the black in 2004 . those plans precede tuesday 's news that mehdorn and co. are considering cost-cutting measures , including abandoning costly refurbishment and expansion plans for 2004 . for example , the long-awaited high-speed rail line between erfurt and nuremburg that would reduce total travel time between berlin and munich but would cost up to € 244 million to build could become the first victim of the cuts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worse yet , db appears to be one of the businesses german consumers most love to hate , along with deutsche post and deutsche telekom , which were also privatized in the 1990s .
last year , db introduced fare reforms that drew so many complaints that the railway gave in after about half a year and reinstated the old fare structure . the company 's byzantine new fare system - modeled after the airlines , with discounts for advance purchases but maximum fares for those purchased at the time of journey - remains not only confusing but often significantly more expensive than other forms of transportation .
indeed , a recent report claimed that as many as 25 percent of the flights by budget airlines within germany , like germanwings or hapag lloyd express , are taking customers away from deutsche bahn with lower prices and faster travel times . db announced drastic cuts in service personnel in late 2003 , including the closure of ticket counters that has led to longer lines at ticket and information counters .
only 85 percent of the trains are on time , which db defines as being no more than five minutes late - well below the company 's stated goal of 95 percent . going public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late trains abound but mehdorn , known for claiming that passenger lobbyists are whiners and even seeking to take legal action against them , is apparently not entirely oblivious to customers ' irritations .
" we have to get better at punctuality and information for our customers when there are irregularities , " he told die welt .
this is of special concern , since mehdorn has made it clear that he 's trying to get db in shape for an initial public offering by 2005 . he has his work cut out for him .
besides improving db 's image among passengers , mehdorn is faced with stiff competition from budget airlines in the passenger division and from trucking firms in the cargo field .
db 's cargo transport has been hit especially hard , with its market share dropping from 21 to 15.6 percent between 1990 and 2002 . it 's also hindered by its lack of punctuality and weak rail infrastructures in eastern europe . the company has also seen significant drops in its passenger traffic .
in a recent report , the european commission stated that since 1995 passenger rail traffic across europe rose 12 percent .
in germany , however , it fell by 7.6 percent - a sharp contrast to the 30 percent growth experienced in france . ten years after privatization the consensus seems to be that reforming the railways was the right thing to do .
nonetheless , critics still have plenty of fodder to fuel their anti-bahn arguments . dw staff -lrb- ni -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de roadwork ahead for the european union six months before enlargement , only one fifth of the ambitious europe-wide infrastructure plans called for in maastricht treaty have been finished .

germany 's railway celebrates a decade as a private company on wednesday .
the deutsche bahn chairman hopes it will be ready to go public in 2005 - but meanwhile , it continues accruing debt . just days after opening , berlin 's newest five-star hotel , the ritz-carlton , is warming up for a bash in honor of the 10th anniversary of germany 's state railway system going private . its host , deutsche bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn , predictably lauds the reform as " a huge success . " " after -lrb- the fall of the berlin wall -rrb- we had two train companies that were on their last legs economically , " mehdorn told the newspaper die welt on the eve of the celebration .
" we know we 're not done , but what this company and its employees have done is unparalleled . " but that has n't put a stop to harsh criticism of db from politicians , economists and passengers . a mountain of debt the trip to where the bahn stands today has been a long one .
based on the recommendations of a government-appointed commission in late 1991 , parliament decided it was time to reform the railway - and it promptly began amending around 130 laws to change its status . in january 1994 , the west and east german railway companies were merged into a stock corporation called deutsche bahn , with the federal government retaining full ownership . by that time , west germany 's railway alone had amassed € 34 billion -lrb- $ 43.5 billion -rrb- in debt .
its enormous losses - € 7.9 billion during its last year as a state agency - were paid for by taxpayers . germany could afford either the national train system or the army but not both , former chancellor helmut schmidt was quoted as saying at the time . but the government nonetheless assumed the mountain of debt , giving db a fresh start . since then , the government has taken a less hands-on approach to deutsche bahn . db , after all , became a private company that was expected to generate a profit .
while politicians no longer dictate the bahn 's day-to-day actions , the government does have a say in strategic decisions through infrastructural funding and members on the company 's supervisory board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn " the numbers speak for themselves , " mehdorn told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" we have saved german taxpayers around € 108 billion -lrb- since 1994 -rrb- , more than € 44 billion more than what independent experts forecasted at the time " for what the government would save if it made deutsche bahn an independent , self-sufficient company .
but mehdorn 's calculations are based on the assumption that the catastrophic pre-reform situation would have continued without change . no more clean slate mehdorn , deutsche bahn ceo since 1999 , can brag that db does n't pocket subsidies to cover its operating costs .
but it still receives around € 10 billion annually from federal and state sources to pay for commuter traffic and infrastructure development . and it 's incurring debts again .
in the first half of 2003 , operating loss after interest stood at € 143 million .
that was down from € 235 million a year earlier - and mehdorn has said he plans to get the company back into the black in 2004 . those plans precede tuesday 's news that mehdorn and co. are considering cost-cutting measures , including abandoning costly refurbishment and expansion plans for 2004 . for example , the long-awaited high-speed rail line between erfurt and nuremburg that would reduce total travel time between berlin and munich but would cost up to € 244 million to build could become the first victim of the cuts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worse yet , db appears to be one of the businesses german consumers most love to hate , along with deutsche post and deutsche telekom , which were also privatized in the 1990s .
last year , db introduced fare reforms that drew so many complaints that the railway gave in after about half a year and reinstated the old fare structure . the company 's byzantine new fare system - modeled after the airlines , with discounts for advance purchases but maximum fares for those purchased at the time of journey - remains not only confusing but often significantly more expensive than other forms of transportation .
indeed , a recent report claimed that as many as 25 percent of the flights by budget airlines within germany , like germanwings or hapag lloyd express , are taking customers away from deutsche bahn with lower prices and faster travel times . db announced drastic cuts in service personnel in late 2003 , including the closure of ticket counters that has led to longer lines at ticket and information counters .
only 85 percent of the trains are on time , which db defines as being no more than five minutes late - well below the company 's stated goal of 95 percent . going public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late trains abound but mehdorn , known for claiming that passenger lobbyists are whiners and even seeking to take legal action against them , is apparently not entirely oblivious to customers ' irritations .
" we have to get better at punctuality and information for our customers when there are irregularities , " he told die welt .
this is of special concern , since mehdorn has made it clear that he 's trying to get db in shape for an initial public offering by 2005 . he has his work cut out for him .
besides improving db 's image among passengers , mehdorn is faced with stiff competition from budget airlines in the passenger division and from trucking firms in the cargo field .
db 's cargo transport has been hit especially hard , with its market share dropping from 21 to 15.6 percent between 1990 and 2002 . it 's also hindered by its lack of punctuality and weak rail infrastructures in eastern europe . the company has also seen significant drops in its passenger traffic .

the murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh plunged the country into a crisis last september .
now , with the confessed killer standing trial , swedes are hoping to draw a close to a dark moment in thier history . the man who admitted to killing lindh testified that voices in his head told him to stab the swedish minister repeatedly in the chest and arms .
" i couldn ’ t resist , " mijailo mijailovic confessed to the panel of judges in the packed stockholm courtroom on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mijailo mijailovic although he said he did indeed kill the widely popular anna lindh , the 25-year old swede of yugoslav origin denied it was for political reasons .
" i ’ m not interested in politics , " he told chief prosecutor krister petersson .
" i have nothing personal against anna lindh . "
mijailo ’ s lawyer , peter althin , has pushed for dropping the charges down to manslaughter rather than murder , arguing that his client had not planned the sept .
10 stabbing and that there was " no intent to kill . "
prosecutors , however , insist the attack was premeditated and argue that mijailovic stalked lindh for 14 minutes before stabbing her with a knife in a crowded department store .
given the killer ’ s confession and the prosecution ’ s overwhelming evidence , the court ’ s main task will be to determine whether mijailovic really intended to kill anna lindh or not .
why anna lindh ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the killer was caught on video tape in the department store when the prosecution asked whether he was specifically looking for lindh in the department store , mijailovic said he had been wandering aimlessly , without any reason .
" i just trotted around on different floors and visited all the departments , " he said .
he denied looking for anyone in particular .
he said he just saw lindh and voices in his head , including that of jesus , urged him to stab her - 10 times with a knife .
lindh died the next day in the hospital after doctors worked through the night to save her .
mijailovic , who was arrested sept .
24 , confessed last week , saying he wanted to end speculation about the motive , including media reports that he was upset over lindh ’ s support of the 1999 nato air strikes on serbia .
difficult search the death of one of the country ’ s best-loved politicians sent shock waves through sweden , and initially there were concerns that the murderer wouldn ’ t be found .
after a first suspect was detained and then quickly released without charge , public opinion against the police .
" we were under huge pressure to solve this murder , " said chief police investigator leif jennekvist .
" and we had to be careful to pass on the information in such a way that on the one had the public need for information would be satisfied , while on the other hand our work wouldn ’ t be hindered . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murder weapon it wasn ’ t until the end of september that mijailovic was arrested .
initially he denied the killing , however police managed to match his dna with that found at the murder scene and on the knife .
" only when we got the dna proof were we one hundred percent sure about the identity of the murder , " said jennekvist .
mijailovic , who has a history of mental problems and three previous convictions , including one for a 1996 stabbing of his father , could face a sentence of between 10 years and life in prison .
if found mentally unstable , he could also be sent to a mental hospital for mandatory treatment .
a previous psychiatric evaluation found him " in great need of psychiatric and psychotherapeutic efforts , " but concluded that there were no medical grounds to sentence him to psychiatric care .
painful recovery whichever way the sentence reads , the trial brings a sense of relief , a form of closure for sweden , said jennekvist .
bringing mijailovic to court will help heal national wounds surrounding the murder and the painful memories it evoked of the assassination of swedish prime minister olof palme in 1986 .

italy ’ s highest court on tuesday annulled a controversial legal immunity law that had shielded top officials from prosecution while in office .
prime minister silvio berlusconi could now once again face bribery charges . the law , which was passed last june , gave the country ’ s five highest officials immunity , but it has been criticized as existing solely to end berlusconi ’ s numerous legal headaches .
dubbed “ lex berlusconi ” by some , it helped the prime minister avoid possible conviction while italy held the rotating eu presidency last autumn . since the court has determined that the law is unconstitutional , berlusconi will once again face trial for allegedly bribing judges in the 1980s while he was a business man .
the trial had been stopped after the law went into effect . “ every man is the same before the law , ” antonio di pietro , an opposition member of parliament and former crusading prosecutor , told the associated press after the legislation was annulled . but berlusconi ’ s justice minister roberto castelli criticized the verdict , saying it could complicate relations between politicians and the judiciary .
“ i fear after this verdict the polemics will become even worse , ” he said . early elections ? berlusconi has repeatedly contended that he has done no wrong and left-wing magistrates have mounted an unfounded campaign against him .
in the face of a possible onslaught of politically motivated legal action against him , berlusconi is reportedly considering calling early elections . “ if that ’ s how things stand , then it ’ s better to go back to the polls , ” he told the daily newspaper corriere della sera . " the teflon premier " a billionaire media mogul turned politician , berlusconi has gone to court eight times over the past decade for varying corruption offenses .
he has been found guilty several times , however , by winning on appeal or due to the statute of limitations nothing has stuck to the " teflon premier . " though the latest case against berlusconi was stopped this summer after the immunity law was passed , the trial against his business associated continued .
a key charge that a firm owned by berlusconi bribed judges to win approval of a corporate takeover in the 1980s was rejected , but a court did convict berlusconi friend and lawyer cesare previti of paying off a rome judge .
previti is currently appealing his sentence of five years in jail . berlusconi , italy ’ s richest man , has repeatedly run into trouble due to his business dealings .
in december , italian president carlo azeglio ciampi decided not to sign a new media law that the opposition fears would add to the influence of the prime minister ’ s already powerful media empire . berlusconi owns three mediaset channels , italia 1 , rete 4 and canale 5 and as premier wields political influence over the board of state public broadcaster rai , mediaset 's only serious competition .
berlusconi 's holdings have long made him the subject of serious conflict of interest allegations . from wire reports -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi 's star-crossed eu presidency italian premier silvio berlusconi steps down as eu council president wednesday .

prime minister silvio berlusconi could now once again face bribery charges . the law , which was passed last june , gave the country ’ s five highest officials immunity , but it has been criticized as existing solely to end berlusconi ’ s numerous legal headaches .
dubbed “ lex berlusconi ” by some , it helped the prime minister avoid possible conviction while italy held the rotating eu presidency last autumn . since the court has determined that the law is unconstitutional , berlusconi will once again face trial for allegedly bribing judges in the 1980s while he was a business man .
the trial had been stopped after the law went into effect . “ every man is the same before the law , ” antonio di pietro , an opposition member of parliament and former crusading prosecutor , told the associated press after the legislation was annulled . but berlusconi ’ s justice minister roberto castelli criticized the verdict , saying it could complicate relations between politicians and the judiciary .
“ i fear after this verdict the polemics will become even worse , ” he said . early elections ? berlusconi has repeatedly contended that he has done no wrong and left-wing magistrates have mounted an unfounded campaign against him .
in the face of a possible onslaught of politically motivated legal action against him , berlusconi is reportedly considering calling early elections . “ if that ’ s how things stand , then it ’ s better to go back to the polls , ” he told the daily newspaper corriere della sera .

he has been found guilty several times , however , by winning on appeal or due to the statute of limitations nothing has stuck to the " teflon premier . " though the latest case against berlusconi was stopped this summer after the immunity law was passed , the trial against his business associated continued .
a key charge that a firm owned by berlusconi bribed judges to win approval of a corporate takeover in the 1980s was rejected , but a court did convict berlusconi friend and lawyer cesare previti of paying off a rome judge .

"
eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes , who is charged with overseeing the stability pact , is seeking legal backing to overturn a ruling which suspends eu budget rules for germany and france . so is this a case of solbes being a bad loser ?
why is he pushing so hard to bring the eu executive before the european court of justice when the outcome and implications of such action are so unclear ?
the proud spaniard suffered political defeat back in november of last year when the majority of ministers on the council of finance ministers voted in favor of suspending eu budget rules for france and germany on the grounds that it does n't make economic sense to punish them for stepping over the budget line .
both " offenders " say they wo n't manage to meet the three percent limit before 2005 . feeling jaded ? it is a clear political decision which the administrative powers at the eu do n't want to accept . as the union 's legislative power , the eu executive has the authority to make or change the rules , but the eu commission , which oversees european treaties , feels like it 's nose has been knocked out of joint .
solbes is particularly irritated by the fact that the ministers strayed from the official line in the treaty , binned his suggestions and came up with their own agreements for france and germany . even if the court in luxembourg were to take on the charges and were to rule in favor of the commissioners , the practical repercussions would be practically non-existent , other than to provide the commission with the chance to savor a moral victory .
it would have been far more sensible to push for a simplification of the rules and to adjust the criteria in the 1997 stability pact so as to make them reflect the economic reality of 2004 .
and this could have happened long before the power struggle between brussels and berlin began . had he acted earlier to work with pedro solbes , german finance minister hans eichel could have helped to avoid the current misery .
but given that the two men seem as stubborn minded as each other , that never happened . hard times ahead the german eu commissioner for enlargement , günter verheugen , who is opposed to the decision to seek legal action , is quite right when he says that this increased aggravation is no help for the union .
with the troubled constitution still hanging over europe 's head , member states really have more important things to worry about than an internal legal dispute . heads of state and government have to take another serious stab at creating a working constitution if the union is to maintain its reputation for being a viable institutional and political partner .
the eu has to define the financial framework for trading after 2007 and then there are the all important discussions on whether or not turkey will be granted membership .
they have to digest the addition of ten new members and with the terms of office for eu commission president , romano prodi , and his department heads due to end in november , they also have some important personnel issues to deal with . so what , in that case , is the point of dubious legal action which will do little to help the stability pact ?
the joke in brussels is that solbes is trying to imitate his famous forefather , don quijote , who made a name for himself by battling imaginary windmills .
but leaving the whisperings in brussels aside , it is certainly too soon for hans eichel to begin rejoicing .
at the end of the year he has to prove that he can sink the german budget deficit below the obligatory three percent .
it is a tough goal for eichel who has his hands full with germany 's economic development .

eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes , who is charged with overseeing the stability pact , is seeking legal backing to overturn a ruling which suspends eu budget rules for germany and france . so is this a case of solbes being a bad loser ?
why is he pushing so hard to bring the eu executive before the european court of justice when the outcome and implications of such action are so unclear ?
the proud spaniard suffered political defeat back in november of last year when the majority of ministers on the council of finance ministers voted in favor of suspending eu budget rules for france and germany on the grounds that it does n't make economic sense to punish them for stepping over the budget line .
both " offenders " say they wo n't manage to meet the three percent limit before 2005 . feeling jaded ? it is a clear political decision which the administrative powers at the eu do n't want to accept . as the union 's legislative power , the eu executive has the authority to make or change the rules , but the eu commission , which oversees european treaties , feels like it 's nose has been knocked out of joint .
solbes is particularly irritated by the fact that the ministers strayed from the official line in the treaty , binned his suggestions and came up with their own agreements for france and germany . even if the court in luxembourg were to take on the charges and were to rule in favor of the commissioners , the practical repercussions would be practically non-existent , other than to provide the commission with the chance to savor a moral victory .
it would have been far more sensible to push for a simplification of the rules and to adjust the criteria in the 1997 stability pact so as to make them reflect the economic reality of 2004 .

with the troubled constitution still hanging over europe 's head , member states really have more important things to worry about than an internal legal dispute . heads of state and government have to take another serious stab at creating a working constitution if the union is to maintain its reputation for being a viable institutional and political partner .

defense minister peter struck 's announcement that some € 26 billion will be cut from the bundeswehr 's spending plans will hit the german arms industry hard . bundeswehr generals will be rewriting their wish lists after peter struck outlined his plans to reduce military spending on tuesday .
several missile projects are now set to be scrapped , and overall , the new budget constraints mean ever fewer contracts for arms manufacturers .
although the government says it will be sticking to procurement contracts already signed , such as orders for 180 eurofighter combat aircraft , the tiger combat helicopter and nh90 transport helicopter , projects such as upgrading the patriot missile defense systems and plans to buy a pilotless reconnaissance drone for the navy , will likely now be shelved .
a blow to industrial growth the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- fears the defense ministry 's move will have negative repercussions on the country 's industrial growth .
helmut harff , director of the bdi 's defense industries committee , says germany 's role within the european arms industry will now be severely reduced .
in an interview with deutsche welle , he said that " peter struck 's plans did n't come as a surprise to the defense industry , but it received very little information in advance . "
harff pointed out that " one needs to bear in mind that via the defense ministry , the government is the arms industry 's primary client , and for this section of the industry , the announced cuts mean major changes to existing business plans . "
a missed opportunity experts said the trend towards international mergers and alliances is now set to increase as a result of the defense cutbacks . harff , who served as first commander of the german troops in kosovo , predicted that germany may end up fast selling off its state-of-the-art technology .
although arms make up a very small share of germany 's total exports , he argued that the new cuts might mean germany could miss out on the opportunity to continue selling high-tech products on international markets .
" overall , exports of german munitions last year amounted to just 0.06 percent of germany 's total exports , which is very low , " said harff , before adding that " it 's important to maintain the technological means for manufacturing these munitions so that the country remains a player on the world market . "
a muted reaction so far , there 's been a muted reaction from business .
europe 's leading supplier of land forces systems , rheinmetall has welcomed the defense minister 's proposals because the company can now factor the cuts into its own planning security . but another company , kraus-maffei wegmann , a system vendor in the area of armored vehicles , has announced it does n't expect to be affected by the cuts .
germany 's arms industry may not have been given due warning of struck 's drastic agenda , but many companies are well-prepared nonetheless , having already introduced their own austerity measures some time ago and opted for new business strategies .
the same day the government revealed its plans , for example , european missile system manufacturer diehl announced it would be setting up a joint venture with american rival company raytheon to market a special sidewinder guided missile .
adhering to international agreements although the arms industry appears rather unruffled by the imminent cuts , harff pointed out that , in germany , the defense budget is a uniquely thorny issue .
he said he believes the key issue here is not so much arms spending , but rather security provisions for the future .
in that respect , he said , germany is is not sticking to international agreements .
" nato wants to see 2.3 percent of gross domestic product spent on security provisions , and in germany only 1.5 percent is being spent , " he observed .
but harff said he believes this has to change .
" other countries invest considerably more , " he said .
" last year , for example , france invested three times as much -lrb- in its military -rrb- as germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.01.2004 trial begins for accused killer of swedish foreign minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden is still mourning the passing of anna lindh .
the murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh plunged the country into a crisis last september .
now , with the confessed killer standing trial , swedes are hoping to draw a close to a dark moment in thier history . the man who admitted to killing lindh testified that voices in his head told him to stab the swedish minister repeatedly in the chest and arms .
" i couldn ’ t resist , " mijailo mijailovic confessed to the panel of judges in the packed stockholm courtroom on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mijailo mijailovic although he said he did indeed kill the widely popular anna lindh , the 25-year old swede of yugoslav origin denied it was for political reasons .
" i ’ m not interested in politics , " he told chief prosecutor krister petersson .
" i have nothing personal against anna lindh . "
mijailo ’ s lawyer , peter althin , has pushed for dropping the charges down to manslaughter rather than murder , arguing that his client had not planned the sept .
10 stabbing and that there was " no intent to kill . "
prosecutors , however , insist the attack was premeditated and argue that mijailovic stalked lindh for 14 minutes before stabbing her with a knife in a crowded department store .
given the killer ’ s confession and the prosecution ’ s overwhelming evidence , the court ’ s main task will be to determine whether mijailovic really intended to kill anna lindh or not .
why anna lindh ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the killer was caught on video tape in the department store when the prosecution asked whether he was specifically looking for lindh in the department store , mijailovic said he had been wandering aimlessly , without any reason .
" i just trotted around on different floors and visited all the departments , " he said .
he denied looking for anyone in particular .
he said he just saw lindh and voices in his head , including that of jesus , urged him to stab her - 10 times with a knife .
lindh died the next day in the hospital after doctors worked through the night to save her .
mijailovic , who was arrested sept .
24 , confessed last week , saying he wanted to end speculation about the motive , including media reports that he was upset over lindh ’ s support of the 1999 nato air strikes on serbia .
difficult search the death of one of the country ’ s best-loved politicians sent shock waves through sweden , and initially there were concerns that the murderer wouldn ’ t be found .
after a first suspect was detained and then quickly released without charge , public opinion against the police .
" we were under huge pressure to solve this murder , " said chief police investigator leif jennekvist .
" and we had to be careful to pass on the information in such a way that on the one had the public need for information would be satisfied , while on the other hand our work wouldn ’ t be hindered . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murder weapon it wasn ’ t until the end of september that mijailovic was arrested .
initially he denied the killing , however police managed to match his dna with that found at the murder scene and on the knife .
" only when we got the dna proof were we one hundred percent sure about the identity of the murder , " said jennekvist .
mijailovic , who has a history of mental problems and three previous convictions , including one for a 1996 stabbing of his father , could face a sentence of between 10 years and life in prison .
if found mentally unstable , he could also be sent to a mental hospital for mandatory treatment .
a previous psychiatric evaluation found him " in great need of psychiatric and psychotherapeutic efforts , " but concluded that there were no medical grounds to sentence him to psychiatric care .
painful recovery whichever way the sentence reads , the trial brings a sense of relief , a form of closure for sweden , said jennekvist .
bringing mijailovic to court will help heal national wounds surrounding the murder and the painful memories it evoked of the assassination of swedish prime minister olof palme in 1986 .
like lindh , palme was attacked while out in public without bodyguards .

the murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh plunged the country into a crisis last september .
now , with the confessed killer standing trial , swedes are hoping to draw a close to a dark moment in thier history . the man who admitted to killing lindh testified that voices in his head told him to stab the swedish minister repeatedly in the chest and arms .
" i couldn ’ t resist , " mijailo mijailovic confessed to the panel of judges in the packed stockholm courtroom on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mijailo mijailovic although he said he did indeed kill the widely popular anna lindh , the 25-year old swede of yugoslav origin denied it was for political reasons .
" i ’ m not interested in politics , " he told chief prosecutor krister petersson .
" i have nothing personal against anna lindh . "
mijailo ’ s lawyer , peter althin , has pushed for dropping the charges down to manslaughter rather than murder , arguing that his client had not planned the sept .
10 stabbing and that there was " no intent to kill . "
prosecutors , however , insist the attack was premeditated and argue that mijailovic stalked lindh for 14 minutes before stabbing her with a knife in a crowded department store .
given the killer ’ s confession and the prosecution ’ s overwhelming evidence , the court ’ s main task will be to determine whether mijailovic really intended to kill anna lindh or not .
why anna lindh ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the killer was caught on video tape in the department store when the prosecution asked whether he was specifically looking for lindh in the department store , mijailovic said he had been wandering aimlessly , without any reason .
" i just trotted around on different floors and visited all the departments , " he said .
he denied looking for anyone in particular .
he said he just saw lindh and voices in his head , including that of jesus , urged him to stab her - 10 times with a knife .
lindh died the next day in the hospital after doctors worked through the night to save her .
mijailovic , who was arrested sept .
24 , confessed last week , saying he wanted to end speculation about the motive , including media reports that he was upset over lindh ’ s support of the 1999 nato air strikes on serbia .
difficult search the death of one of the country ’ s best-loved politicians sent shock waves through sweden , and initially there were concerns that the murderer wouldn ’ t be found .
after a first suspect was detained and then quickly released without charge , public opinion against the police .
" we were under huge pressure to solve this murder , " said chief police investigator leif jennekvist .
" and we had to be careful to pass on the information in such a way that on the one had the public need for information would be satisfied , while on the other hand our work wouldn ’ t be hindered . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murder weapon it wasn ’ t until the end of september that mijailovic was arrested .
initially he denied the killing , however police managed to match his dna with that found at the murder scene and on the knife .
" only when we got the dna proof were we one hundred percent sure about the identity of the murder , " said jennekvist .
mijailovic , who has a history of mental problems and three previous convictions , including one for a 1996 stabbing of his father , could face a sentence of between 10 years and life in prison .
if found mentally unstable , he could also be sent to a mental hospital for mandatory treatment .
a previous psychiatric evaluation found him " in great need of psychiatric and psychotherapeutic efforts , " but concluded that there were no medical grounds to sentence him to psychiatric care .
painful recovery whichever way the sentence reads , the trial brings a sense of relief , a form of closure for sweden , said jennekvist .
bringing mijailovic to court will help heal national wounds surrounding the murder and the painful memories it evoked of the assassination of swedish prime minister olof palme in 1986 .

the european commission on tuesday decided to seek a court ruling to overturn finance ministers ’ suspension of eu budget rules for france and germany .
member states criticize the action , saying it ’ s a risky move . the eu executive , which is responsible for enforcing laws in the 15-member bloc , argued that taking finance ministers to court was vital to clarify disciplinary procedures for those who break the eu ’ s guidelines on deficit spending , as france and germany have done repeatedly .
but the unprecedented legal move is expected to generate a considerable amount of friction at a time when the eu is concerned about maintaining cohesion .
german finance minister hans eichel said the decision to go to the european court of justice was " hard to understand " and added that he saw no wrong doing in the finance minister ’ s nov .
25 decision to forego disciplinary action against berlin and paris for violating the stability pact .
the results of the ecofin -lrb- council of european finance ministers -rrb- meeting " correspond to the spirit and the letter of the stability and growth pact , " he said in a statement released on tuesday .
" the procedures that are foreseen -lrb- in the pact -rrb- were upheld . "
at the meeting , germany and france , europe ’ s two biggest economies , used their combined influence to convince ecofin to reject the commission ’ s recommendation to punish berlin and paris for running up excessive budget deficits by slapping them with steep fines and forcing them to make deeper deficit cuts in 2004 .
the commission is now seeking a ruling on whether the ministers violated procedure in taking an ad hoc decision against the eu executive branch .
brussels vs. brussels " not least with a view to the tasks the european union faces in the near future , it would be more helpful to aim for cooperation rather than confrontation , " eichel said in response to the commission ’ s legal challenge .
but eu monetary affairs commssioner pedro solbes , whose office oversees the stability pact , has argued that brussels has a duty to uphold the law and avoid a precedent that could legitimize rule-breaking in the future and ultimately undermine the eu treaty .
french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin acknowledged that it was the commission ’ s right to seek recourse in court , but insisted the finance minister ’ s decision was legal .
" i respect the decision of the commission , but i am not worried about the result , " he told reporters during a visit in brussels .
legal advisors to the member states in the eu council said the ministers had a discretionary power to overturn the commission ’ s recommendation and doubt the eu executive will come out a clear winner in court .
a house divided against itself the commission itself is divided over the decision to seek legal action .
the move is seen as a risky one , which could seriously undermine the authority of the executive branch if the eu ’ s top court rules the finance ministers ’ action legal .
solbes ' spokesman , gerassimos thomas , admitted there were possible risks involved in taking the case to court , but said " it had to be done , " and that it is the commission ’ s " role as guardian of the treaty to ensure that provisions are upheld . "
although nothing has been made public about internal discussion surrounding the commission ’ s action , thomas confirmed that tuesday ’ s decision had not been unanimous among the 20 commissioners .
sources in brussels say the french , german and british commissioners were against taking legal action .
it is also not certain whether the court of justice will agree to the commission ’ s request for a fast-track procedure that would lead to a decision in three to six months rather than the normal two years .
solbes , however , is convinced the risky legal move is the correct strategy for the commission .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.01.2004 taking a new look at mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mapping mars in 3-d and color .
a camera mounted on the mars express orbiter is expected to produce unprecedented images of the planet over the next years .
first images will be released next week .
dw-world took a look behind the scenes . berlin - ralf jaumann expects to feel a little edgy over the next two years .
the planetary geologist at the german aerospace center ’ s -lrb- dlr -rrb- institute for planetary research in berlin will be one of the first people to receive data collected by the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- .
“ every time we switch it on or off , i ’ m nervous , ” said jaumann , who will turn the data into raw images before sending the latter on for further analysis .
“ it will certainly become a matter of routine , but not completely . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf jaumann during a dw-tv interview .
last friday jaumann -lrb- photo -rrb- got another chance to jitter as the camera began searching for signs of the missing beagle 2 lander .
the robot probably crashed during touchdown on the martian surface . while beagle 2 was designed to conduct a small percentage of the mission ’ s ground experiments , focus is likely to shift now to the camera and other instruments mounted on the orbiter , such as marsis , a sub-surface sounding radar altimeter searching for water under the planet ’ s crust , or spicam , an ultraviolet and infrared spectrometer that will study the martian atmosphere . not all hope has been lost for finding the lander , however , and jaumann and his colleagues have been given a lot of data storage space on the orbiter to search for beagle 2 .
but neither he nor gerhard neukum , the hrsc project ’ s principal investigator at berlin ’ s free university , believe there ’ s much of a chance to discover the tiny robot . “ we haven ’ t seen beagle yet , ” neukum said on wednesday after looking through the first batch of “ outstanding ” data he ’ s received so far .
even though the probe has n't turned up , " these are the best data ever recorded , ” neukum said . while other missions , such as nasa ’ s global surveyor mission , have already produced high resolution images , the hrsc ’ s capability to produce colorful , three-dimensional pictures is a first , according to neukum .
“ we will be able to look at mars like we do with our eyes here on the surface of the earth , ” he said . in addition , an infrared image would allow scientists to determine the abundance of specific minerals on mars , neukum said .
he added that first images would be released to the public by jan .
20 . sending commands , receiving data while neukum and his team of 43 co-investigators will use the data to produce three-dimensional images and analyze them , jaumann and a group of 10 scientists will be testing and sending future commands to the camera and processing incoming data on a daily basis . the team does n't work in a big mission control center like the one in darmstadt , germany , where the mars express mission and the orbiter 's flight path is monitored .
tv crews are often disappointed when they come to visit his office in a non-descript building on the outskirts of the german capital , jaumann said .
“ years ago we had rooms with big computers , but now we get our data on machines like this one , ” he said , pointing to his apple powerbook . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a drawing of the hrsc camera .
to test commands , jaumann and his colleagues can work with an exact replica of the camera , which sits in a dlr laboratory .
several dozen screws have to be adjusted to find the perfect position .

a camera mounted on the mars express orbiter is expected to produce unprecedented images of the planet over the next years .

dw-world took a look behind the scenes . berlin - ralf jaumann expects to feel a little edgy over the next two years .
the planetary geologist at the german aerospace center ’ s -lrb- dlr -rrb- institute for planetary research in berlin will be one of the first people to receive data collected by the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- .
“ every time we switch it on or off , i ’ m nervous , ” said jaumann , who will turn the data into raw images before sending the latter on for further analysis .
“ it will certainly become a matter of routine , but not completely . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf jaumann during a dw-tv interview .
last friday jaumann -lrb- photo -rrb- got another chance to jitter as the camera began searching for signs of the missing beagle 2 lander .
the robot probably crashed during touchdown on the martian surface . while beagle 2 was designed to conduct a small percentage of the mission ’ s ground experiments , focus is likely to shift now to the camera and other instruments mounted on the orbiter , such as marsis , a sub-surface sounding radar altimeter searching for water under the planet ’ s crust , or spicam , an ultraviolet and infrared spectrometer that will study the martian atmosphere . not all hope has been lost for finding the lander , however , and jaumann and his colleagues have been given a lot of data storage space on the orbiter to search for beagle 2 .
but neither he nor gerhard neukum , the hrsc project ’ s principal investigator at berlin ’ s free university , believe there ’ s much of a chance to discover the tiny robot . “ we haven ’ t seen beagle yet , ” neukum said on wednesday after looking through the first batch of “ outstanding ” data he ’ s received so far .
even though the probe has n't turned up , " these are the best data ever recorded , ” neukum said . while other missions , such as nasa ’ s global surveyor mission , have already produced high resolution images , the hrsc ’ s capability to produce colorful , three-dimensional pictures is a first , according to neukum .
“ we will be able to look at mars like we do with our eyes here on the surface of the earth , ” he said . in addition , an infrared image would allow scientists to determine the abundance of specific minerals on mars , neukum said .
he added that first images would be released to the public by jan .

tv crews are often disappointed when they come to visit his office in a non-descript building on the outskirts of the german capital , jaumann said .

the european commission on tuesday decided to seek a court ruling to overturn finance ministers ’ suspension of eu budget rules for france and germany .
member states criticize the action , saying it ’ s a risky move . the eu executive , which is responsible for enforcing laws in the 15-member bloc , argued that taking finance ministers to court was vital to clarify disciplinary procedures for those who break the eu ’ s guidelines on deficit spending , as france and germany have done repeatedly .
but the unprecedented legal move is expected to generate a considerable amount of friction at a time when the eu is concerned about maintaining cohesion .
german finance minister hans eichel said the decision to go to the european court of justice was " hard to understand " and added that he saw no wrong doing in the finance minister ’ s nov .
25 decision to forego disciplinary action against berlin and paris for violating the stability pact .
the results of the ecofin -lrb- council of european finance ministers -rrb- meeting " correspond to the spirit and the letter of the stability and growth pact , " he said in a statement released on tuesday .
" the procedures that are foreseen -lrb- in the pact -rrb- were upheld . "
at the meeting , germany and france , europe ’ s two biggest economies , used their combined influence to convince ecofin to reject the commission ’ s recommendation to punish berlin and paris for running up excessive budget deficits by slapping them with steep fines and forcing them to make deeper deficit cuts in 2004 .
the commission is now seeking a ruling on whether the ministers violated procedure in taking an ad hoc decision against the eu executive branch .
brussels vs. brussels " not least with a view to the tasks the european union faces in the near future , it would be more helpful to aim for cooperation rather than confrontation , " eichel said in response to the commission ’ s legal challenge .
but eu monetary affairs commssioner pedro solbes , whose office oversees the stability pact , has argued that brussels has a duty to uphold the law and avoid a precedent that could legitimize rule-breaking in the future and ultimately undermine the eu treaty .
french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin acknowledged that it was the commission ’ s right to seek recourse in court , but insisted the finance minister ’ s decision was legal .
" i respect the decision of the commission , but i am not worried about the result , " he told reporters during a visit in brussels .
legal advisors to the member states in the eu council said the ministers had a discretionary power to overturn the commission ’ s recommendation and doubt the eu executive will come out a clear winner in court .
a house divided against itself the commission itself is divided over the decision to seek legal action .
the move is seen as a risky one , which could seriously undermine the authority of the executive branch if the eu ’ s top court rules the finance ministers ’ action legal .
solbes ' spokesman , gerassimos thomas , admitted there were possible risks involved in taking the case to court , but said " it had to be done , " and that it is the commission ’ s " role as guardian of the treaty to ensure that provisions are upheld . "
although nothing has been made public about internal discussion surrounding the commission ’ s action , thomas confirmed that tuesday ’ s decision had not been unanimous among the 20 commissioners .
sources in brussels say the french , german and british commissioners were against taking legal action .
it is also not certain whether the court of justice will agree to the commission ’ s request for a fast-track procedure that would lead to a decision in three to six months rather than the normal two years .
solbes , however , is convinced the risky legal move is the correct strategy for the commission .

the ratings of a new reality tv show in germany are climbing as minor celebrities are put through daily hair-raising ‘ challenges ’ in the australian jungle .
but as the tests get crueler , criticism is starting to grow . germany ’ s private television channel rtl has hit ratings pay dirt with its version of the british and american show “ i ’ m a celebrity get me out of here . ”
called “ ich bin ein star holt mich hier raus ” in german , the show has dropped ten b-list celebrities into a jungle in australia for 12 days . despite being inundated by reality tv in recent years , german viewers are flocking to the program , which forces one member of the group to undertake a stunt testing their courage each day in order to earn food for all .
but after a singer of questionable talent was forced to lie in a " cockroach coffin " with 30,000 of the wriggly creatures and an out-of-work tv host was pecked nearly to tears by a band of aggressive ostriches , media watchdogs and other groups are beginning to question the show ’ s lack of moral grounding . “ i ’ ve really been blown over .
these are methods that are reminiscent of torture tactics , ” jo groebel , the director of the european institute for the media in düsseldorf , told the associated press on wednesday . alarm bells for many went off when daniel küblböck , who become a celebrity as a performer in the german version of " pop idol , " suffered a panic attack after putting his head in a “ terror aquarium ” filled with eels and water spiders .

walter eykmann from a national catholic church group told the daily tabloid newspaper bild that rtl was putting “ profits and ratings ” above the participants well-being .

a camera mounted on the mars express orbiter is expected to produce unprecedented images of the planet over the next years .
first images will be released next week .
dw-world took a look behind the scenes . berlin - ralf jaumann expects to feel a little edgy over the next two years .
the planetary geologist at the german aerospace center ’ s -lrb- dlr -rrb- institute for planetary research in berlin will be one of the first people to receive data collected by the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- .
“ every time we switch it on or off , i ’ m nervous , ” said jaumann , who will turn the data into raw images before sending the latter on for further analysis .
“ it will certainly become a matter of routine , but not completely . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf jaumann during a dw-tv interview .
last friday jaumann -lrb- photo -rrb- got another chance to jitter as the camera began searching for signs of the missing beagle 2 lander .
the robot probably crashed during touchdown on the martian surface . while beagle 2 was designed to conduct a small percentage of the mission ’ s ground experiments , focus is likely to shift now to the camera and other instruments mounted on the orbiter , such as marsis , a sub-surface sounding radar altimeter searching for water under the planet ’ s crust , or spicam , an ultraviolet and infrared spectrometer that will study the martian atmosphere . not all hope has been lost for finding the lander , however , and jaumann and his colleagues have been given a lot of data storage space on the orbiter to search for beagle 2 .
but neither he nor gerhard neukum , the hrsc project ’ s principal investigator at berlin ’ s free university , believe there ’ s much of a chance to discover the tiny robot . “ we haven ’ t seen beagle yet , ” neukum said on wednesday after looking through the first batch of “ outstanding ” data he ’ s received so far .
even though the probe has n't turned up , " these are the best data ever recorded , ” neukum said . while other missions , such as nasa ’ s global surveyor mission , have already produced high resolution images , the hrsc ’ s capability to produce colorful , three-dimensional pictures is a first , according to neukum .
“ we will be able to look at mars like we do with our eyes here on the surface of the earth , ” he said . in addition , an infrared image would allow scientists to determine the abundance of specific minerals on mars , neukum said .
he added that first images would be released to the public by jan .
20 . sending commands , receiving data while neukum and his team of 43 co-investigators will use the data to produce three-dimensional images and analyze them , jaumann and a group of 10 scientists will be testing and sending future commands to the camera and processing incoming data on a daily basis . the team does n't work in a big mission control center like the one in darmstadt , germany , where the mars express mission and the orbiter 's flight path is monitored .
tv crews are often disappointed when they come to visit his office in a non-descript building on the outskirts of the german capital , jaumann said .
“ years ago we had rooms with big computers , but now we get our data on machines like this one , ” he said , pointing to his apple powerbook . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a drawing of the hrsc camera .
to test commands , jaumann and his colleagues can work with an exact replica of the camera , which sits in a dlr laboratory .
several dozen screws have to be adjusted to find the perfect position .
“ it ’ s nothing spectacular , ” he said , pointing to the 20 kg -lrb- 44 pound -rrb- instrument that ’ s mounted on a table .
“ but hopefully it will produce spectacular pictures . ” mapping mars like never before the hrsc project ’ s goal is to produce a three-dimensional , colorful map of the entire martian surface at a resolution that has never been achieved before . detailed images of the red planet ’ s polar caps or volcanic regions will be even more interesting for scientists working on the project , however .
“ it ’ s more interesting to do fewer things in great detail rather than to do everything at a resolution that we have done with other missions , ” said wojciech markiewicz , a planetary scientist at the max planck institute for aeronomy in katlenburg-lindau in central germany . the camera ’ s images will allow scientists to locate rocks as small as two meters -lrb- 6.5 feet -rrb- , according to jaumann , who added that he expects the project to answer the question whether it ever rained on mars . putting the camera to work on earth the hrsc technology is not only useful for gaining a greater understanding of mars , however : a modified version of the camera has already mapped regions on earth .
many possibilities exist to put the instrument to commercial use , jaumann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insurance companies could use the camera to assess damage after a flood like the one in saxony in 2002 .
telecommunication companies could use the images to pinpoint the best locations for their antennae , cities could take inventory of things such as street signs , park benches and trees by looking at the pictures , jaumann said .
insurance companies could assess damage caused by floods immediately , hence preventing fraudulent claims later on .
even the european union could monitor fields of farmers who receive subsidies for not planting anything on their land . but others , who work in the commercial sector , will have to look into these options , jaumann said , adding that data from the hrsc will keep scientists busy for years to come .
“ we ’ re still working with apollo and viking data today , ” he said , referring to missions that ended decades ago . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mapping mars berlin-based planetary scientist gerhard neukum recently talked to dw-world about his plans to produce a three-dimensional map of mars with a camera mounted on european space agency ’ s mars express .

“ we will be able to look at mars like we do with our eyes here on the surface of the earth , ” he said . in addition , an infrared image would allow scientists to determine the abundance of specific minerals on mars , neukum said .

but neither he nor gerhard neukum , the hrsc project ’ s principal investigator at berlin ’ s free university , believe there ’ s much of a chance to discover the tiny robot . “ we haven ’ t seen beagle yet , ” neukum said on wednesday after looking through the first batch of “ outstanding ” data he ’ s received so far .
even though the probe has n't turned up , " these are the best data ever recorded , ” neukum said . while other missions , such as nasa ’ s global surveyor mission , have already produced high resolution images , the hrsc ’ s capability to produce colorful , three-dimensional pictures is a first , according to neukum .
“ we will be able to look at mars like we do with our eyes here on the surface of the earth , ” he said . in addition , an infrared image would allow scientists to determine the abundance of specific minerals on mars , neukum said .
he added that first images would be released to the public by jan .
20 . sending commands , receiving data while neukum and his team of 43 co-investigators will use the data to produce three-dimensional images and analyze them , jaumann and a group of 10 scientists will be testing and sending future commands to the camera and processing incoming data on a daily basis . the team does n't work in a big mission control center like the one in darmstadt , germany , where the mars express mission and the orbiter 's flight path is monitored .
tv crews are often disappointed when they come to visit his office in a non-descript building on the outskirts of the german capital , jaumann said .
“ years ago we had rooms with big computers , but now we get our data on machines like this one , ” he said , pointing to his apple powerbook . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a drawing of the hrsc camera .
to test commands , jaumann and his colleagues can work with an exact replica of the camera , which sits in a dlr laboratory .
several dozen screws have to be adjusted to find the perfect position .
“ it ’ s nothing spectacular , ” he said , pointing to the 20 kg -lrb- 44 pound -rrb- instrument that ’ s mounted on a table .
“ but hopefully it will produce spectacular pictures . ” mapping mars like never before the hrsc project ’ s goal is to produce a three-dimensional , colorful map of the entire martian surface at a resolution that has never been achieved before . detailed images of the red planet ’ s polar caps or volcanic regions will be even more interesting for scientists working on the project , however .
“ it ’ s more interesting to do fewer things in great detail rather than to do everything at a resolution that we have done with other missions , ” said wojciech markiewicz , a planetary scientist at the max planck institute for aeronomy in katlenburg-lindau in central germany . the camera ’ s images will allow scientists to locate rocks as small as two meters -lrb- 6.5 feet -rrb- , according to jaumann , who added that he expects the project to answer the question whether it ever rained on mars . putting the camera to work on earth the hrsc technology is not only useful for gaining a greater understanding of mars , however : a modified version of the camera has already mapped regions on earth .
many possibilities exist to put the instrument to commercial use , jaumann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insurance companies could use the camera to assess damage after a flood like the one in saxony in 2002 .
telecommunication companies could use the images to pinpoint the best locations for their antennae , cities could take inventory of things such as street signs , park benches and trees by looking at the pictures , jaumann said .
insurance companies could assess damage caused by floods immediately , hence preventing fraudulent claims later on .
even the european union could monitor fields of farmers who receive subsidies for not planting anything on their land . but others , who work in the commercial sector , will have to look into these options , jaumann said , adding that data from the hrsc will keep scientists busy for years to come .
“ we ’ re still working with apollo and viking data today , ” he said , referring to missions that ended decades ago . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mapping mars berlin-based planetary scientist gerhard neukum recently talked to dw-world about his plans to produce a three-dimensional map of mars with a camera mounted on european space agency ’ s mars express .

defense minister peter struck 's announcement that some € 26 billion will be cut from the bundeswehr 's spending plans will hit the german arms industry hard . bundeswehr generals will be rewriting their wish lists after peter struck outlined his plans to reduce military spending on tuesday .
several missile projects are now set to be scrapped , and overall , the new budget constraints mean ever fewer contracts for arms manufacturers .
although the government says it will be sticking to procurement contracts already signed , such as orders for 180 eurofighter combat aircraft , the tiger combat helicopter and nh90 transport helicopter , projects such as upgrading the patriot missile defense systems and plans to buy a pilotless reconnaissance drone for the navy , will likely now be shelved .
a blow to industrial growth the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- fears the defense ministry 's move will have negative repercussions on the country 's industrial growth .
helmut harff , director of the bdi 's defense industries committee , says germany 's role within the european arms industry will now be severely reduced .
in an interview with deutsche welle , he said that " peter struck 's plans did n't come as a surprise to the defense industry , but it received very little information in advance . "
harff pointed out that " one needs to bear in mind that via the defense ministry , the government is the arms industry 's primary client , and for this section of the industry , the announced cuts mean major changes to existing business plans . "
a missed opportunity experts said the trend towards international mergers and alliances is now set to increase as a result of the defense cutbacks . harff , who served as first commander of the german troops in kosovo , predicted that germany may end up fast selling off its state-of-the-art technology .
although arms make up a very small share of germany 's total exports , he argued that the new cuts might mean germany could miss out on the opportunity to continue selling high-tech products on international markets .
" overall , exports of german munitions last year amounted to just 0.06 percent of germany 's total exports , which is very low , " said harff , before adding that " it 's important to maintain the technological means for manufacturing these munitions so that the country remains a player on the world market . "
a muted reaction so far , there 's been a muted reaction from business .
europe 's leading supplier of land forces systems , rheinmetall has welcomed the defense minister 's proposals because the company can now factor the cuts into its own planning security . but another company , kraus-maffei wegmann , a system vendor in the area of armored vehicles , has announced it does n't expect to be affected by the cuts .
germany 's arms industry may not have been given due warning of struck 's drastic agenda , but many companies are well-prepared nonetheless , having already introduced their own austerity measures some time ago and opted for new business strategies .
the same day the government revealed its plans , for example , european missile system manufacturer diehl announced it would be setting up a joint venture with american rival company raytheon to market a special sidewinder guided missile .
adhering to international agreements although the arms industry appears rather unruffled by the imminent cuts , harff pointed out that , in germany , the defense budget is a uniquely thorny issue .
he said he believes the key issue here is not so much arms spending , but rather security provisions for the future .
in that respect , he said , germany is is not sticking to international agreements .
" nato wants to see 2.3 percent of gross domestic product spent on security provisions , and in germany only 1.5 percent is being spent , " he observed .

italy ’ s highest court on tuesday annulled a controversial legal immunity law that had shielded top officials from prosecution while in office .
prime minister silvio berlusconi could now once again face bribery charges . the law , which was passed last june , gave the country ’ s five highest officials immunity , but it has been criticized as existing solely to end berlusconi ’ s numerous legal headaches .
dubbed “ lex berlusconi ” by some , it helped the prime minister avoid possible conviction while italy held the rotating eu presidency last autumn . since the court has determined that the law is unconstitutional , berlusconi will once again face trial for allegedly bribing judges in the 1980s while he was a business man .
the trial had been stopped after the law went into effect . “ every man is the same before the law , ” antonio di pietro , an opposition member of parliament and former crusading prosecutor , told the associated press after the legislation was annulled . but berlusconi ’ s justice minister roberto castelli criticized the verdict , saying it could complicate relations between politicians and the judiciary .
“ i fear after this verdict the polemics will become even worse , ” he said . early elections ? berlusconi has repeatedly contended that he has done no wrong and left-wing magistrates have mounted an unfounded campaign against him .
in the face of a possible onslaught of politically motivated legal action against him , berlusconi is reportedly considering calling early elections . “ if that ’ s how things stand , then it ’ s better to go back to the polls , ” he told the daily newspaper corriere della sera . " the teflon premier " a billionaire media mogul turned politician , berlusconi has gone to court eight times over the past decade for varying corruption offenses .
he has been found guilty several times , however , by winning on appeal or due to the statute of limitations nothing has stuck to the " teflon premier . " though the latest case against berlusconi was stopped this summer after the immunity law was passed , the trial against his business associated continued .
a key charge that a firm owned by berlusconi bribed judges to win approval of a corporate takeover in the 1980s was rejected , but a court did convict berlusconi friend and lawyer cesare previti of paying off a rome judge .

the murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh plunged the country into a crisis last september .
now , with the confessed killer standing trial , swedes are hoping to draw a close to a dark moment in thier history . the man who admitted to killing lindh testified that voices in his head told him to stab the swedish minister repeatedly in the chest and arms .
" i couldn ’ t resist , " mijailo mijailovic confessed to the panel of judges in the packed stockholm courtroom on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mijailo mijailovic although he said he did indeed kill the widely popular anna lindh , the 25-year old swede of yugoslav origin denied it was for political reasons .
" i ’ m not interested in politics , " he told chief prosecutor krister petersson .
" i have nothing personal against anna lindh . "
mijailo ’ s lawyer , peter althin , has pushed for dropping the charges down to manslaughter rather than murder , arguing that his client had not planned the sept .
10 stabbing and that there was " no intent to kill . "
prosecutors , however , insist the attack was premeditated and argue that mijailovic stalked lindh for 14 minutes before stabbing her with a knife in a crowded department store .
given the killer ’ s confession and the prosecution ’ s overwhelming evidence , the court ’ s main task will be to determine whether mijailovic really intended to kill anna lindh or not .
why anna lindh ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the killer was caught on video tape in the department store when the prosecution asked whether he was specifically looking for lindh in the department store , mijailovic said he had been wandering aimlessly , without any reason .
" i just trotted around on different floors and visited all the departments , " he said .
he denied looking for anyone in particular .
he said he just saw lindh and voices in his head , including that of jesus , urged him to stab her - 10 times with a knife .
lindh died the next day in the hospital after doctors worked through the night to save her .
mijailovic , who was arrested sept .
24 , confessed last week , saying he wanted to end speculation about the motive , including media reports that he was upset over lindh ’ s support of the 1999 nato air strikes on serbia .
difficult search the death of one of the country ’ s best-loved politicians sent shock waves through sweden , and initially there were concerns that the murderer wouldn ’ t be found .
after a first suspect was detained and then quickly released without charge , public opinion against the police .
" we were under huge pressure to solve this murder , " said chief police investigator leif jennekvist .
" and we had to be careful to pass on the information in such a way that on the one had the public need for information would be satisfied , while on the other hand our work wouldn ’ t be hindered . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murder weapon it wasn ’ t until the end of september that mijailovic was arrested .
initially he denied the killing , however police managed to match his dna with that found at the murder scene and on the knife .
" only when we got the dna proof were we one hundred percent sure about the identity of the murder , " said jennekvist .
mijailovic , who has a history of mental problems and three previous convictions , including one for a 1996 stabbing of his father , could face a sentence of between 10 years and life in prison .
if found mentally unstable , he could also be sent to a mental hospital for mandatory treatment .
a previous psychiatric evaluation found him " in great need of psychiatric and psychotherapeutic efforts , " but concluded that there were no medical grounds to sentence him to psychiatric care .
painful recovery whichever way the sentence reads , the trial brings a sense of relief , a form of closure for sweden , said jennekvist .
bringing mijailovic to court will help heal national wounds surrounding the murder and the painful memories it evoked of the assassination of swedish prime minister olof palme in 1986 .
like lindh , palme was attacked while out in public without bodyguards .
to this day his murderers have not been found . anja von cysewski -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspect confesses in lindh killing the man suspected of killing swedish foreign minister anna lindh in a brutal stabbing incident last year has confessed to the crime , a prosecutor said wednesday .

germany 's railway celebrates a decade as a private company on wednesday .
the deutsche bahn chairman hopes it will be ready to go public in 2005 - but meanwhile , it continues accruing debt . just days after opening , berlin 's newest five-star hotel , the ritz-carlton , is warming up for a bash in honor of the 10th anniversary of germany 's state railway system going private . its host , deutsche bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn , predictably lauds the reform as " a huge success . " " after -lrb- the fall of the berlin wall -rrb- we had two train companies that were on their last legs economically , " mehdorn told the newspaper die welt on the eve of the celebration .
" we know we 're not done , but what this company and its employees have done is unparalleled . " but that has n't put a stop to harsh criticism of db from politicians , economists and passengers . a mountain of debt the trip to where the bahn stands today has been a long one .
based on the recommendations of a government-appointed commission in late 1991 , parliament decided it was time to reform the railway - and it promptly began amending around 130 laws to change its status . in january 1994 , the west and east german railway companies were merged into a stock corporation called deutsche bahn , with the federal government retaining full ownership . by that time , west germany 's railway alone had amassed € 34 billion -lrb- $ 43.5 billion -rrb- in debt .
its enormous losses - € 7.9 billion during its last year as a state agency - were paid for by taxpayers . germany could afford either the national train system or the army but not both , former chancellor helmut schmidt was quoted as saying at the time . but the government nonetheless assumed the mountain of debt , giving db a fresh start . since then , the government has taken a less hands-on approach to deutsche bahn . db , after all , became a private company that was expected to generate a profit .
while politicians no longer dictate the bahn 's day-to-day actions , the government does have a say in strategic decisions through infrastructural funding and members on the company 's supervisory board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn " the numbers speak for themselves , " mehdorn told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" we have saved german taxpayers around € 108 billion -lrb- since 1994 -rrb- , more than € 44 billion more than what independent experts forecasted at the time " for what the government would save if it made deutsche bahn an independent , self-sufficient company .
but mehdorn 's calculations are based on the assumption that the catastrophic pre-reform situation would have continued without change . no more clean slate mehdorn , deutsche bahn ceo since 1999 , can brag that db does n't pocket subsidies to cover its operating costs .
but it still receives around € 10 billion annually from federal and state sources to pay for commuter traffic and infrastructure development . and it 's incurring debts again .
in the first half of 2003 , operating loss after interest stood at € 143 million .
that was down from € 235 million a year earlier - and mehdorn has said he plans to get the company back into the black in 2004 . those plans precede tuesday 's news that mehdorn and co. are considering cost-cutting measures , including abandoning costly refurbishment and expansion plans for 2004 . for example , the long-awaited high-speed rail line between erfurt and nuremburg that would reduce total travel time between berlin and munich but would cost up to € 244 million to build could become the first victim of the cuts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worse yet , db appears to be one of the businesses german consumers most love to hate , along with deutsche post and deutsche telekom , which were also privatized in the 1990s .
last year , db introduced fare reforms that drew so many complaints that the railway gave in after about half a year and reinstated the old fare structure . the company 's byzantine new fare system - modeled after the airlines , with discounts for advance purchases but maximum fares for those purchased at the time of journey - remains not only confusing but often significantly more expensive than other forms of transportation .
indeed , a recent report claimed that as many as 25 percent of the flights by budget airlines within germany , like germanwings or hapag lloyd express , are taking customers away from deutsche bahn with lower prices and faster travel times . db announced drastic cuts in service personnel in late 2003 , including the closure of ticket counters that has led to longer lines at ticket and information counters .
only 85 percent of the trains are on time , which db defines as being no more than five minutes late - well below the company 's stated goal of 95 percent . going public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late trains abound but mehdorn , known for claiming that passenger lobbyists are whiners and even seeking to take legal action against them , is apparently not entirely oblivious to customers ' irritations .
" we have to get better at punctuality and information for our customers when there are irregularities , " he told die welt .
this is of special concern , since mehdorn has made it clear that he 's trying to get db in shape for an initial public offering by 2005 . he has his work cut out for him .
besides improving db 's image among passengers , mehdorn is faced with stiff competition from budget airlines in the passenger division and from trucking firms in the cargo field .
db 's cargo transport has been hit especially hard , with its market share dropping from 21 to 15.6 percent between 1990 and 2002 . it 's also hindered by its lack of punctuality and weak rail infrastructures in eastern europe . the company has also seen significant drops in its passenger traffic .
in a recent report , the european commission stated that since 1995 passenger rail traffic across europe rose 12 percent .
in germany , however , it fell by 7.6 percent - a sharp contrast to the 30 percent growth experienced in france . ten years after privatization the consensus seems to be that reforming the railways was the right thing to do .

last year , db introduced fare reforms that drew so many complaints that the railway gave in after about half a year and reinstated the old fare structure . the company 's byzantine new fare system - modeled after the airlines , with discounts for advance purchases but maximum fares for those purchased at the time of journey - remains not only confusing but often significantly more expensive than other forms of transportation .
indeed , a recent report claimed that as many as 25 percent of the flights by budget airlines within germany , like germanwings or hapag lloyd express , are taking customers away from deutsche bahn with lower prices and faster travel times . db announced drastic cuts in service personnel in late 2003 , including the closure of ticket counters that has led to longer lines at ticket and information counters .
only 85 percent of the trains are on time , which db defines as being no more than five minutes late - well below the company 's stated goal of 95 percent . going public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late trains abound but mehdorn , known for claiming that passenger lobbyists are whiners and even seeking to take legal action against them , is apparently not entirely oblivious to customers ' irritations .
" we have to get better at punctuality and information for our customers when there are irregularities , " he told die welt .
this is of special concern , since mehdorn has made it clear that he 's trying to get db in shape for an initial public offering by 2005 . he has his work cut out for him .
besides improving db 's image among passengers , mehdorn is faced with stiff competition from budget airlines in the passenger division and from trucking firms in the cargo field .
db 's cargo transport has been hit especially hard , with its market share dropping from 21 to 15.6 percent between 1990 and 2002 . it 's also hindered by its lack of punctuality and weak rail infrastructures in eastern europe . the company has also seen significant drops in its passenger traffic .
in a recent report , the european commission stated that since 1995 passenger rail traffic across europe rose 12 percent .
in germany , however , it fell by 7.6 percent - a sharp contrast to the 30 percent growth experienced in france . ten years after privatization the consensus seems to be that reforming the railways was the right thing to do .

the murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh plunged the country into a crisis last september .
now , with the confessed killer standing trial , swedes are hoping to draw a close to a dark moment in thier history . the man who admitted to killing lindh testified that voices in his head told him to stab the swedish minister repeatedly in the chest and arms .
" i couldn ’ t resist , " mijailo mijailovic confessed to the panel of judges in the packed stockholm courtroom on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mijailo mijailovic although he said he did indeed kill the widely popular anna lindh , the 25-year old swede of yugoslav origin denied it was for political reasons .
" i ’ m not interested in politics , " he told chief prosecutor krister petersson .
" i have nothing personal against anna lindh . "
mijailo ’ s lawyer , peter althin , has pushed for dropping the charges down to manslaughter rather than murder , arguing that his client had not planned the sept .
10 stabbing and that there was " no intent to kill . "
prosecutors , however , insist the attack was premeditated and argue that mijailovic stalked lindh for 14 minutes before stabbing her with a knife in a crowded department store .
given the killer ’ s confession and the prosecution ’ s overwhelming evidence , the court ’ s main task will be to determine whether mijailovic really intended to kill anna lindh or not .
why anna lindh ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the killer was caught on video tape in the department store when the prosecution asked whether he was specifically looking for lindh in the department store , mijailovic said he had been wandering aimlessly , without any reason .
" i just trotted around on different floors and visited all the departments , " he said .
he denied looking for anyone in particular .
he said he just saw lindh and voices in his head , including that of jesus , urged him to stab her - 10 times with a knife .
lindh died the next day in the hospital after doctors worked through the night to save her .
mijailovic , who was arrested sept .
24 , confessed last week , saying he wanted to end speculation about the motive , including media reports that he was upset over lindh ’ s support of the 1999 nato air strikes on serbia .
difficult search the death of one of the country ’ s best-loved politicians sent shock waves through sweden , and initially there were concerns that the murderer wouldn ’ t be found .
after a first suspect was detained and then quickly released without charge , public opinion against the police .
" we were under huge pressure to solve this murder , " said chief police investigator leif jennekvist .
" and we had to be careful to pass on the information in such a way that on the one had the public need for information would be satisfied , while on the other hand our work wouldn ’ t be hindered . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murder weapon it wasn ’ t until the end of september that mijailovic was arrested .
initially he denied the killing , however police managed to match his dna with that found at the murder scene and on the knife .
" only when we got the dna proof were we one hundred percent sure about the identity of the murder , " said jennekvist .
mijailovic , who has a history of mental problems and three previous convictions , including one for a 1996 stabbing of his father , could face a sentence of between 10 years and life in prison .
if found mentally unstable , he could also be sent to a mental hospital for mandatory treatment .
a previous psychiatric evaluation found him " in great need of psychiatric and psychotherapeutic efforts , " but concluded that there were no medical grounds to sentence him to psychiatric care .
painful recovery whichever way the sentence reads , the trial brings a sense of relief , a form of closure for sweden , said jennekvist .
bringing mijailovic to court will help heal national wounds surrounding the murder and the painful memories it evoked of the assassination of swedish prime minister olof palme in 1986 .
like lindh , palme was attacked while out in public without bodyguards .
to this day his murderers have not been found . anja von cysewski -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspect confesses in lindh killing the man suspected of killing swedish foreign minister anna lindh in a brutal stabbing incident last year has confessed to the crime , a prosecutor said wednesday .

germany 's railway celebrates a decade as a private company on wednesday .
the deutsche bahn chairman hopes it will be ready to go public in 2005 - but meanwhile , it continues accruing debt . just days after opening , berlin 's newest five-star hotel , the ritz-carlton , is warming up for a bash in honor of the 10th anniversary of germany 's state railway system going private . its host , deutsche bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn , predictably lauds the reform as " a huge success . " " after -lrb- the fall of the berlin wall -rrb- we had two train companies that were on their last legs economically , " mehdorn told the newspaper die welt on the eve of the celebration .
" we know we 're not done , but what this company and its employees have done is unparalleled . " but that has n't put a stop to harsh criticism of db from politicians , economists and passengers . a mountain of debt the trip to where the bahn stands today has been a long one .
based on the recommendations of a government-appointed commission in late 1991 , parliament decided it was time to reform the railway - and it promptly began amending around 130 laws to change its status . in january 1994 , the west and east german railway companies were merged into a stock corporation called deutsche bahn , with the federal government retaining full ownership . by that time , west germany 's railway alone had amassed € 34 billion -lrb- $ 43.5 billion -rrb- in debt .
its enormous losses - € 7.9 billion during its last year as a state agency - were paid for by taxpayers . germany could afford either the national train system or the army but not both , former chancellor helmut schmidt was quoted as saying at the time . but the government nonetheless assumed the mountain of debt , giving db a fresh start . since then , the government has taken a less hands-on approach to deutsche bahn . db , after all , became a private company that was expected to generate a profit .
while politicians no longer dictate the bahn 's day-to-day actions , the government does have a say in strategic decisions through infrastructural funding and members on the company 's supervisory board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn " the numbers speak for themselves , " mehdorn told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" we have saved german taxpayers around € 108 billion -lrb- since 1994 -rrb- , more than € 44 billion more than what independent experts forecasted at the time " for what the government would save if it made deutsche bahn an independent , self-sufficient company .
but mehdorn 's calculations are based on the assumption that the catastrophic pre-reform situation would have continued without change . no more clean slate mehdorn , deutsche bahn ceo since 1999 , can brag that db does n't pocket subsidies to cover its operating costs .
but it still receives around € 10 billion annually from federal and state sources to pay for commuter traffic and infrastructure development . and it 's incurring debts again .
in the first half of 2003 , operating loss after interest stood at € 143 million .
that was down from € 235 million a year earlier - and mehdorn has said he plans to get the company back into the black in 2004 . those plans precede tuesday 's news that mehdorn and co. are considering cost-cutting measures , including abandoning costly refurbishment and expansion plans for 2004 . for example , the long-awaited high-speed rail line between erfurt and nuremburg that would reduce total travel time between berlin and munich but would cost up to € 244 million to build could become the first victim of the cuts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worse yet , db appears to be one of the businesses german consumers most love to hate , along with deutsche post and deutsche telekom , which were also privatized in the 1990s .

now the irish prime minister bertie ahern has set out his intentions before the european parliament in strasbourg . the irish premier left his audience in no doubt about his top priority over the next six months .
he promised to pick the failed talks on an eu constitution off the floor and do all he could to elicit a final agreement .
" i pledge to you that the irish presidency will spare no effort to make progress and to facilitate consensus during our term in office .
the issue will command the highest priority under our presidency , " he told parliament .
ahern was also at pains to point out that time is of the essence if the european union wishes to keep its reputation in tact .
" excessive delay will damage our credibility and weaken our standing .
stalemate is not an option any of us can contemplate , " he said .
ahern said he planned to hold intensive talks with the heads of state and government ahead of the next eu summit in march , in order to come up with a possible solution to the sticking point of voting weights .
" i can assure the parliament that if my consultations suggest that there is a real prospect of agreement i will immediately move to seize the opportunity , " he said .
the talks last december , which should have been the crowning glory of italy 's six months in the eu presidential hot seat , ground to a halt when spain and poland refused to give up powerful voting rights established in the earlier nice treaty . something to celebrate a further high point during the irish presidency will be the addition of the ten new member states on may 1st .

he is also hoping to see progress in the unification of the divided mediterranean island of cyprus .
as it stands , only the greek southern part will join the eu in may , but ahern also praised turkey 's attempts to close the gap between itself and europe .
a rallying call looking beyond europe 's borders , ahern called on the eu member states to do more in the fight against poverty and aids in africa .
he said it was crucial for developing nations that they resume talks with the world trade organization .
several members of the european parliament called on ahern to push forward his initiative on debt relief for the poorest countries in the world .
ireland wants to stimulate economic development in europe and has pledged to work towards the goal of making it the most innovative economic power in the world by the end of the decade .
ahern believes in increasing competitiveness in the union , and he voiced his support for the latest eu commission initiative to completely do away with restraints on service sector competition for professions such as doctors , lawyers , architects and pharmacists .
he told parliament that europe had to be as competitive as possible and that the greatest challenge is the desperate need for more and better employment .
ahern , who likes to go by the gallic name of taoiseach - meaning prime minister - will be turning his own attention to matters of employment over the coming months .

now the irish prime minister bertie ahern has set out his intentions before the european parliament in strasbourg . the irish premier left his audience in no doubt about his top priority over the next six months .
he promised to pick the failed talks on an eu constitution off the floor and do all he could to elicit a final agreement .
" i pledge to you that the irish presidency will spare no effort to make progress and to facilitate consensus during our term in office .
the issue will command the highest priority under our presidency , " he told parliament .
ahern was also at pains to point out that time is of the essence if the european union wishes to keep its reputation in tact .
" excessive delay will damage our credibility and weaken our standing .
stalemate is not an option any of us can contemplate , " he said .
ahern said he planned to hold intensive talks with the heads of state and government ahead of the next eu summit in march , in order to come up with a possible solution to the sticking point of voting weights .
" i can assure the parliament that if my consultations suggest that there is a real prospect of agreement i will immediately move to seize the opportunity , " he said .
the talks last december , which should have been the crowning glory of italy 's six months in the eu presidential hot seat , ground to a halt when spain and poland refused to give up powerful voting rights established in the earlier nice treaty . something to celebrate a further high point during the irish presidency will be the addition of the ten new member states on may 1st .
and to mark the occasion , the irish government is planning to invite them all to dublin for a party .
as far as ahern is concerned , it is a moment in history which is well worth a celebration .
he told parliament that the founding fathers of a unified europe had dreamed of a time when europeans would never again kill each other in the name of natural resources , land or beliefs .
and with ten new states poised to join the bloc , the irish prime minister said that 2004 was a year in which europe was moving closer to making those dreams come true . with the constitution talks and eu expansion , the new president has a fat agenda for the next half a year , but looking beyond his six-month stint , he is confident that membership talks for romania and bulgaria will be concluded this year .
he is also hoping to see progress in the unification of the divided mediterranean island of cyprus .
as it stands , only the greek southern part will join the eu in may , but ahern also praised turkey 's attempts to close the gap between itself and europe .
a rallying call looking beyond europe 's borders , ahern called on the eu member states to do more in the fight against poverty and aids in africa .
he said it was crucial for developing nations that they resume talks with the world trade organization .
several members of the european parliament called on ahern to push forward his initiative on debt relief for the poorest countries in the world .
ireland wants to stimulate economic development in europe and has pledged to work towards the goal of making it the most innovative economic power in the world by the end of the decade .
ahern believes in increasing competitiveness in the union , and he voiced his support for the latest eu commission initiative to completely do away with restraints on service sector competition for professions such as doctors , lawyers , architects and pharmacists .
he told parliament that europe had to be as competitive as possible and that the greatest challenge is the desperate need for more and better employment .
ahern , who likes to go by the gallic name of taoiseach - meaning prime minister - will be turning his own attention to matters of employment over the coming months .

the murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh plunged the country into a crisis last september .
now , with the confessed killer standing trial , swedes are hoping to draw a close to a dark moment in thier history . the man who admitted to killing lindh testified that voices in his head told him to stab the swedish minister repeatedly in the chest and arms .
" i couldn ’ t resist , " mijailo mijailovic confessed to the panel of judges in the packed stockholm courtroom on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mijailo mijailovic although he said he did indeed kill the widely popular anna lindh , the 25-year old swede of yugoslav origin denied it was for political reasons .
" i ’ m not interested in politics , " he told chief prosecutor krister petersson .
" i have nothing personal against anna lindh . "
mijailo ’ s lawyer , peter althin , has pushed for dropping the charges down to manslaughter rather than murder , arguing that his client had not planned the sept .
10 stabbing and that there was " no intent to kill . "
prosecutors , however , insist the attack was premeditated and argue that mijailovic stalked lindh for 14 minutes before stabbing her with a knife in a crowded department store .
given the killer ’ s confession and the prosecution ’ s overwhelming evidence , the court ’ s main task will be to determine whether mijailovic really intended to kill anna lindh or not .
why anna lindh ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the killer was caught on video tape in the department store when the prosecution asked whether he was specifically looking for lindh in the department store , mijailovic said he had been wandering aimlessly , without any reason .
" i just trotted around on different floors and visited all the departments , " he said .
he denied looking for anyone in particular .
he said he just saw lindh and voices in his head , including that of jesus , urged him to stab her - 10 times with a knife .
lindh died the next day in the hospital after doctors worked through the night to save her .
mijailovic , who was arrested sept .
24 , confessed last week , saying he wanted to end speculation about the motive , including media reports that he was upset over lindh ’ s support of the 1999 nato air strikes on serbia .
difficult search the death of one of the country ’ s best-loved politicians sent shock waves through sweden , and initially there were concerns that the murderer wouldn ’ t be found .
after a first suspect was detained and then quickly released without charge , public opinion against the police .
" we were under huge pressure to solve this murder , " said chief police investigator leif jennekvist .
" and we had to be careful to pass on the information in such a way that on the one had the public need for information would be satisfied , while on the other hand our work wouldn ’ t be hindered . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murder weapon it wasn ’ t until the end of september that mijailovic was arrested .
initially he denied the killing , however police managed to match his dna with that found at the murder scene and on the knife .
" only when we got the dna proof were we one hundred percent sure about the identity of the murder , " said jennekvist .
mijailovic , who has a history of mental problems and three previous convictions , including one for a 1996 stabbing of his father , could face a sentence of between 10 years and life in prison .
if found mentally unstable , he could also be sent to a mental hospital for mandatory treatment .
a previous psychiatric evaluation found him " in great need of psychiatric and psychotherapeutic efforts , " but concluded that there were no medical grounds to sentence him to psychiatric care .
painful recovery whichever way the sentence reads , the trial brings a sense of relief , a form of closure for sweden , said jennekvist .
bringing mijailovic to court will help heal national wounds surrounding the murder and the painful memories it evoked of the assassination of swedish prime minister olof palme in 1986 .

lindh died the next day in the hospital after doctors worked through the night to save her .

" we were under huge pressure to solve this murder , " said chief police investigator leif jennekvist .
" and we had to be careful to pass on the information in such a way that on the one had the public need for information would be satisfied , while on the other hand our work wouldn ’ t be hindered . "

initially he denied the killing , however police managed to match his dna with that found at the murder scene and on the knife .
" only when we got the dna proof were we one hundred percent sure about the identity of the murder , " said jennekvist .
mijailovic , who has a history of mental problems and three previous convictions , including one for a 1996 stabbing of his father , could face a sentence of between 10 years and life in prison .
if found mentally unstable , he could also be sent to a mental hospital for mandatory treatment .
a previous psychiatric evaluation found him " in great need of psychiatric and psychotherapeutic efforts , " but concluded that there were no medical grounds to sentence him to psychiatric care .
painful recovery whichever way the sentence reads , the trial brings a sense of relief , a form of closure for sweden , said jennekvist .
bringing mijailovic to court will help heal national wounds surrounding the murder and the painful memories it evoked of the assassination of swedish prime minister olof palme in 1986 .

now the irish prime minister bertie ahern has set out his intentions before the european parliament in strasbourg . the irish premier left his audience in no doubt about his top priority over the next six months .
he promised to pick the failed talks on an eu constitution off the floor and do all he could to elicit a final agreement .
" i pledge to you that the irish presidency will spare no effort to make progress and to facilitate consensus during our term in office .
the issue will command the highest priority under our presidency , " he told parliament .
ahern was also at pains to point out that time is of the essence if the european union wishes to keep its reputation in tact .
" excessive delay will damage our credibility and weaken our standing .
stalemate is not an option any of us can contemplate , " he said .
ahern said he planned to hold intensive talks with the heads of state and government ahead of the next eu summit in march , in order to come up with a possible solution to the sticking point of voting weights .
" i can assure the parliament that if my consultations suggest that there is a real prospect of agreement i will immediately move to seize the opportunity , " he said .
the talks last december , which should have been the crowning glory of italy 's six months in the eu presidential hot seat , ground to a halt when spain and poland refused to give up powerful voting rights established in the earlier nice treaty . something to celebrate a further high point during the irish presidency will be the addition of the ten new member states on may 1st .
and to mark the occasion , the irish government is planning to invite them all to dublin for a party .
as far as ahern is concerned , it is a moment in history which is well worth a celebration .
he told parliament that the founding fathers of a unified europe had dreamed of a time when europeans would never again kill each other in the name of natural resources , land or beliefs .
and with ten new states poised to join the bloc , the irish prime minister said that 2004 was a year in which europe was moving closer to making those dreams come true . with the constitution talks and eu expansion , the new president has a fat agenda for the next half a year , but looking beyond his six-month stint , he is confident that membership talks for romania and bulgaria will be concluded this year .
he is also hoping to see progress in the unification of the divided mediterranean island of cyprus .
as it stands , only the greek southern part will join the eu in may , but ahern also praised turkey 's attempts to close the gap between itself and europe .
a rallying call looking beyond europe 's borders , ahern called on the eu member states to do more in the fight against poverty and aids in africa .
he said it was crucial for developing nations that they resume talks with the world trade organization .
several members of the european parliament called on ahern to push forward his initiative on debt relief for the poorest countries in the world .
ireland wants to stimulate economic development in europe and has pledged to work towards the goal of making it the most innovative economic power in the world by the end of the decade .
ahern believes in increasing competitiveness in the union , and he voiced his support for the latest eu commission initiative to completely do away with restraints on service sector competition for professions such as doctors , lawyers , architects and pharmacists .
he told parliament that europe had to be as competitive as possible and that the greatest challenge is the desperate need for more and better employment .

italy ’ s highest court on tuesday annulled a controversial legal immunity law that had shielded top officials from prosecution while in office .
prime minister silvio berlusconi could now once again face bribery charges . the law , which was passed last june , gave the country ’ s five highest officials immunity , but it has been criticized as existing solely to end berlusconi ’ s numerous legal headaches .
dubbed “ lex berlusconi ” by some , it helped the prime minister avoid possible conviction while italy held the rotating eu presidency last autumn . since the court has determined that the law is unconstitutional , berlusconi will once again face trial for allegedly bribing judges in the 1980s while he was a business man .
the trial had been stopped after the law went into effect . “ every man is the same before the law , ” antonio di pietro , an opposition member of parliament and former crusading prosecutor , told the associated press after the legislation was annulled . but berlusconi ’ s justice minister roberto castelli criticized the verdict , saying it could complicate relations between politicians and the judiciary .
“ i fear after this verdict the polemics will become even worse , ” he said . early elections ? berlusconi has repeatedly contended that he has done no wrong and left-wing magistrates have mounted an unfounded campaign against him .
in the face of a possible onslaught of politically motivated legal action against him , berlusconi is reportedly considering calling early elections . “ if that ’ s how things stand , then it ’ s better to go back to the polls , ” he told the daily newspaper corriere della sera . " the teflon premier " a billionaire media mogul turned politician , berlusconi has gone to court eight times over the past decade for varying corruption offenses .
he has been found guilty several times , however , by winning on appeal or due to the statute of limitations nothing has stuck to the " teflon premier . " though the latest case against berlusconi was stopped this summer after the immunity law was passed , the trial against his business associated continued .
a key charge that a firm owned by berlusconi bribed judges to win approval of a corporate takeover in the 1980s was rejected , but a court did convict berlusconi friend and lawyer cesare previti of paying off a rome judge .
previti is currently appealing his sentence of five years in jail . berlusconi , italy ’ s richest man , has repeatedly run into trouble due to his business dealings .
in december , italian president carlo azeglio ciampi decided not to sign a new media law that the opposition fears would add to the influence of the prime minister ’ s already powerful media empire . berlusconi owns three mediaset channels , italia 1 , rete 4 and canale 5 and as premier wields political influence over the board of state public broadcaster rai , mediaset 's only serious competition .

"
eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes , who is charged with overseeing the stability pact , is seeking legal backing to overturn a ruling which suspends eu budget rules for germany and france . so is this a case of solbes being a bad loser ?
why is he pushing so hard to bring the eu executive before the european court of justice when the outcome and implications of such action are so unclear ?
the proud spaniard suffered political defeat back in november of last year when the majority of ministers on the council of finance ministers voted in favor of suspending eu budget rules for france and germany on the grounds that it does n't make economic sense to punish them for stepping over the budget line .
both " offenders " say they wo n't manage to meet the three percent limit before 2005 . feeling jaded ? it is a clear political decision which the administrative powers at the eu do n't want to accept . as the union 's legislative power , the eu executive has the authority to make or change the rules , but the eu commission , which oversees european treaties , feels like it 's nose has been knocked out of joint .
solbes is particularly irritated by the fact that the ministers strayed from the official line in the treaty , binned his suggestions and came up with their own agreements for france and germany . even if the court in luxembourg were to take on the charges and were to rule in favor of the commissioners , the practical repercussions would be practically non-existent , other than to provide the commission with the chance to savor a moral victory .
it would have been far more sensible to push for a simplification of the rules and to adjust the criteria in the 1997 stability pact so as to make them reflect the economic reality of 2004 .
and this could have happened long before the power struggle between brussels and berlin began . had he acted earlier to work with pedro solbes , german finance minister hans eichel could have helped to avoid the current misery .
but given that the two men seem as stubborn minded as each other , that never happened . hard times ahead the german eu commissioner for enlargement , günter verheugen , who is opposed to the decision to seek legal action , is quite right when he says that this increased aggravation is no help for the union .
with the troubled constitution still hanging over europe 's head , member states really have more important things to worry about than an internal legal dispute . heads of state and government have to take another serious stab at creating a working constitution if the union is to maintain its reputation for being a viable institutional and political partner .
the eu has to define the financial framework for trading after 2007 and then there are the all important discussions on whether or not turkey will be granted membership .
they have to digest the addition of ten new members and with the terms of office for eu commission president , romano prodi , and his department heads due to end in november , they also have some important personnel issues to deal with . so what , in that case , is the point of dubious legal action which will do little to help the stability pact ?
the joke in brussels is that solbes is trying to imitate his famous forefather , don quijote , who made a name for himself by battling imaginary windmills .
but leaving the whisperings in brussels aside , it is certainly too soon for hans eichel to begin rejoicing .
at the end of the year he has to prove that he can sink the german budget deficit below the obligatory three percent .
it is a tough goal for eichel who has his hands full with germany 's economic development .
indeed , his ministry has already warned that it will be very difficult to meet the notorious maastricht criteria in 2005 . bernd riegert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes eu to court the european commission on tuesday decided to seek a court ruling to overturn finance ministers ’ suspension of eu budget rules for france and germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 14.01.2004 bundeswehr cuts could hurt german defense industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wo n't be cancelling its order for 180 eurofighter combat aircraft , but other missile projects will be scrapped .
defense minister peter struck 's announcement that some € 26 billion will be cut from the bundeswehr 's spending plans will hit the german arms industry hard . bundeswehr generals will be rewriting their wish lists after peter struck outlined his plans to reduce military spending on tuesday .
several missile projects are now set to be scrapped , and overall , the new budget constraints mean ever fewer contracts for arms manufacturers .
although the government says it will be sticking to procurement contracts already signed , such as orders for 180 eurofighter combat aircraft , the tiger combat helicopter and nh90 transport helicopter , projects such as upgrading the patriot missile defense systems and plans to buy a pilotless reconnaissance drone for the navy , will likely now be shelved .
a blow to industrial growth the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- fears the defense ministry 's move will have negative repercussions on the country 's industrial growth .
helmut harff , director of the bdi 's defense industries committee , says germany 's role within the european arms industry will now be severely reduced .
in an interview with deutsche welle , he said that " peter struck 's plans did n't come as a surprise to the defense industry , but it received very little information in advance . "
harff pointed out that " one needs to bear in mind that via the defense ministry , the government is the arms industry 's primary client , and for this section of the industry , the announced cuts mean major changes to existing business plans . "
a missed opportunity experts said the trend towards international mergers and alliances is now set to increase as a result of the defense cutbacks . harff , who served as first commander of the german troops in kosovo , predicted that germany may end up fast selling off its state-of-the-art technology .
although arms make up a very small share of germany 's total exports , he argued that the new cuts might mean germany could miss out on the opportunity to continue selling high-tech products on international markets .
" overall , exports of german munitions last year amounted to just 0.06 percent of germany 's total exports , which is very low , " said harff , before adding that " it 's important to maintain the technological means for manufacturing these munitions so that the country remains a player on the world market . "
a muted reaction so far , there 's been a muted reaction from business .
europe 's leading supplier of land forces systems , rheinmetall has welcomed the defense minister 's proposals because the company can now factor the cuts into its own planning security . but another company , kraus-maffei wegmann , a system vendor in the area of armored vehicles , has announced it does n't expect to be affected by the cuts .
germany 's arms industry may not have been given due warning of struck 's drastic agenda , but many companies are well-prepared nonetheless , having already introduced their own austerity measures some time ago and opted for new business strategies .
the same day the government revealed its plans , for example , european missile system manufacturer diehl announced it would be setting up a joint venture with american rival company raytheon to market a special sidewinder guided missile .
adhering to international agreements although the arms industry appears rather unruffled by the imminent cuts , harff pointed out that , in germany , the defense budget is a uniquely thorny issue .
he said he believes the key issue here is not so much arms spending , but rather security provisions for the future .
in that respect , he said , germany is is not sticking to international agreements .
" nato wants to see 2.3 percent of gross domestic product spent on security provisions , and in germany only 1.5 percent is being spent , " he observed .
but harff said he believes this has to change .
" other countries invest considerably more , " he said .
" last year , for example , france invested three times as much -lrb- in its military -rrb- as germany .

defense minister peter struck 's announcement that some € 26 billion will be cut from the bundeswehr 's spending plans will hit the german arms industry hard . bundeswehr generals will be rewriting their wish lists after peter struck outlined his plans to reduce military spending on tuesday .
several missile projects are now set to be scrapped , and overall , the new budget constraints mean ever fewer contracts for arms manufacturers .
although the government says it will be sticking to procurement contracts already signed , such as orders for 180 eurofighter combat aircraft , the tiger combat helicopter and nh90 transport helicopter , projects such as upgrading the patriot missile defense systems and plans to buy a pilotless reconnaissance drone for the navy , will likely now be shelved .
a blow to industrial growth the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- fears the defense ministry 's move will have negative repercussions on the country 's industrial growth .
helmut harff , director of the bdi 's defense industries committee , says germany 's role within the european arms industry will now be severely reduced .
in an interview with deutsche welle , he said that " peter struck 's plans did n't come as a surprise to the defense industry , but it received very little information in advance . "
harff pointed out that " one needs to bear in mind that via the defense ministry , the government is the arms industry 's primary client , and for this section of the industry , the announced cuts mean major changes to existing business plans . "
a missed opportunity experts said the trend towards international mergers and alliances is now set to increase as a result of the defense cutbacks . harff , who served as first commander of the german troops in kosovo , predicted that germany may end up fast selling off its state-of-the-art technology .
although arms make up a very small share of germany 's total exports , he argued that the new cuts might mean germany could miss out on the opportunity to continue selling high-tech products on international markets .
" overall , exports of german munitions last year amounted to just 0.06 percent of germany 's total exports , which is very low , " said harff , before adding that " it 's important to maintain the technological means for manufacturing these munitions so that the country remains a player on the world market . "
a muted reaction so far , there 's been a muted reaction from business .
europe 's leading supplier of land forces systems , rheinmetall has welcomed the defense minister 's proposals because the company can now factor the cuts into its own planning security . but another company , kraus-maffei wegmann , a system vendor in the area of armored vehicles , has announced it does n't expect to be affected by the cuts .
germany 's arms industry may not have been given due warning of struck 's drastic agenda , but many companies are well-prepared nonetheless , having already introduced their own austerity measures some time ago and opted for new business strategies .
the same day the government revealed its plans , for example , european missile system manufacturer diehl announced it would be setting up a joint venture with american rival company raytheon to market a special sidewinder guided missile .
adhering to international agreements although the arms industry appears rather unruffled by the imminent cuts , harff pointed out that , in germany , the defense budget is a uniquely thorny issue .
he said he believes the key issue here is not so much arms spending , but rather security provisions for the future .
in that respect , he said , germany is is not sticking to international agreements .
" nato wants to see 2.3 percent of gross domestic product spent on security provisions , and in germany only 1.5 percent is being spent , " he observed .
but harff said he believes this has to change .
" other countries invest considerably more , " he said .
" last year , for example , france invested three times as much -lrb- in its military -rrb- as germany .

the ratings of a new reality tv show in germany are climbing as minor celebrities are put through daily hair-raising ‘ challenges ’ in the australian jungle .
but as the tests get crueler , criticism is starting to grow . germany ’ s private television channel rtl has hit ratings pay dirt with its version of the british and american show “ i ’ m a celebrity get me out of here . ”
called “ ich bin ein star holt mich hier raus ” in german , the show has dropped ten b-list celebrities into a jungle in australia for 12 days . despite being inundated by reality tv in recent years , german viewers are flocking to the program , which forces one member of the group to undertake a stunt testing their courage each day in order to earn food for all .
but after a singer of questionable talent was forced to lie in a " cockroach coffin " with 30,000 of the wriggly creatures and an out-of-work tv host was pecked nearly to tears by a band of aggressive ostriches , media watchdogs and other groups are beginning to question the show ’ s lack of moral grounding . “ i ’ ve really been blown over .
these are methods that are reminiscent of torture tactics , ” jo groebel , the director of the european institute for the media in düsseldorf , told the associated press on wednesday . alarm bells for many went off when daniel küblböck , who become a celebrity as a performer in the german version of " pop idol , " suffered a panic attack after putting his head in a “ terror aquarium ” filled with eels and water spiders .

walter eykmann from a national catholic church group told the daily tabloid newspaper bild that rtl was putting “ profits and ratings ” above the participants well-being .
“ it ’ s absolutely repugnant how daniel küblböck is being abused , ” eykmann said . plenty of publicity though the candidates earn € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,276 -rrb- for each day they stay in the camp for the charity of their choice , the real motivation is likely the free publicity that could help their careers .
shown live each evening , the show 's ratings have swelled in recent days .
on tuesday , it garnered a whopping third of the total viewing audience . despite the growing popularity of “ i ’ m a celebrity get me out of here , ” the company said it has so far kept the price of a 30-second commercial spot steady at € 34,500 .
and rtl has defended the program , saying all those taking part were aware of what they were getting into . “ the participants are acting of their own will and are public persons who know exactly what they are doing , ” said an rtl spokesman .
“ we aren ’ t torturing anyone . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krokodil im kölner zoo but some animal rights groups see things differently , saying that even if the celebrities can choose not to take part , the the snakes , spiders and cockroaches used in the television stunts can ’ t .

the european commission on tuesday decided to seek a court ruling to overturn finance ministers ’ suspension of eu budget rules for france and germany .
member states criticize the action , saying it ’ s a risky move . the eu executive , which is responsible for enforcing laws in the 15-member bloc , argued that taking finance ministers to court was vital to clarify disciplinary procedures for those who break the eu ’ s guidelines on deficit spending , as france and germany have done repeatedly .
but the unprecedented legal move is expected to generate a considerable amount of friction at a time when the eu is concerned about maintaining cohesion .
german finance minister hans eichel said the decision to go to the european court of justice was " hard to understand " and added that he saw no wrong doing in the finance minister ’ s nov .
25 decision to forego disciplinary action against berlin and paris for violating the stability pact .
the results of the ecofin -lrb- council of european finance ministers -rrb- meeting " correspond to the spirit and the letter of the stability and growth pact , " he said in a statement released on tuesday .
" the procedures that are foreseen -lrb- in the pact -rrb- were upheld . "
at the meeting , germany and france , europe ’ s two biggest economies , used their combined influence to convince ecofin to reject the commission ’ s recommendation to punish berlin and paris for running up excessive budget deficits by slapping them with steep fines and forcing them to make deeper deficit cuts in 2004 .
the commission is now seeking a ruling on whether the ministers violated procedure in taking an ad hoc decision against the eu executive branch .
brussels vs. brussels " not least with a view to the tasks the european union faces in the near future , it would be more helpful to aim for cooperation rather than confrontation , " eichel said in response to the commission ’ s legal challenge .
but eu monetary affairs commssioner pedro solbes , whose office oversees the stability pact , has argued that brussels has a duty to uphold the law and avoid a precedent that could legitimize rule-breaking in the future and ultimately undermine the eu treaty .
french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin acknowledged that it was the commission ’ s right to seek recourse in court , but insisted the finance minister ’ s decision was legal .
" i respect the decision of the commission , but i am not worried about the result , " he told reporters during a visit in brussels .
legal advisors to the member states in the eu council said the ministers had a discretionary power to overturn the commission ’ s recommendation and doubt the eu executive will come out a clear winner in court .
a house divided against itself the commission itself is divided over the decision to seek legal action .
the move is seen as a risky one , which could seriously undermine the authority of the executive branch if the eu ’ s top court rules the finance ministers ’ action legal .
solbes ' spokesman , gerassimos thomas , admitted there were possible risks involved in taking the case to court , but said " it had to be done , " and that it is the commission ’ s " role as guardian of the treaty to ensure that provisions are upheld . "
although nothing has been made public about internal discussion surrounding the commission ’ s action , thomas confirmed that tuesday ’ s decision had not been unanimous among the 20 commissioners .
sources in brussels say the french , german and british commissioners were against taking legal action .
it is also not certain whether the court of justice will agree to the commission ’ s request for a fast-track procedure that would lead to a decision in three to six months rather than the normal two years .
solbes , however , is convinced the risky legal move is the correct strategy for the commission .

the european commission on tuesday decided to seek a court ruling to overturn finance ministers ’ suspension of eu budget rules for france and germany .
member states criticize the action , saying it ’ s a risky move . the eu executive , which is responsible for enforcing laws in the 15-member bloc , argued that taking finance ministers to court was vital to clarify disciplinary procedures for those who break the eu ’ s guidelines on deficit spending , as france and germany have done repeatedly .
but the unprecedented legal move is expected to generate a considerable amount of friction at a time when the eu is concerned about maintaining cohesion .
german finance minister hans eichel said the decision to go to the european court of justice was " hard to understand " and added that he saw no wrong doing in the finance minister ’ s nov .
25 decision to forego disciplinary action against berlin and paris for violating the stability pact .
the results of the ecofin -lrb- council of european finance ministers -rrb- meeting " correspond to the spirit and the letter of the stability and growth pact , " he said in a statement released on tuesday .
" the procedures that are foreseen -lrb- in the pact -rrb- were upheld . "
at the meeting , germany and france , europe ’ s two biggest economies , used their combined influence to convince ecofin to reject the commission ’ s recommendation to punish berlin and paris for running up excessive budget deficits by slapping them with steep fines and forcing them to make deeper deficit cuts in 2004 .
the commission is now seeking a ruling on whether the ministers violated procedure in taking an ad hoc decision against the eu executive branch .
brussels vs. brussels " not least with a view to the tasks the european union faces in the near future , it would be more helpful to aim for cooperation rather than confrontation , " eichel said in response to the commission ’ s legal challenge .
but eu monetary affairs commssioner pedro solbes , whose office oversees the stability pact , has argued that brussels has a duty to uphold the law and avoid a precedent that could legitimize rule-breaking in the future and ultimately undermine the eu treaty .
french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin acknowledged that it was the commission ’ s right to seek recourse in court , but insisted the finance minister ’ s decision was legal .
" i respect the decision of the commission , but i am not worried about the result , " he told reporters during a visit in brussels .
legal advisors to the member states in the eu council said the ministers had a discretionary power to overturn the commission ’ s recommendation and doubt the eu executive will come out a clear winner in court .
a house divided against itself the commission itself is divided over the decision to seek legal action .
the move is seen as a risky one , which could seriously undermine the authority of the executive branch if the eu ’ s top court rules the finance ministers ’ action legal .
solbes ' spokesman , gerassimos thomas , admitted there were possible risks involved in taking the case to court , but said " it had to be done , " and that it is the commission ’ s " role as guardian of the treaty to ensure that provisions are upheld . "
although nothing has been made public about internal discussion surrounding the commission ’ s action , thomas confirmed that tuesday ’ s decision had not been unanimous among the 20 commissioners .
sources in brussels say the french , german and british commissioners were against taking legal action .
it is also not certain whether the court of justice will agree to the commission ’ s request for a fast-track procedure that would lead to a decision in three to six months rather than the normal two years .
solbes , however , is convinced the risky legal move is the correct strategy for the commission .
speaking to reporters after the announcement was made , he said the court challenge " has had great support , even if not all commissioners have agreed on all different aspects of the strategy .

the ratings of a new reality tv show in germany are climbing as minor celebrities are put through daily hair-raising ‘ challenges ’ in the australian jungle .
but as the tests get crueler , criticism is starting to grow . germany ’ s private television channel rtl has hit ratings pay dirt with its version of the british and american show “ i ’ m a celebrity get me out of here . ”
called “ ich bin ein star holt mich hier raus ” in german , the show has dropped ten b-list celebrities into a jungle in australia for 12 days . despite being inundated by reality tv in recent years , german viewers are flocking to the program , which forces one member of the group to undertake a stunt testing their courage each day in order to earn food for all .
but after a singer of questionable talent was forced to lie in a " cockroach coffin " with 30,000 of the wriggly creatures and an out-of-work tv host was pecked nearly to tears by a band of aggressive ostriches , media watchdogs and other groups are beginning to question the show ’ s lack of moral grounding . “ i ’ ve really been blown over .
these are methods that are reminiscent of torture tactics , ” jo groebel , the director of the european institute for the media in düsseldorf , told the associated press on wednesday . alarm bells for many went off when daniel küblböck , who become a celebrity as a performer in the german version of " pop idol , " suffered a panic attack after putting his head in a “ terror aquarium ” filled with eels and water spiders .

shown live each evening , the show 's ratings have swelled in recent days .
on tuesday , it garnered a whopping third of the total viewing audience . despite the growing popularity of “ i ’ m a celebrity get me out of here , ” the company said it has so far kept the price of a 30-second commercial spot steady at € 34,500 .
and rtl has defended the program , saying all those taking part were aware of what they were getting into . “ the participants are acting of their own will and are public persons who know exactly what they are doing , ” said an rtl spokesman .
“ we aren ’ t torturing anyone . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krokodil im kölner zoo but some animal rights groups see things differently , saying that even if the celebrities can choose not to take part , the the snakes , spiders and cockroaches used in the television stunts can ’ t .

germany 's railway celebrates a decade as a private company on wednesday .
the deutsche bahn chairman hopes it will be ready to go public in 2005 - but meanwhile , it continues accruing debt . just days after opening , berlin 's newest five-star hotel , the ritz-carlton , is warming up for a bash in honor of the 10th anniversary of germany 's state railway system going private . its host , deutsche bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn , predictably lauds the reform as " a huge success . " " after -lrb- the fall of the berlin wall -rrb- we had two train companies that were on their last legs economically , " mehdorn told the newspaper die welt on the eve of the celebration .
" we know we 're not done , but what this company and its employees have done is unparalleled . " but that has n't put a stop to harsh criticism of db from politicians , economists and passengers . a mountain of debt the trip to where the bahn stands today has been a long one .
based on the recommendations of a government-appointed commission in late 1991 , parliament decided it was time to reform the railway - and it promptly began amending around 130 laws to change its status . in january 1994 , the west and east german railway companies were merged into a stock corporation called deutsche bahn , with the federal government retaining full ownership . by that time , west germany 's railway alone had amassed € 34 billion -lrb- $ 43.5 billion -rrb- in debt .
its enormous losses - € 7.9 billion during its last year as a state agency - were paid for by taxpayers . germany could afford either the national train system or the army but not both , former chancellor helmut schmidt was quoted as saying at the time . but the government nonetheless assumed the mountain of debt , giving db a fresh start . since then , the government has taken a less hands-on approach to deutsche bahn . db , after all , became a private company that was expected to generate a profit .
while politicians no longer dictate the bahn 's day-to-day actions , the government does have a say in strategic decisions through infrastructural funding and members on the company 's supervisory board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn " the numbers speak for themselves , " mehdorn told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" we have saved german taxpayers around € 108 billion -lrb- since 1994 -rrb- , more than € 44 billion more than what independent experts forecasted at the time " for what the government would save if it made deutsche bahn an independent , self-sufficient company .
but mehdorn 's calculations are based on the assumption that the catastrophic pre-reform situation would have continued without change . no more clean slate mehdorn , deutsche bahn ceo since 1999 , can brag that db does n't pocket subsidies to cover its operating costs .
but it still receives around € 10 billion annually from federal and state sources to pay for commuter traffic and infrastructure development . and it 's incurring debts again .
in the first half of 2003 , operating loss after interest stood at € 143 million .
that was down from € 235 million a year earlier - and mehdorn has said he plans to get the company back into the black in 2004 . those plans precede tuesday 's news that mehdorn and co. are considering cost-cutting measures , including abandoning costly refurbishment and expansion plans for 2004 . for example , the long-awaited high-speed rail line between erfurt and nuremburg that would reduce total travel time between berlin and munich but would cost up to € 244 million to build could become the first victim of the cuts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worse yet , db appears to be one of the businesses german consumers most love to hate , along with deutsche post and deutsche telekom , which were also privatized in the 1990s .

germany 's railway celebrates a decade as a private company on wednesday .
the deutsche bahn chairman hopes it will be ready to go public in 2005 - but meanwhile , it continues accruing debt . just days after opening , berlin 's newest five-star hotel , the ritz-carlton , is warming up for a bash in honor of the 10th anniversary of germany 's state railway system going private . its host , deutsche bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn , predictably lauds the reform as " a huge success . " " after -lrb- the fall of the berlin wall -rrb- we had two train companies that were on their last legs economically , " mehdorn told the newspaper die welt on the eve of the celebration .
" we know we 're not done , but what this company and its employees have done is unparalleled . " but that has n't put a stop to harsh criticism of db from politicians , economists and passengers . a mountain of debt the trip to where the bahn stands today has been a long one .
based on the recommendations of a government-appointed commission in late 1991 , parliament decided it was time to reform the railway - and it promptly began amending around 130 laws to change its status . in january 1994 , the west and east german railway companies were merged into a stock corporation called deutsche bahn , with the federal government retaining full ownership . by that time , west germany 's railway alone had amassed € 34 billion -lrb- $ 43.5 billion -rrb- in debt .
its enormous losses - € 7.9 billion during its last year as a state agency - were paid for by taxpayers . germany could afford either the national train system or the army but not both , former chancellor helmut schmidt was quoted as saying at the time . but the government nonetheless assumed the mountain of debt , giving db a fresh start . since then , the government has taken a less hands-on approach to deutsche bahn . db , after all , became a private company that was expected to generate a profit .
while politicians no longer dictate the bahn 's day-to-day actions , the government does have a say in strategic decisions through infrastructural funding and members on the company 's supervisory board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn " the numbers speak for themselves , " mehdorn told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" we have saved german taxpayers around € 108 billion -lrb- since 1994 -rrb- , more than € 44 billion more than what independent experts forecasted at the time " for what the government would save if it made deutsche bahn an independent , self-sufficient company .
but mehdorn 's calculations are based on the assumption that the catastrophic pre-reform situation would have continued without change . no more clean slate mehdorn , deutsche bahn ceo since 1999 , can brag that db does n't pocket subsidies to cover its operating costs .
but it still receives around € 10 billion annually from federal and state sources to pay for commuter traffic and infrastructure development . and it 's incurring debts again .
in the first half of 2003 , operating loss after interest stood at € 143 million .
that was down from € 235 million a year earlier - and mehdorn has said he plans to get the company back into the black in 2004 . those plans precede tuesday 's news that mehdorn and co. are considering cost-cutting measures , including abandoning costly refurbishment and expansion plans for 2004 . for example , the long-awaited high-speed rail line between erfurt and nuremburg that would reduce total travel time between berlin and munich but would cost up to € 244 million to build could become the first victim of the cuts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worse yet , db appears to be one of the businesses german consumers most love to hate , along with deutsche post and deutsche telekom , which were also privatized in the 1990s .

germany 's railway celebrates a decade as a private company on wednesday .
the deutsche bahn chairman hopes it will be ready to go public in 2005 - but meanwhile , it continues accruing debt . just days after opening , berlin 's newest five-star hotel , the ritz-carlton , is warming up for a bash in honor of the 10th anniversary of germany 's state railway system going private . its host , deutsche bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn , predictably lauds the reform as " a huge success . " " after -lrb- the fall of the berlin wall -rrb- we had two train companies that were on their last legs economically , " mehdorn told the newspaper die welt on the eve of the celebration .
" we know we 're not done , but what this company and its employees have done is unparalleled . " but that has n't put a stop to harsh criticism of db from politicians , economists and passengers . a mountain of debt the trip to where the bahn stands today has been a long one .
based on the recommendations of a government-appointed commission in late 1991 , parliament decided it was time to reform the railway - and it promptly began amending around 130 laws to change its status . in january 1994 , the west and east german railway companies were merged into a stock corporation called deutsche bahn , with the federal government retaining full ownership . by that time , west germany 's railway alone had amassed € 34 billion -lrb- $ 43.5 billion -rrb- in debt .
its enormous losses - € 7.9 billion during its last year as a state agency - were paid for by taxpayers . germany could afford either the national train system or the army but not both , former chancellor helmut schmidt was quoted as saying at the time . but the government nonetheless assumed the mountain of debt , giving db a fresh start . since then , the government has taken a less hands-on approach to deutsche bahn . db , after all , became a private company that was expected to generate a profit .

but mehdorn 's calculations are based on the assumption that the catastrophic pre-reform situation would have continued without change . no more clean slate mehdorn , deutsche bahn ceo since 1999 , can brag that db does n't pocket subsidies to cover its operating costs .
but it still receives around € 10 billion annually from federal and state sources to pay for commuter traffic and infrastructure development . and it 's incurring debts again .
in the first half of 2003 , operating loss after interest stood at € 143 million .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.01.2004 eu takes eu to court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice for the european union - but which part of it ?
the european commission on tuesday decided to seek a court ruling to overturn finance ministers ’ suspension of eu budget rules for france and germany .
member states criticize the action , saying it ’ s a risky move . the eu executive , which is responsible for enforcing laws in the 15-member bloc , argued that taking finance ministers to court was vital to clarify disciplinary procedures for those who break the eu ’ s guidelines on deficit spending , as france and germany have done repeatedly .
but the unprecedented legal move is expected to generate a considerable amount of friction at a time when the eu is concerned about maintaining cohesion .
german finance minister hans eichel said the decision to go to the european court of justice was " hard to understand " and added that he saw no wrong doing in the finance minister ’ s nov .
25 decision to forego disciplinary action against berlin and paris for violating the stability pact .
the results of the ecofin -lrb- council of european finance ministers -rrb- meeting " correspond to the spirit and the letter of the stability and growth pact , " he said in a statement released on tuesday .
" the procedures that are foreseen -lrb- in the pact -rrb- were upheld . "
at the meeting , germany and france , europe ’ s two biggest economies , used their combined influence to convince ecofin to reject the commission ’ s recommendation to punish berlin and paris for running up excessive budget deficits by slapping them with steep fines and forcing them to make deeper deficit cuts in 2004 .
the commission is now seeking a ruling on whether the ministers violated procedure in taking an ad hoc decision against the eu executive branch .
brussels vs. brussels " not least with a view to the tasks the european union faces in the near future , it would be more helpful to aim for cooperation rather than confrontation , " eichel said in response to the commission ’ s legal challenge .
but eu monetary affairs commssioner pedro solbes , whose office oversees the stability pact , has argued that brussels has a duty to uphold the law and avoid a precedent that could legitimize rule-breaking in the future and ultimately undermine the eu treaty .
french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin acknowledged that it was the commission ’ s right to seek recourse in court , but insisted the finance minister ’ s decision was legal .
" i respect the decision of the commission , but i am not worried about the result , " he told reporters during a visit in brussels .
legal advisors to the member states in the eu council said the ministers had a discretionary power to overturn the commission ’ s recommendation and doubt the eu executive will come out a clear winner in court .
a house divided against itself the commission itself is divided over the decision to seek legal action .
the move is seen as a risky one , which could seriously undermine the authority of the executive branch if the eu ’ s top court rules the finance ministers ’ action legal .
solbes ' spokesman , gerassimos thomas , admitted there were possible risks involved in taking the case to court , but said " it had to be done , " and that it is the commission ’ s " role as guardian of the treaty to ensure that provisions are upheld . "
although nothing has been made public about internal discussion surrounding the commission ’ s action , thomas confirmed that tuesday ’ s decision had not been unanimous among the 20 commissioners .
sources in brussels say the french , german and british commissioners were against taking legal action .
it is also not certain whether the court of justice will agree to the commission ’ s request for a fast-track procedure that would lead to a decision in three to six months rather than the normal two years .
solbes , however , is convinced the risky legal move is the correct strategy for the commission .

the european commission on tuesday decided to seek a court ruling to overturn finance ministers ’ suspension of eu budget rules for france and germany .
member states criticize the action , saying it ’ s a risky move . the eu executive , which is responsible for enforcing laws in the 15-member bloc , argued that taking finance ministers to court was vital to clarify disciplinary procedures for those who break the eu ’ s guidelines on deficit spending , as france and germany have done repeatedly .
but the unprecedented legal move is expected to generate a considerable amount of friction at a time when the eu is concerned about maintaining cohesion .
german finance minister hans eichel said the decision to go to the european court of justice was " hard to understand " and added that he saw no wrong doing in the finance minister ’ s nov .
25 decision to forego disciplinary action against berlin and paris for violating the stability pact .
the results of the ecofin -lrb- council of european finance ministers -rrb- meeting " correspond to the spirit and the letter of the stability and growth pact , " he said in a statement released on tuesday .
" the procedures that are foreseen -lrb- in the pact -rrb- were upheld . "
at the meeting , germany and france , europe ’ s two biggest economies , used their combined influence to convince ecofin to reject the commission ’ s recommendation to punish berlin and paris for running up excessive budget deficits by slapping them with steep fines and forcing them to make deeper deficit cuts in 2004 .
the commission is now seeking a ruling on whether the ministers violated procedure in taking an ad hoc decision against the eu executive branch .
brussels vs. brussels " not least with a view to the tasks the european union faces in the near future , it would be more helpful to aim for cooperation rather than confrontation , " eichel said in response to the commission ’ s legal challenge .
but eu monetary affairs commssioner pedro solbes , whose office oversees the stability pact , has argued that brussels has a duty to uphold the law and avoid a precedent that could legitimize rule-breaking in the future and ultimately undermine the eu treaty .
french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin acknowledged that it was the commission ’ s right to seek recourse in court , but insisted the finance minister ’ s decision was legal .
" i respect the decision of the commission , but i am not worried about the result , " he told reporters during a visit in brussels .
legal advisors to the member states in the eu council said the ministers had a discretionary power to overturn the commission ’ s recommendation and doubt the eu executive will come out a clear winner in court .
a house divided against itself the commission itself is divided over the decision to seek legal action .
the move is seen as a risky one , which could seriously undermine the authority of the executive branch if the eu ’ s top court rules the finance ministers ’ action legal .
solbes ' spokesman , gerassimos thomas , admitted there were possible risks involved in taking the case to court , but said " it had to be done , " and that it is the commission ’ s " role as guardian of the treaty to ensure that provisions are upheld . "
although nothing has been made public about internal discussion surrounding the commission ’ s action , thomas confirmed that tuesday ’ s decision had not been unanimous among the 20 commissioners .
sources in brussels say the french , german and british commissioners were against taking legal action .
it is also not certain whether the court of justice will agree to the commission ’ s request for a fast-track procedure that would lead to a decision in three to six months rather than the normal two years .
solbes , however , is convinced the risky legal move is the correct strategy for the commission .

solbes ' spokesman , gerassimos thomas , admitted there were possible risks involved in taking the case to court , but said " it had to be done , " and that it is the commission ’ s " role as guardian of the treaty to ensure that provisions are upheld . "
although nothing has been made public about internal discussion surrounding the commission ’ s action , thomas confirmed that tuesday ’ s decision had not been unanimous among the 20 commissioners .

the european commission on tuesday decided to seek a court ruling to overturn finance ministers ’ suspension of eu budget rules for france and germany .
member states criticize the action , saying it ’ s a risky move . the eu executive , which is responsible for enforcing laws in the 15-member bloc , argued that taking finance ministers to court was vital to clarify disciplinary procedures for those who break the eu ’ s guidelines on deficit spending , as france and germany have done repeatedly .
but the unprecedented legal move is expected to generate a considerable amount of friction at a time when the eu is concerned about maintaining cohesion .
german finance minister hans eichel said the decision to go to the european court of justice was " hard to understand " and added that he saw no wrong doing in the finance minister ’ s nov .
25 decision to forego disciplinary action against berlin and paris for violating the stability pact .
the results of the ecofin -lrb- council of european finance ministers -rrb- meeting " correspond to the spirit and the letter of the stability and growth pact , " he said in a statement released on tuesday .
" the procedures that are foreseen -lrb- in the pact -rrb- were upheld . "
at the meeting , germany and france , europe ’ s two biggest economies , used their combined influence to convince ecofin to reject the commission ’ s recommendation to punish berlin and paris for running up excessive budget deficits by slapping them with steep fines and forcing them to make deeper deficit cuts in 2004 .
the commission is now seeking a ruling on whether the ministers violated procedure in taking an ad hoc decision against the eu executive branch .
brussels vs. brussels " not least with a view to the tasks the european union faces in the near future , it would be more helpful to aim for cooperation rather than confrontation , " eichel said in response to the commission ’ s legal challenge .
but eu monetary affairs commssioner pedro solbes , whose office oversees the stability pact , has argued that brussels has a duty to uphold the law and avoid a precedent that could legitimize rule-breaking in the future and ultimately undermine the eu treaty .
french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin acknowledged that it was the commission ’ s right to seek recourse in court , but insisted the finance minister ’ s decision was legal .
" i respect the decision of the commission , but i am not worried about the result , " he told reporters during a visit in brussels .
legal advisors to the member states in the eu council said the ministers had a discretionary power to overturn the commission ’ s recommendation and doubt the eu executive will come out a clear winner in court .

the murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh plunged the country into a crisis last september .
now , with the confessed killer standing trial , swedes are hoping to draw a close to a dark moment in thier history . the man who admitted to killing lindh testified that voices in his head told him to stab the swedish minister repeatedly in the chest and arms .
" i couldn ’ t resist , " mijailo mijailovic confessed to the panel of judges in the packed stockholm courtroom on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mijailo mijailovic although he said he did indeed kill the widely popular anna lindh , the 25-year old swede of yugoslav origin denied it was for political reasons .
" i ’ m not interested in politics , " he told chief prosecutor krister petersson .
" i have nothing personal against anna lindh . "
mijailo ’ s lawyer , peter althin , has pushed for dropping the charges down to manslaughter rather than murder , arguing that his client had not planned the sept .

prosecutors , however , insist the attack was premeditated and argue that mijailovic stalked lindh for 14 minutes before stabbing her with a knife in a crowded department store .
given the killer ’ s confession and the prosecution ’ s overwhelming evidence , the court ’ s main task will be to determine whether mijailovic really intended to kill anna lindh or not .

he denied looking for anyone in particular .
he said he just saw lindh and voices in his head , including that of jesus , urged him to stab her - 10 times with a knife .
lindh died the next day in the hospital after doctors worked through the night to save her .

mijailovic , who has a history of mental problems and three previous convictions , including one for a 1996 stabbing of his father , could face a sentence of between 10 years and life in prison .
if found mentally unstable , he could also be sent to a mental hospital for mandatory treatment .

he denied looking for anyone in particular .
he said he just saw lindh and voices in his head , including that of jesus , urged him to stab her - 10 times with a knife .

mijailovic , who has a history of mental problems and three previous convictions , including one for a 1996 stabbing of his father , could face a sentence of between 10 years and life in prison .

italy ’ s highest court on tuesday annulled a controversial legal immunity law that had shielded top officials from prosecution while in office .
prime minister silvio berlusconi could now once again face bribery charges . the law , which was passed last june , gave the country ’ s five highest officials immunity , but it has been criticized as existing solely to end berlusconi ’ s numerous legal headaches .
dubbed “ lex berlusconi ” by some , it helped the prime minister avoid possible conviction while italy held the rotating eu presidency last autumn . since the court has determined that the law is unconstitutional , berlusconi will once again face trial for allegedly bribing judges in the 1980s while he was a business man .
the trial had been stopped after the law went into effect . “ every man is the same before the law , ” antonio di pietro , an opposition member of parliament and former crusading prosecutor , told the associated press after the legislation was annulled . but berlusconi ’ s justice minister roberto castelli criticized the verdict , saying it could complicate relations between politicians and the judiciary .
“ i fear after this verdict the polemics will become even worse , ” he said . early elections ? berlusconi has repeatedly contended that he has done no wrong and left-wing magistrates have mounted an unfounded campaign against him .
in the face of a possible onslaught of politically motivated legal action against him , berlusconi is reportedly considering calling early elections . “ if that ’ s how things stand , then it ’ s better to go back to the polls , ” he told the daily newspaper corriere della sera . " the teflon premier " a billionaire media mogul turned politician , berlusconi has gone to court eight times over the past decade for varying corruption offenses .
he has been found guilty several times , however , by winning on appeal or due to the statute of limitations nothing has stuck to the " teflon premier . " though the latest case against berlusconi was stopped this summer after the immunity law was passed , the trial against his business associated continued .
a key charge that a firm owned by berlusconi bribed judges to win approval of a corporate takeover in the 1980s was rejected , but a court did convict berlusconi friend and lawyer cesare previti of paying off a rome judge .
previti is currently appealing his sentence of five years in jail . berlusconi , italy ’ s richest man , has repeatedly run into trouble due to his business dealings .
in december , italian president carlo azeglio ciampi decided not to sign a new media law that the opposition fears would add to the influence of the prime minister ’ s already powerful media empire . berlusconi owns three mediaset channels , italia 1 , rete 4 and canale 5 and as premier wields political influence over the board of state public broadcaster rai , mediaset 's only serious competition .

italy ’ s highest court on tuesday annulled a controversial legal immunity law that had shielded top officials from prosecution while in office .
prime minister silvio berlusconi could now once again face bribery charges . the law , which was passed last june , gave the country ’ s five highest officials immunity , but it has been criticized as existing solely to end berlusconi ’ s numerous legal headaches .
dubbed “ lex berlusconi ” by some , it helped the prime minister avoid possible conviction while italy held the rotating eu presidency last autumn . since the court has determined that the law is unconstitutional , berlusconi will once again face trial for allegedly bribing judges in the 1980s while he was a business man .
the trial had been stopped after the law went into effect . “ every man is the same before the law , ” antonio di pietro , an opposition member of parliament and former crusading prosecutor , told the associated press after the legislation was annulled . but berlusconi ’ s justice minister roberto castelli criticized the verdict , saying it could complicate relations between politicians and the judiciary .
“ i fear after this verdict the polemics will become even worse , ” he said . early elections ? berlusconi has repeatedly contended that he has done no wrong and left-wing magistrates have mounted an unfounded campaign against him .
in the face of a possible onslaught of politically motivated legal action against him , berlusconi is reportedly considering calling early elections . “ if that ’ s how things stand , then it ’ s better to go back to the polls , ” he told the daily newspaper corriere della sera . " the teflon premier " a billionaire media mogul turned politician , berlusconi has gone to court eight times over the past decade for varying corruption offenses .
he has been found guilty several times , however , by winning on appeal or due to the statute of limitations nothing has stuck to the " teflon premier . " though the latest case against berlusconi was stopped this summer after the immunity law was passed , the trial against his business associated continued .
a key charge that a firm owned by berlusconi bribed judges to win approval of a corporate takeover in the 1980s was rejected , but a court did convict berlusconi friend and lawyer cesare previti of paying off a rome judge .
previti is currently appealing his sentence of five years in jail . berlusconi , italy ’ s richest man , has repeatedly run into trouble due to his business dealings .
in december , italian president carlo azeglio ciampi decided not to sign a new media law that the opposition fears would add to the influence of the prime minister ’ s already powerful media empire . berlusconi owns three mediaset channels , italia 1 , rete 4 and canale 5 and as premier wields political influence over the board of state public broadcaster rai , mediaset 's only serious competition .

"
eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes , who is charged with overseeing the stability pact , is seeking legal backing to overturn a ruling which suspends eu budget rules for germany and france . so is this a case of solbes being a bad loser ?
why is he pushing so hard to bring the eu executive before the european court of justice when the outcome and implications of such action are so unclear ?
the proud spaniard suffered political defeat back in november of last year when the majority of ministers on the council of finance ministers voted in favor of suspending eu budget rules for france and germany on the grounds that it does n't make economic sense to punish them for stepping over the budget line .
both " offenders " say they wo n't manage to meet the three percent limit before 2005 . feeling jaded ? it is a clear political decision which the administrative powers at the eu do n't want to accept . as the union 's legislative power , the eu executive has the authority to make or change the rules , but the eu commission , which oversees european treaties , feels like it 's nose has been knocked out of joint .
solbes is particularly irritated by the fact that the ministers strayed from the official line in the treaty , binned his suggestions and came up with their own agreements for france and germany . even if the court in luxembourg were to take on the charges and were to rule in favor of the commissioners , the practical repercussions would be practically non-existent , other than to provide the commission with the chance to savor a moral victory .
it would have been far more sensible to push for a simplification of the rules and to adjust the criteria in the 1997 stability pact so as to make them reflect the economic reality of 2004 .
and this could have happened long before the power struggle between brussels and berlin began . had he acted earlier to work with pedro solbes , german finance minister hans eichel could have helped to avoid the current misery .
but given that the two men seem as stubborn minded as each other , that never happened . hard times ahead the german eu commissioner for enlargement , günter verheugen , who is opposed to the decision to seek legal action , is quite right when he says that this increased aggravation is no help for the union .
with the troubled constitution still hanging over europe 's head , member states really have more important things to worry about than an internal legal dispute . heads of state and government have to take another serious stab at creating a working constitution if the union is to maintain its reputation for being a viable institutional and political partner .
the eu has to define the financial framework for trading after 2007 and then there are the all important discussions on whether or not turkey will be granted membership .
they have to digest the addition of ten new members and with the terms of office for eu commission president , romano prodi , and his department heads due to end in november , they also have some important personnel issues to deal with . so what , in that case , is the point of dubious legal action which will do little to help the stability pact ?
the joke in brussels is that solbes is trying to imitate his famous forefather , don quijote , who made a name for himself by battling imaginary windmills .
but leaving the whisperings in brussels aside , it is certainly too soon for hans eichel to begin rejoicing .
at the end of the year he has to prove that he can sink the german budget deficit below the obligatory three percent .
it is a tough goal for eichel who has his hands full with germany 's economic development .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.01.2004 ireland puts eu constitution at the top of its agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertie ahern knows exactly which way he wants ireland 's turn at the eu presidency to go after a rocky shot at the helm of the eu presidency , italy handed the reins to ireland on january 1st .
now the irish prime minister bertie ahern has set out his intentions before the european parliament in strasbourg . the irish premier left his audience in no doubt about his top priority over the next six months .
he promised to pick the failed talks on an eu constitution off the floor and do all he could to elicit a final agreement .
" i pledge to you that the irish presidency will spare no effort to make progress and to facilitate consensus during our term in office .
the issue will command the highest priority under our presidency , " he told parliament .
ahern was also at pains to point out that time is of the essence if the european union wishes to keep its reputation in tact .
" excessive delay will damage our credibility and weaken our standing .
stalemate is not an option any of us can contemplate , " he said .
ahern said he planned to hold intensive talks with the heads of state and government ahead of the next eu summit in march , in order to come up with a possible solution to the sticking point of voting weights .
" i can assure the parliament that if my consultations suggest that there is a real prospect of agreement i will immediately move to seize the opportunity , " he said .
the talks last december , which should have been the crowning glory of italy 's six months in the eu presidential hot seat , ground to a halt when spain and poland refused to give up powerful voting rights established in the earlier nice treaty . something to celebrate a further high point during the irish presidency will be the addition of the ten new member states on may 1st .
and to mark the occasion , the irish government is planning to invite them all to dublin for a party .
as far as ahern is concerned , it is a moment in history which is well worth a celebration .
he told parliament that the founding fathers of a unified europe had dreamed of a time when europeans would never again kill each other in the name of natural resources , land or beliefs .
and with ten new states poised to join the bloc , the irish prime minister said that 2004 was a year in which europe was moving closer to making those dreams come true . with the constitution talks and eu expansion , the new president has a fat agenda for the next half a year , but looking beyond his six-month stint , he is confident that membership talks for romania and bulgaria will be concluded this year .
he is also hoping to see progress in the unification of the divided mediterranean island of cyprus .
as it stands , only the greek southern part will join the eu in may , but ahern also praised turkey 's attempts to close the gap between itself and europe .
a rallying call looking beyond europe 's borders , ahern called on the eu member states to do more in the fight against poverty and aids in africa .
he said it was crucial for developing nations that they resume talks with the world trade organization .
several members of the european parliament called on ahern to push forward his initiative on debt relief for the poorest countries in the world .
ireland wants to stimulate economic development in europe and has pledged to work towards the goal of making it the most innovative economic power in the world by the end of the decade .
ahern believes in increasing competitiveness in the union , and he voiced his support for the latest eu commission initiative to completely do away with restraints on service sector competition for professions such as doctors , lawyers , architects and pharmacists .
he told parliament that europe had to be as competitive as possible and that the greatest challenge is the desperate need for more and better employment .
ahern , who likes to go by the gallic name of taoiseach - meaning prime minister - will be turning his own attention to matters of employment over the coming months .
during his term in the rotating presidency , he will have to suggest a possible replacement for eu commission president romano prodi , whose term of office expires in november . bernd riegert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi 's star-crossed eu presidency italian premier silvio berlusconi steps down as eu council president wednesday .

now the irish prime minister bertie ahern has set out his intentions before the european parliament in strasbourg . the irish premier left his audience in no doubt about his top priority over the next six months .
he promised to pick the failed talks on an eu constitution off the floor and do all he could to elicit a final agreement .
" i pledge to you that the irish presidency will spare no effort to make progress and to facilitate consensus during our term in office .
the issue will command the highest priority under our presidency , " he told parliament .
ahern was also at pains to point out that time is of the essence if the european union wishes to keep its reputation in tact .
" excessive delay will damage our credibility and weaken our standing .
stalemate is not an option any of us can contemplate , " he said .
ahern said he planned to hold intensive talks with the heads of state and government ahead of the next eu summit in march , in order to come up with a possible solution to the sticking point of voting weights .
" i can assure the parliament that if my consultations suggest that there is a real prospect of agreement i will immediately move to seize the opportunity , " he said .
the talks last december , which should have been the crowning glory of italy 's six months in the eu presidential hot seat , ground to a halt when spain and poland refused to give up powerful voting rights established in the earlier nice treaty . something to celebrate a further high point during the irish presidency will be the addition of the ten new member states on may 1st .
and to mark the occasion , the irish government is planning to invite them all to dublin for a party .
as far as ahern is concerned , it is a moment in history which is well worth a celebration .
he told parliament that the founding fathers of a unified europe had dreamed of a time when europeans would never again kill each other in the name of natural resources , land or beliefs .
and with ten new states poised to join the bloc , the irish prime minister said that 2004 was a year in which europe was moving closer to making those dreams come true . with the constitution talks and eu expansion , the new president has a fat agenda for the next half a year , but looking beyond his six-month stint , he is confident that membership talks for romania and bulgaria will be concluded this year .
he is also hoping to see progress in the unification of the divided mediterranean island of cyprus .
as it stands , only the greek southern part will join the eu in may , but ahern also praised turkey 's attempts to close the gap between itself and europe .
a rallying call looking beyond europe 's borders , ahern called on the eu member states to do more in the fight against poverty and aids in africa .
he said it was crucial for developing nations that they resume talks with the world trade organization .
several members of the european parliament called on ahern to push forward his initiative on debt relief for the poorest countries in the world .
ireland wants to stimulate economic development in europe and has pledged to work towards the goal of making it the most innovative economic power in the world by the end of the decade .
ahern believes in increasing competitiveness in the union , and he voiced his support for the latest eu commission initiative to completely do away with restraints on service sector competition for professions such as doctors , lawyers , architects and pharmacists .
he told parliament that europe had to be as competitive as possible and that the greatest challenge is the desperate need for more and better employment .
ahern , who likes to go by the gallic name of taoiseach - meaning prime minister - will be turning his own attention to matters of employment over the coming months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 14.01.2004 bundeswehr cuts could hurt german defense industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wo n't be cancelling its order for 180 eurofighter combat aircraft , but other missile projects will be scrapped .
defense minister peter struck 's announcement that some € 26 billion will be cut from the bundeswehr 's spending plans will hit the german arms industry hard . bundeswehr generals will be rewriting their wish lists after peter struck outlined his plans to reduce military spending on tuesday .
several missile projects are now set to be scrapped , and overall , the new budget constraints mean ever fewer contracts for arms manufacturers .
although the government says it will be sticking to procurement contracts already signed , such as orders for 180 eurofighter combat aircraft , the tiger combat helicopter and nh90 transport helicopter , projects such as upgrading the patriot missile defense systems and plans to buy a pilotless reconnaissance drone for the navy , will likely now be shelved .
a blow to industrial growth the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- fears the defense ministry 's move will have negative repercussions on the country 's industrial growth .
helmut harff , director of the bdi 's defense industries committee , says germany 's role within the european arms industry will now be severely reduced .
in an interview with deutsche welle , he said that " peter struck 's plans did n't come as a surprise to the defense industry , but it received very little information in advance . "
harff pointed out that " one needs to bear in mind that via the defense ministry , the government is the arms industry 's primary client , and for this section of the industry , the announced cuts mean major changes to existing business plans . "
a missed opportunity experts said the trend towards international mergers and alliances is now set to increase as a result of the defense cutbacks . harff , who served as first commander of the german troops in kosovo , predicted that germany may end up fast selling off its state-of-the-art technology .
although arms make up a very small share of germany 's total exports , he argued that the new cuts might mean germany could miss out on the opportunity to continue selling high-tech products on international markets .
" overall , exports of german munitions last year amounted to just 0.06 percent of germany 's total exports , which is very low , " said harff , before adding that " it 's important to maintain the technological means for manufacturing these munitions so that the country remains a player on the world market . "
a muted reaction so far , there 's been a muted reaction from business .
europe 's leading supplier of land forces systems , rheinmetall has welcomed the defense minister 's proposals because the company can now factor the cuts into its own planning security . but another company , kraus-maffei wegmann , a system vendor in the area of armored vehicles , has announced it does n't expect to be affected by the cuts .
germany 's arms industry may not have been given due warning of struck 's drastic agenda , but many companies are well-prepared nonetheless , having already introduced their own austerity measures some time ago and opted for new business strategies .
the same day the government revealed its plans , for example , european missile system manufacturer diehl announced it would be setting up a joint venture with american rival company raytheon to market a special sidewinder guided missile .
adhering to international agreements although the arms industry appears rather unruffled by the imminent cuts , harff pointed out that , in germany , the defense budget is a uniquely thorny issue .
he said he believes the key issue here is not so much arms spending , but rather security provisions for the future .
in that respect , he said , germany is is not sticking to international agreements .
" nato wants to see 2.3 percent of gross domestic product spent on security provisions , and in germany only 1.5 percent is being spent , " he observed .
but harff said he believes this has to change .

defense minister peter struck 's announcement that some € 26 billion will be cut from the bundeswehr 's spending plans will hit the german arms industry hard . bundeswehr generals will be rewriting their wish lists after peter struck outlined his plans to reduce military spending on tuesday .
several missile projects are now set to be scrapped , and overall , the new budget constraints mean ever fewer contracts for arms manufacturers .
although the government says it will be sticking to procurement contracts already signed , such as orders for 180 eurofighter combat aircraft , the tiger combat helicopter and nh90 transport helicopter , projects such as upgrading the patriot missile defense systems and plans to buy a pilotless reconnaissance drone for the navy , will likely now be shelved .
a blow to industrial growth the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- fears the defense ministry 's move will have negative repercussions on the country 's industrial growth .
helmut harff , director of the bdi 's defense industries committee , says germany 's role within the european arms industry will now be severely reduced .
in an interview with deutsche welle , he said that " peter struck 's plans did n't come as a surprise to the defense industry , but it received very little information in advance . "
harff pointed out that " one needs to bear in mind that via the defense ministry , the government is the arms industry 's primary client , and for this section of the industry , the announced cuts mean major changes to existing business plans . "
a missed opportunity experts said the trend towards international mergers and alliances is now set to increase as a result of the defense cutbacks . harff , who served as first commander of the german troops in kosovo , predicted that germany may end up fast selling off its state-of-the-art technology .
although arms make up a very small share of germany 's total exports , he argued that the new cuts might mean germany could miss out on the opportunity to continue selling high-tech products on international markets .
" overall , exports of german munitions last year amounted to just 0.06 percent of germany 's total exports , which is very low , " said harff , before adding that " it 's important to maintain the technological means for manufacturing these munitions so that the country remains a player on the world market . "
a muted reaction so far , there 's been a muted reaction from business .
europe 's leading supplier of land forces systems , rheinmetall has welcomed the defense minister 's proposals because the company can now factor the cuts into its own planning security . but another company , kraus-maffei wegmann , a system vendor in the area of armored vehicles , has announced it does n't expect to be affected by the cuts .
germany 's arms industry may not have been given due warning of struck 's drastic agenda , but many companies are well-prepared nonetheless , having already introduced their own austerity measures some time ago and opted for new business strategies .
the same day the government revealed its plans , for example , european missile system manufacturer diehl announced it would be setting up a joint venture with american rival company raytheon to market a special sidewinder guided missile .
adhering to international agreements although the arms industry appears rather unruffled by the imminent cuts , harff pointed out that , in germany , the defense budget is a uniquely thorny issue .
he said he believes the key issue here is not so much arms spending , but rather security provisions for the future .
in that respect , he said , germany is is not sticking to international agreements .
" nato wants to see 2.3 percent of gross domestic product spent on security provisions , and in germany only 1.5 percent is being spent , " he observed .

" overall , exports of german munitions last year amounted to just 0.06 percent of germany 's total exports , which is very low , " said harff , before adding that " it 's important to maintain the technological means for manufacturing these munitions so that the country remains a player on the world market . "
a muted reaction so far , there 's been a muted reaction from business .
europe 's leading supplier of land forces systems , rheinmetall has welcomed the defense minister 's proposals because the company can now factor the cuts into its own planning security . but another company , kraus-maffei wegmann , a system vendor in the area of armored vehicles , has announced it does n't expect to be affected by the cuts .
germany 's arms industry may not have been given due warning of struck 's drastic agenda , but many companies are well-prepared nonetheless , having already introduced their own austerity measures some time ago and opted for new business strategies .
the same day the government revealed its plans , for example , european missile system manufacturer diehl announced it would be setting up a joint venture with american rival company raytheon to market a special sidewinder guided missile .
adhering to international agreements although the arms industry appears rather unruffled by the imminent cuts , harff pointed out that , in germany , the defense budget is a uniquely thorny issue .
he said he believes the key issue here is not so much arms spending , but rather security provisions for the future .
in that respect , he said , germany is is not sticking to international agreements .
" nato wants to see 2.3 percent of gross domestic product spent on security provisions , and in germany only 1.5 percent is being spent , " he observed .
but harff said he believes this has to change .
" other countries invest considerably more , " he said .
" last year , for example , france invested three times as much -lrb- in its military -rrb- as germany .

now the irish prime minister bertie ahern has set out his intentions before the european parliament in strasbourg . the irish premier left his audience in no doubt about his top priority over the next six months .
he promised to pick the failed talks on an eu constitution off the floor and do all he could to elicit a final agreement .
" i pledge to you that the irish presidency will spare no effort to make progress and to facilitate consensus during our term in office .
the issue will command the highest priority under our presidency , " he told parliament .
ahern was also at pains to point out that time is of the essence if the european union wishes to keep its reputation in tact .
" excessive delay will damage our credibility and weaken our standing .
stalemate is not an option any of us can contemplate , " he said .
ahern said he planned to hold intensive talks with the heads of state and government ahead of the next eu summit in march , in order to come up with a possible solution to the sticking point of voting weights .
" i can assure the parliament that if my consultations suggest that there is a real prospect of agreement i will immediately move to seize the opportunity , " he said .
the talks last december , which should have been the crowning glory of italy 's six months in the eu presidential hot seat , ground to a halt when spain and poland refused to give up powerful voting rights established in the earlier nice treaty . something to celebrate a further high point during the irish presidency will be the addition of the ten new member states on may 1st .
and to mark the occasion , the irish government is planning to invite them all to dublin for a party .
as far as ahern is concerned , it is a moment in history which is well worth a celebration .
he told parliament that the founding fathers of a unified europe had dreamed of a time when europeans would never again kill each other in the name of natural resources , land or beliefs .
and with ten new states poised to join the bloc , the irish prime minister said that 2004 was a year in which europe was moving closer to making those dreams come true . with the constitution talks and eu expansion , the new president has a fat agenda for the next half a year , but looking beyond his six-month stint , he is confident that membership talks for romania and bulgaria will be concluded this year .
he is also hoping to see progress in the unification of the divided mediterranean island of cyprus .
as it stands , only the greek southern part will join the eu in may , but ahern also praised turkey 's attempts to close the gap between itself and europe .
a rallying call looking beyond europe 's borders , ahern called on the eu member states to do more in the fight against poverty and aids in africa .
he said it was crucial for developing nations that they resume talks with the world trade organization .
several members of the european parliament called on ahern to push forward his initiative on debt relief for the poorest countries in the world .
ireland wants to stimulate economic development in europe and has pledged to work towards the goal of making it the most innovative economic power in the world by the end of the decade .
ahern believes in increasing competitiveness in the union , and he voiced his support for the latest eu commission initiative to completely do away with restraints on service sector competition for professions such as doctors , lawyers , architects and pharmacists .
he told parliament that europe had to be as competitive as possible and that the greatest challenge is the desperate need for more and better employment .
ahern , who likes to go by the gallic name of taoiseach - meaning prime minister - will be turning his own attention to matters of employment over the coming months .

a camera mounted on the mars express orbiter is expected to produce unprecedented images of the planet over the next years .
first images will be released next week .
dw-world took a look behind the scenes . berlin - ralf jaumann expects to feel a little edgy over the next two years .
the planetary geologist at the german aerospace center ’ s -lrb- dlr -rrb- institute for planetary research in berlin will be one of the first people to receive data collected by the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- .
“ every time we switch it on or off , i ’ m nervous , ” said jaumann , who will turn the data into raw images before sending the latter on for further analysis .
“ it will certainly become a matter of routine , but not completely . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf jaumann during a dw-tv interview .
last friday jaumann -lrb- photo -rrb- got another chance to jitter as the camera began searching for signs of the missing beagle 2 lander .
the robot probably crashed during touchdown on the martian surface . while beagle 2 was designed to conduct a small percentage of the mission ’ s ground experiments , focus is likely to shift now to the camera and other instruments mounted on the orbiter , such as marsis , a sub-surface sounding radar altimeter searching for water under the planet ’ s crust , or spicam , an ultraviolet and infrared spectrometer that will study the martian atmosphere . not all hope has been lost for finding the lander , however , and jaumann and his colleagues have been given a lot of data storage space on the orbiter to search for beagle 2 .
but neither he nor gerhard neukum , the hrsc project ’ s principal investigator at berlin ’ s free university , believe there ’ s much of a chance to discover the tiny robot . “ we haven ’ t seen beagle yet , ” neukum said on wednesday after looking through the first batch of “ outstanding ” data he ’ s received so far .
even though the probe has n't turned up , " these are the best data ever recorded , ” neukum said . while other missions , such as nasa ’ s global surveyor mission , have already produced high resolution images , the hrsc ’ s capability to produce colorful , three-dimensional pictures is a first , according to neukum .
“ we will be able to look at mars like we do with our eyes here on the surface of the earth , ” he said . in addition , an infrared image would allow scientists to determine the abundance of specific minerals on mars , neukum said .
he added that first images would be released to the public by jan .

tv crews are often disappointed when they come to visit his office in a non-descript building on the outskirts of the german capital , jaumann said .

a camera mounted on the mars express orbiter is expected to produce unprecedented images of the planet over the next years .
first images will be released next week .
dw-world took a look behind the scenes . berlin - ralf jaumann expects to feel a little edgy over the next two years .
the planetary geologist at the german aerospace center ’ s -lrb- dlr -rrb- institute for planetary research in berlin will be one of the first people to receive data collected by the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- .
“ every time we switch it on or off , i ’ m nervous , ” said jaumann , who will turn the data into raw images before sending the latter on for further analysis .
“ it will certainly become a matter of routine , but not completely . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf jaumann during a dw-tv interview .
last friday jaumann -lrb- photo -rrb- got another chance to jitter as the camera began searching for signs of the missing beagle 2 lander .
the robot probably crashed during touchdown on the martian surface . while beagle 2 was designed to conduct a small percentage of the mission ’ s ground experiments , focus is likely to shift now to the camera and other instruments mounted on the orbiter , such as marsis , a sub-surface sounding radar altimeter searching for water under the planet ’ s crust , or spicam , an ultraviolet and infrared spectrometer that will study the martian atmosphere . not all hope has been lost for finding the lander , however , and jaumann and his colleagues have been given a lot of data storage space on the orbiter to search for beagle 2 .
but neither he nor gerhard neukum , the hrsc project ’ s principal investigator at berlin ’ s free university , believe there ’ s much of a chance to discover the tiny robot . “ we haven ’ t seen beagle yet , ” neukum said on wednesday after looking through the first batch of “ outstanding ” data he ’ s received so far .
even though the probe has n't turned up , " these are the best data ever recorded , ” neukum said . while other missions , such as nasa ’ s global surveyor mission , have already produced high resolution images , the hrsc ’ s capability to produce colorful , three-dimensional pictures is a first , according to neukum .
“ we will be able to look at mars like we do with our eyes here on the surface of the earth , ” he said . in addition , an infrared image would allow scientists to determine the abundance of specific minerals on mars , neukum said .
he added that first images would be released to the public by jan .
20 . sending commands , receiving data while neukum and his team of 43 co-investigators will use the data to produce three-dimensional images and analyze them , jaumann and a group of 10 scientists will be testing and sending future commands to the camera and processing incoming data on a daily basis . the team does n't work in a big mission control center like the one in darmstadt , germany , where the mars express mission and the orbiter 's flight path is monitored .
tv crews are often disappointed when they come to visit his office in a non-descript building on the outskirts of the german capital , jaumann said .
“ years ago we had rooms with big computers , but now we get our data on machines like this one , ” he said , pointing to his apple powerbook . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a drawing of the hrsc camera .
to test commands , jaumann and his colleagues can work with an exact replica of the camera , which sits in a dlr laboratory .
several dozen screws have to be adjusted to find the perfect position .
“ it ’ s nothing spectacular , ” he said , pointing to the 20 kg -lrb- 44 pound -rrb- instrument that ’ s mounted on a table .
“ but hopefully it will produce spectacular pictures . ” mapping mars like never before the hrsc project ’ s goal is to produce a three-dimensional , colorful map of the entire martian surface at a resolution that has never been achieved before . detailed images of the red planet ’ s polar caps or volcanic regions will be even more interesting for scientists working on the project , however .
“ it ’ s more interesting to do fewer things in great detail rather than to do everything at a resolution that we have done with other missions , ” said wojciech markiewicz , a planetary scientist at the max planck institute for aeronomy in katlenburg-lindau in central germany . the camera ’ s images will allow scientists to locate rocks as small as two meters -lrb- 6.5 feet -rrb- , according to jaumann , who added that he expects the project to answer the question whether it ever rained on mars . putting the camera to work on earth the hrsc technology is not only useful for gaining a greater understanding of mars , however : a modified version of the camera has already mapped regions on earth .
many possibilities exist to put the instrument to commercial use , jaumann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insurance companies could use the camera to assess damage after a flood like the one in saxony in 2002 .
telecommunication companies could use the images to pinpoint the best locations for their antennae , cities could take inventory of things such as street signs , park benches and trees by looking at the pictures , jaumann said .
insurance companies could assess damage caused by floods immediately , hence preventing fraudulent claims later on .
even the european union could monitor fields of farmers who receive subsidies for not planting anything on their land . but others , who work in the commercial sector , will have to look into these options , jaumann said , adding that data from the hrsc will keep scientists busy for years to come .

a camera mounted on the mars express orbiter is expected to produce unprecedented images of the planet over the next years .
first images will be released next week .
dw-world took a look behind the scenes . berlin - ralf jaumann expects to feel a little edgy over the next two years .
the planetary geologist at the german aerospace center ’ s -lrb- dlr -rrb- institute for planetary research in berlin will be one of the first people to receive data collected by the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- .
“ every time we switch it on or off , i ’ m nervous , ” said jaumann , who will turn the data into raw images before sending the latter on for further analysis .
“ it will certainly become a matter of routine , but not completely . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf jaumann during a dw-tv interview .
last friday jaumann -lrb- photo -rrb- got another chance to jitter as the camera began searching for signs of the missing beagle 2 lander .
the robot probably crashed during touchdown on the martian surface . while beagle 2 was designed to conduct a small percentage of the mission ’ s ground experiments , focus is likely to shift now to the camera and other instruments mounted on the orbiter , such as marsis , a sub-surface sounding radar altimeter searching for water under the planet ’ s crust , or spicam , an ultraviolet and infrared spectrometer that will study the martian atmosphere . not all hope has been lost for finding the lander , however , and jaumann and his colleagues have been given a lot of data storage space on the orbiter to search for beagle 2 .
but neither he nor gerhard neukum , the hrsc project ’ s principal investigator at berlin ’ s free university , believe there ’ s much of a chance to discover the tiny robot . “ we haven ’ t seen beagle yet , ” neukum said on wednesday after looking through the first batch of “ outstanding ” data he ’ s received so far .
even though the probe has n't turned up , " these are the best data ever recorded , ” neukum said . while other missions , such as nasa ’ s global surveyor mission , have already produced high resolution images , the hrsc ’ s capability to produce colorful , three-dimensional pictures is a first , according to neukum .
“ we will be able to look at mars like we do with our eyes here on the surface of the earth , ” he said . in addition , an infrared image would allow scientists to determine the abundance of specific minerals on mars , neukum said .
he added that first images would be released to the public by jan .
20 . sending commands , receiving data while neukum and his team of 43 co-investigators will use the data to produce three-dimensional images and analyze them , jaumann and a group of 10 scientists will be testing and sending future commands to the camera and processing incoming data on a daily basis . the team does n't work in a big mission control center like the one in darmstadt , germany , where the mars express mission and the orbiter 's flight path is monitored .
tv crews are often disappointed when they come to visit his office in a non-descript building on the outskirts of the german capital , jaumann said .
“ years ago we had rooms with big computers , but now we get our data on machines like this one , ” he said , pointing to his apple powerbook . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a drawing of the hrsc camera .
to test commands , jaumann and his colleagues can work with an exact replica of the camera , which sits in a dlr laboratory .
several dozen screws have to be adjusted to find the perfect position .
“ it ’ s nothing spectacular , ” he said , pointing to the 20 kg -lrb- 44 pound -rrb- instrument that ’ s mounted on a table .
“ but hopefully it will produce spectacular pictures . ” mapping mars like never before the hrsc project ’ s goal is to produce a three-dimensional , colorful map of the entire martian surface at a resolution that has never been achieved before . detailed images of the red planet ’ s polar caps or volcanic regions will be even more interesting for scientists working on the project , however .
“ it ’ s more interesting to do fewer things in great detail rather than to do everything at a resolution that we have done with other missions , ” said wojciech markiewicz , a planetary scientist at the max planck institute for aeronomy in katlenburg-lindau in central germany . the camera ’ s images will allow scientists to locate rocks as small as two meters -lrb- 6.5 feet -rrb- , according to jaumann , who added that he expects the project to answer the question whether it ever rained on mars . putting the camera to work on earth the hrsc technology is not only useful for gaining a greater understanding of mars , however : a modified version of the camera has already mapped regions on earth .
many possibilities exist to put the instrument to commercial use , jaumann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insurance companies could use the camera to assess damage after a flood like the one in saxony in 2002 .
telecommunication companies could use the images to pinpoint the best locations for their antennae , cities could take inventory of things such as street signs , park benches and trees by looking at the pictures , jaumann said .
insurance companies could assess damage caused by floods immediately , hence preventing fraudulent claims later on .
even the european union could monitor fields of farmers who receive subsidies for not planting anything on their land . but others , who work in the commercial sector , will have to look into these options , jaumann said , adding that data from the hrsc will keep scientists busy for years to come .
“ we ’ re still working with apollo and viking data today , ” he said , referring to missions that ended decades ago . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mapping mars berlin-based planetary scientist gerhard neukum recently talked to dw-world about his plans to produce a three-dimensional map of mars with a camera mounted on european space agency ’ s mars express .

the ratings of a new reality tv show in germany are climbing as minor celebrities are put through daily hair-raising ‘ challenges ’ in the australian jungle .
but as the tests get crueler , criticism is starting to grow . germany ’ s private television channel rtl has hit ratings pay dirt with its version of the british and american show “ i ’ m a celebrity get me out of here . ”
called “ ich bin ein star holt mich hier raus ” in german , the show has dropped ten b-list celebrities into a jungle in australia for 12 days . despite being inundated by reality tv in recent years , german viewers are flocking to the program , which forces one member of the group to undertake a stunt testing their courage each day in order to earn food for all .
but after a singer of questionable talent was forced to lie in a " cockroach coffin " with 30,000 of the wriggly creatures and an out-of-work tv host was pecked nearly to tears by a band of aggressive ostriches , media watchdogs and other groups are beginning to question the show ’ s lack of moral grounding . “ i ’ ve really been blown over .
these are methods that are reminiscent of torture tactics , ” jo groebel , the director of the european institute for the media in düsseldorf , told the associated press on wednesday . alarm bells for many went off when daniel küblböck , who become a celebrity as a performer in the german version of " pop idol , " suffered a panic attack after putting his head in a “ terror aquarium ” filled with eels and water spiders .
the melodramatic 18-year-old was forced to do three stunts in a row by the schadenfreude-filled audience , who voted by telephone on which cast member would be forced into the humiliating acts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel and the cockroaches .
walter eykmann from a national catholic church group told the daily tabloid newspaper bild that rtl was putting “ profits and ratings ” above the participants well-being .
“ it ’ s absolutely repugnant how daniel küblböck is being abused , ” eykmann said . plenty of publicity though the candidates earn € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,276 -rrb- for each day they stay in the camp for the charity of their choice , the real motivation is likely the free publicity that could help their careers .
shown live each evening , the show 's ratings have swelled in recent days .
on tuesday , it garnered a whopping third of the total viewing audience . despite the growing popularity of “ i ’ m a celebrity get me out of here , ” the company said it has so far kept the price of a 30-second commercial spot steady at € 34,500 .
and rtl has defended the program , saying all those taking part were aware of what they were getting into . “ the participants are acting of their own will and are public persons who know exactly what they are doing , ” said an rtl spokesman .
“ we aren ’ t torturing anyone . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krokodil im kölner zoo but some animal rights groups see things differently , saying that even if the celebrities can choose not to take part , the the snakes , spiders and cockroaches used in the television stunts can ’ t .

the ratings of a new reality tv show in germany are climbing as minor celebrities are put through daily hair-raising ‘ challenges ’ in the australian jungle .
but as the tests get crueler , criticism is starting to grow . germany ’ s private television channel rtl has hit ratings pay dirt with its version of the british and american show “ i ’ m a celebrity get me out of here . ”
called “ ich bin ein star holt mich hier raus ” in german , the show has dropped ten b-list celebrities into a jungle in australia for 12 days . despite being inundated by reality tv in recent years , german viewers are flocking to the program , which forces one member of the group to undertake a stunt testing their courage each day in order to earn food for all .
but after a singer of questionable talent was forced to lie in a " cockroach coffin " with 30,000 of the wriggly creatures and an out-of-work tv host was pecked nearly to tears by a band of aggressive ostriches , media watchdogs and other groups are beginning to question the show ’ s lack of moral grounding . “ i ’ ve really been blown over .
these are methods that are reminiscent of torture tactics , ” jo groebel , the director of the european institute for the media in düsseldorf , told the associated press on wednesday . alarm bells for many went off when daniel küblböck , who become a celebrity as a performer in the german version of " pop idol , " suffered a panic attack after putting his head in a “ terror aquarium ” filled with eels and water spiders .
the melodramatic 18-year-old was forced to do three stunts in a row by the schadenfreude-filled audience , who voted by telephone on which cast member would be forced into the humiliating acts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel and the cockroaches .
walter eykmann from a national catholic church group told the daily tabloid newspaper bild that rtl was putting “ profits and ratings ” above the participants well-being .
“ it ’ s absolutely repugnant how daniel küblböck is being abused , ” eykmann said . plenty of publicity though the candidates earn € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,276 -rrb- for each day they stay in the camp for the charity of their choice , the real motivation is likely the free publicity that could help their careers .

italy ’ s highest court on tuesday annulled a controversial legal immunity law that had shielded top officials from prosecution while in office .
prime minister silvio berlusconi could now once again face bribery charges . the law , which was passed last june , gave the country ’ s five highest officials immunity , but it has been criticized as existing solely to end berlusconi ’ s numerous legal headaches .
dubbed “ lex berlusconi ” by some , it helped the prime minister avoid possible conviction while italy held the rotating eu presidency last autumn . since the court has determined that the law is unconstitutional , berlusconi will once again face trial for allegedly bribing judges in the 1980s while he was a business man .
the trial had been stopped after the law went into effect . “ every man is the same before the law , ” antonio di pietro , an opposition member of parliament and former crusading prosecutor , told the associated press after the legislation was annulled . but berlusconi ’ s justice minister roberto castelli criticized the verdict , saying it could complicate relations between politicians and the judiciary .
“ i fear after this verdict the polemics will become even worse , ” he said . early elections ? berlusconi has repeatedly contended that he has done no wrong and left-wing magistrates have mounted an unfounded campaign against him .
in the face of a possible onslaught of politically motivated legal action against him , berlusconi is reportedly considering calling early elections . “ if that ’ s how things stand , then it ’ s better to go back to the polls , ” he told the daily newspaper corriere della sera . " the teflon premier " a billionaire media mogul turned politician , berlusconi has gone to court eight times over the past decade for varying corruption offenses .
he has been found guilty several times , however , by winning on appeal or due to the statute of limitations nothing has stuck to the " teflon premier . " though the latest case against berlusconi was stopped this summer after the immunity law was passed , the trial against his business associated continued .
a key charge that a firm owned by berlusconi bribed judges to win approval of a corporate takeover in the 1980s was rejected , but a court did convict berlusconi friend and lawyer cesare previti of paying off a rome judge .
previti is currently appealing his sentence of five years in jail . berlusconi , italy ’ s richest man , has repeatedly run into trouble due to his business dealings .

italy ’ s highest court on tuesday annulled a controversial legal immunity law that had shielded top officials from prosecution while in office .
prime minister silvio berlusconi could now once again face bribery charges . the law , which was passed last june , gave the country ’ s five highest officials immunity , but it has been criticized as existing solely to end berlusconi ’ s numerous legal headaches .
dubbed “ lex berlusconi ” by some , it helped the prime minister avoid possible conviction while italy held the rotating eu presidency last autumn . since the court has determined that the law is unconstitutional , berlusconi will once again face trial for allegedly bribing judges in the 1980s while he was a business man .
the trial had been stopped after the law went into effect . “ every man is the same before the law , ” antonio di pietro , an opposition member of parliament and former crusading prosecutor , told the associated press after the legislation was annulled . but berlusconi ’ s justice minister roberto castelli criticized the verdict , saying it could complicate relations between politicians and the judiciary .
“ i fear after this verdict the polemics will become even worse , ” he said . early elections ? berlusconi has repeatedly contended that he has done no wrong and left-wing magistrates have mounted an unfounded campaign against him .
in the face of a possible onslaught of politically motivated legal action against him , berlusconi is reportedly considering calling early elections . “ if that ’ s how things stand , then it ’ s better to go back to the polls , ” he told the daily newspaper corriere della sera . " the teflon premier " a billionaire media mogul turned politician , berlusconi has gone to court eight times over the past decade for varying corruption offenses .
he has been found guilty several times , however , by winning on appeal or due to the statute of limitations nothing has stuck to the " teflon premier . " though the latest case against berlusconi was stopped this summer after the immunity law was passed , the trial against his business associated continued .
a key charge that a firm owned by berlusconi bribed judges to win approval of a corporate takeover in the 1980s was rejected , but a court did convict berlusconi friend and lawyer cesare previti of paying off a rome judge .
previti is currently appealing his sentence of five years in jail . berlusconi , italy ’ s richest man , has repeatedly run into trouble due to his business dealings .
in december , italian president carlo azeglio ciampi decided not to sign a new media law that the opposition fears would add to the influence of the prime minister ’ s already powerful media empire . berlusconi owns three mediaset channels , italia 1 , rete 4 and canale 5 and as premier wields political influence over the board of state public broadcaster rai , mediaset 's only serious competition .

"
eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes , who is charged with overseeing the stability pact , is seeking legal backing to overturn a ruling which suspends eu budget rules for germany and france . so is this a case of solbes being a bad loser ?
why is he pushing so hard to bring the eu executive before the european court of justice when the outcome and implications of such action are so unclear ?
the proud spaniard suffered political defeat back in november of last year when the majority of ministers on the council of finance ministers voted in favor of suspending eu budget rules for france and germany on the grounds that it does n't make economic sense to punish them for stepping over the budget line .
both " offenders " say they wo n't manage to meet the three percent limit before 2005 . feeling jaded ? it is a clear political decision which the administrative powers at the eu do n't want to accept . as the union 's legislative power , the eu executive has the authority to make or change the rules , but the eu commission , which oversees european treaties , feels like it 's nose has been knocked out of joint .
solbes is particularly irritated by the fact that the ministers strayed from the official line in the treaty , binned his suggestions and came up with their own agreements for france and germany . even if the court in luxembourg were to take on the charges and were to rule in favor of the commissioners , the practical repercussions would be practically non-existent , other than to provide the commission with the chance to savor a moral victory .
it would have been far more sensible to push for a simplification of the rules and to adjust the criteria in the 1997 stability pact so as to make them reflect the economic reality of 2004 .
and this could have happened long before the power struggle between brussels and berlin began . had he acted earlier to work with pedro solbes , german finance minister hans eichel could have helped to avoid the current misery .
but given that the two men seem as stubborn minded as each other , that never happened . hard times ahead the german eu commissioner for enlargement , günter verheugen , who is opposed to the decision to seek legal action , is quite right when he says that this increased aggravation is no help for the union .
with the troubled constitution still hanging over europe 's head , member states really have more important things to worry about than an internal legal dispute . heads of state and government have to take another serious stab at creating a working constitution if the union is to maintain its reputation for being a viable institutional and political partner .
the eu has to define the financial framework for trading after 2007 and then there are the all important discussions on whether or not turkey will be granted membership .
they have to digest the addition of ten new members and with the terms of office for eu commission president , romano prodi , and his department heads due to end in november , they also have some important personnel issues to deal with . so what , in that case , is the point of dubious legal action which will do little to help the stability pact ?
the joke in brussels is that solbes is trying to imitate his famous forefather , don quijote , who made a name for himself by battling imaginary windmills .
but leaving the whisperings in brussels aside , it is certainly too soon for hans eichel to begin rejoicing .
at the end of the year he has to prove that he can sink the german budget deficit below the obligatory three percent .
it is a tough goal for eichel who has his hands full with germany 's economic development .

eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes , who is charged with overseeing the stability pact , is seeking legal backing to overturn a ruling which suspends eu budget rules for germany and france . so is this a case of solbes being a bad loser ?

defense minister peter struck 's announcement that some € 26 billion will be cut from the bundeswehr 's spending plans will hit the german arms industry hard . bundeswehr generals will be rewriting their wish lists after peter struck outlined his plans to reduce military spending on tuesday .
several missile projects are now set to be scrapped , and overall , the new budget constraints mean ever fewer contracts for arms manufacturers .
although the government says it will be sticking to procurement contracts already signed , such as orders for 180 eurofighter combat aircraft , the tiger combat helicopter and nh90 transport helicopter , projects such as upgrading the patriot missile defense systems and plans to buy a pilotless reconnaissance drone for the navy , will likely now be shelved .
a blow to industrial growth the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- fears the defense ministry 's move will have negative repercussions on the country 's industrial growth .
helmut harff , director of the bdi 's defense industries committee , says germany 's role within the european arms industry will now be severely reduced .
in an interview with deutsche welle , he said that " peter struck 's plans did n't come as a surprise to the defense industry , but it received very little information in advance . "
harff pointed out that " one needs to bear in mind that via the defense ministry , the government is the arms industry 's primary client , and for this section of the industry , the announced cuts mean major changes to existing business plans . "
a missed opportunity experts said the trend towards international mergers and alliances is now set to increase as a result of the defense cutbacks . harff , who served as first commander of the german troops in kosovo , predicted that germany may end up fast selling off its state-of-the-art technology .
although arms make up a very small share of germany 's total exports , he argued that the new cuts might mean germany could miss out on the opportunity to continue selling high-tech products on international markets .
" overall , exports of german munitions last year amounted to just 0.06 percent of germany 's total exports , which is very low , " said harff , before adding that " it 's important to maintain the technological means for manufacturing these munitions so that the country remains a player on the world market . "
a muted reaction so far , there 's been a muted reaction from business .
europe 's leading supplier of land forces systems , rheinmetall has welcomed the defense minister 's proposals because the company can now factor the cuts into its own planning security . but another company , kraus-maffei wegmann , a system vendor in the area of armored vehicles , has announced it does n't expect to be affected by the cuts .
germany 's arms industry may not have been given due warning of struck 's drastic agenda , but many companies are well-prepared nonetheless , having already introduced their own austerity measures some time ago and opted for new business strategies .
the same day the government revealed its plans , for example , european missile system manufacturer diehl announced it would be setting up a joint venture with american rival company raytheon to market a special sidewinder guided missile .
adhering to international agreements although the arms industry appears rather unruffled by the imminent cuts , harff pointed out that , in germany , the defense budget is a uniquely thorny issue .
he said he believes the key issue here is not so much arms spending , but rather security provisions for the future .
in that respect , he said , germany is is not sticking to international agreements .
" nato wants to see 2.3 percent of gross domestic product spent on security provisions , and in germany only 1.5 percent is being spent , " he observed .
but harff said he believes this has to change .

defense minister peter struck 's announcement that some € 26 billion will be cut from the bundeswehr 's spending plans will hit the german arms industry hard . bundeswehr generals will be rewriting their wish lists after peter struck outlined his plans to reduce military spending on tuesday .
several missile projects are now set to be scrapped , and overall , the new budget constraints mean ever fewer contracts for arms manufacturers .
although the government says it will be sticking to procurement contracts already signed , such as orders for 180 eurofighter combat aircraft , the tiger combat helicopter and nh90 transport helicopter , projects such as upgrading the patriot missile defense systems and plans to buy a pilotless reconnaissance drone for the navy , will likely now be shelved .
a blow to industrial growth the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- fears the defense ministry 's move will have negative repercussions on the country 's industrial growth .
helmut harff , director of the bdi 's defense industries committee , says germany 's role within the european arms industry will now be severely reduced .
in an interview with deutsche welle , he said that " peter struck 's plans did n't come as a surprise to the defense industry , but it received very little information in advance . "
harff pointed out that " one needs to bear in mind that via the defense ministry , the government is the arms industry 's primary client , and for this section of the industry , the announced cuts mean major changes to existing business plans . "
a missed opportunity experts said the trend towards international mergers and alliances is now set to increase as a result of the defense cutbacks . harff , who served as first commander of the german troops in kosovo , predicted that germany may end up fast selling off its state-of-the-art technology .
although arms make up a very small share of germany 's total exports , he argued that the new cuts might mean germany could miss out on the opportunity to continue selling high-tech products on international markets .
" overall , exports of german munitions last year amounted to just 0.06 percent of germany 's total exports , which is very low , " said harff , before adding that " it 's important to maintain the technological means for manufacturing these munitions so that the country remains a player on the world market . "
a muted reaction so far , there 's been a muted reaction from business .
europe 's leading supplier of land forces systems , rheinmetall has welcomed the defense minister 's proposals because the company can now factor the cuts into its own planning security . but another company , kraus-maffei wegmann , a system vendor in the area of armored vehicles , has announced it does n't expect to be affected by the cuts .
germany 's arms industry may not have been given due warning of struck 's drastic agenda , but many companies are well-prepared nonetheless , having already introduced their own austerity measures some time ago and opted for new business strategies .
the same day the government revealed its plans , for example , european missile system manufacturer diehl announced it would be setting up a joint venture with american rival company raytheon to market a special sidewinder guided missile .
adhering to international agreements although the arms industry appears rather unruffled by the imminent cuts , harff pointed out that , in germany , the defense budget is a uniquely thorny issue .
he said he believes the key issue here is not so much arms spending , but rather security provisions for the future .
in that respect , he said , germany is is not sticking to international agreements .
" nato wants to see 2.3 percent of gross domestic product spent on security provisions , and in germany only 1.5 percent is being spent , " he observed .
but harff said he believes this has to change .

a camera mounted on the mars express orbiter is expected to produce unprecedented images of the planet over the next years .
first images will be released next week .
dw-world took a look behind the scenes . berlin - ralf jaumann expects to feel a little edgy over the next two years .
the planetary geologist at the german aerospace center ’ s -lrb- dlr -rrb- institute for planetary research in berlin will be one of the first people to receive data collected by the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- .
“ every time we switch it on or off , i ’ m nervous , ” said jaumann , who will turn the data into raw images before sending the latter on for further analysis .
“ it will certainly become a matter of routine , but not completely . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf jaumann during a dw-tv interview .
last friday jaumann -lrb- photo -rrb- got another chance to jitter as the camera began searching for signs of the missing beagle 2 lander .
the robot probably crashed during touchdown on the martian surface . while beagle 2 was designed to conduct a small percentage of the mission ’ s ground experiments , focus is likely to shift now to the camera and other instruments mounted on the orbiter , such as marsis , a sub-surface sounding radar altimeter searching for water under the planet ’ s crust , or spicam , an ultraviolet and infrared spectrometer that will study the martian atmosphere . not all hope has been lost for finding the lander , however , and jaumann and his colleagues have been given a lot of data storage space on the orbiter to search for beagle 2 .
but neither he nor gerhard neukum , the hrsc project ’ s principal investigator at berlin ’ s free university , believe there ’ s much of a chance to discover the tiny robot . “ we haven ’ t seen beagle yet , ” neukum said on wednesday after looking through the first batch of “ outstanding ” data he ’ s received so far .
even though the probe has n't turned up , " these are the best data ever recorded , ” neukum said . while other missions , such as nasa ’ s global surveyor mission , have already produced high resolution images , the hrsc ’ s capability to produce colorful , three-dimensional pictures is a first , according to neukum .
“ we will be able to look at mars like we do with our eyes here on the surface of the earth , ” he said . in addition , an infrared image would allow scientists to determine the abundance of specific minerals on mars , neukum said .
he added that first images would be released to the public by jan .
20 . sending commands , receiving data while neukum and his team of 43 co-investigators will use the data to produce three-dimensional images and analyze them , jaumann and a group of 10 scientists will be testing and sending future commands to the camera and processing incoming data on a daily basis . the team does n't work in a big mission control center like the one in darmstadt , germany , where the mars express mission and the orbiter 's flight path is monitored .
tv crews are often disappointed when they come to visit his office in a non-descript building on the outskirts of the german capital , jaumann said .
“ years ago we had rooms with big computers , but now we get our data on machines like this one , ” he said , pointing to his apple powerbook . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a drawing of the hrsc camera .
to test commands , jaumann and his colleagues can work with an exact replica of the camera , which sits in a dlr laboratory .
several dozen screws have to be adjusted to find the perfect position .
“ it ’ s nothing spectacular , ” he said , pointing to the 20 kg -lrb- 44 pound -rrb- instrument that ’ s mounted on a table .
“ but hopefully it will produce spectacular pictures . ” mapping mars like never before the hrsc project ’ s goal is to produce a three-dimensional , colorful map of the entire martian surface at a resolution that has never been achieved before . detailed images of the red planet ’ s polar caps or volcanic regions will be even more interesting for scientists working on the project , however .
“ it ’ s more interesting to do fewer things in great detail rather than to do everything at a resolution that we have done with other missions , ” said wojciech markiewicz , a planetary scientist at the max planck institute for aeronomy in katlenburg-lindau in central germany . the camera ’ s images will allow scientists to locate rocks as small as two meters -lrb- 6.5 feet -rrb- , according to jaumann , who added that he expects the project to answer the question whether it ever rained on mars . putting the camera to work on earth the hrsc technology is not only useful for gaining a greater understanding of mars , however : a modified version of the camera has already mapped regions on earth .
many possibilities exist to put the instrument to commercial use , jaumann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insurance companies could use the camera to assess damage after a flood like the one in saxony in 2002 .
telecommunication companies could use the images to pinpoint the best locations for their antennae , cities could take inventory of things such as street signs , park benches and trees by looking at the pictures , jaumann said .
insurance companies could assess damage caused by floods immediately , hence preventing fraudulent claims later on .
even the european union could monitor fields of farmers who receive subsidies for not planting anything on their land . but others , who work in the commercial sector , will have to look into these options , jaumann said , adding that data from the hrsc will keep scientists busy for years to come .

a camera mounted on the mars express orbiter is expected to produce unprecedented images of the planet over the next years .
first images will be released next week .
dw-world took a look behind the scenes . berlin - ralf jaumann expects to feel a little edgy over the next two years .
the planetary geologist at the german aerospace center ’ s -lrb- dlr -rrb- institute for planetary research in berlin will be one of the first people to receive data collected by the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- .
“ every time we switch it on or off , i ’ m nervous , ” said jaumann , who will turn the data into raw images before sending the latter on for further analysis .
“ it will certainly become a matter of routine , but not completely . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf jaumann during a dw-tv interview .
last friday jaumann -lrb- photo -rrb- got another chance to jitter as the camera began searching for signs of the missing beagle 2 lander .
the robot probably crashed during touchdown on the martian surface . while beagle 2 was designed to conduct a small percentage of the mission ’ s ground experiments , focus is likely to shift now to the camera and other instruments mounted on the orbiter , such as marsis , a sub-surface sounding radar altimeter searching for water under the planet ’ s crust , or spicam , an ultraviolet and infrared spectrometer that will study the martian atmosphere . not all hope has been lost for finding the lander , however , and jaumann and his colleagues have been given a lot of data storage space on the orbiter to search for beagle 2 .
but neither he nor gerhard neukum , the hrsc project ’ s principal investigator at berlin ’ s free university , believe there ’ s much of a chance to discover the tiny robot . “ we haven ’ t seen beagle yet , ” neukum said on wednesday after looking through the first batch of “ outstanding ” data he ’ s received so far .
even though the probe has n't turned up , " these are the best data ever recorded , ” neukum said . while other missions , such as nasa ’ s global surveyor mission , have already produced high resolution images , the hrsc ’ s capability to produce colorful , three-dimensional pictures is a first , according to neukum .
“ we will be able to look at mars like we do with our eyes here on the surface of the earth , ” he said . in addition , an infrared image would allow scientists to determine the abundance of specific minerals on mars , neukum said .
he added that first images would be released to the public by jan .
20 . sending commands , receiving data while neukum and his team of 43 co-investigators will use the data to produce three-dimensional images and analyze them , jaumann and a group of 10 scientists will be testing and sending future commands to the camera and processing incoming data on a daily basis . the team does n't work in a big mission control center like the one in darmstadt , germany , where the mars express mission and the orbiter 's flight path is monitored .
tv crews are often disappointed when they come to visit his office in a non-descript building on the outskirts of the german capital , jaumann said .
“ years ago we had rooms with big computers , but now we get our data on machines like this one , ” he said , pointing to his apple powerbook . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a drawing of the hrsc camera .
to test commands , jaumann and his colleagues can work with an exact replica of the camera , which sits in a dlr laboratory .
several dozen screws have to be adjusted to find the perfect position .
“ it ’ s nothing spectacular , ” he said , pointing to the 20 kg -lrb- 44 pound -rrb- instrument that ’ s mounted on a table .
“ but hopefully it will produce spectacular pictures . ” mapping mars like never before the hrsc project ’ s goal is to produce a three-dimensional , colorful map of the entire martian surface at a resolution that has never been achieved before . detailed images of the red planet ’ s polar caps or volcanic regions will be even more interesting for scientists working on the project , however .
“ it ’ s more interesting to do fewer things in great detail rather than to do everything at a resolution that we have done with other missions , ” said wojciech markiewicz , a planetary scientist at the max planck institute for aeronomy in katlenburg-lindau in central germany . the camera ’ s images will allow scientists to locate rocks as small as two meters -lrb- 6.5 feet -rrb- , according to jaumann , who added that he expects the project to answer the question whether it ever rained on mars . putting the camera to work on earth the hrsc technology is not only useful for gaining a greater understanding of mars , however : a modified version of the camera has already mapped regions on earth .
many possibilities exist to put the instrument to commercial use , jaumann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insurance companies could use the camera to assess damage after a flood like the one in saxony in 2002 .
telecommunication companies could use the images to pinpoint the best locations for their antennae , cities could take inventory of things such as street signs , park benches and trees by looking at the pictures , jaumann said .
insurance companies could assess damage caused by floods immediately , hence preventing fraudulent claims later on .
even the european union could monitor fields of farmers who receive subsidies for not planting anything on their land . but others , who work in the commercial sector , will have to look into these options , jaumann said , adding that data from the hrsc will keep scientists busy for years to come .

the ratings of a new reality tv show in germany are climbing as minor celebrities are put through daily hair-raising ‘ challenges ’ in the australian jungle .
but as the tests get crueler , criticism is starting to grow . germany ’ s private television channel rtl has hit ratings pay dirt with its version of the british and american show “ i ’ m a celebrity get me out of here . ”
called “ ich bin ein star holt mich hier raus ” in german , the show has dropped ten b-list celebrities into a jungle in australia for 12 days . despite being inundated by reality tv in recent years , german viewers are flocking to the program , which forces one member of the group to undertake a stunt testing their courage each day in order to earn food for all .
but after a singer of questionable talent was forced to lie in a " cockroach coffin " with 30,000 of the wriggly creatures and an out-of-work tv host was pecked nearly to tears by a band of aggressive ostriches , media watchdogs and other groups are beginning to question the show ’ s lack of moral grounding . “ i ’ ve really been blown over .
these are methods that are reminiscent of torture tactics , ” jo groebel , the director of the european institute for the media in düsseldorf , told the associated press on wednesday . alarm bells for many went off when daniel küblböck , who become a celebrity as a performer in the german version of " pop idol , " suffered a panic attack after putting his head in a “ terror aquarium ” filled with eels and water spiders .
the melodramatic 18-year-old was forced to do three stunts in a row by the schadenfreude-filled audience , who voted by telephone on which cast member would be forced into the humiliating acts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel and the cockroaches .
walter eykmann from a national catholic church group told the daily tabloid newspaper bild that rtl was putting “ profits and ratings ” above the participants well-being .
“ it ’ s absolutely repugnant how daniel küblböck is being abused , ” eykmann said . plenty of publicity though the candidates earn € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,276 -rrb- for each day they stay in the camp for the charity of their choice , the real motivation is likely the free publicity that could help their careers .
shown live each evening , the show 's ratings have swelled in recent days .
on tuesday , it garnered a whopping third of the total viewing audience . despite the growing popularity of “ i ’ m a celebrity get me out of here , ” the company said it has so far kept the price of a 30-second commercial spot steady at € 34,500 .
and rtl has defended the program , saying all those taking part were aware of what they were getting into . “ the participants are acting of their own will and are public persons who know exactly what they are doing , ” said an rtl spokesman .
“ we aren ’ t torturing anyone . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krokodil im kölner zoo but some animal rights groups see things differently , saying that even if the celebrities can choose not to take part , the the snakes , spiders and cockroaches used in the television stunts can ’ t .
both the association against cruelty to animals and german association for the protection of animals have criticized the show for using living creatures simply for a scare effect . germany ’ s authority for television standards has also stepped in to the debate and is planning to hold a hearing on feb .

however , since the two-week run of “ i ’ m a celebrity get me out of here ” will long be over by then , there appears little chance the plug will be pulled .

the ratings of a new reality tv show in germany are climbing as minor celebrities are put through daily hair-raising ‘ challenges ’ in the australian jungle .
but as the tests get crueler , criticism is starting to grow . germany ’ s private television channel rtl has hit ratings pay dirt with its version of the british and american show “ i ’ m a celebrity get me out of here . ”
called “ ich bin ein star holt mich hier raus ” in german , the show has dropped ten b-list celebrities into a jungle in australia for 12 days . despite being inundated by reality tv in recent years , german viewers are flocking to the program , which forces one member of the group to undertake a stunt testing their courage each day in order to earn food for all .
but after a singer of questionable talent was forced to lie in a " cockroach coffin " with 30,000 of the wriggly creatures and an out-of-work tv host was pecked nearly to tears by a band of aggressive ostriches , media watchdogs and other groups are beginning to question the show ’ s lack of moral grounding . “ i ’ ve really been blown over .
these are methods that are reminiscent of torture tactics , ” jo groebel , the director of the european institute for the media in düsseldorf , told the associated press on wednesday . alarm bells for many went off when daniel küblböck , who become a celebrity as a performer in the german version of " pop idol , " suffered a panic attack after putting his head in a “ terror aquarium ” filled with eels and water spiders .
the melodramatic 18-year-old was forced to do three stunts in a row by the schadenfreude-filled audience , who voted by telephone on which cast member would be forced into the humiliating acts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel and the cockroaches .
walter eykmann from a national catholic church group told the daily tabloid newspaper bild that rtl was putting “ profits and ratings ” above the participants well-being .
“ it ’ s absolutely repugnant how daniel küblböck is being abused , ” eykmann said . plenty of publicity though the candidates earn € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,276 -rrb- for each day they stay in the camp for the charity of their choice , the real motivation is likely the free publicity that could help their careers .
shown live each evening , the show 's ratings have swelled in recent days .
on tuesday , it garnered a whopping third of the total viewing audience . despite the growing popularity of “ i ’ m a celebrity get me out of here , ” the company said it has so far kept the price of a 30-second commercial spot steady at € 34,500 .
and rtl has defended the program , saying all those taking part were aware of what they were getting into . “ the participants are acting of their own will and are public persons who know exactly what they are doing , ” said an rtl spokesman .
“ we aren ’ t torturing anyone . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krokodil im kölner zoo but some animal rights groups see things differently , saying that even if the celebrities can choose not to take part , the the snakes , spiders and cockroaches used in the television stunts can ’ t .

now the irish prime minister bertie ahern has set out his intentions before the european parliament in strasbourg . the irish premier left his audience in no doubt about his top priority over the next six months .
he promised to pick the failed talks on an eu constitution off the floor and do all he could to elicit a final agreement .
" i pledge to you that the irish presidency will spare no effort to make progress and to facilitate consensus during our term in office .
the issue will command the highest priority under our presidency , " he told parliament .
ahern was also at pains to point out that time is of the essence if the european union wishes to keep its reputation in tact .
" excessive delay will damage our credibility and weaken our standing .
stalemate is not an option any of us can contemplate , " he said .
ahern said he planned to hold intensive talks with the heads of state and government ahead of the next eu summit in march , in order to come up with a possible solution to the sticking point of voting weights .
" i can assure the parliament that if my consultations suggest that there is a real prospect of agreement i will immediately move to seize the opportunity , " he said .
the talks last december , which should have been the crowning glory of italy 's six months in the eu presidential hot seat , ground to a halt when spain and poland refused to give up powerful voting rights established in the earlier nice treaty . something to celebrate a further high point during the irish presidency will be the addition of the ten new member states on may 1st .
and to mark the occasion , the irish government is planning to invite them all to dublin for a party .
as far as ahern is concerned , it is a moment in history which is well worth a celebration .
he told parliament that the founding fathers of a unified europe had dreamed of a time when europeans would never again kill each other in the name of natural resources , land or beliefs .
and with ten new states poised to join the bloc , the irish prime minister said that 2004 was a year in which europe was moving closer to making those dreams come true . with the constitution talks and eu expansion , the new president has a fat agenda for the next half a year , but looking beyond his six-month stint , he is confident that membership talks for romania and bulgaria will be concluded this year .
he is also hoping to see progress in the unification of the divided mediterranean island of cyprus .
as it stands , only the greek southern part will join the eu in may , but ahern also praised turkey 's attempts to close the gap between itself and europe .
a rallying call looking beyond europe 's borders , ahern called on the eu member states to do more in the fight against poverty and aids in africa .
he said it was crucial for developing nations that they resume talks with the world trade organization .
several members of the european parliament called on ahern to push forward his initiative on debt relief for the poorest countries in the world .
ireland wants to stimulate economic development in europe and has pledged to work towards the goal of making it the most innovative economic power in the world by the end of the decade .
ahern believes in increasing competitiveness in the union , and he voiced his support for the latest eu commission initiative to completely do away with restraints on service sector competition for professions such as doctors , lawyers , architects and pharmacists .
he told parliament that europe had to be as competitive as possible and that the greatest challenge is the desperate need for more and better employment .
ahern , who likes to go by the gallic name of taoiseach - meaning prime minister - will be turning his own attention to matters of employment over the coming months .
during his term in the rotating presidency , he will have to suggest a possible replacement for eu commission president romano prodi , whose term of office expires in november . bernd riegert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi 's star-crossed eu presidency italian premier silvio berlusconi steps down as eu council president wednesday .

now the irish prime minister bertie ahern has set out his intentions before the european parliament in strasbourg . the irish premier left his audience in no doubt about his top priority over the next six months .
he promised to pick the failed talks on an eu constitution off the floor and do all he could to elicit a final agreement .
" i pledge to you that the irish presidency will spare no effort to make progress and to facilitate consensus during our term in office .
the issue will command the highest priority under our presidency , " he told parliament .
ahern was also at pains to point out that time is of the essence if the european union wishes to keep its reputation in tact .
" excessive delay will damage our credibility and weaken our standing .
stalemate is not an option any of us can contemplate , " he said .
ahern said he planned to hold intensive talks with the heads of state and government ahead of the next eu summit in march , in order to come up with a possible solution to the sticking point of voting weights .
" i can assure the parliament that if my consultations suggest that there is a real prospect of agreement i will immediately move to seize the opportunity , " he said .
the talks last december , which should have been the crowning glory of italy 's six months in the eu presidential hot seat , ground to a halt when spain and poland refused to give up powerful voting rights established in the earlier nice treaty . something to celebrate a further high point during the irish presidency will be the addition of the ten new member states on may 1st .

a camera mounted on the mars express orbiter is expected to produce unprecedented images of the planet over the next years .
first images will be released next week .
dw-world took a look behind the scenes . berlin - ralf jaumann expects to feel a little edgy over the next two years .
the planetary geologist at the german aerospace center ’ s -lrb- dlr -rrb- institute for planetary research in berlin will be one of the first people to receive data collected by the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- .
“ every time we switch it on or off , i ’ m nervous , ” said jaumann , who will turn the data into raw images before sending the latter on for further analysis .
“ it will certainly become a matter of routine , but not completely . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf jaumann during a dw-tv interview .
last friday jaumann -lrb- photo -rrb- got another chance to jitter as the camera began searching for signs of the missing beagle 2 lander .
the robot probably crashed during touchdown on the martian surface . while beagle 2 was designed to conduct a small percentage of the mission ’ s ground experiments , focus is likely to shift now to the camera and other instruments mounted on the orbiter , such as marsis , a sub-surface sounding radar altimeter searching for water under the planet ’ s crust , or spicam , an ultraviolet and infrared spectrometer that will study the martian atmosphere . not all hope has been lost for finding the lander , however , and jaumann and his colleagues have been given a lot of data storage space on the orbiter to search for beagle 2 .
but neither he nor gerhard neukum , the hrsc project ’ s principal investigator at berlin ’ s free university , believe there ’ s much of a chance to discover the tiny robot . “ we haven ’ t seen beagle yet , ” neukum said on wednesday after looking through the first batch of “ outstanding ” data he ’ s received so far .
even though the probe has n't turned up , " these are the best data ever recorded , ” neukum said . while other missions , such as nasa ’ s global surveyor mission , have already produced high resolution images , the hrsc ’ s capability to produce colorful , three-dimensional pictures is a first , according to neukum .
“ we will be able to look at mars like we do with our eyes here on the surface of the earth , ” he said . in addition , an infrared image would allow scientists to determine the abundance of specific minerals on mars , neukum said .
he added that first images would be released to the public by jan .
20 . sending commands , receiving data while neukum and his team of 43 co-investigators will use the data to produce three-dimensional images and analyze them , jaumann and a group of 10 scientists will be testing and sending future commands to the camera and processing incoming data on a daily basis . the team does n't work in a big mission control center like the one in darmstadt , germany , where the mars express mission and the orbiter 's flight path is monitored .
tv crews are often disappointed when they come to visit his office in a non-descript building on the outskirts of the german capital , jaumann said .
“ years ago we had rooms with big computers , but now we get our data on machines like this one , ” he said , pointing to his apple powerbook . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a drawing of the hrsc camera .
to test commands , jaumann and his colleagues can work with an exact replica of the camera , which sits in a dlr laboratory .
several dozen screws have to be adjusted to find the perfect position .
“ it ’ s nothing spectacular , ” he said , pointing to the 20 kg -lrb- 44 pound -rrb- instrument that ’ s mounted on a table .
“ but hopefully it will produce spectacular pictures . ” mapping mars like never before the hrsc project ’ s goal is to produce a three-dimensional , colorful map of the entire martian surface at a resolution that has never been achieved before . detailed images of the red planet ’ s polar caps or volcanic regions will be even more interesting for scientists working on the project , however .
“ it ’ s more interesting to do fewer things in great detail rather than to do everything at a resolution that we have done with other missions , ” said wojciech markiewicz , a planetary scientist at the max planck institute for aeronomy in katlenburg-lindau in central germany . the camera ’ s images will allow scientists to locate rocks as small as two meters -lrb- 6.5 feet -rrb- , according to jaumann , who added that he expects the project to answer the question whether it ever rained on mars . putting the camera to work on earth the hrsc technology is not only useful for gaining a greater understanding of mars , however : a modified version of the camera has already mapped regions on earth .
many possibilities exist to put the instrument to commercial use , jaumann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insurance companies could use the camera to assess damage after a flood like the one in saxony in 2002 .
telecommunication companies could use the images to pinpoint the best locations for their antennae , cities could take inventory of things such as street signs , park benches and trees by looking at the pictures , jaumann said .
insurance companies could assess damage caused by floods immediately , hence preventing fraudulent claims later on .
even the european union could monitor fields of farmers who receive subsidies for not planting anything on their land . but others , who work in the commercial sector , will have to look into these options , jaumann said , adding that data from the hrsc will keep scientists busy for years to come .

a camera mounted on the mars express orbiter is expected to produce unprecedented images of the planet over the next years .
first images will be released next week .
dw-world took a look behind the scenes . berlin - ralf jaumann expects to feel a little edgy over the next two years .
the planetary geologist at the german aerospace center ’ s -lrb- dlr -rrb- institute for planetary research in berlin will be one of the first people to receive data collected by the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- .
“ every time we switch it on or off , i ’ m nervous , ” said jaumann , who will turn the data into raw images before sending the latter on for further analysis .
“ it will certainly become a matter of routine , but not completely . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf jaumann during a dw-tv interview .
last friday jaumann -lrb- photo -rrb- got another chance to jitter as the camera began searching for signs of the missing beagle 2 lander .
the robot probably crashed during touchdown on the martian surface . while beagle 2 was designed to conduct a small percentage of the mission ’ s ground experiments , focus is likely to shift now to the camera and other instruments mounted on the orbiter , such as marsis , a sub-surface sounding radar altimeter searching for water under the planet ’ s crust , or spicam , an ultraviolet and infrared spectrometer that will study the martian atmosphere . not all hope has been lost for finding the lander , however , and jaumann and his colleagues have been given a lot of data storage space on the orbiter to search for beagle 2 .
but neither he nor gerhard neukum , the hrsc project ’ s principal investigator at berlin ’ s free university , believe there ’ s much of a chance to discover the tiny robot . “ we haven ’ t seen beagle yet , ” neukum said on wednesday after looking through the first batch of “ outstanding ” data he ’ s received so far .
even though the probe has n't turned up , " these are the best data ever recorded , ” neukum said . while other missions , such as nasa ’ s global surveyor mission , have already produced high resolution images , the hrsc ’ s capability to produce colorful , three-dimensional pictures is a first , according to neukum .
“ we will be able to look at mars like we do with our eyes here on the surface of the earth , ” he said . in addition , an infrared image would allow scientists to determine the abundance of specific minerals on mars , neukum said .
he added that first images would be released to the public by jan .
20 . sending commands , receiving data while neukum and his team of 43 co-investigators will use the data to produce three-dimensional images and analyze them , jaumann and a group of 10 scientists will be testing and sending future commands to the camera and processing incoming data on a daily basis . the team does n't work in a big mission control center like the one in darmstadt , germany , where the mars express mission and the orbiter 's flight path is monitored .
tv crews are often disappointed when they come to visit his office in a non-descript building on the outskirts of the german capital , jaumann said .
“ years ago we had rooms with big computers , but now we get our data on machines like this one , ” he said , pointing to his apple powerbook . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a drawing of the hrsc camera .
to test commands , jaumann and his colleagues can work with an exact replica of the camera , which sits in a dlr laboratory .
several dozen screws have to be adjusted to find the perfect position .

“ it ’ s more interesting to do fewer things in great detail rather than to do everything at a resolution that we have done with other missions , ” said wojciech markiewicz , a planetary scientist at the max planck institute for aeronomy in katlenburg-lindau in central germany . the camera ’ s images will allow scientists to locate rocks as small as two meters -lrb- 6.5 feet -rrb- , according to jaumann , who added that he expects the project to answer the question whether it ever rained on mars . putting the camera to work on earth the hrsc technology is not only useful for gaining a greater understanding of mars , however : a modified version of the camera has already mapped regions on earth .
many possibilities exist to put the instrument to commercial use , jaumann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insurance companies could use the camera to assess damage after a flood like the one in saxony in 2002 .
telecommunication companies could use the images to pinpoint the best locations for their antennae , cities could take inventory of things such as street signs , park benches and trees by looking at the pictures , jaumann said .
insurance companies could assess damage caused by floods immediately , hence preventing fraudulent claims later on .
even the european union could monitor fields of farmers who receive subsidies for not planting anything on their land . but others , who work in the commercial sector , will have to look into these options , jaumann said , adding that data from the hrsc will keep scientists busy for years to come .

germany 's railway celebrates a decade as a private company on wednesday .
the deutsche bahn chairman hopes it will be ready to go public in 2005 - but meanwhile , it continues accruing debt . just days after opening , berlin 's newest five-star hotel , the ritz-carlton , is warming up for a bash in honor of the 10th anniversary of germany 's state railway system going private . its host , deutsche bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn , predictably lauds the reform as " a huge success . " " after -lrb- the fall of the berlin wall -rrb- we had two train companies that were on their last legs economically , " mehdorn told the newspaper die welt on the eve of the celebration .
" we know we 're not done , but what this company and its employees have done is unparalleled . " but that has n't put a stop to harsh criticism of db from politicians , economists and passengers . a mountain of debt the trip to where the bahn stands today has been a long one .
based on the recommendations of a government-appointed commission in late 1991 , parliament decided it was time to reform the railway - and it promptly began amending around 130 laws to change its status . in january 1994 , the west and east german railway companies were merged into a stock corporation called deutsche bahn , with the federal government retaining full ownership . by that time , west germany 's railway alone had amassed € 34 billion -lrb- $ 43.5 billion -rrb- in debt .
its enormous losses - € 7.9 billion during its last year as a state agency - were paid for by taxpayers . germany could afford either the national train system or the army but not both , former chancellor helmut schmidt was quoted as saying at the time . but the government nonetheless assumed the mountain of debt , giving db a fresh start . since then , the government has taken a less hands-on approach to deutsche bahn . db , after all , became a private company that was expected to generate a profit .
while politicians no longer dictate the bahn 's day-to-day actions , the government does have a say in strategic decisions through infrastructural funding and members on the company 's supervisory board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn " the numbers speak for themselves , " mehdorn told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" we have saved german taxpayers around € 108 billion -lrb- since 1994 -rrb- , more than € 44 billion more than what independent experts forecasted at the time " for what the government would save if it made deutsche bahn an independent , self-sufficient company .
but mehdorn 's calculations are based on the assumption that the catastrophic pre-reform situation would have continued without change . no more clean slate mehdorn , deutsche bahn ceo since 1999 , can brag that db does n't pocket subsidies to cover its operating costs .
but it still receives around € 10 billion annually from federal and state sources to pay for commuter traffic and infrastructure development . and it 's incurring debts again .
in the first half of 2003 , operating loss after interest stood at € 143 million .
that was down from € 235 million a year earlier - and mehdorn has said he plans to get the company back into the black in 2004 . those plans precede tuesday 's news that mehdorn and co. are considering cost-cutting measures , including abandoning costly refurbishment and expansion plans for 2004 . for example , the long-awaited high-speed rail line between erfurt and nuremburg that would reduce total travel time between berlin and munich but would cost up to € 244 million to build could become the first victim of the cuts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worse yet , db appears to be one of the businesses german consumers most love to hate , along with deutsche post and deutsche telekom , which were also privatized in the 1990s .
last year , db introduced fare reforms that drew so many complaints that the railway gave in after about half a year and reinstated the old fare structure . the company 's byzantine new fare system - modeled after the airlines , with discounts for advance purchases but maximum fares for those purchased at the time of journey - remains not only confusing but often significantly more expensive than other forms of transportation .
indeed , a recent report claimed that as many as 25 percent of the flights by budget airlines within germany , like germanwings or hapag lloyd express , are taking customers away from deutsche bahn with lower prices and faster travel times . db announced drastic cuts in service personnel in late 2003 , including the closure of ticket counters that has led to longer lines at ticket and information counters .
only 85 percent of the trains are on time , which db defines as being no more than five minutes late - well below the company 's stated goal of 95 percent . going public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late trains abound but mehdorn , known for claiming that passenger lobbyists are whiners and even seeking to take legal action against them , is apparently not entirely oblivious to customers ' irritations .
" we have to get better at punctuality and information for our customers when there are irregularities , " he told die welt .
this is of special concern , since mehdorn has made it clear that he 's trying to get db in shape for an initial public offering by 2005 . he has his work cut out for him .
besides improving db 's image among passengers , mehdorn is faced with stiff competition from budget airlines in the passenger division and from trucking firms in the cargo field .
db 's cargo transport has been hit especially hard , with its market share dropping from 21 to 15.6 percent between 1990 and 2002 . it 's also hindered by its lack of punctuality and weak rail infrastructures in eastern europe . the company has also seen significant drops in its passenger traffic .
in a recent report , the european commission stated that since 1995 passenger rail traffic across europe rose 12 percent .
in germany , however , it fell by 7.6 percent - a sharp contrast to the 30 percent growth experienced in france . ten years after privatization the consensus seems to be that reforming the railways was the right thing to do .

the deutsche bahn chairman hopes it will be ready to go public in 2005 - but meanwhile , it continues accruing debt . just days after opening , berlin 's newest five-star hotel , the ritz-carlton , is warming up for a bash in honor of the 10th anniversary of germany 's state railway system going private . its host , deutsche bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn , predictably lauds the reform as " a huge success . " " after -lrb- the fall of the berlin wall -rrb- we had two train companies that were on their last legs economically , " mehdorn told the newspaper die welt on the eve of the celebration .
" we know we 're not done , but what this company and its employees have done is unparalleled . " but that has n't put a stop to harsh criticism of db from politicians , economists and passengers . a mountain of debt the trip to where the bahn stands today has been a long one .
based on the recommendations of a government-appointed commission in late 1991 , parliament decided it was time to reform the railway - and it promptly began amending around 130 laws to change its status . in january 1994 , the west and east german railway companies were merged into a stock corporation called deutsche bahn , with the federal government retaining full ownership . by that time , west germany 's railway alone had amassed € 34 billion -lrb- $ 43.5 billion -rrb- in debt .
its enormous losses - € 7.9 billion during its last year as a state agency - were paid for by taxpayers . germany could afford either the national train system or the army but not both , former chancellor helmut schmidt was quoted as saying at the time . but the government nonetheless assumed the mountain of debt , giving db a fresh start . since then , the government has taken a less hands-on approach to deutsche bahn . db , after all , became a private company that was expected to generate a profit .
while politicians no longer dictate the bahn 's day-to-day actions , the government does have a say in strategic decisions through infrastructural funding and members on the company 's supervisory board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn " the numbers speak for themselves , " mehdorn told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" we have saved german taxpayers around € 108 billion -lrb- since 1994 -rrb- , more than € 44 billion more than what independent experts forecasted at the time " for what the government would save if it made deutsche bahn an independent , self-sufficient company .
but mehdorn 's calculations are based on the assumption that the catastrophic pre-reform situation would have continued without change . no more clean slate mehdorn , deutsche bahn ceo since 1999 , can brag that db does n't pocket subsidies to cover its operating costs .
but it still receives around € 10 billion annually from federal and state sources to pay for commuter traffic and infrastructure development . and it 's incurring debts again .
in the first half of 2003 , operating loss after interest stood at € 143 million .
that was down from € 235 million a year earlier - and mehdorn has said he plans to get the company back into the black in 2004 . those plans precede tuesday 's news that mehdorn and co. are considering cost-cutting measures , including abandoning costly refurbishment and expansion plans for 2004 . for example , the long-awaited high-speed rail line between erfurt and nuremburg that would reduce total travel time between berlin and munich but would cost up to € 244 million to build could become the first victim of the cuts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worse yet , db appears to be one of the businesses german consumers most love to hate , along with deutsche post and deutsche telekom , which were also privatized in the 1990s .
last year , db introduced fare reforms that drew so many complaints that the railway gave in after about half a year and reinstated the old fare structure . the company 's byzantine new fare system - modeled after the airlines , with discounts for advance purchases but maximum fares for those purchased at the time of journey - remains not only confusing but often significantly more expensive than other forms of transportation .
indeed , a recent report claimed that as many as 25 percent of the flights by budget airlines within germany , like germanwings or hapag lloyd express , are taking customers away from deutsche bahn with lower prices and faster travel times . db announced drastic cuts in service personnel in late 2003 , including the closure of ticket counters that has led to longer lines at ticket and information counters .

" we have to get better at punctuality and information for our customers when there are irregularities , " he told die welt .
this is of special concern , since mehdorn has made it clear that he 's trying to get db in shape for an initial public offering by 2005 . he has his work cut out for him .
besides improving db 's image among passengers , mehdorn is faced with stiff competition from budget airlines in the passenger division and from trucking firms in the cargo field .
db 's cargo transport has been hit especially hard , with its market share dropping from 21 to 15.6 percent between 1990 and 2002 . it 's also hindered by its lack of punctuality and weak rail infrastructures in eastern europe . the company has also seen significant drops in its passenger traffic .
in a recent report , the european commission stated that since 1995 passenger rail traffic across europe rose 12 percent .
in germany , however , it fell by 7.6 percent - a sharp contrast to the 30 percent growth experienced in france . ten years after privatization the consensus seems to be that reforming the railways was the right thing to do .

germany 's railway celebrates a decade as a private company on wednesday .
the deutsche bahn chairman hopes it will be ready to go public in 2005 - but meanwhile , it continues accruing debt . just days after opening , berlin 's newest five-star hotel , the ritz-carlton , is warming up for a bash in honor of the 10th anniversary of germany 's state railway system going private . its host , deutsche bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn , predictably lauds the reform as " a huge success . " " after -lrb- the fall of the berlin wall -rrb- we had two train companies that were on their last legs economically , " mehdorn told the newspaper die welt on the eve of the celebration .
" we know we 're not done , but what this company and its employees have done is unparalleled . " but that has n't put a stop to harsh criticism of db from politicians , economists and passengers . a mountain of debt the trip to where the bahn stands today has been a long one .
based on the recommendations of a government-appointed commission in late 1991 , parliament decided it was time to reform the railway - and it promptly began amending around 130 laws to change its status . in january 1994 , the west and east german railway companies were merged into a stock corporation called deutsche bahn , with the federal government retaining full ownership . by that time , west germany 's railway alone had amassed € 34 billion -lrb- $ 43.5 billion -rrb- in debt .
its enormous losses - € 7.9 billion during its last year as a state agency - were paid for by taxpayers . germany could afford either the national train system or the army but not both , former chancellor helmut schmidt was quoted as saying at the time . but the government nonetheless assumed the mountain of debt , giving db a fresh start . since then , the government has taken a less hands-on approach to deutsche bahn . db , after all , became a private company that was expected to generate a profit .
while politicians no longer dictate the bahn 's day-to-day actions , the government does have a say in strategic decisions through infrastructural funding and members on the company 's supervisory board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn " the numbers speak for themselves , " mehdorn told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" we have saved german taxpayers around € 108 billion -lrb- since 1994 -rrb- , more than € 44 billion more than what independent experts forecasted at the time " for what the government would save if it made deutsche bahn an independent , self-sufficient company .
but mehdorn 's calculations are based on the assumption that the catastrophic pre-reform situation would have continued without change . no more clean slate mehdorn , deutsche bahn ceo since 1999 , can brag that db does n't pocket subsidies to cover its operating costs .
but it still receives around € 10 billion annually from federal and state sources to pay for commuter traffic and infrastructure development . and it 's incurring debts again .
in the first half of 2003 , operating loss after interest stood at € 143 million .
that was down from € 235 million a year earlier - and mehdorn has said he plans to get the company back into the black in 2004 . those plans precede tuesday 's news that mehdorn and co. are considering cost-cutting measures , including abandoning costly refurbishment and expansion plans for 2004 . for example , the long-awaited high-speed rail line between erfurt and nuremburg that would reduce total travel time between berlin and munich but would cost up to € 244 million to build could become the first victim of the cuts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worse yet , db appears to be one of the businesses german consumers most love to hate , along with deutsche post and deutsche telekom , which were also privatized in the 1990s .

italy ’ s highest court on tuesday annulled a controversial legal immunity law that had shielded top officials from prosecution while in office .
prime minister silvio berlusconi could now once again face bribery charges . the law , which was passed last june , gave the country ’ s five highest officials immunity , but it has been criticized as existing solely to end berlusconi ’ s numerous legal headaches .
dubbed “ lex berlusconi ” by some , it helped the prime minister avoid possible conviction while italy held the rotating eu presidency last autumn . since the court has determined that the law is unconstitutional , berlusconi will once again face trial for allegedly bribing judges in the 1980s while he was a business man .
the trial had been stopped after the law went into effect . “ every man is the same before the law , ” antonio di pietro , an opposition member of parliament and former crusading prosecutor , told the associated press after the legislation was annulled . but berlusconi ’ s justice minister roberto castelli criticized the verdict , saying it could complicate relations between politicians and the judiciary .
“ i fear after this verdict the polemics will become even worse , ” he said . early elections ? berlusconi has repeatedly contended that he has done no wrong and left-wing magistrates have mounted an unfounded campaign against him .
in the face of a possible onslaught of politically motivated legal action against him , berlusconi is reportedly considering calling early elections . “ if that ’ s how things stand , then it ’ s better to go back to the polls , ” he told the daily newspaper corriere della sera . " the teflon premier " a billionaire media mogul turned politician , berlusconi has gone to court eight times over the past decade for varying corruption offenses .
he has been found guilty several times , however , by winning on appeal or due to the statute of limitations nothing has stuck to the " teflon premier . " though the latest case against berlusconi was stopped this summer after the immunity law was passed , the trial against his business associated continued .
a key charge that a firm owned by berlusconi bribed judges to win approval of a corporate takeover in the 1980s was rejected , but a court did convict berlusconi friend and lawyer cesare previti of paying off a rome judge .
previti is currently appealing his sentence of five years in jail . berlusconi , italy ’ s richest man , has repeatedly run into trouble due to his business dealings .
in december , italian president carlo azeglio ciampi decided not to sign a new media law that the opposition fears would add to the influence of the prime minister ’ s already powerful media empire . berlusconi owns three mediaset channels , italia 1 , rete 4 and canale 5 and as premier wields political influence over the board of state public broadcaster rai , mediaset 's only serious competition .

italy ’ s highest court on tuesday annulled a controversial legal immunity law that had shielded top officials from prosecution while in office .
prime minister silvio berlusconi could now once again face bribery charges . the law , which was passed last june , gave the country ’ s five highest officials immunity , but it has been criticized as existing solely to end berlusconi ’ s numerous legal headaches .
dubbed “ lex berlusconi ” by some , it helped the prime minister avoid possible conviction while italy held the rotating eu presidency last autumn . since the court has determined that the law is unconstitutional , berlusconi will once again face trial for allegedly bribing judges in the 1980s while he was a business man .
the trial had been stopped after the law went into effect . “ every man is the same before the law , ” antonio di pietro , an opposition member of parliament and former crusading prosecutor , told the associated press after the legislation was annulled . but berlusconi ’ s justice minister roberto castelli criticized the verdict , saying it could complicate relations between politicians and the judiciary .
“ i fear after this verdict the polemics will become even worse , ” he said . early elections ? berlusconi has repeatedly contended that he has done no wrong and left-wing magistrates have mounted an unfounded campaign against him .
in the face of a possible onslaught of politically motivated legal action against him , berlusconi is reportedly considering calling early elections . “ if that ’ s how things stand , then it ’ s better to go back to the polls , ” he told the daily newspaper corriere della sera . " the teflon premier " a billionaire media mogul turned politician , berlusconi has gone to court eight times over the past decade for varying corruption offenses .
he has been found guilty several times , however , by winning on appeal or due to the statute of limitations nothing has stuck to the " teflon premier . " though the latest case against berlusconi was stopped this summer after the immunity law was passed , the trial against his business associated continued .
a key charge that a firm owned by berlusconi bribed judges to win approval of a corporate takeover in the 1980s was rejected , but a court did convict berlusconi friend and lawyer cesare previti of paying off a rome judge .
previti is currently appealing his sentence of five years in jail . berlusconi , italy ’ s richest man , has repeatedly run into trouble due to his business dealings .

the murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh plunged the country into a crisis last september .
now , with the confessed killer standing trial , swedes are hoping to draw a close to a dark moment in thier history . the man who admitted to killing lindh testified that voices in his head told him to stab the swedish minister repeatedly in the chest and arms .
" i couldn ’ t resist , " mijailo mijailovic confessed to the panel of judges in the packed stockholm courtroom on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mijailo mijailovic although he said he did indeed kill the widely popular anna lindh , the 25-year old swede of yugoslav origin denied it was for political reasons .
" i ’ m not interested in politics , " he told chief prosecutor krister petersson .
" i have nothing personal against anna lindh . "
mijailo ’ s lawyer , peter althin , has pushed for dropping the charges down to manslaughter rather than murder , arguing that his client had not planned the sept .
10 stabbing and that there was " no intent to kill . "
prosecutors , however , insist the attack was premeditated and argue that mijailovic stalked lindh for 14 minutes before stabbing her with a knife in a crowded department store .
given the killer ’ s confession and the prosecution ’ s overwhelming evidence , the court ’ s main task will be to determine whether mijailovic really intended to kill anna lindh or not .
why anna lindh ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the killer was caught on video tape in the department store when the prosecution asked whether he was specifically looking for lindh in the department store , mijailovic said he had been wandering aimlessly , without any reason .
" i just trotted around on different floors and visited all the departments , " he said .
he denied looking for anyone in particular .
he said he just saw lindh and voices in his head , including that of jesus , urged him to stab her - 10 times with a knife .
lindh died the next day in the hospital after doctors worked through the night to save her .
mijailovic , who was arrested sept .
24 , confessed last week , saying he wanted to end speculation about the motive , including media reports that he was upset over lindh ’ s support of the 1999 nato air strikes on serbia .
difficult search the death of one of the country ’ s best-loved politicians sent shock waves through sweden , and initially there were concerns that the murderer wouldn ’ t be found .
after a first suspect was detained and then quickly released without charge , public opinion against the police .
" we were under huge pressure to solve this murder , " said chief police investigator leif jennekvist .
" and we had to be careful to pass on the information in such a way that on the one had the public need for information would be satisfied , while on the other hand our work wouldn ’ t be hindered . "

" i ’ m not interested in politics , " he told chief prosecutor krister petersson .
" i have nothing personal against anna lindh . "
mijailo ’ s lawyer , peter althin , has pushed for dropping the charges down to manslaughter rather than murder , arguing that his client had not planned the sept .

he denied looking for anyone in particular .

" we were under huge pressure to solve this murder , " said chief police investigator leif jennekvist .

the murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh plunged the country into a crisis last september .
now , with the confessed killer standing trial , swedes are hoping to draw a close to a dark moment in thier history . the man who admitted to killing lindh testified that voices in his head told him to stab the swedish minister repeatedly in the chest and arms .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mijailo mijailovic although he said he did indeed kill the widely popular anna lindh , the 25-year old swede of yugoslav origin denied it was for political reasons .
" i ’ m not interested in politics , " he told chief prosecutor krister petersson .
" i have nothing personal against anna lindh . "
mijailo ’ s lawyer , peter althin , has pushed for dropping the charges down to manslaughter rather than murder , arguing that his client had not planned the sept .
10 stabbing and that there was " no intent to kill . "
prosecutors , however , insist the attack was premeditated and argue that mijailovic stalked lindh for 14 minutes before stabbing her with a knife in a crowded department store .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 14.01.2004 opinion : sour grapes at the european commission ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pedro solbes is seeking legal action against the eu executive after weeks of dispute between brussels and berlin over the euro stability pact , the european commission has announced its intention to take the eu executive to the european court of justice . it 's a first in the history of the european union and it 's left germany gasping for breath and german finance minister hans eichel calling for " cooperation rather than confrontation . "
eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes , who is charged with overseeing the stability pact , is seeking legal backing to overturn a ruling which suspends eu budget rules for germany and france . so is this a case of solbes being a bad loser ?
why is he pushing so hard to bring the eu executive before the european court of justice when the outcome and implications of such action are so unclear ?
the proud spaniard suffered political defeat back in november of last year when the majority of ministers on the council of finance ministers voted in favor of suspending eu budget rules for france and germany on the grounds that it does n't make economic sense to punish them for stepping over the budget line .
both " offenders " say they wo n't manage to meet the three percent limit before 2005 . feeling jaded ? it is a clear political decision which the administrative powers at the eu do n't want to accept . as the union 's legislative power , the eu executive has the authority to make or change the rules , but the eu commission , which oversees european treaties , feels like it 's nose has been knocked out of joint .
solbes is particularly irritated by the fact that the ministers strayed from the official line in the treaty , binned his suggestions and came up with their own agreements for france and germany . even if the court in luxembourg were to take on the charges and were to rule in favor of the commissioners , the practical repercussions would be practically non-existent , other than to provide the commission with the chance to savor a moral victory .
it would have been far more sensible to push for a simplification of the rules and to adjust the criteria in the 1997 stability pact so as to make them reflect the economic reality of 2004 .
and this could have happened long before the power struggle between brussels and berlin began . had he acted earlier to work with pedro solbes , german finance minister hans eichel could have helped to avoid the current misery .
but given that the two men seem as stubborn minded as each other , that never happened . hard times ahead the german eu commissioner for enlargement , günter verheugen , who is opposed to the decision to seek legal action , is quite right when he says that this increased aggravation is no help for the union .
with the troubled constitution still hanging over europe 's head , member states really have more important things to worry about than an internal legal dispute . heads of state and government have to take another serious stab at creating a working constitution if the union is to maintain its reputation for being a viable institutional and political partner .
the eu has to define the financial framework for trading after 2007 and then there are the all important discussions on whether or not turkey will be granted membership .
they have to digest the addition of ten new members and with the terms of office for eu commission president , romano prodi , and his department heads due to end in november , they also have some important personnel issues to deal with . so what , in that case , is the point of dubious legal action which will do little to help the stability pact ?
the joke in brussels is that solbes is trying to imitate his famous forefather , don quijote , who made a name for himself by battling imaginary windmills .
but leaving the whisperings in brussels aside , it is certainly too soon for hans eichel to begin rejoicing .
at the end of the year he has to prove that he can sink the german budget deficit below the obligatory three percent .
it is a tough goal for eichel who has his hands full with germany 's economic development .
indeed , his ministry has already warned that it will be very difficult to meet the notorious maastricht criteria in 2005 . bernd riegert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes eu to court the european commission on tuesday decided to seek a court ruling to overturn finance ministers ’ suspension of eu budget rules for france and germany .
member states criticize the action , saying it ’ s a risky move .

"
eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes , who is charged with overseeing the stability pact , is seeking legal backing to overturn a ruling which suspends eu budget rules for germany and france . so is this a case of solbes being a bad loser ?
why is he pushing so hard to bring the eu executive before the european court of justice when the outcome and implications of such action are so unclear ?
the proud spaniard suffered political defeat back in november of last year when the majority of ministers on the council of finance ministers voted in favor of suspending eu budget rules for france and germany on the grounds that it does n't make economic sense to punish them for stepping over the budget line .
both " offenders " say they wo n't manage to meet the three percent limit before 2005 . feeling jaded ? it is a clear political decision which the administrative powers at the eu do n't want to accept . as the union 's legislative power , the eu executive has the authority to make or change the rules , but the eu commission , which oversees european treaties , feels like it 's nose has been knocked out of joint .
solbes is particularly irritated by the fact that the ministers strayed from the official line in the treaty , binned his suggestions and came up with their own agreements for france and germany . even if the court in luxembourg were to take on the charges and were to rule in favor of the commissioners , the practical repercussions would be practically non-existent , other than to provide the commission with the chance to savor a moral victory .
it would have been far more sensible to push for a simplification of the rules and to adjust the criteria in the 1997 stability pact so as to make them reflect the economic reality of 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.01.2004 -pipe- 19:00 utc amnesty accuses german police of excessive force in a report published wednesday , human rights watchdog amnesty international says that between 1999 and 2003 , there have been some 20 cases in germany of police using excessive force and ill-treating suspects .
the study suggests that in some cases , officers may even be getting away with torture .
" all too often , " it says , " complaints against police officers are not investigated promptly or impartially and there is a very real danger that these practices result in police officers getting away with committing human rights violations . "

the european commission on tuesday decided to seek a court ruling to overturn finance ministers ’ suspension of eu budget rules for france and germany .
member states criticize the action , saying it ’ s a risky move . the eu executive , which is responsible for enforcing laws in the 15-member bloc , argued that taking finance ministers to court was vital to clarify disciplinary procedures for those who break the eu ’ s guidelines on deficit spending , as france and germany have done repeatedly .
but the unprecedented legal move is expected to generate a considerable amount of friction at a time when the eu is concerned about maintaining cohesion .
german finance minister hans eichel said the decision to go to the european court of justice was " hard to understand " and added that he saw no wrong doing in the finance minister ’ s nov .
25 decision to forego disciplinary action against berlin and paris for violating the stability pact .
the results of the ecofin -lrb- council of european finance ministers -rrb- meeting " correspond to the spirit and the letter of the stability and growth pact , " he said in a statement released on tuesday .
" the procedures that are foreseen -lrb- in the pact -rrb- were upheld . "
at the meeting , germany and france , europe ’ s two biggest economies , used their combined influence to convince ecofin to reject the commission ’ s recommendation to punish berlin and paris for running up excessive budget deficits by slapping them with steep fines and forcing them to make deeper deficit cuts in 2004 .
the commission is now seeking a ruling on whether the ministers violated procedure in taking an ad hoc decision against the eu executive branch .
brussels vs. brussels " not least with a view to the tasks the european union faces in the near future , it would be more helpful to aim for cooperation rather than confrontation , " eichel said in response to the commission ’ s legal challenge .
but eu monetary affairs commssioner pedro solbes , whose office oversees the stability pact , has argued that brussels has a duty to uphold the law and avoid a precedent that could legitimize rule-breaking in the future and ultimately undermine the eu treaty .
french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin acknowledged that it was the commission ’ s right to seek recourse in court , but insisted the finance minister ’ s decision was legal .
" i respect the decision of the commission , but i am not worried about the result , " he told reporters during a visit in brussels .
legal advisors to the member states in the eu council said the ministers had a discretionary power to overturn the commission ’ s recommendation and doubt the eu executive will come out a clear winner in court .
a house divided against itself the commission itself is divided over the decision to seek legal action .
the move is seen as a risky one , which could seriously undermine the authority of the executive branch if the eu ’ s top court rules the finance ministers ’ action legal .
solbes ' spokesman , gerassimos thomas , admitted there were possible risks involved in taking the case to court , but said " it had to be done , " and that it is the commission ’ s " role as guardian of the treaty to ensure that provisions are upheld . "
although nothing has been made public about internal discussion surrounding the commission ’ s action , thomas confirmed that tuesday ’ s decision had not been unanimous among the 20 commissioners .
sources in brussels say the french , german and british commissioners were against taking legal action .
it is also not certain whether the court of justice will agree to the commission ’ s request for a fast-track procedure that would lead to a decision in three to six months rather than the normal two years .
solbes , however , is convinced the risky legal move is the correct strategy for the commission .
speaking to reporters after the announcement was made , he said the court challenge " has had great support , even if not all commissioners have agreed on all different aspects of the strategy .

the european commission on tuesday decided to seek a court ruling to overturn finance ministers ’ suspension of eu budget rules for france and germany .
member states criticize the action , saying it ’ s a risky move . the eu executive , which is responsible for enforcing laws in the 15-member bloc , argued that taking finance ministers to court was vital to clarify disciplinary procedures for those who break the eu ’ s guidelines on deficit spending , as france and germany have done repeatedly .
but the unprecedented legal move is expected to generate a considerable amount of friction at a time when the eu is concerned about maintaining cohesion .
german finance minister hans eichel said the decision to go to the european court of justice was " hard to understand " and added that he saw no wrong doing in the finance minister ’ s nov .
25 decision to forego disciplinary action against berlin and paris for violating the stability pact .
the results of the ecofin -lrb- council of european finance ministers -rrb- meeting " correspond to the spirit and the letter of the stability and growth pact , " he said in a statement released on tuesday .
" the procedures that are foreseen -lrb- in the pact -rrb- were upheld . "
at the meeting , germany and france , europe ’ s two biggest economies , used their combined influence to convince ecofin to reject the commission ’ s recommendation to punish berlin and paris for running up excessive budget deficits by slapping them with steep fines and forcing them to make deeper deficit cuts in 2004 .
the commission is now seeking a ruling on whether the ministers violated procedure in taking an ad hoc decision against the eu executive branch .
brussels vs. brussels " not least with a view to the tasks the european union faces in the near future , it would be more helpful to aim for cooperation rather than confrontation , " eichel said in response to the commission ’ s legal challenge .
but eu monetary affairs commssioner pedro solbes , whose office oversees the stability pact , has argued that brussels has a duty to uphold the law and avoid a precedent that could legitimize rule-breaking in the future and ultimately undermine the eu treaty .
french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin acknowledged that it was the commission ’ s right to seek recourse in court , but insisted the finance minister ’ s decision was legal .
" i respect the decision of the commission , but i am not worried about the result , " he told reporters during a visit in brussels .
legal advisors to the member states in the eu council said the ministers had a discretionary power to overturn the commission ’ s recommendation and doubt the eu executive will come out a clear winner in court .
a house divided against itself the commission itself is divided over the decision to seek legal action .
the move is seen as a risky one , which could seriously undermine the authority of the executive branch if the eu ’ s top court rules the finance ministers ’ action legal .
solbes ' spokesman , gerassimos thomas , admitted there were possible risks involved in taking the case to court , but said " it had to be done , " and that it is the commission ’ s " role as guardian of the treaty to ensure that provisions are upheld . "
although nothing has been made public about internal discussion surrounding the commission ’ s action , thomas confirmed that tuesday ’ s decision had not been unanimous among the 20 commissioners .
sources in brussels say the french , german and british commissioners were against taking legal action .
it is also not certain whether the court of justice will agree to the commission ’ s request for a fast-track procedure that would lead to a decision in three to six months rather than the normal two years .

the european commission on tuesday decided to seek a court ruling to overturn finance ministers ’ suspension of eu budget rules for france and germany .
member states criticize the action , saying it ’ s a risky move . the eu executive , which is responsible for enforcing laws in the 15-member bloc , argued that taking finance ministers to court was vital to clarify disciplinary procedures for those who break the eu ’ s guidelines on deficit spending , as france and germany have done repeatedly .
but the unprecedented legal move is expected to generate a considerable amount of friction at a time when the eu is concerned about maintaining cohesion .
german finance minister hans eichel said the decision to go to the european court of justice was " hard to understand " and added that he saw no wrong doing in the finance minister ’ s nov .
25 decision to forego disciplinary action against berlin and paris for violating the stability pact .
the results of the ecofin -lrb- council of european finance ministers -rrb- meeting " correspond to the spirit and the letter of the stability and growth pact , " he said in a statement released on tuesday .
" the procedures that are foreseen -lrb- in the pact -rrb- were upheld . "
at the meeting , germany and france , europe ’ s two biggest economies , used their combined influence to convince ecofin to reject the commission ’ s recommendation to punish berlin and paris for running up excessive budget deficits by slapping them with steep fines and forcing them to make deeper deficit cuts in 2004 .
the commission is now seeking a ruling on whether the ministers violated procedure in taking an ad hoc decision against the eu executive branch .
brussels vs. brussels " not least with a view to the tasks the european union faces in the near future , it would be more helpful to aim for cooperation rather than confrontation , " eichel said in response to the commission ’ s legal challenge .
but eu monetary affairs commssioner pedro solbes , whose office oversees the stability pact , has argued that brussels has a duty to uphold the law and avoid a precedent that could legitimize rule-breaking in the future and ultimately undermine the eu treaty .
french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin acknowledged that it was the commission ’ s right to seek recourse in court , but insisted the finance minister ’ s decision was legal .
" i respect the decision of the commission , but i am not worried about the result , " he told reporters during a visit in brussels .
legal advisors to the member states in the eu council said the ministers had a discretionary power to overturn the commission ’ s recommendation and doubt the eu executive will come out a clear winner in court .

the move is seen as a risky one , which could seriously undermine the authority of the executive branch if the eu ’ s top court rules the finance ministers ’ action legal .

now the irish prime minister bertie ahern has set out his intentions before the european parliament in strasbourg . the irish premier left his audience in no doubt about his top priority over the next six months .
he promised to pick the failed talks on an eu constitution off the floor and do all he could to elicit a final agreement .
" i pledge to you that the irish presidency will spare no effort to make progress and to facilitate consensus during our term in office .
the issue will command the highest priority under our presidency , " he told parliament .
ahern was also at pains to point out that time is of the essence if the european union wishes to keep its reputation in tact .
" excessive delay will damage our credibility and weaken our standing .
stalemate is not an option any of us can contemplate , " he said .
ahern said he planned to hold intensive talks with the heads of state and government ahead of the next eu summit in march , in order to come up with a possible solution to the sticking point of voting weights .
" i can assure the parliament that if my consultations suggest that there is a real prospect of agreement i will immediately move to seize the opportunity , " he said .
the talks last december , which should have been the crowning glory of italy 's six months in the eu presidential hot seat , ground to a halt when spain and poland refused to give up powerful voting rights established in the earlier nice treaty . something to celebrate a further high point during the irish presidency will be the addition of the ten new member states on may 1st .
and to mark the occasion , the irish government is planning to invite them all to dublin for a party .
as far as ahern is concerned , it is a moment in history which is well worth a celebration .
he told parliament that the founding fathers of a unified europe had dreamed of a time when europeans would never again kill each other in the name of natural resources , land or beliefs .
and with ten new states poised to join the bloc , the irish prime minister said that 2004 was a year in which europe was moving closer to making those dreams come true . with the constitution talks and eu expansion , the new president has a fat agenda for the next half a year , but looking beyond his six-month stint , he is confident that membership talks for romania and bulgaria will be concluded this year .
he is also hoping to see progress in the unification of the divided mediterranean island of cyprus .
as it stands , only the greek southern part will join the eu in may , but ahern also praised turkey 's attempts to close the gap between itself and europe .
a rallying call looking beyond europe 's borders , ahern called on the eu member states to do more in the fight against poverty and aids in africa .

now the irish prime minister bertie ahern has set out his intentions before the european parliament in strasbourg . the irish premier left his audience in no doubt about his top priority over the next six months .
he promised to pick the failed talks on an eu constitution off the floor and do all he could to elicit a final agreement .
" i pledge to you that the irish presidency will spare no effort to make progress and to facilitate consensus during our term in office .
the issue will command the highest priority under our presidency , " he told parliament .
ahern was also at pains to point out that time is of the essence if the european union wishes to keep its reputation in tact .
" excessive delay will damage our credibility and weaken our standing .
stalemate is not an option any of us can contemplate , " he said .
ahern said he planned to hold intensive talks with the heads of state and government ahead of the next eu summit in march , in order to come up with a possible solution to the sticking point of voting weights .
" i can assure the parliament that if my consultations suggest that there is a real prospect of agreement i will immediately move to seize the opportunity , " he said .
the talks last december , which should have been the crowning glory of italy 's six months in the eu presidential hot seat , ground to a halt when spain and poland refused to give up powerful voting rights established in the earlier nice treaty . something to celebrate a further high point during the irish presidency will be the addition of the ten new member states on may 1st .
and to mark the occasion , the irish government is planning to invite them all to dublin for a party .
as far as ahern is concerned , it is a moment in history which is well worth a celebration .
he told parliament that the founding fathers of a unified europe had dreamed of a time when europeans would never again kill each other in the name of natural resources , land or beliefs .
and with ten new states poised to join the bloc , the irish prime minister said that 2004 was a year in which europe was moving closer to making those dreams come true . with the constitution talks and eu expansion , the new president has a fat agenda for the next half a year , but looking beyond his six-month stint , he is confident that membership talks for romania and bulgaria will be concluded this year .
he is also hoping to see progress in the unification of the divided mediterranean island of cyprus .
as it stands , only the greek southern part will join the eu in may , but ahern also praised turkey 's attempts to close the gap between itself and europe .
a rallying call looking beyond europe 's borders , ahern called on the eu member states to do more in the fight against poverty and aids in africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 14.01.2004 opinion : sour grapes at the european commission ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pedro solbes is seeking legal action against the eu executive after weeks of dispute between brussels and berlin over the euro stability pact , the european commission has announced its intention to take the eu executive to the european court of justice . it 's a first in the history of the european union and it 's left germany gasping for breath and german finance minister hans eichel calling for " cooperation rather than confrontation . "
eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes , who is charged with overseeing the stability pact , is seeking legal backing to overturn a ruling which suspends eu budget rules for germany and france . so is this a case of solbes being a bad loser ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.01.2004 ireland puts eu constitution at the top of its agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertie ahern knows exactly which way he wants ireland 's turn at the eu presidency to go after a rocky shot at the helm of the eu presidency , italy handed the reins to ireland on january 1st .
now the irish prime minister bertie ahern has set out his intentions before the european parliament in strasbourg . the irish premier left his audience in no doubt about his top priority over the next six months .
he promised to pick the failed talks on an eu constitution off the floor and do all he could to elicit a final agreement .
" i pledge to you that the irish presidency will spare no effort to make progress and to facilitate consensus during our term in office .
the issue will command the highest priority under our presidency , " he told parliament .
ahern was also at pains to point out that time is of the essence if the european union wishes to keep its reputation in tact .
" excessive delay will damage our credibility and weaken our standing .
stalemate is not an option any of us can contemplate , " he said .
ahern said he planned to hold intensive talks with the heads of state and government ahead of the next eu summit in march , in order to come up with a possible solution to the sticking point of voting weights .
" i can assure the parliament that if my consultations suggest that there is a real prospect of agreement i will immediately move to seize the opportunity , " he said .
the talks last december , which should have been the crowning glory of italy 's six months in the eu presidential hot seat , ground to a halt when spain and poland refused to give up powerful voting rights established in the earlier nice treaty . something to celebrate a further high point during the irish presidency will be the addition of the ten new member states on may 1st .
and to mark the occasion , the irish government is planning to invite them all to dublin for a party .
as far as ahern is concerned , it is a moment in history which is well worth a celebration .
he told parliament that the founding fathers of a unified europe had dreamed of a time when europeans would never again kill each other in the name of natural resources , land or beliefs .
and with ten new states poised to join the bloc , the irish prime minister said that 2004 was a year in which europe was moving closer to making those dreams come true . with the constitution talks and eu expansion , the new president has a fat agenda for the next half a year , but looking beyond his six-month stint , he is confident that membership talks for romania and bulgaria will be concluded this year .
he is also hoping to see progress in the unification of the divided mediterranean island of cyprus .
as it stands , only the greek southern part will join the eu in may , but ahern also praised turkey 's attempts to close the gap between itself and europe .
a rallying call looking beyond europe 's borders , ahern called on the eu member states to do more in the fight against poverty and aids in africa .
he said it was crucial for developing nations that they resume talks with the world trade organization .
several members of the european parliament called on ahern to push forward his initiative on debt relief for the poorest countries in the world .
ireland wants to stimulate economic development in europe and has pledged to work towards the goal of making it the most innovative economic power in the world by the end of the decade .
ahern believes in increasing competitiveness in the union , and he voiced his support for the latest eu commission initiative to completely do away with restraints on service sector competition for professions such as doctors , lawyers , architects and pharmacists .
he told parliament that europe had to be as competitive as possible and that the greatest challenge is the desperate need for more and better employment .
ahern , who likes to go by the gallic name of taoiseach - meaning prime minister - will be turning his own attention to matters of employment over the coming months .
during his term in the rotating presidency , he will have to suggest a possible replacement for eu commission president romano prodi , whose term of office expires in november . bernd riegert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi 's star-crossed eu presidency italian premier silvio berlusconi steps down as eu council president wednesday .

now the irish prime minister bertie ahern has set out his intentions before the european parliament in strasbourg . the irish premier left his audience in no doubt about his top priority over the next six months .
he promised to pick the failed talks on an eu constitution off the floor and do all he could to elicit a final agreement .
" i pledge to you that the irish presidency will spare no effort to make progress and to facilitate consensus during our term in office .
the issue will command the highest priority under our presidency , " he told parliament .
ahern was also at pains to point out that time is of the essence if the european union wishes to keep its reputation in tact .
" excessive delay will damage our credibility and weaken our standing .
stalemate is not an option any of us can contemplate , " he said .
ahern said he planned to hold intensive talks with the heads of state and government ahead of the next eu summit in march , in order to come up with a possible solution to the sticking point of voting weights .
" i can assure the parliament that if my consultations suggest that there is a real prospect of agreement i will immediately move to seize the opportunity , " he said .
the talks last december , which should have been the crowning glory of italy 's six months in the eu presidential hot seat , ground to a halt when spain and poland refused to give up powerful voting rights established in the earlier nice treaty . something to celebrate a further high point during the irish presidency will be the addition of the ten new member states on may 1st .
and to mark the occasion , the irish government is planning to invite them all to dublin for a party .
as far as ahern is concerned , it is a moment in history which is well worth a celebration .
he told parliament that the founding fathers of a unified europe had dreamed of a time when europeans would never again kill each other in the name of natural resources , land or beliefs .
and with ten new states poised to join the bloc , the irish prime minister said that 2004 was a year in which europe was moving closer to making those dreams come true . with the constitution talks and eu expansion , the new president has a fat agenda for the next half a year , but looking beyond his six-month stint , he is confident that membership talks for romania and bulgaria will be concluded this year .
he is also hoping to see progress in the unification of the divided mediterranean island of cyprus .
as it stands , only the greek southern part will join the eu in may , but ahern also praised turkey 's attempts to close the gap between itself and europe .
a rallying call looking beyond europe 's borders , ahern called on the eu member states to do more in the fight against poverty and aids in africa .
he said it was crucial for developing nations that they resume talks with the world trade organization .
several members of the european parliament called on ahern to push forward his initiative on debt relief for the poorest countries in the world .
ireland wants to stimulate economic development in europe and has pledged to work towards the goal of making it the most innovative economic power in the world by the end of the decade .
ahern believes in increasing competitiveness in the union , and he voiced his support for the latest eu commission initiative to completely do away with restraints on service sector competition for professions such as doctors , lawyers , architects and pharmacists .
he told parliament that europe had to be as competitive as possible and that the greatest challenge is the desperate need for more and better employment .
ahern , who likes to go by the gallic name of taoiseach - meaning prime minister - will be turning his own attention to matters of employment over the coming months .
during his term in the rotating presidency , he will have to suggest a possible replacement for eu commission president romano prodi , whose term of office expires in november . bernd riegert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi 's star-crossed eu presidency italian premier silvio berlusconi steps down as eu council president wednesday .

a camera mounted on the mars express orbiter is expected to produce unprecedented images of the planet over the next years .
first images will be released next week .
dw-world took a look behind the scenes . berlin - ralf jaumann expects to feel a little edgy over the next two years .
the planetary geologist at the german aerospace center ’ s -lrb- dlr -rrb- institute for planetary research in berlin will be one of the first people to receive data collected by the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- .
“ every time we switch it on or off , i ’ m nervous , ” said jaumann , who will turn the data into raw images before sending the latter on for further analysis .
“ it will certainly become a matter of routine , but not completely . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf jaumann during a dw-tv interview .
last friday jaumann -lrb- photo -rrb- got another chance to jitter as the camera began searching for signs of the missing beagle 2 lander .
the robot probably crashed during touchdown on the martian surface . while beagle 2 was designed to conduct a small percentage of the mission ’ s ground experiments , focus is likely to shift now to the camera and other instruments mounted on the orbiter , such as marsis , a sub-surface sounding radar altimeter searching for water under the planet ’ s crust , or spicam , an ultraviolet and infrared spectrometer that will study the martian atmosphere . not all hope has been lost for finding the lander , however , and jaumann and his colleagues have been given a lot of data storage space on the orbiter to search for beagle 2 .
but neither he nor gerhard neukum , the hrsc project ’ s principal investigator at berlin ’ s free university , believe there ’ s much of a chance to discover the tiny robot . “ we haven ’ t seen beagle yet , ” neukum said on wednesday after looking through the first batch of “ outstanding ” data he ’ s received so far .
even though the probe has n't turned up , " these are the best data ever recorded , ” neukum said . while other missions , such as nasa ’ s global surveyor mission , have already produced high resolution images , the hrsc ’ s capability to produce colorful , three-dimensional pictures is a first , according to neukum .
“ we will be able to look at mars like we do with our eyes here on the surface of the earth , ” he said . in addition , an infrared image would allow scientists to determine the abundance of specific minerals on mars , neukum said .
he added that first images would be released to the public by jan .
20 . sending commands , receiving data while neukum and his team of 43 co-investigators will use the data to produce three-dimensional images and analyze them , jaumann and a group of 10 scientists will be testing and sending future commands to the camera and processing incoming data on a daily basis . the team does n't work in a big mission control center like the one in darmstadt , germany , where the mars express mission and the orbiter 's flight path is monitored .
tv crews are often disappointed when they come to visit his office in a non-descript building on the outskirts of the german capital , jaumann said .
“ years ago we had rooms with big computers , but now we get our data on machines like this one , ” he said , pointing to his apple powerbook . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a drawing of the hrsc camera .
to test commands , jaumann and his colleagues can work with an exact replica of the camera , which sits in a dlr laboratory .
several dozen screws have to be adjusted to find the perfect position .
“ it ’ s nothing spectacular , ” he said , pointing to the 20 kg -lrb- 44 pound -rrb- instrument that ’ s mounted on a table .
“ but hopefully it will produce spectacular pictures . ” mapping mars like never before the hrsc project ’ s goal is to produce a three-dimensional , colorful map of the entire martian surface at a resolution that has never been achieved before . detailed images of the red planet ’ s polar caps or volcanic regions will be even more interesting for scientists working on the project , however .
“ it ’ s more interesting to do fewer things in great detail rather than to do everything at a resolution that we have done with other missions , ” said wojciech markiewicz , a planetary scientist at the max planck institute for aeronomy in katlenburg-lindau in central germany . the camera ’ s images will allow scientists to locate rocks as small as two meters -lrb- 6.5 feet -rrb- , according to jaumann , who added that he expects the project to answer the question whether it ever rained on mars . putting the camera to work on earth the hrsc technology is not only useful for gaining a greater understanding of mars , however : a modified version of the camera has already mapped regions on earth .
many possibilities exist to put the instrument to commercial use , jaumann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insurance companies could use the camera to assess damage after a flood like the one in saxony in 2002 .
telecommunication companies could use the images to pinpoint the best locations for their antennae , cities could take inventory of things such as street signs , park benches and trees by looking at the pictures , jaumann said .
insurance companies could assess damage caused by floods immediately , hence preventing fraudulent claims later on .
even the european union could monitor fields of farmers who receive subsidies for not planting anything on their land . but others , who work in the commercial sector , will have to look into these options , jaumann said , adding that data from the hrsc will keep scientists busy for years to come .

defense minister peter struck 's announcement that some € 26 billion will be cut from the bundeswehr 's spending plans will hit the german arms industry hard . bundeswehr generals will be rewriting their wish lists after peter struck outlined his plans to reduce military spending on tuesday .
several missile projects are now set to be scrapped , and overall , the new budget constraints mean ever fewer contracts for arms manufacturers .
although the government says it will be sticking to procurement contracts already signed , such as orders for 180 eurofighter combat aircraft , the tiger combat helicopter and nh90 transport helicopter , projects such as upgrading the patriot missile defense systems and plans to buy a pilotless reconnaissance drone for the navy , will likely now be shelved .
a blow to industrial growth the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- fears the defense ministry 's move will have negative repercussions on the country 's industrial growth .
helmut harff , director of the bdi 's defense industries committee , says germany 's role within the european arms industry will now be severely reduced .
in an interview with deutsche welle , he said that " peter struck 's plans did n't come as a surprise to the defense industry , but it received very little information in advance . "
harff pointed out that " one needs to bear in mind that via the defense ministry , the government is the arms industry 's primary client , and for this section of the industry , the announced cuts mean major changes to existing business plans . "
a missed opportunity experts said the trend towards international mergers and alliances is now set to increase as a result of the defense cutbacks . harff , who served as first commander of the german troops in kosovo , predicted that germany may end up fast selling off its state-of-the-art technology .
although arms make up a very small share of germany 's total exports , he argued that the new cuts might mean germany could miss out on the opportunity to continue selling high-tech products on international markets .
" overall , exports of german munitions last year amounted to just 0.06 percent of germany 's total exports , which is very low , " said harff , before adding that " it 's important to maintain the technological means for manufacturing these munitions so that the country remains a player on the world market . "
a muted reaction so far , there 's been a muted reaction from business .
europe 's leading supplier of land forces systems , rheinmetall has welcomed the defense minister 's proposals because the company can now factor the cuts into its own planning security . but another company , kraus-maffei wegmann , a system vendor in the area of armored vehicles , has announced it does n't expect to be affected by the cuts .
germany 's arms industry may not have been given due warning of struck 's drastic agenda , but many companies are well-prepared nonetheless , having already introduced their own austerity measures some time ago and opted for new business strategies .
the same day the government revealed its plans , for example , european missile system manufacturer diehl announced it would be setting up a joint venture with american rival company raytheon to market a special sidewinder guided missile .
adhering to international agreements although the arms industry appears rather unruffled by the imminent cuts , harff pointed out that , in germany , the defense budget is a uniquely thorny issue .
he said he believes the key issue here is not so much arms spending , but rather security provisions for the future .
in that respect , he said , germany is is not sticking to international agreements .
" nato wants to see 2.3 percent of gross domestic product spent on security provisions , and in germany only 1.5 percent is being spent , " he observed .

the ratings of a new reality tv show in germany are climbing as minor celebrities are put through daily hair-raising ‘ challenges ’ in the australian jungle .
but as the tests get crueler , criticism is starting to grow . germany ’ s private television channel rtl has hit ratings pay dirt with its version of the british and american show “ i ’ m a celebrity get me out of here . ”
called “ ich bin ein star holt mich hier raus ” in german , the show has dropped ten b-list celebrities into a jungle in australia for 12 days . despite being inundated by reality tv in recent years , german viewers are flocking to the program , which forces one member of the group to undertake a stunt testing their courage each day in order to earn food for all .
but after a singer of questionable talent was forced to lie in a " cockroach coffin " with 30,000 of the wriggly creatures and an out-of-work tv host was pecked nearly to tears by a band of aggressive ostriches , media watchdogs and other groups are beginning to question the show ’ s lack of moral grounding . “ i ’ ve really been blown over .
these are methods that are reminiscent of torture tactics , ” jo groebel , the director of the european institute for the media in düsseldorf , told the associated press on wednesday . alarm bells for many went off when daniel küblböck , who become a celebrity as a performer in the german version of " pop idol , " suffered a panic attack after putting his head in a “ terror aquarium ” filled with eels and water spiders .
the melodramatic 18-year-old was forced to do three stunts in a row by the schadenfreude-filled audience , who voted by telephone on which cast member would be forced into the humiliating acts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel and the cockroaches .
walter eykmann from a national catholic church group told the daily tabloid newspaper bild that rtl was putting “ profits and ratings ” above the participants well-being .
“ it ’ s absolutely repugnant how daniel küblböck is being abused , ” eykmann said . plenty of publicity though the candidates earn € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,276 -rrb- for each day they stay in the camp for the charity of their choice , the real motivation is likely the free publicity that could help their careers .
shown live each evening , the show 's ratings have swelled in recent days .
on tuesday , it garnered a whopping third of the total viewing audience . despite the growing popularity of “ i ’ m a celebrity get me out of here , ” the company said it has so far kept the price of a 30-second commercial spot steady at € 34,500 .
and rtl has defended the program , saying all those taking part were aware of what they were getting into . “ the participants are acting of their own will and are public persons who know exactly what they are doing , ” said an rtl spokesman .
“ we aren ’ t torturing anyone . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krokodil im kölner zoo but some animal rights groups see things differently , saying that even if the celebrities can choose not to take part , the the snakes , spiders and cockroaches used in the television stunts can ’ t .

the ratings of a new reality tv show in germany are climbing as minor celebrities are put through daily hair-raising ‘ challenges ’ in the australian jungle .
but as the tests get crueler , criticism is starting to grow . germany ’ s private television channel rtl has hit ratings pay dirt with its version of the british and american show “ i ’ m a celebrity get me out of here . ”
called “ ich bin ein star holt mich hier raus ” in german , the show has dropped ten b-list celebrities into a jungle in australia for 12 days . despite being inundated by reality tv in recent years , german viewers are flocking to the program , which forces one member of the group to undertake a stunt testing their courage each day in order to earn food for all .
but after a singer of questionable talent was forced to lie in a " cockroach coffin " with 30,000 of the wriggly creatures and an out-of-work tv host was pecked nearly to tears by a band of aggressive ostriches , media watchdogs and other groups are beginning to question the show ’ s lack of moral grounding . “ i ’ ve really been blown over .
these are methods that are reminiscent of torture tactics , ” jo groebel , the director of the european institute for the media in düsseldorf , told the associated press on wednesday . alarm bells for many went off when daniel küblböck , who become a celebrity as a performer in the german version of " pop idol , " suffered a panic attack after putting his head in a “ terror aquarium ” filled with eels and water spiders .
the melodramatic 18-year-old was forced to do three stunts in a row by the schadenfreude-filled audience , who voted by telephone on which cast member would be forced into the humiliating acts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel and the cockroaches .
walter eykmann from a national catholic church group told the daily tabloid newspaper bild that rtl was putting “ profits and ratings ” above the participants well-being .
“ it ’ s absolutely repugnant how daniel küblböck is being abused , ” eykmann said . plenty of publicity though the candidates earn € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,276 -rrb- for each day they stay in the camp for the charity of their choice , the real motivation is likely the free publicity that could help their careers .
shown live each evening , the show 's ratings have swelled in recent days .
on tuesday , it garnered a whopping third of the total viewing audience . despite the growing popularity of “ i ’ m a celebrity get me out of here , ” the company said it has so far kept the price of a 30-second commercial spot steady at € 34,500 .
and rtl has defended the program , saying all those taking part were aware of what they were getting into . “ the participants are acting of their own will and are public persons who know exactly what they are doing , ” said an rtl spokesman .
“ we aren ’ t torturing anyone . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krokodil im kölner zoo but some animal rights groups see things differently , saying that even if the celebrities can choose not to take part , the the snakes , spiders and cockroaches used in the television stunts can ’ t .

defense minister peter struck 's announcement that some € 26 billion will be cut from the bundeswehr 's spending plans will hit the german arms industry hard . bundeswehr generals will be rewriting their wish lists after peter struck outlined his plans to reduce military spending on tuesday .
several missile projects are now set to be scrapped , and overall , the new budget constraints mean ever fewer contracts for arms manufacturers .
although the government says it will be sticking to procurement contracts already signed , such as orders for 180 eurofighter combat aircraft , the tiger combat helicopter and nh90 transport helicopter , projects such as upgrading the patriot missile defense systems and plans to buy a pilotless reconnaissance drone for the navy , will likely now be shelved .
a blow to industrial growth the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- fears the defense ministry 's move will have negative repercussions on the country 's industrial growth .
helmut harff , director of the bdi 's defense industries committee , says germany 's role within the european arms industry will now be severely reduced .
in an interview with deutsche welle , he said that " peter struck 's plans did n't come as a surprise to the defense industry , but it received very little information in advance . "
harff pointed out that " one needs to bear in mind that via the defense ministry , the government is the arms industry 's primary client , and for this section of the industry , the announced cuts mean major changes to existing business plans . "
a missed opportunity experts said the trend towards international mergers and alliances is now set to increase as a result of the defense cutbacks . harff , who served as first commander of the german troops in kosovo , predicted that germany may end up fast selling off its state-of-the-art technology .
although arms make up a very small share of germany 's total exports , he argued that the new cuts might mean germany could miss out on the opportunity to continue selling high-tech products on international markets .
" overall , exports of german munitions last year amounted to just 0.06 percent of germany 's total exports , which is very low , " said harff , before adding that " it 's important to maintain the technological means for manufacturing these munitions so that the country remains a player on the world market . "
a muted reaction so far , there 's been a muted reaction from business .
europe 's leading supplier of land forces systems , rheinmetall has welcomed the defense minister 's proposals because the company can now factor the cuts into its own planning security . but another company , kraus-maffei wegmann , a system vendor in the area of armored vehicles , has announced it does n't expect to be affected by the cuts .
germany 's arms industry may not have been given due warning of struck 's drastic agenda , but many companies are well-prepared nonetheless , having already introduced their own austerity measures some time ago and opted for new business strategies .
the same day the government revealed its plans , for example , european missile system manufacturer diehl announced it would be setting up a joint venture with american rival company raytheon to market a special sidewinder guided missile .
adhering to international agreements although the arms industry appears rather unruffled by the imminent cuts , harff pointed out that , in germany , the defense budget is a uniquely thorny issue .
he said he believes the key issue here is not so much arms spending , but rather security provisions for the future .
in that respect , he said , germany is is not sticking to international agreements .
" nato wants to see 2.3 percent of gross domestic product spent on security provisions , and in germany only 1.5 percent is being spent , " he observed .
but harff said he believes this has to change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.01.2004 taking a new look at mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mapping mars in 3-d and color .
a camera mounted on the mars express orbiter is expected to produce unprecedented images of the planet over the next years .
first images will be released next week .
dw-world took a look behind the scenes . berlin - ralf jaumann expects to feel a little edgy over the next two years .
the planetary geologist at the german aerospace center ’ s -lrb- dlr -rrb- institute for planetary research in berlin will be one of the first people to receive data collected by the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- .
“ every time we switch it on or off , i ’ m nervous , ” said jaumann , who will turn the data into raw images before sending the latter on for further analysis .
“ it will certainly become a matter of routine , but not completely . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf jaumann during a dw-tv interview .
last friday jaumann -lrb- photo -rrb- got another chance to jitter as the camera began searching for signs of the missing beagle 2 lander .
the robot probably crashed during touchdown on the martian surface . while beagle 2 was designed to conduct a small percentage of the mission ’ s ground experiments , focus is likely to shift now to the camera and other instruments mounted on the orbiter , such as marsis , a sub-surface sounding radar altimeter searching for water under the planet ’ s crust , or spicam , an ultraviolet and infrared spectrometer that will study the martian atmosphere . not all hope has been lost for finding the lander , however , and jaumann and his colleagues have been given a lot of data storage space on the orbiter to search for beagle 2 .
but neither he nor gerhard neukum , the hrsc project ’ s principal investigator at berlin ’ s free university , believe there ’ s much of a chance to discover the tiny robot . “ we haven ’ t seen beagle yet , ” neukum said on wednesday after looking through the first batch of “ outstanding ” data he ’ s received so far .
even though the probe has n't turned up , " these are the best data ever recorded , ” neukum said . while other missions , such as nasa ’ s global surveyor mission , have already produced high resolution images , the hrsc ’ s capability to produce colorful , three-dimensional pictures is a first , according to neukum .
“ we will be able to look at mars like we do with our eyes here on the surface of the earth , ” he said . in addition , an infrared image would allow scientists to determine the abundance of specific minerals on mars , neukum said .
he added that first images would be released to the public by jan .
20 . sending commands , receiving data while neukum and his team of 43 co-investigators will use the data to produce three-dimensional images and analyze them , jaumann and a group of 10 scientists will be testing and sending future commands to the camera and processing incoming data on a daily basis . the team does n't work in a big mission control center like the one in darmstadt , germany , where the mars express mission and the orbiter 's flight path is monitored .
tv crews are often disappointed when they come to visit his office in a non-descript building on the outskirts of the german capital , jaumann said .
“ years ago we had rooms with big computers , but now we get our data on machines like this one , ” he said , pointing to his apple powerbook . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a drawing of the hrsc camera .
to test commands , jaumann and his colleagues can work with an exact replica of the camera , which sits in a dlr laboratory .
several dozen screws have to be adjusted to find the perfect position .
“ it ’ s nothing spectacular , ” he said , pointing to the 20 kg -lrb- 44 pound -rrb- instrument that ’ s mounted on a table .
“ but hopefully it will produce spectacular pictures . ” mapping mars like never before the hrsc project ’ s goal is to produce a three-dimensional , colorful map of the entire martian surface at a resolution that has never been achieved before . detailed images of the red planet ’ s polar caps or volcanic regions will be even more interesting for scientists working on the project , however .
“ it ’ s more interesting to do fewer things in great detail rather than to do everything at a resolution that we have done with other missions , ” said wojciech markiewicz , a planetary scientist at the max planck institute for aeronomy in katlenburg-lindau in central germany . the camera ’ s images will allow scientists to locate rocks as small as two meters -lrb- 6.5 feet -rrb- , according to jaumann , who added that he expects the project to answer the question whether it ever rained on mars . putting the camera to work on earth the hrsc technology is not only useful for gaining a greater understanding of mars , however : a modified version of the camera has already mapped regions on earth .
many possibilities exist to put the instrument to commercial use , jaumann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insurance companies could use the camera to assess damage after a flood like the one in saxony in 2002 .
telecommunication companies could use the images to pinpoint the best locations for their antennae , cities could take inventory of things such as street signs , park benches and trees by looking at the pictures , jaumann said .
insurance companies could assess damage caused by floods immediately , hence preventing fraudulent claims later on .
even the european union could monitor fields of farmers who receive subsidies for not planting anything on their land . but others , who work in the commercial sector , will have to look into these options , jaumann said , adding that data from the hrsc will keep scientists busy for years to come .
“ we ’ re still working with apollo and viking data today , ” he said , referring to missions that ended decades ago . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mapping mars berlin-based planetary scientist gerhard neukum recently talked to dw-world about his plans to produce a three-dimensional map of mars with a camera mounted on european space agency ’ s mars express .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 14.01.2004 -pipe- 19:00 utc new hope for german companies in iraq a change in washington ’ s position on awarding contracts for rebuilding iraq has german businesses and politicians hoping for a new piece of the pie .
after germany and france , among others , were frozen out of the first round of u.s.-financed reconstruction contracts for opposing the iraq war , the bush administration on tuesday hinted that there was still room for companies from these nations to bid for billions of dollars in lucrative work .
although defense secretary donald rumsfeld declined to name which countries would be eligible to participate in the new round of contract biding , many in berlin and paris see the two big european players as intended .
jochen münker , head of the middle east division at the german chamber of industry and commerce , told ap that a change in the u.s. position barring war opponents was greatly welcomed .

on wednesday the spokeswoman for eu trade commissioner pascal lamy said the time wasn ’ t right to introduce the " made in the eu " label .
when it comes time for such a decision , she said the eu would consult representatives from industry , consumer advocacy groups and member states .
towards the beginning of march , the commission will present a list of various options , including displaying both national and european labels of origin .
the suggestion to introduce the eu seal came from italy and was an attempt to present consumers with an image of a cohesive europe .
industry leaders , however , have criticized the idea as undermining national interests .
the president of the federation of german industries , michael rogowski , warned the eu not to get rid of the german seal of origin .
" we are proud of our seal of quality , " he told the mass circulation bild .
" we reject a mandatory eu label .

on wednesday the spokeswoman for eu trade commissioner pascal lamy said the time wasn ’ t right to introduce the " made in the eu " label .
when it comes time for such a decision , she said the eu would consult representatives from industry , consumer advocacy groups and member states .
towards the beginning of march , the commission will present a list of various options , including displaying both national and european labels of origin .
the suggestion to introduce the eu seal came from italy and was an attempt to present consumers with an image of a cohesive europe .
industry leaders , however , have criticized the idea as undermining national interests .
the president of the federation of german industries , michael rogowski , warned the eu not to get rid of the german seal of origin .
" we are proud of our seal of quality , " he told the mass circulation bild .

the murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh plunged the country into a crisis last september .
now , with the confessed killer standing trial , swedes are hoping to draw a close to a dark moment in thier history . the man who admitted to killing lindh testified that voices in his head told him to stab the swedish minister repeatedly in the chest and arms .
" i couldn ’ t resist , " mijailo mijailovic confessed to the panel of judges in the packed stockholm courtroom on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mijailo mijailovic although he said he did indeed kill the widely popular anna lindh , the 25-year old swede of yugoslav origin denied it was for political reasons .
" i ’ m not interested in politics , " he told chief prosecutor krister petersson .
" i have nothing personal against anna lindh . "
mijailo ’ s lawyer , peter althin , has pushed for dropping the charges down to manslaughter rather than murder , arguing that his client had not planned the sept .
10 stabbing and that there was " no intent to kill . "
prosecutors , however , insist the attack was premeditated and argue that mijailovic stalked lindh for 14 minutes before stabbing her with a knife in a crowded department store .
given the killer ’ s confession and the prosecution ’ s overwhelming evidence , the court ’ s main task will be to determine whether mijailovic really intended to kill anna lindh or not .
why anna lindh ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the killer was caught on video tape in the department store when the prosecution asked whether he was specifically looking for lindh in the department store , mijailovic said he had been wandering aimlessly , without any reason .
" i just trotted around on different floors and visited all the departments , " he said .
he denied looking for anyone in particular .
he said he just saw lindh and voices in his head , including that of jesus , urged him to stab her - 10 times with a knife .
lindh died the next day in the hospital after doctors worked through the night to save her .
mijailovic , who was arrested sept .
24 , confessed last week , saying he wanted to end speculation about the motive , including media reports that he was upset over lindh ’ s support of the 1999 nato air strikes on serbia .
difficult search the death of one of the country ’ s best-loved politicians sent shock waves through sweden , and initially there were concerns that the murderer wouldn ’ t be found .
after a first suspect was detained and then quickly released without charge , public opinion against the police .
" we were under huge pressure to solve this murder , " said chief police investigator leif jennekvist .
" and we had to be careful to pass on the information in such a way that on the one had the public need for information would be satisfied , while on the other hand our work wouldn ’ t be hindered . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murder weapon it wasn ’ t until the end of september that mijailovic was arrested .
initially he denied the killing , however police managed to match his dna with that found at the murder scene and on the knife .
" only when we got the dna proof were we one hundred percent sure about the identity of the murder , " said jennekvist .
mijailovic , who has a history of mental problems and three previous convictions , including one for a 1996 stabbing of his father , could face a sentence of between 10 years and life in prison .
if found mentally unstable , he could also be sent to a mental hospital for mandatory treatment .
a previous psychiatric evaluation found him " in great need of psychiatric and psychotherapeutic efforts , " but concluded that there were no medical grounds to sentence him to psychiatric care .
painful recovery whichever way the sentence reads , the trial brings a sense of relief , a form of closure for sweden , said jennekvist .
bringing mijailovic to court will help heal national wounds surrounding the murder and the painful memories it evoked of the assassination of swedish prime minister olof palme in 1986 .

italy ’ s highest court on tuesday annulled a controversial legal immunity law that had shielded top officials from prosecution while in office .
prime minister silvio berlusconi could now once again face bribery charges . the law , which was passed last june , gave the country ’ s five highest officials immunity , but it has been criticized as existing solely to end berlusconi ’ s numerous legal headaches .
dubbed “ lex berlusconi ” by some , it helped the prime minister avoid possible conviction while italy held the rotating eu presidency last autumn . since the court has determined that the law is unconstitutional , berlusconi will once again face trial for allegedly bribing judges in the 1980s while he was a business man .
the trial had been stopped after the law went into effect . “ every man is the same before the law , ” antonio di pietro , an opposition member of parliament and former crusading prosecutor , told the associated press after the legislation was annulled . but berlusconi ’ s justice minister roberto castelli criticized the verdict , saying it could complicate relations between politicians and the judiciary .
“ i fear after this verdict the polemics will become even worse , ” he said . early elections ? berlusconi has repeatedly contended that he has done no wrong and left-wing magistrates have mounted an unfounded campaign against him .
in the face of a possible onslaught of politically motivated legal action against him , berlusconi is reportedly considering calling early elections . “ if that ’ s how things stand , then it ’ s better to go back to the polls , ” he told the daily newspaper corriere della sera . " the teflon premier " a billionaire media mogul turned politician , berlusconi has gone to court eight times over the past decade for varying corruption offenses .
he has been found guilty several times , however , by winning on appeal or due to the statute of limitations nothing has stuck to the " teflon premier . " though the latest case against berlusconi was stopped this summer after the immunity law was passed , the trial against his business associated continued .
a key charge that a firm owned by berlusconi bribed judges to win approval of a corporate takeover in the 1980s was rejected , but a court did convict berlusconi friend and lawyer cesare previti of paying off a rome judge .
previti is currently appealing his sentence of five years in jail . berlusconi , italy ’ s richest man , has repeatedly run into trouble due to his business dealings .
in december , italian president carlo azeglio ciampi decided not to sign a new media law that the opposition fears would add to the influence of the prime minister ’ s already powerful media empire . berlusconi owns three mediaset channels , italia 1 , rete 4 and canale 5 and as premier wields political influence over the board of state public broadcaster rai , mediaset 's only serious competition .

dubbed “ lex berlusconi ” by some , it helped the prime minister avoid possible conviction while italy held the rotating eu presidency last autumn . since the court has determined that the law is unconstitutional , berlusconi will once again face trial for allegedly bribing judges in the 1980s while he was a business man .
the trial had been stopped after the law went into effect . “ every man is the same before the law , ” antonio di pietro , an opposition member of parliament and former crusading prosecutor , told the associated press after the legislation was annulled . but berlusconi ’ s justice minister roberto castelli criticized the verdict , saying it could complicate relations between politicians and the judiciary .
“ i fear after this verdict the polemics will become even worse , ” he said . early elections ? berlusconi has repeatedly contended that he has done no wrong and left-wing magistrates have mounted an unfounded campaign against him .
in the face of a possible onslaught of politically motivated legal action against him , berlusconi is reportedly considering calling early elections . “ if that ’ s how things stand , then it ’ s better to go back to the polls , ” he told the daily newspaper corriere della sera . " the teflon premier " a billionaire media mogul turned politician , berlusconi has gone to court eight times over the past decade for varying corruption offenses .
he has been found guilty several times , however , by winning on appeal or due to the statute of limitations nothing has stuck to the " teflon premier . " though the latest case against berlusconi was stopped this summer after the immunity law was passed , the trial against his business associated continued .
a key charge that a firm owned by berlusconi bribed judges to win approval of a corporate takeover in the 1980s was rejected , but a court did convict berlusconi friend and lawyer cesare previti of paying off a rome judge .
previti is currently appealing his sentence of five years in jail . berlusconi , italy ’ s richest man , has repeatedly run into trouble due to his business dealings .
in december , italian president carlo azeglio ciampi decided not to sign a new media law that the opposition fears would add to the influence of the prime minister ’ s already powerful media empire . berlusconi owns three mediaset channels , italia 1 , rete 4 and canale 5 and as premier wields political influence over the board of state public broadcaster rai , mediaset 's only serious competition .

the murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh plunged the country into a crisis last september .
now , with the confessed killer standing trial , swedes are hoping to draw a close to a dark moment in thier history . the man who admitted to killing lindh testified that voices in his head told him to stab the swedish minister repeatedly in the chest and arms .
" i couldn ’ t resist , " mijailo mijailovic confessed to the panel of judges in the packed stockholm courtroom on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mijailo mijailovic although he said he did indeed kill the widely popular anna lindh , the 25-year old swede of yugoslav origin denied it was for political reasons .
" i ’ m not interested in politics , " he told chief prosecutor krister petersson .
" i have nothing personal against anna lindh . "
mijailo ’ s lawyer , peter althin , has pushed for dropping the charges down to manslaughter rather than murder , arguing that his client had not planned the sept .
10 stabbing and that there was " no intent to kill . "
prosecutors , however , insist the attack was premeditated and argue that mijailovic stalked lindh for 14 minutes before stabbing her with a knife in a crowded department store .
given the killer ’ s confession and the prosecution ’ s overwhelming evidence , the court ’ s main task will be to determine whether mijailovic really intended to kill anna lindh or not .
why anna lindh ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the killer was caught on video tape in the department store when the prosecution asked whether he was specifically looking for lindh in the department store , mijailovic said he had been wandering aimlessly , without any reason .
" i just trotted around on different floors and visited all the departments , " he said .
he denied looking for anyone in particular .
he said he just saw lindh and voices in his head , including that of jesus , urged him to stab her - 10 times with a knife .
lindh died the next day in the hospital after doctors worked through the night to save her .
mijailovic , who was arrested sept .
24 , confessed last week , saying he wanted to end speculation about the motive , including media reports that he was upset over lindh ’ s support of the 1999 nato air strikes on serbia .
difficult search the death of one of the country ’ s best-loved politicians sent shock waves through sweden , and initially there were concerns that the murderer wouldn ’ t be found .
after a first suspect was detained and then quickly released without charge , public opinion against the police .
" we were under huge pressure to solve this murder , " said chief police investigator leif jennekvist .
" and we had to be careful to pass on the information in such a way that on the one had the public need for information would be satisfied , while on the other hand our work wouldn ’ t be hindered . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murder weapon it wasn ’ t until the end of september that mijailovic was arrested .
initially he denied the killing , however police managed to match his dna with that found at the murder scene and on the knife .
" only when we got the dna proof were we one hundred percent sure about the identity of the murder , " said jennekvist .
mijailovic , who has a history of mental problems and three previous convictions , including one for a 1996 stabbing of his father , could face a sentence of between 10 years and life in prison .
if found mentally unstable , he could also be sent to a mental hospital for mandatory treatment .
a previous psychiatric evaluation found him " in great need of psychiatric and psychotherapeutic efforts , " but concluded that there were no medical grounds to sentence him to psychiatric care .
painful recovery whichever way the sentence reads , the trial brings a sense of relief , a form of closure for sweden , said jennekvist .
bringing mijailovic to court will help heal national wounds surrounding the murder and the painful memories it evoked of the assassination of swedish prime minister olof palme in 1986 .
like lindh , palme was attacked while out in public without bodyguards .

the ratings of a new reality tv show in germany are climbing as minor celebrities are put through daily hair-raising ‘ challenges ’ in the australian jungle .
but as the tests get crueler , criticism is starting to grow . germany ’ s private television channel rtl has hit ratings pay dirt with its version of the british and american show “ i ’ m a celebrity get me out of here . ”
called “ ich bin ein star holt mich hier raus ” in german , the show has dropped ten b-list celebrities into a jungle in australia for 12 days . despite being inundated by reality tv in recent years , german viewers are flocking to the program , which forces one member of the group to undertake a stunt testing their courage each day in order to earn food for all .
but after a singer of questionable talent was forced to lie in a " cockroach coffin " with 30,000 of the wriggly creatures and an out-of-work tv host was pecked nearly to tears by a band of aggressive ostriches , media watchdogs and other groups are beginning to question the show ’ s lack of moral grounding . “ i ’ ve really been blown over .
these are methods that are reminiscent of torture tactics , ” jo groebel , the director of the european institute for the media in düsseldorf , told the associated press on wednesday . alarm bells for many went off when daniel küblböck , who become a celebrity as a performer in the german version of " pop idol , " suffered a panic attack after putting his head in a “ terror aquarium ” filled with eels and water spiders .
the melodramatic 18-year-old was forced to do three stunts in a row by the schadenfreude-filled audience , who voted by telephone on which cast member would be forced into the humiliating acts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel and the cockroaches .
walter eykmann from a national catholic church group told the daily tabloid newspaper bild that rtl was putting “ profits and ratings ” above the participants well-being .
“ it ’ s absolutely repugnant how daniel küblböck is being abused , ” eykmann said . plenty of publicity though the candidates earn € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,276 -rrb- for each day they stay in the camp for the charity of their choice , the real motivation is likely the free publicity that could help their careers .
shown live each evening , the show 's ratings have swelled in recent days .
on tuesday , it garnered a whopping third of the total viewing audience . despite the growing popularity of “ i ’ m a celebrity get me out of here , ” the company said it has so far kept the price of a 30-second commercial spot steady at € 34,500 .
and rtl has defended the program , saying all those taking part were aware of what they were getting into . “ the participants are acting of their own will and are public persons who know exactly what they are doing , ” said an rtl spokesman .
“ we aren ’ t torturing anyone . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krokodil im kölner zoo but some animal rights groups see things differently , saying that even if the celebrities can choose not to take part , the the snakes , spiders and cockroaches used in the television stunts can ’ t .
both the association against cruelty to animals and german association for the protection of animals have criticized the show for using living creatures simply for a scare effect . germany ’ s authority for television standards has also stepped in to the debate and is planning to hold a hearing on feb .
11 to determine whether rtl 's show breaks the country 's normal standards of broadcast decency .
however , since the two-week run of “ i ’ m a celebrity get me out of here ” will long be over by then , there appears little chance the plug will be pulled .

germany 's railway celebrates a decade as a private company on wednesday .
the deutsche bahn chairman hopes it will be ready to go public in 2005 - but meanwhile , it continues accruing debt . just days after opening , berlin 's newest five-star hotel , the ritz-carlton , is warming up for a bash in honor of the 10th anniversary of germany 's state railway system going private . its host , deutsche bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn , predictably lauds the reform as " a huge success . " " after -lrb- the fall of the berlin wall -rrb- we had two train companies that were on their last legs economically , " mehdorn told the newspaper die welt on the eve of the celebration .
" we know we 're not done , but what this company and its employees have done is unparalleled . " but that has n't put a stop to harsh criticism of db from politicians , economists and passengers . a mountain of debt the trip to where the bahn stands today has been a long one .
based on the recommendations of a government-appointed commission in late 1991 , parliament decided it was time to reform the railway - and it promptly began amending around 130 laws to change its status . in january 1994 , the west and east german railway companies were merged into a stock corporation called deutsche bahn , with the federal government retaining full ownership . by that time , west germany 's railway alone had amassed € 34 billion -lrb- $ 43.5 billion -rrb- in debt .
its enormous losses - € 7.9 billion during its last year as a state agency - were paid for by taxpayers . germany could afford either the national train system or the army but not both , former chancellor helmut schmidt was quoted as saying at the time . but the government nonetheless assumed the mountain of debt , giving db a fresh start . since then , the government has taken a less hands-on approach to deutsche bahn . db , after all , became a private company that was expected to generate a profit .
while politicians no longer dictate the bahn 's day-to-day actions , the government does have a say in strategic decisions through infrastructural funding and members on the company 's supervisory board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn " the numbers speak for themselves , " mehdorn told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" we have saved german taxpayers around € 108 billion -lrb- since 1994 -rrb- , more than € 44 billion more than what independent experts forecasted at the time " for what the government would save if it made deutsche bahn an independent , self-sufficient company .
but mehdorn 's calculations are based on the assumption that the catastrophic pre-reform situation would have continued without change . no more clean slate mehdorn , deutsche bahn ceo since 1999 , can brag that db does n't pocket subsidies to cover its operating costs .
but it still receives around € 10 billion annually from federal and state sources to pay for commuter traffic and infrastructure development . and it 's incurring debts again .
in the first half of 2003 , operating loss after interest stood at € 143 million .
that was down from € 235 million a year earlier - and mehdorn has said he plans to get the company back into the black in 2004 . those plans precede tuesday 's news that mehdorn and co. are considering cost-cutting measures , including abandoning costly refurbishment and expansion plans for 2004 . for example , the long-awaited high-speed rail line between erfurt and nuremburg that would reduce total travel time between berlin and munich but would cost up to € 244 million to build could become the first victim of the cuts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worse yet , db appears to be one of the businesses german consumers most love to hate , along with deutsche post and deutsche telekom , which were also privatized in the 1990s .
last year , db introduced fare reforms that drew so many complaints that the railway gave in after about half a year and reinstated the old fare structure . the company 's byzantine new fare system - modeled after the airlines , with discounts for advance purchases but maximum fares for those purchased at the time of journey - remains not only confusing but often significantly more expensive than other forms of transportation .
indeed , a recent report claimed that as many as 25 percent of the flights by budget airlines within germany , like germanwings or hapag lloyd express , are taking customers away from deutsche bahn with lower prices and faster travel times . db announced drastic cuts in service personnel in late 2003 , including the closure of ticket counters that has led to longer lines at ticket and information counters .
only 85 percent of the trains are on time , which db defines as being no more than five minutes late - well below the company 's stated goal of 95 percent . going public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late trains abound but mehdorn , known for claiming that passenger lobbyists are whiners and even seeking to take legal action against them , is apparently not entirely oblivious to customers ' irritations .
" we have to get better at punctuality and information for our customers when there are irregularities , " he told die welt .
this is of special concern , since mehdorn has made it clear that he 's trying to get db in shape for an initial public offering by 2005 . he has his work cut out for him .
besides improving db 's image among passengers , mehdorn is faced with stiff competition from budget airlines in the passenger division and from trucking firms in the cargo field .
db 's cargo transport has been hit especially hard , with its market share dropping from 21 to 15.6 percent between 1990 and 2002 . it 's also hindered by its lack of punctuality and weak rail infrastructures in eastern europe . the company has also seen significant drops in its passenger traffic .
in a recent report , the european commission stated that since 1995 passenger rail traffic across europe rose 12 percent .
in germany , however , it fell by 7.6 percent - a sharp contrast to the 30 percent growth experienced in france . ten years after privatization the consensus seems to be that reforming the railways was the right thing to do .
nonetheless , critics still have plenty of fodder to fuel their anti-bahn arguments . dw staff -lrb- ni -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de roadwork ahead for the european union six months before enlargement , only one fifth of the ambitious europe-wide infrastructure plans called for in maastricht treaty have been finished .

germany 's railway celebrates a decade as a private company on wednesday .
the deutsche bahn chairman hopes it will be ready to go public in 2005 - but meanwhile , it continues accruing debt . just days after opening , berlin 's newest five-star hotel , the ritz-carlton , is warming up for a bash in honor of the 10th anniversary of germany 's state railway system going private . its host , deutsche bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn , predictably lauds the reform as " a huge success . " " after -lrb- the fall of the berlin wall -rrb- we had two train companies that were on their last legs economically , " mehdorn told the newspaper die welt on the eve of the celebration .
" we know we 're not done , but what this company and its employees have done is unparalleled . " but that has n't put a stop to harsh criticism of db from politicians , economists and passengers . a mountain of debt the trip to where the bahn stands today has been a long one .
based on the recommendations of a government-appointed commission in late 1991 , parliament decided it was time to reform the railway - and it promptly began amending around 130 laws to change its status . in january 1994 , the west and east german railway companies were merged into a stock corporation called deutsche bahn , with the federal government retaining full ownership . by that time , west germany 's railway alone had amassed € 34 billion -lrb- $ 43.5 billion -rrb- in debt .
its enormous losses - € 7.9 billion during its last year as a state agency - were paid for by taxpayers . germany could afford either the national train system or the army but not both , former chancellor helmut schmidt was quoted as saying at the time . but the government nonetheless assumed the mountain of debt , giving db a fresh start . since then , the government has taken a less hands-on approach to deutsche bahn . db , after all , became a private company that was expected to generate a profit .
while politicians no longer dictate the bahn 's day-to-day actions , the government does have a say in strategic decisions through infrastructural funding and members on the company 's supervisory board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn " the numbers speak for themselves , " mehdorn told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" we have saved german taxpayers around € 108 billion -lrb- since 1994 -rrb- , more than € 44 billion more than what independent experts forecasted at the time " for what the government would save if it made deutsche bahn an independent , self-sufficient company .
but mehdorn 's calculations are based on the assumption that the catastrophic pre-reform situation would have continued without change . no more clean slate mehdorn , deutsche bahn ceo since 1999 , can brag that db does n't pocket subsidies to cover its operating costs .
but it still receives around € 10 billion annually from federal and state sources to pay for commuter traffic and infrastructure development . and it 's incurring debts again .
in the first half of 2003 , operating loss after interest stood at € 143 million .
that was down from € 235 million a year earlier - and mehdorn has said he plans to get the company back into the black in 2004 . those plans precede tuesday 's news that mehdorn and co. are considering cost-cutting measures , including abandoning costly refurbishment and expansion plans for 2004 . for example , the long-awaited high-speed rail line between erfurt and nuremburg that would reduce total travel time between berlin and munich but would cost up to € 244 million to build could become the first victim of the cuts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worse yet , db appears to be one of the businesses german consumers most love to hate , along with deutsche post and deutsche telekom , which were also privatized in the 1990s .

the european commission on tuesday decided to seek a court ruling to overturn finance ministers ’ suspension of eu budget rules for france and germany .
member states criticize the action , saying it ’ s a risky move . the eu executive , which is responsible for enforcing laws in the 15-member bloc , argued that taking finance ministers to court was vital to clarify disciplinary procedures for those who break the eu ’ s guidelines on deficit spending , as france and germany have done repeatedly .
but the unprecedented legal move is expected to generate a considerable amount of friction at a time when the eu is concerned about maintaining cohesion .
german finance minister hans eichel said the decision to go to the european court of justice was " hard to understand " and added that he saw no wrong doing in the finance minister ’ s nov .
25 decision to forego disciplinary action against berlin and paris for violating the stability pact .
the results of the ecofin -lrb- council of european finance ministers -rrb- meeting " correspond to the spirit and the letter of the stability and growth pact , " he said in a statement released on tuesday .
" the procedures that are foreseen -lrb- in the pact -rrb- were upheld . "
at the meeting , germany and france , europe ’ s two biggest economies , used their combined influence to convince ecofin to reject the commission ’ s recommendation to punish berlin and paris for running up excessive budget deficits by slapping them with steep fines and forcing them to make deeper deficit cuts in 2004 .
the commission is now seeking a ruling on whether the ministers violated procedure in taking an ad hoc decision against the eu executive branch .
brussels vs. brussels " not least with a view to the tasks the european union faces in the near future , it would be more helpful to aim for cooperation rather than confrontation , " eichel said in response to the commission ’ s legal challenge .
but eu monetary affairs commssioner pedro solbes , whose office oversees the stability pact , has argued that brussels has a duty to uphold the law and avoid a precedent that could legitimize rule-breaking in the future and ultimately undermine the eu treaty .
french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin acknowledged that it was the commission ’ s right to seek recourse in court , but insisted the finance minister ’ s decision was legal .
" i respect the decision of the commission , but i am not worried about the result , " he told reporters during a visit in brussels .
legal advisors to the member states in the eu council said the ministers had a discretionary power to overturn the commission ’ s recommendation and doubt the eu executive will come out a clear winner in court .
a house divided against itself the commission itself is divided over the decision to seek legal action .
the move is seen as a risky one , which could seriously undermine the authority of the executive branch if the eu ’ s top court rules the finance ministers ’ action legal .
solbes ' spokesman , gerassimos thomas , admitted there were possible risks involved in taking the case to court , but said " it had to be done , " and that it is the commission ’ s " role as guardian of the treaty to ensure that provisions are upheld . "
although nothing has been made public about internal discussion surrounding the commission ’ s action , thomas confirmed that tuesday ’ s decision had not been unanimous among the 20 commissioners .
sources in brussels say the french , german and british commissioners were against taking legal action .
it is also not certain whether the court of justice will agree to the commission ’ s request for a fast-track procedure that would lead to a decision in three to six months rather than the normal two years .
solbes , however , is convinced the risky legal move is the correct strategy for the commission .
speaking to reporters after the announcement was made , he said the court challenge " has had great support , even if not all commissioners have agreed on all different aspects of the strategy .

brussels vs. brussels " not least with a view to the tasks the european union faces in the near future , it would be more helpful to aim for cooperation rather than confrontation , " eichel said in response to the commission ’ s legal challenge .
but eu monetary affairs commssioner pedro solbes , whose office oversees the stability pact , has argued that brussels has a duty to uphold the law and avoid a precedent that could legitimize rule-breaking in the future and ultimately undermine the eu treaty .
french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin acknowledged that it was the commission ’ s right to seek recourse in court , but insisted the finance minister ’ s decision was legal .
" i respect the decision of the commission , but i am not worried about the result , " he told reporters during a visit in brussels .
legal advisors to the member states in the eu council said the ministers had a discretionary power to overturn the commission ’ s recommendation and doubt the eu executive will come out a clear winner in court .
a house divided against itself the commission itself is divided over the decision to seek legal action .
the move is seen as a risky one , which could seriously undermine the authority of the executive branch if the eu ’ s top court rules the finance ministers ’ action legal .
solbes ' spokesman , gerassimos thomas , admitted there were possible risks involved in taking the case to court , but said " it had to be done , " and that it is the commission ’ s " role as guardian of the treaty to ensure that provisions are upheld . "
although nothing has been made public about internal discussion surrounding the commission ’ s action , thomas confirmed that tuesday ’ s decision had not been unanimous among the 20 commissioners .
sources in brussels say the french , german and british commissioners were against taking legal action .
it is also not certain whether the court of justice will agree to the commission ’ s request for a fast-track procedure that would lead to a decision in three to six months rather than the normal two years .
solbes , however , is convinced the risky legal move is the correct strategy for the commission .
speaking to reporters after the announcement was made , he said the court challenge " has had great support , even if not all commissioners have agreed on all different aspects of the strategy .

germany 's railway celebrates a decade as a private company on wednesday .
the deutsche bahn chairman hopes it will be ready to go public in 2005 - but meanwhile , it continues accruing debt . just days after opening , berlin 's newest five-star hotel , the ritz-carlton , is warming up for a bash in honor of the 10th anniversary of germany 's state railway system going private . its host , deutsche bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn , predictably lauds the reform as " a huge success . " " after -lrb- the fall of the berlin wall -rrb- we had two train companies that were on their last legs economically , " mehdorn told the newspaper die welt on the eve of the celebration .
" we know we 're not done , but what this company and its employees have done is unparalleled . " but that has n't put a stop to harsh criticism of db from politicians , economists and passengers . a mountain of debt the trip to where the bahn stands today has been a long one .
based on the recommendations of a government-appointed commission in late 1991 , parliament decided it was time to reform the railway - and it promptly began amending around 130 laws to change its status . in january 1994 , the west and east german railway companies were merged into a stock corporation called deutsche bahn , with the federal government retaining full ownership . by that time , west germany 's railway alone had amassed € 34 billion -lrb- $ 43.5 billion -rrb- in debt .
its enormous losses - € 7.9 billion during its last year as a state agency - were paid for by taxpayers . germany could afford either the national train system or the army but not both , former chancellor helmut schmidt was quoted as saying at the time . but the government nonetheless assumed the mountain of debt , giving db a fresh start . since then , the government has taken a less hands-on approach to deutsche bahn . db , after all , became a private company that was expected to generate a profit .
while politicians no longer dictate the bahn 's day-to-day actions , the government does have a say in strategic decisions through infrastructural funding and members on the company 's supervisory board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn " the numbers speak for themselves , " mehdorn told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" we have saved german taxpayers around € 108 billion -lrb- since 1994 -rrb- , more than € 44 billion more than what independent experts forecasted at the time " for what the government would save if it made deutsche bahn an independent , self-sufficient company .
but mehdorn 's calculations are based on the assumption that the catastrophic pre-reform situation would have continued without change . no more clean slate mehdorn , deutsche bahn ceo since 1999 , can brag that db does n't pocket subsidies to cover its operating costs .
but it still receives around € 10 billion annually from federal and state sources to pay for commuter traffic and infrastructure development . and it 's incurring debts again .
in the first half of 2003 , operating loss after interest stood at € 143 million .
that was down from € 235 million a year earlier - and mehdorn has said he plans to get the company back into the black in 2004 . those plans precede tuesday 's news that mehdorn and co. are considering cost-cutting measures , including abandoning costly refurbishment and expansion plans for 2004 . for example , the long-awaited high-speed rail line between erfurt and nuremburg that would reduce total travel time between berlin and munich but would cost up to € 244 million to build could become the first victim of the cuts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worse yet , db appears to be one of the businesses german consumers most love to hate , along with deutsche post and deutsche telekom , which were also privatized in the 1990s .
last year , db introduced fare reforms that drew so many complaints that the railway gave in after about half a year and reinstated the old fare structure . the company 's byzantine new fare system - modeled after the airlines , with discounts for advance purchases but maximum fares for those purchased at the time of journey - remains not only confusing but often significantly more expensive than other forms of transportation .
indeed , a recent report claimed that as many as 25 percent of the flights by budget airlines within germany , like germanwings or hapag lloyd express , are taking customers away from deutsche bahn with lower prices and faster travel times . db announced drastic cuts in service personnel in late 2003 , including the closure of ticket counters that has led to longer lines at ticket and information counters .
only 85 percent of the trains are on time , which db defines as being no more than five minutes late - well below the company 's stated goal of 95 percent . going public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late trains abound but mehdorn , known for claiming that passenger lobbyists are whiners and even seeking to take legal action against them , is apparently not entirely oblivious to customers ' irritations .
" we have to get better at punctuality and information for our customers when there are irregularities , " he told die welt .
this is of special concern , since mehdorn has made it clear that he 's trying to get db in shape for an initial public offering by 2005 . he has his work cut out for him .
besides improving db 's image among passengers , mehdorn is faced with stiff competition from budget airlines in the passenger division and from trucking firms in the cargo field .
db 's cargo transport has been hit especially hard , with its market share dropping from 21 to 15.6 percent between 1990 and 2002 . it 's also hindered by its lack of punctuality and weak rail infrastructures in eastern europe . the company has also seen significant drops in its passenger traffic .
in a recent report , the european commission stated that since 1995 passenger rail traffic across europe rose 12 percent .
in germany , however , it fell by 7.6 percent - a sharp contrast to the 30 percent growth experienced in france . ten years after privatization the consensus seems to be that reforming the railways was the right thing to do .
nonetheless , critics still have plenty of fodder to fuel their anti-bahn arguments . dw staff -lrb- ni -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de roadwork ahead for the european union six months before enlargement , only one fifth of the ambitious europe-wide infrastructure plans called for in maastricht treaty have been finished .

defense minister peter struck 's announcement that some € 26 billion will be cut from the bundeswehr 's spending plans will hit the german arms industry hard . bundeswehr generals will be rewriting their wish lists after peter struck outlined his plans to reduce military spending on tuesday .
several missile projects are now set to be scrapped , and overall , the new budget constraints mean ever fewer contracts for arms manufacturers .
although the government says it will be sticking to procurement contracts already signed , such as orders for 180 eurofighter combat aircraft , the tiger combat helicopter and nh90 transport helicopter , projects such as upgrading the patriot missile defense systems and plans to buy a pilotless reconnaissance drone for the navy , will likely now be shelved .
a blow to industrial growth the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- fears the defense ministry 's move will have negative repercussions on the country 's industrial growth .
helmut harff , director of the bdi 's defense industries committee , says germany 's role within the european arms industry will now be severely reduced .
in an interview with deutsche welle , he said that " peter struck 's plans did n't come as a surprise to the defense industry , but it received very little information in advance . "
harff pointed out that " one needs to bear in mind that via the defense ministry , the government is the arms industry 's primary client , and for this section of the industry , the announced cuts mean major changes to existing business plans . "
a missed opportunity experts said the trend towards international mergers and alliances is now set to increase as a result of the defense cutbacks . harff , who served as first commander of the german troops in kosovo , predicted that germany may end up fast selling off its state-of-the-art technology .
although arms make up a very small share of germany 's total exports , he argued that the new cuts might mean germany could miss out on the opportunity to continue selling high-tech products on international markets .
" overall , exports of german munitions last year amounted to just 0.06 percent of germany 's total exports , which is very low , " said harff , before adding that " it 's important to maintain the technological means for manufacturing these munitions so that the country remains a player on the world market . "
a muted reaction so far , there 's been a muted reaction from business .
europe 's leading supplier of land forces systems , rheinmetall has welcomed the defense minister 's proposals because the company can now factor the cuts into its own planning security . but another company , kraus-maffei wegmann , a system vendor in the area of armored vehicles , has announced it does n't expect to be affected by the cuts .
germany 's arms industry may not have been given due warning of struck 's drastic agenda , but many companies are well-prepared nonetheless , having already introduced their own austerity measures some time ago and opted for new business strategies .
the same day the government revealed its plans , for example , european missile system manufacturer diehl announced it would be setting up a joint venture with american rival company raytheon to market a special sidewinder guided missile .
adhering to international agreements although the arms industry appears rather unruffled by the imminent cuts , harff pointed out that , in germany , the defense budget is a uniquely thorny issue .
he said he believes the key issue here is not so much arms spending , but rather security provisions for the future .
in that respect , he said , germany is is not sticking to international agreements .
" nato wants to see 2.3 percent of gross domestic product spent on security provisions , and in germany only 1.5 percent is being spent , " he observed .
but harff said he believes this has to change .
" other countries invest considerably more , " he said .
" last year , for example , france invested three times as much -lrb- in its military -rrb- as germany .

defense minister peter struck 's announcement that some € 26 billion will be cut from the bundeswehr 's spending plans will hit the german arms industry hard . bundeswehr generals will be rewriting their wish lists after peter struck outlined his plans to reduce military spending on tuesday .
several missile projects are now set to be scrapped , and overall , the new budget constraints mean ever fewer contracts for arms manufacturers .
although the government says it will be sticking to procurement contracts already signed , such as orders for 180 eurofighter combat aircraft , the tiger combat helicopter and nh90 transport helicopter , projects such as upgrading the patriot missile defense systems and plans to buy a pilotless reconnaissance drone for the navy , will likely now be shelved .
a blow to industrial growth the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- fears the defense ministry 's move will have negative repercussions on the country 's industrial growth .
helmut harff , director of the bdi 's defense industries committee , says germany 's role within the european arms industry will now be severely reduced .
in an interview with deutsche welle , he said that " peter struck 's plans did n't come as a surprise to the defense industry , but it received very little information in advance . "
harff pointed out that " one needs to bear in mind that via the defense ministry , the government is the arms industry 's primary client , and for this section of the industry , the announced cuts mean major changes to existing business plans . "
a missed opportunity experts said the trend towards international mergers and alliances is now set to increase as a result of the defense cutbacks . harff , who served as first commander of the german troops in kosovo , predicted that germany may end up fast selling off its state-of-the-art technology .
although arms make up a very small share of germany 's total exports , he argued that the new cuts might mean germany could miss out on the opportunity to continue selling high-tech products on international markets .
" overall , exports of german munitions last year amounted to just 0.06 percent of germany 's total exports , which is very low , " said harff , before adding that " it 's important to maintain the technological means for manufacturing these munitions so that the country remains a player on the world market . "
a muted reaction so far , there 's been a muted reaction from business .
europe 's leading supplier of land forces systems , rheinmetall has welcomed the defense minister 's proposals because the company can now factor the cuts into its own planning security . but another company , kraus-maffei wegmann , a system vendor in the area of armored vehicles , has announced it does n't expect to be affected by the cuts .
germany 's arms industry may not have been given due warning of struck 's drastic agenda , but many companies are well-prepared nonetheless , having already introduced their own austerity measures some time ago and opted for new business strategies .
the same day the government revealed its plans , for example , european missile system manufacturer diehl announced it would be setting up a joint venture with american rival company raytheon to market a special sidewinder guided missile .
adhering to international agreements although the arms industry appears rather unruffled by the imminent cuts , harff pointed out that , in germany , the defense budget is a uniquely thorny issue .
he said he believes the key issue here is not so much arms spending , but rather security provisions for the future .
in that respect , he said , germany is is not sticking to international agreements .
" nato wants to see 2.3 percent of gross domestic product spent on security provisions , and in germany only 1.5 percent is being spent , " he observed .

the ratings of a new reality tv show in germany are climbing as minor celebrities are put through daily hair-raising ‘ challenges ’ in the australian jungle .
but as the tests get crueler , criticism is starting to grow . germany ’ s private television channel rtl has hit ratings pay dirt with its version of the british and american show “ i ’ m a celebrity get me out of here . ”
called “ ich bin ein star holt mich hier raus ” in german , the show has dropped ten b-list celebrities into a jungle in australia for 12 days . despite being inundated by reality tv in recent years , german viewers are flocking to the program , which forces one member of the group to undertake a stunt testing their courage each day in order to earn food for all .
but after a singer of questionable talent was forced to lie in a " cockroach coffin " with 30,000 of the wriggly creatures and an out-of-work tv host was pecked nearly to tears by a band of aggressive ostriches , media watchdogs and other groups are beginning to question the show ’ s lack of moral grounding . “ i ’ ve really been blown over .
these are methods that are reminiscent of torture tactics , ” jo groebel , the director of the european institute for the media in düsseldorf , told the associated press on wednesday . alarm bells for many went off when daniel küblböck , who become a celebrity as a performer in the german version of " pop idol , " suffered a panic attack after putting his head in a “ terror aquarium ” filled with eels and water spiders .
the melodramatic 18-year-old was forced to do three stunts in a row by the schadenfreude-filled audience , who voted by telephone on which cast member would be forced into the humiliating acts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel and the cockroaches .
walter eykmann from a national catholic church group told the daily tabloid newspaper bild that rtl was putting “ profits and ratings ” above the participants well-being .
“ it ’ s absolutely repugnant how daniel küblböck is being abused , ” eykmann said . plenty of publicity though the candidates earn € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,276 -rrb- for each day they stay in the camp for the charity of their choice , the real motivation is likely the free publicity that could help their careers .
shown live each evening , the show 's ratings have swelled in recent days .
on tuesday , it garnered a whopping third of the total viewing audience . despite the growing popularity of “ i ’ m a celebrity get me out of here , ” the company said it has so far kept the price of a 30-second commercial spot steady at € 34,500 .
and rtl has defended the program , saying all those taking part were aware of what they were getting into . “ the participants are acting of their own will and are public persons who know exactly what they are doing , ” said an rtl spokesman .
“ we aren ’ t torturing anyone . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krokodil im kölner zoo but some animal rights groups see things differently , saying that even if the celebrities can choose not to take part , the the snakes , spiders and cockroaches used in the television stunts can ’ t .
both the association against cruelty to animals and german association for the protection of animals have criticized the show for using living creatures simply for a scare effect . germany ’ s authority for television standards has also stepped in to the debate and is planning to hold a hearing on feb .
11 to determine whether rtl 's show breaks the country 's normal standards of broadcast decency .
however , since the two-week run of “ i ’ m a celebrity get me out of here ” will long be over by then , there appears little chance the plug will be pulled .

the murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh plunged the country into a crisis last september .
now , with the confessed killer standing trial , swedes are hoping to draw a close to a dark moment in thier history . the man who admitted to killing lindh testified that voices in his head told him to stab the swedish minister repeatedly in the chest and arms .
" i couldn ’ t resist , " mijailo mijailovic confessed to the panel of judges in the packed stockholm courtroom on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mijailo mijailovic although he said he did indeed kill the widely popular anna lindh , the 25-year old swede of yugoslav origin denied it was for political reasons .
" i ’ m not interested in politics , " he told chief prosecutor krister petersson .
" i have nothing personal against anna lindh . "
mijailo ’ s lawyer , peter althin , has pushed for dropping the charges down to manslaughter rather than murder , arguing that his client had not planned the sept .
10 stabbing and that there was " no intent to kill . "
prosecutors , however , insist the attack was premeditated and argue that mijailovic stalked lindh for 14 minutes before stabbing her with a knife in a crowded department store .
given the killer ’ s confession and the prosecution ’ s overwhelming evidence , the court ’ s main task will be to determine whether mijailovic really intended to kill anna lindh or not .
why anna lindh ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the killer was caught on video tape in the department store when the prosecution asked whether he was specifically looking for lindh in the department store , mijailovic said he had been wandering aimlessly , without any reason .
" i just trotted around on different floors and visited all the departments , " he said .
he denied looking for anyone in particular .
he said he just saw lindh and voices in his head , including that of jesus , urged him to stab her - 10 times with a knife .
lindh died the next day in the hospital after doctors worked through the night to save her .
mijailovic , who was arrested sept .
24 , confessed last week , saying he wanted to end speculation about the motive , including media reports that he was upset over lindh ’ s support of the 1999 nato air strikes on serbia .
difficult search the death of one of the country ’ s best-loved politicians sent shock waves through sweden , and initially there were concerns that the murderer wouldn ’ t be found .
after a first suspect was detained and then quickly released without charge , public opinion against the police .
" we were under huge pressure to solve this murder , " said chief police investigator leif jennekvist .
" and we had to be careful to pass on the information in such a way that on the one had the public need for information would be satisfied , while on the other hand our work wouldn ’ t be hindered . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murder weapon it wasn ’ t until the end of september that mijailovic was arrested .
initially he denied the killing , however police managed to match his dna with that found at the murder scene and on the knife .
" only when we got the dna proof were we one hundred percent sure about the identity of the murder , " said jennekvist .
mijailovic , who has a history of mental problems and three previous convictions , including one for a 1996 stabbing of his father , could face a sentence of between 10 years and life in prison .
if found mentally unstable , he could also be sent to a mental hospital for mandatory treatment .
a previous psychiatric evaluation found him " in great need of psychiatric and psychotherapeutic efforts , " but concluded that there were no medical grounds to sentence him to psychiatric care .
painful recovery whichever way the sentence reads , the trial brings a sense of relief , a form of closure for sweden , said jennekvist .
bringing mijailovic to court will help heal national wounds surrounding the murder and the painful memories it evoked of the assassination of swedish prime minister olof palme in 1986 .
like lindh , palme was attacked while out in public without bodyguards .
to this day his murderers have not been found . anja von cysewski -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspect confesses in lindh killing the man suspected of killing swedish foreign minister anna lindh in a brutal stabbing incident last year has confessed to the crime , a prosecutor said wednesday .

the ratings of a new reality tv show in germany are climbing as minor celebrities are put through daily hair-raising ‘ challenges ’ in the australian jungle .
but as the tests get crueler , criticism is starting to grow . germany ’ s private television channel rtl has hit ratings pay dirt with its version of the british and american show “ i ’ m a celebrity get me out of here . ”
called “ ich bin ein star holt mich hier raus ” in german , the show has dropped ten b-list celebrities into a jungle in australia for 12 days . despite being inundated by reality tv in recent years , german viewers are flocking to the program , which forces one member of the group to undertake a stunt testing their courage each day in order to earn food for all .
but after a singer of questionable talent was forced to lie in a " cockroach coffin " with 30,000 of the wriggly creatures and an out-of-work tv host was pecked nearly to tears by a band of aggressive ostriches , media watchdogs and other groups are beginning to question the show ’ s lack of moral grounding . “ i ’ ve really been blown over .

eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes , who is charged with overseeing the stability pact , is seeking legal backing to overturn a ruling which suspends eu budget rules for germany and france . so is this a case of solbes being a bad loser ?
why is he pushing so hard to bring the eu executive before the european court of justice when the outcome and implications of such action are so unclear ?
the proud spaniard suffered political defeat back in november of last year when the majority of ministers on the council of finance ministers voted in favor of suspending eu budget rules for france and germany on the grounds that it does n't make economic sense to punish them for stepping over the budget line .
both " offenders " say they wo n't manage to meet the three percent limit before 2005 . feeling jaded ? it is a clear political decision which the administrative powers at the eu do n't want to accept . as the union 's legislative power , the eu executive has the authority to make or change the rules , but the eu commission , which oversees european treaties , feels like it 's nose has been knocked out of joint .
solbes is particularly irritated by the fact that the ministers strayed from the official line in the treaty , binned his suggestions and came up with their own agreements for france and germany . even if the court in luxembourg were to take on the charges and were to rule in favor of the commissioners , the practical repercussions would be practically non-existent , other than to provide the commission with the chance to savor a moral victory .
it would have been far more sensible to push for a simplification of the rules and to adjust the criteria in the 1997 stability pact so as to make them reflect the economic reality of 2004 .
and this could have happened long before the power struggle between brussels and berlin began . had he acted earlier to work with pedro solbes , german finance minister hans eichel could have helped to avoid the current misery .
but given that the two men seem as stubborn minded as each other , that never happened . hard times ahead the german eu commissioner for enlargement , günter verheugen , who is opposed to the decision to seek legal action , is quite right when he says that this increased aggravation is no help for the union .
with the troubled constitution still hanging over europe 's head , member states really have more important things to worry about than an internal legal dispute . heads of state and government have to take another serious stab at creating a working constitution if the union is to maintain its reputation for being a viable institutional and political partner .
the eu has to define the financial framework for trading after 2007 and then there are the all important discussions on whether or not turkey will be granted membership .
they have to digest the addition of ten new members and with the terms of office for eu commission president , romano prodi , and his department heads due to end in november , they also have some important personnel issues to deal with . so what , in that case , is the point of dubious legal action which will do little to help the stability pact ?
the joke in brussels is that solbes is trying to imitate his famous forefather , don quijote , who made a name for himself by battling imaginary windmills .
but leaving the whisperings in brussels aside , it is certainly too soon for hans eichel to begin rejoicing .
at the end of the year he has to prove that he can sink the german budget deficit below the obligatory three percent .
it is a tough goal for eichel who has his hands full with germany 's economic development .
indeed , his ministry has already warned that it will be very difficult to meet the notorious maastricht criteria in 2005 . bernd riegert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes eu to court the european commission on tuesday decided to seek a court ruling to overturn finance ministers ’ suspension of eu budget rules for france and germany .
member states criticize the action , saying it ’ s a risky move .

now the irish prime minister bertie ahern has set out his intentions before the european parliament in strasbourg . the irish premier left his audience in no doubt about his top priority over the next six months .
he promised to pick the failed talks on an eu constitution off the floor and do all he could to elicit a final agreement .
" i pledge to you that the irish presidency will spare no effort to make progress and to facilitate consensus during our term in office .
the issue will command the highest priority under our presidency , " he told parliament .
ahern was also at pains to point out that time is of the essence if the european union wishes to keep its reputation in tact .
" excessive delay will damage our credibility and weaken our standing .
stalemate is not an option any of us can contemplate , " he said .
ahern said he planned to hold intensive talks with the heads of state and government ahead of the next eu summit in march , in order to come up with a possible solution to the sticking point of voting weights .
" i can assure the parliament that if my consultations suggest that there is a real prospect of agreement i will immediately move to seize the opportunity , " he said .
the talks last december , which should have been the crowning glory of italy 's six months in the eu presidential hot seat , ground to a halt when spain and poland refused to give up powerful voting rights established in the earlier nice treaty . something to celebrate a further high point during the irish presidency will be the addition of the ten new member states on may 1st .
and to mark the occasion , the irish government is planning to invite them all to dublin for a party .
as far as ahern is concerned , it is a moment in history which is well worth a celebration .
he told parliament that the founding fathers of a unified europe had dreamed of a time when europeans would never again kill each other in the name of natural resources , land or beliefs .
and with ten new states poised to join the bloc , the irish prime minister said that 2004 was a year in which europe was moving closer to making those dreams come true . with the constitution talks and eu expansion , the new president has a fat agenda for the next half a year , but looking beyond his six-month stint , he is confident that membership talks for romania and bulgaria will be concluded this year .
he is also hoping to see progress in the unification of the divided mediterranean island of cyprus .
as it stands , only the greek southern part will join the eu in may , but ahern also praised turkey 's attempts to close the gap between itself and europe .
a rallying call looking beyond europe 's borders , ahern called on the eu member states to do more in the fight against poverty and aids in africa .
he said it was crucial for developing nations that they resume talks with the world trade organization .
several members of the european parliament called on ahern to push forward his initiative on debt relief for the poorest countries in the world .
ireland wants to stimulate economic development in europe and has pledged to work towards the goal of making it the most innovative economic power in the world by the end of the decade .
ahern believes in increasing competitiveness in the union , and he voiced his support for the latest eu commission initiative to completely do away with restraints on service sector competition for professions such as doctors , lawyers , architects and pharmacists .
he told parliament that europe had to be as competitive as possible and that the greatest challenge is the desperate need for more and better employment .
ahern , who likes to go by the gallic name of taoiseach - meaning prime minister - will be turning his own attention to matters of employment over the coming months .
during his term in the rotating presidency , he will have to suggest a possible replacement for eu commission president romano prodi , whose term of office expires in november . bernd riegert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi 's star-crossed eu presidency italian premier silvio berlusconi steps down as eu council president wednesday .

"
eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes , who is charged with overseeing the stability pact , is seeking legal backing to overturn a ruling which suspends eu budget rules for germany and france . so is this a case of solbes being a bad loser ?
why is he pushing so hard to bring the eu executive before the european court of justice when the outcome and implications of such action are so unclear ?
the proud spaniard suffered political defeat back in november of last year when the majority of ministers on the council of finance ministers voted in favor of suspending eu budget rules for france and germany on the grounds that it does n't make economic sense to punish them for stepping over the budget line .
both " offenders " say they wo n't manage to meet the three percent limit before 2005 . feeling jaded ? it is a clear political decision which the administrative powers at the eu do n't want to accept . as the union 's legislative power , the eu executive has the authority to make or change the rules , but the eu commission , which oversees european treaties , feels like it 's nose has been knocked out of joint .
solbes is particularly irritated by the fact that the ministers strayed from the official line in the treaty , binned his suggestions and came up with their own agreements for france and germany . even if the court in luxembourg were to take on the charges and were to rule in favor of the commissioners , the practical repercussions would be practically non-existent , other than to provide the commission with the chance to savor a moral victory .
it would have been far more sensible to push for a simplification of the rules and to adjust the criteria in the 1997 stability pact so as to make them reflect the economic reality of 2004 .
and this could have happened long before the power struggle between brussels and berlin began . had he acted earlier to work with pedro solbes , german finance minister hans eichel could have helped to avoid the current misery .
but given that the two men seem as stubborn minded as each other , that never happened . hard times ahead the german eu commissioner for enlargement , günter verheugen , who is opposed to the decision to seek legal action , is quite right when he says that this increased aggravation is no help for the union .
with the troubled constitution still hanging over europe 's head , member states really have more important things to worry about than an internal legal dispute . heads of state and government have to take another serious stab at creating a working constitution if the union is to maintain its reputation for being a viable institutional and political partner .
the eu has to define the financial framework for trading after 2007 and then there are the all important discussions on whether or not turkey will be granted membership .
they have to digest the addition of ten new members and with the terms of office for eu commission president , romano prodi , and his department heads due to end in november , they also have some important personnel issues to deal with . so what , in that case , is the point of dubious legal action which will do little to help the stability pact ?
the joke in brussels is that solbes is trying to imitate his famous forefather , don quijote , who made a name for himself by battling imaginary windmills .
but leaving the whisperings in brussels aside , it is certainly too soon for hans eichel to begin rejoicing .
at the end of the year he has to prove that he can sink the german budget deficit below the obligatory three percent .

a camera mounted on the mars express orbiter is expected to produce unprecedented images of the planet over the next years .
first images will be released next week .
dw-world took a look behind the scenes . berlin - ralf jaumann expects to feel a little edgy over the next two years .
the planetary geologist at the german aerospace center ’ s -lrb- dlr -rrb- institute for planetary research in berlin will be one of the first people to receive data collected by the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- .
“ every time we switch it on or off , i ’ m nervous , ” said jaumann , who will turn the data into raw images before sending the latter on for further analysis .
“ it will certainly become a matter of routine , but not completely . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf jaumann during a dw-tv interview .
last friday jaumann -lrb- photo -rrb- got another chance to jitter as the camera began searching for signs of the missing beagle 2 lander .
the robot probably crashed during touchdown on the martian surface . while beagle 2 was designed to conduct a small percentage of the mission ’ s ground experiments , focus is likely to shift now to the camera and other instruments mounted on the orbiter , such as marsis , a sub-surface sounding radar altimeter searching for water under the planet ’ s crust , or spicam , an ultraviolet and infrared spectrometer that will study the martian atmosphere . not all hope has been lost for finding the lander , however , and jaumann and his colleagues have been given a lot of data storage space on the orbiter to search for beagle 2 .
but neither he nor gerhard neukum , the hrsc project ’ s principal investigator at berlin ’ s free university , believe there ’ s much of a chance to discover the tiny robot . “ we haven ’ t seen beagle yet , ” neukum said on wednesday after looking through the first batch of “ outstanding ” data he ’ s received so far .
even though the probe has n't turned up , " these are the best data ever recorded , ” neukum said . while other missions , such as nasa ’ s global surveyor mission , have already produced high resolution images , the hrsc ’ s capability to produce colorful , three-dimensional pictures is a first , according to neukum .
“ we will be able to look at mars like we do with our eyes here on the surface of the earth , ” he said . in addition , an infrared image would allow scientists to determine the abundance of specific minerals on mars , neukum said .
he added that first images would be released to the public by jan .
20 . sending commands , receiving data while neukum and his team of 43 co-investigators will use the data to produce three-dimensional images and analyze them , jaumann and a group of 10 scientists will be testing and sending future commands to the camera and processing incoming data on a daily basis . the team does n't work in a big mission control center like the one in darmstadt , germany , where the mars express mission and the orbiter 's flight path is monitored .
tv crews are often disappointed when they come to visit his office in a non-descript building on the outskirts of the german capital , jaumann said .
“ years ago we had rooms with big computers , but now we get our data on machines like this one , ” he said , pointing to his apple powerbook . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a drawing of the hrsc camera .
to test commands , jaumann and his colleagues can work with an exact replica of the camera , which sits in a dlr laboratory .
several dozen screws have to be adjusted to find the perfect position .
“ it ’ s nothing spectacular , ” he said , pointing to the 20 kg -lrb- 44 pound -rrb- instrument that ’ s mounted on a table .
“ but hopefully it will produce spectacular pictures . ” mapping mars like never before the hrsc project ’ s goal is to produce a three-dimensional , colorful map of the entire martian surface at a resolution that has never been achieved before . detailed images of the red planet ’ s polar caps or volcanic regions will be even more interesting for scientists working on the project , however .
“ it ’ s more interesting to do fewer things in great detail rather than to do everything at a resolution that we have done with other missions , ” said wojciech markiewicz , a planetary scientist at the max planck institute for aeronomy in katlenburg-lindau in central germany . the camera ’ s images will allow scientists to locate rocks as small as two meters -lrb- 6.5 feet -rrb- , according to jaumann , who added that he expects the project to answer the question whether it ever rained on mars . putting the camera to work on earth the hrsc technology is not only useful for gaining a greater understanding of mars , however : a modified version of the camera has already mapped regions on earth .
many possibilities exist to put the instrument to commercial use , jaumann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insurance companies could use the camera to assess damage after a flood like the one in saxony in 2002 .
telecommunication companies could use the images to pinpoint the best locations for their antennae , cities could take inventory of things such as street signs , park benches and trees by looking at the pictures , jaumann said .
insurance companies could assess damage caused by floods immediately , hence preventing fraudulent claims later on .
even the european union could monitor fields of farmers who receive subsidies for not planting anything on their land . but others , who work in the commercial sector , will have to look into these options , jaumann said , adding that data from the hrsc will keep scientists busy for years to come .

a camera mounted on the mars express orbiter is expected to produce unprecedented images of the planet over the next years .
first images will be released next week .
dw-world took a look behind the scenes . berlin - ralf jaumann expects to feel a little edgy over the next two years .
the planetary geologist at the german aerospace center ’ s -lrb- dlr -rrb- institute for planetary research in berlin will be one of the first people to receive data collected by the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- .
“ every time we switch it on or off , i ’ m nervous , ” said jaumann , who will turn the data into raw images before sending the latter on for further analysis .
“ it will certainly become a matter of routine , but not completely . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf jaumann during a dw-tv interview .
last friday jaumann -lrb- photo -rrb- got another chance to jitter as the camera began searching for signs of the missing beagle 2 lander .
the robot probably crashed during touchdown on the martian surface . while beagle 2 was designed to conduct a small percentage of the mission ’ s ground experiments , focus is likely to shift now to the camera and other instruments mounted on the orbiter , such as marsis , a sub-surface sounding radar altimeter searching for water under the planet ’ s crust , or spicam , an ultraviolet and infrared spectrometer that will study the martian atmosphere . not all hope has been lost for finding the lander , however , and jaumann and his colleagues have been given a lot of data storage space on the orbiter to search for beagle 2 .
but neither he nor gerhard neukum , the hrsc project ’ s principal investigator at berlin ’ s free university , believe there ’ s much of a chance to discover the tiny robot . “ we haven ’ t seen beagle yet , ” neukum said on wednesday after looking through the first batch of “ outstanding ” data he ’ s received so far .
even though the probe has n't turned up , " these are the best data ever recorded , ” neukum said . while other missions , such as nasa ’ s global surveyor mission , have already produced high resolution images , the hrsc ’ s capability to produce colorful , three-dimensional pictures is a first , according to neukum .
“ we will be able to look at mars like we do with our eyes here on the surface of the earth , ” he said . in addition , an infrared image would allow scientists to determine the abundance of specific minerals on mars , neukum said .
he added that first images would be released to the public by jan .
20 . sending commands , receiving data while neukum and his team of 43 co-investigators will use the data to produce three-dimensional images and analyze them , jaumann and a group of 10 scientists will be testing and sending future commands to the camera and processing incoming data on a daily basis . the team does n't work in a big mission control center like the one in darmstadt , germany , where the mars express mission and the orbiter 's flight path is monitored .
tv crews are often disappointed when they come to visit his office in a non-descript building on the outskirts of the german capital , jaumann said .
“ years ago we had rooms with big computers , but now we get our data on machines like this one , ” he said , pointing to his apple powerbook . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a drawing of the hrsc camera .
to test commands , jaumann and his colleagues can work with an exact replica of the camera , which sits in a dlr laboratory .
several dozen screws have to be adjusted to find the perfect position .
“ it ’ s nothing spectacular , ” he said , pointing to the 20 kg -lrb- 44 pound -rrb- instrument that ’ s mounted on a table .
“ but hopefully it will produce spectacular pictures . ” mapping mars like never before the hrsc project ’ s goal is to produce a three-dimensional , colorful map of the entire martian surface at a resolution that has never been achieved before . detailed images of the red planet ’ s polar caps or volcanic regions will be even more interesting for scientists working on the project , however .
“ it ’ s more interesting to do fewer things in great detail rather than to do everything at a resolution that we have done with other missions , ” said wojciech markiewicz , a planetary scientist at the max planck institute for aeronomy in katlenburg-lindau in central germany . the camera ’ s images will allow scientists to locate rocks as small as two meters -lrb- 6.5 feet -rrb- , according to jaumann , who added that he expects the project to answer the question whether it ever rained on mars . putting the camera to work on earth the hrsc technology is not only useful for gaining a greater understanding of mars , however : a modified version of the camera has already mapped regions on earth .
many possibilities exist to put the instrument to commercial use , jaumann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insurance companies could use the camera to assess damage after a flood like the one in saxony in 2002 .
telecommunication companies could use the images to pinpoint the best locations for their antennae , cities could take inventory of things such as street signs , park benches and trees by looking at the pictures , jaumann said .
insurance companies could assess damage caused by floods immediately , hence preventing fraudulent claims later on .
even the european union could monitor fields of farmers who receive subsidies for not planting anything on their land . but others , who work in the commercial sector , will have to look into these options , jaumann said , adding that data from the hrsc will keep scientists busy for years to come .

"
eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes , who is charged with overseeing the stability pact , is seeking legal backing to overturn a ruling which suspends eu budget rules for germany and france . so is this a case of solbes being a bad loser ?
why is he pushing so hard to bring the eu executive before the european court of justice when the outcome and implications of such action are so unclear ?
the proud spaniard suffered political defeat back in november of last year when the majority of ministers on the council of finance ministers voted in favor of suspending eu budget rules for france and germany on the grounds that it does n't make economic sense to punish them for stepping over the budget line .
both " offenders " say they wo n't manage to meet the three percent limit before 2005 . feeling jaded ? it is a clear political decision which the administrative powers at the eu do n't want to accept . as the union 's legislative power , the eu executive has the authority to make or change the rules , but the eu commission , which oversees european treaties , feels like it 's nose has been knocked out of joint .
solbes is particularly irritated by the fact that the ministers strayed from the official line in the treaty , binned his suggestions and came up with their own agreements for france and germany . even if the court in luxembourg were to take on the charges and were to rule in favor of the commissioners , the practical repercussions would be practically non-existent , other than to provide the commission with the chance to savor a moral victory .
it would have been far more sensible to push for a simplification of the rules and to adjust the criteria in the 1997 stability pact so as to make them reflect the economic reality of 2004 .
and this could have happened long before the power struggle between brussels and berlin began . had he acted earlier to work with pedro solbes , german finance minister hans eichel could have helped to avoid the current misery .
but given that the two men seem as stubborn minded as each other , that never happened . hard times ahead the german eu commissioner for enlargement , günter verheugen , who is opposed to the decision to seek legal action , is quite right when he says that this increased aggravation is no help for the union .
with the troubled constitution still hanging over europe 's head , member states really have more important things to worry about than an internal legal dispute . heads of state and government have to take another serious stab at creating a working constitution if the union is to maintain its reputation for being a viable institutional and political partner .
the eu has to define the financial framework for trading after 2007 and then there are the all important discussions on whether or not turkey will be granted membership .
they have to digest the addition of ten new members and with the terms of office for eu commission president , romano prodi , and his department heads due to end in november , they also have some important personnel issues to deal with . so what , in that case , is the point of dubious legal action which will do little to help the stability pact ?
the joke in brussels is that solbes is trying to imitate his famous forefather , don quijote , who made a name for himself by battling imaginary windmills .
but leaving the whisperings in brussels aside , it is certainly too soon for hans eichel to begin rejoicing .
at the end of the year he has to prove that he can sink the german budget deficit below the obligatory three percent .
it is a tough goal for eichel who has his hands full with germany 's economic development .
indeed , his ministry has already warned that it will be very difficult to meet the notorious maastricht criteria in 2005 . bernd riegert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes eu to court the european commission on tuesday decided to seek a court ruling to overturn finance ministers ’ suspension of eu budget rules for france and germany .
member states criticize the action , saying it ’ s a risky move .

italy ’ s highest court on tuesday annulled a controversial legal immunity law that had shielded top officials from prosecution while in office .
prime minister silvio berlusconi could now once again face bribery charges . the law , which was passed last june , gave the country ’ s five highest officials immunity , but it has been criticized as existing solely to end berlusconi ’ s numerous legal headaches .
dubbed “ lex berlusconi ” by some , it helped the prime minister avoid possible conviction while italy held the rotating eu presidency last autumn . since the court has determined that the law is unconstitutional , berlusconi will once again face trial for allegedly bribing judges in the 1980s while he was a business man .
the trial had been stopped after the law went into effect . “ every man is the same before the law , ” antonio di pietro , an opposition member of parliament and former crusading prosecutor , told the associated press after the legislation was annulled . but berlusconi ’ s justice minister roberto castelli criticized the verdict , saying it could complicate relations between politicians and the judiciary .

the european commission on tuesday decided to seek a court ruling to overturn finance ministers ’ suspension of eu budget rules for france and germany .
member states criticize the action , saying it ’ s a risky move . the eu executive , which is responsible for enforcing laws in the 15-member bloc , argued that taking finance ministers to court was vital to clarify disciplinary procedures for those who break the eu ’ s guidelines on deficit spending , as france and germany have done repeatedly .
but the unprecedented legal move is expected to generate a considerable amount of friction at a time when the eu is concerned about maintaining cohesion .
german finance minister hans eichel said the decision to go to the european court of justice was " hard to understand " and added that he saw no wrong doing in the finance minister ’ s nov .
25 decision to forego disciplinary action against berlin and paris for violating the stability pact .
the results of the ecofin -lrb- council of european finance ministers -rrb- meeting " correspond to the spirit and the letter of the stability and growth pact , " he said in a statement released on tuesday .
" the procedures that are foreseen -lrb- in the pact -rrb- were upheld . "
at the meeting , germany and france , europe ’ s two biggest economies , used their combined influence to convince ecofin to reject the commission ’ s recommendation to punish berlin and paris for running up excessive budget deficits by slapping them with steep fines and forcing them to make deeper deficit cuts in 2004 .
the commission is now seeking a ruling on whether the ministers violated procedure in taking an ad hoc decision against the eu executive branch .
brussels vs. brussels " not least with a view to the tasks the european union faces in the near future , it would be more helpful to aim for cooperation rather than confrontation , " eichel said in response to the commission ’ s legal challenge .
but eu monetary affairs commssioner pedro solbes , whose office oversees the stability pact , has argued that brussels has a duty to uphold the law and avoid a precedent that could legitimize rule-breaking in the future and ultimately undermine the eu treaty .
french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin acknowledged that it was the commission ’ s right to seek recourse in court , but insisted the finance minister ’ s decision was legal .
" i respect the decision of the commission , but i am not worried about the result , " he told reporters during a visit in brussels .
legal advisors to the member states in the eu council said the ministers had a discretionary power to overturn the commission ’ s recommendation and doubt the eu executive will come out a clear winner in court .
a house divided against itself the commission itself is divided over the decision to seek legal action .
the move is seen as a risky one , which could seriously undermine the authority of the executive branch if the eu ’ s top court rules the finance ministers ’ action legal .
solbes ' spokesman , gerassimos thomas , admitted there were possible risks involved in taking the case to court , but said " it had to be done , " and that it is the commission ’ s " role as guardian of the treaty to ensure that provisions are upheld . "
although nothing has been made public about internal discussion surrounding the commission ’ s action , thomas confirmed that tuesday ’ s decision had not been unanimous among the 20 commissioners .
sources in brussels say the french , german and british commissioners were against taking legal action .
it is also not certain whether the court of justice will agree to the commission ’ s request for a fast-track procedure that would lead to a decision in three to six months rather than the normal two years .
solbes , however , is convinced the risky legal move is the correct strategy for the commission .
speaking to reporters after the announcement was made , he said the court challenge " has had great support , even if not all commissioners have agreed on all different aspects of the strategy .

germany 's railway celebrates a decade as a private company on wednesday .
the deutsche bahn chairman hopes it will be ready to go public in 2005 - but meanwhile , it continues accruing debt . just days after opening , berlin 's newest five-star hotel , the ritz-carlton , is warming up for a bash in honor of the 10th anniversary of germany 's state railway system going private . its host , deutsche bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn , predictably lauds the reform as " a huge success . " " after -lrb- the fall of the berlin wall -rrb- we had two train companies that were on their last legs economically , " mehdorn told the newspaper die welt on the eve of the celebration .
" we know we 're not done , but what this company and its employees have done is unparalleled . " but that has n't put a stop to harsh criticism of db from politicians , economists and passengers . a mountain of debt the trip to where the bahn stands today has been a long one .
based on the recommendations of a government-appointed commission in late 1991 , parliament decided it was time to reform the railway - and it promptly began amending around 130 laws to change its status . in january 1994 , the west and east german railway companies were merged into a stock corporation called deutsche bahn , with the federal government retaining full ownership . by that time , west germany 's railway alone had amassed € 34 billion -lrb- $ 43.5 billion -rrb- in debt .
its enormous losses - € 7.9 billion during its last year as a state agency - were paid for by taxpayers . germany could afford either the national train system or the army but not both , former chancellor helmut schmidt was quoted as saying at the time . but the government nonetheless assumed the mountain of debt , giving db a fresh start . since then , the government has taken a less hands-on approach to deutsche bahn . db , after all , became a private company that was expected to generate a profit .
while politicians no longer dictate the bahn 's day-to-day actions , the government does have a say in strategic decisions through infrastructural funding and members on the company 's supervisory board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn " the numbers speak for themselves , " mehdorn told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" we have saved german taxpayers around € 108 billion -lrb- since 1994 -rrb- , more than € 44 billion more than what independent experts forecasted at the time " for what the government would save if it made deutsche bahn an independent , self-sufficient company .
but mehdorn 's calculations are based on the assumption that the catastrophic pre-reform situation would have continued without change . no more clean slate mehdorn , deutsche bahn ceo since 1999 , can brag that db does n't pocket subsidies to cover its operating costs .
but it still receives around € 10 billion annually from federal and state sources to pay for commuter traffic and infrastructure development . and it 's incurring debts again .
in the first half of 2003 , operating loss after interest stood at € 143 million .
that was down from € 235 million a year earlier - and mehdorn has said he plans to get the company back into the black in 2004 . those plans precede tuesday 's news that mehdorn and co. are considering cost-cutting measures , including abandoning costly refurbishment and expansion plans for 2004 . for example , the long-awaited high-speed rail line between erfurt and nuremburg that would reduce total travel time between berlin and munich but would cost up to € 244 million to build could become the first victim of the cuts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worse yet , db appears to be one of the businesses german consumers most love to hate , along with deutsche post and deutsche telekom , which were also privatized in the 1990s .
last year , db introduced fare reforms that drew so many complaints that the railway gave in after about half a year and reinstated the old fare structure . the company 's byzantine new fare system - modeled after the airlines , with discounts for advance purchases but maximum fares for those purchased at the time of journey - remains not only confusing but often significantly more expensive than other forms of transportation .
indeed , a recent report claimed that as many as 25 percent of the flights by budget airlines within germany , like germanwings or hapag lloyd express , are taking customers away from deutsche bahn with lower prices and faster travel times . db announced drastic cuts in service personnel in late 2003 , including the closure of ticket counters that has led to longer lines at ticket and information counters .
only 85 percent of the trains are on time , which db defines as being no more than five minutes late - well below the company 's stated goal of 95 percent . going public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late trains abound but mehdorn , known for claiming that passenger lobbyists are whiners and even seeking to take legal action against them , is apparently not entirely oblivious to customers ' irritations .
" we have to get better at punctuality and information for our customers when there are irregularities , " he told die welt .
this is of special concern , since mehdorn has made it clear that he 's trying to get db in shape for an initial public offering by 2005 . he has his work cut out for him .
besides improving db 's image among passengers , mehdorn is faced with stiff competition from budget airlines in the passenger division and from trucking firms in the cargo field .
db 's cargo transport has been hit especially hard , with its market share dropping from 21 to 15.6 percent between 1990 and 2002 . it 's also hindered by its lack of punctuality and weak rail infrastructures in eastern europe . the company has also seen significant drops in its passenger traffic .
in a recent report , the european commission stated that since 1995 passenger rail traffic across europe rose 12 percent .
in germany , however , it fell by 7.6 percent - a sharp contrast to the 30 percent growth experienced in france . ten years after privatization the consensus seems to be that reforming the railways was the right thing to do .
nonetheless , critics still have plenty of fodder to fuel their anti-bahn arguments . dw staff -lrb- ni -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de roadwork ahead for the european union six months before enlargement , only one fifth of the ambitious europe-wide infrastructure plans called for in maastricht treaty have been finished .

the murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh plunged the country into a crisis last september .
now , with the confessed killer standing trial , swedes are hoping to draw a close to a dark moment in thier history . the man who admitted to killing lindh testified that voices in his head told him to stab the swedish minister repeatedly in the chest and arms .
" i couldn ’ t resist , " mijailo mijailovic confessed to the panel of judges in the packed stockholm courtroom on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mijailo mijailovic although he said he did indeed kill the widely popular anna lindh , the 25-year old swede of yugoslav origin denied it was for political reasons .
" i ’ m not interested in politics , " he told chief prosecutor krister petersson .
" i have nothing personal against anna lindh . "
mijailo ’ s lawyer , peter althin , has pushed for dropping the charges down to manslaughter rather than murder , arguing that his client had not planned the sept .
10 stabbing and that there was " no intent to kill . "
prosecutors , however , insist the attack was premeditated and argue that mijailovic stalked lindh for 14 minutes before stabbing her with a knife in a crowded department store .
given the killer ’ s confession and the prosecution ’ s overwhelming evidence , the court ’ s main task will be to determine whether mijailovic really intended to kill anna lindh or not .
why anna lindh ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the killer was caught on video tape in the department store when the prosecution asked whether he was specifically looking for lindh in the department store , mijailovic said he had been wandering aimlessly , without any reason .
" i just trotted around on different floors and visited all the departments , " he said .
he denied looking for anyone in particular .
he said he just saw lindh and voices in his head , including that of jesus , urged him to stab her - 10 times with a knife .
lindh died the next day in the hospital after doctors worked through the night to save her .
mijailovic , who was arrested sept .
24 , confessed last week , saying he wanted to end speculation about the motive , including media reports that he was upset over lindh ’ s support of the 1999 nato air strikes on serbia .
difficult search the death of one of the country ’ s best-loved politicians sent shock waves through sweden , and initially there were concerns that the murderer wouldn ’ t be found .
after a first suspect was detained and then quickly released without charge , public opinion against the police .
" we were under huge pressure to solve this murder , " said chief police investigator leif jennekvist .
" and we had to be careful to pass on the information in such a way that on the one had the public need for information would be satisfied , while on the other hand our work wouldn ’ t be hindered . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murder weapon it wasn ’ t until the end of september that mijailovic was arrested .
initially he denied the killing , however police managed to match his dna with that found at the murder scene and on the knife .
" only when we got the dna proof were we one hundred percent sure about the identity of the murder , " said jennekvist .
mijailovic , who has a history of mental problems and three previous convictions , including one for a 1996 stabbing of his father , could face a sentence of between 10 years and life in prison .
if found mentally unstable , he could also be sent to a mental hospital for mandatory treatment .
a previous psychiatric evaluation found him " in great need of psychiatric and psychotherapeutic efforts , " but concluded that there were no medical grounds to sentence him to psychiatric care .
painful recovery whichever way the sentence reads , the trial brings a sense of relief , a form of closure for sweden , said jennekvist .
bringing mijailovic to court will help heal national wounds surrounding the murder and the painful memories it evoked of the assassination of swedish prime minister olof palme in 1986 .
like lindh , palme was attacked while out in public without bodyguards .
to this day his murderers have not been found . anja von cysewski -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspect confesses in lindh killing the man suspected of killing swedish foreign minister anna lindh in a brutal stabbing incident last year has confessed to the crime , a prosecutor said wednesday .

the us 's fourth largest carmarker says the older models could inadvertently roll out of parking positions if the gearbox was used with " abusive force " .
insisting the recall was a precaution , the vehicles , including plymouth breeze and dodge intrepid , will have their floor-mounted gear shifts upgraded .
there have been 127 accidents possibly caused by the problem , chrysler said .
in addition there have been 17 alleged injuries and one fatality , added spokeswoman angela ford .
another recall " as a precautionary measure , the company will install stronger components to better withstand abusive force , " she added .
the 2.7 million cars being recalled across north america were mainly built between 1993 and 1999 .
separately , chrysler said it was also recalling around 21,000 of its 2004 model dodge durango sports utility vehicle in order to replace a throttle cable .
this is the second recall affecting the durango since it went on sale on 15 november last year .
the announcements come after chrysler 's german american parent company daimlerchrysler announced a substantial drop in quarterly operating profits last october .
japanese competition the 1.25bn euros -lrb- £ 871m , $ 1.46bn -rrb- figure was down 19 % from 1.54bn euros reported in the third quarter of 2002 and fell short of analysts ' expectations .
the chrysler division itself has recently experienced a tough time in north america and has lost its third place in the sales league to toyota .
overcapacity and low productivity compared with its japanese rivals also hampered performance .
overall , daimlerchrysler posted a net loss of 1.65bn euros -lrb- $ 1.92bn , £ 1.15bn -rrb- in the third quarter of 2003 , although part of this was due to writing down the value of its stake in european aerospace company eads by 2bn euros .
the group , which sold 1.1 million vehicles worldwide in the quarter , employs 375,000 people worldwide and has other brands including mercedes-benz , maybach , jeep and smart .
continuing efforts although well into a three-year overhaul , it has still to see the promised results of the 1998 merger between germany 's daimler-benz and us chrysler that created it .
in those five years , daimler chrysler has lost more than two thirds of its stock market value .
it has also recently faced legal action in the us from disgruntled shareholders who claim that the merger of the two firms was actually a takeover by daimler .

objective one march 1999 , cornwall & scilly designated as an objective one region criteria : gross domestic product per head of population , was below the threshold of 75 % of the european average £ 300 million in european funding available , to be matched by uk funding but mr tyler said there should be an investigation by the objective one team which made the grant two years ago when camel valley poultry was undertaking a £ 3m expansion scheme .
he said : " we are very concerned to make sure that all the public money that we have got with great difficulty for cornwall is spent wisely .

the regulations could see youngsters appeal against an expulsion , even without input from their parents .
it is part of a series of moves introduced by education minister jane davidson which are designed to " avoid exclusion as far as possible " .
but geraint davies , welsh nasuwt secretary said the move , which is not being introduced in england , was " purely cosmetic " .
he said decisions to expel pupils should rest solely with head teachers and governors , and disagreed with all attempts to strengthen the appeals process .
ms davidson said the new regulations aimed to promote " a variety of support mechanisms and sanctions " to avoid expulsions .
" the main changes include the introduction of the right for pupils of secondary school age and above -lrb- 11 upwards -rrb- , as well as their parents , to appeal against their own exclusions , " said ms davidson .
she said that , even though the assembly government was trying to avoid expulsions where possible , she recognised they were sometimes necessary .
" when this is the case we need to ensure that appropriate procedures are followed to protect the rights of all concerned , " she said .
" the intention of this guidance is to clarify those procedures . "
the regulations , which came into force on 9 january , also include advice on reintegrating expelled pupils .
but mr davies , from nasuwt , argued the decision to expel a pupil " should be vested in the head teacher and governors " .
" except in the most serious incidents , expulsions will follow only at the exhaustive end of a long drawn-out process and a school is left with no alternative , " he said .
" we disagree with any attempts to strengthen the appeal process .

the regulations could see youngsters appeal against an expulsion , even without input from their parents .
it is part of a series of moves introduced by education minister jane davidson which are designed to " avoid exclusion as far as possible " .
but geraint davies , welsh nasuwt secretary said the move , which is not being introduced in england , was " purely cosmetic " .
he said decisions to expel pupils should rest solely with head teachers and governors , and disagreed with all attempts to strengthen the appeals process .
ms davidson said the new regulations aimed to promote " a variety of support mechanisms and sanctions " to avoid expulsions .
" the main changes include the introduction of the right for pupils of secondary school age and above -lrb- 11 upwards -rrb- , as well as their parents , to appeal against their own exclusions , " said ms davidson .
she said that , even though the assembly government was trying to avoid expulsions where possible , she recognised they were sometimes necessary .
jane davidson admits some expulsions are unavoidable " when this is the case we need to ensure that appropriate procedures are followed to protect the rights of all concerned , " she said .
" the intention of this guidance is to clarify those procedures . "
the regulations , which came into force on 9 january , also include advice on reintegrating expelled pupils .
but mr davies , from nasuwt , argued the decision to expel a pupil " should be vested in the head teacher and governors " .
" except in the most serious incidents , expulsions will follow only at the exhaustive end of a long drawn-out process and a school is left with no alternative , " he said .
" we disagree with any attempts to strengthen the appeal process .
" it should be placed in the hands of the professionals who deal with the cases week-in week-out . "

this week , global environment body , the world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- has claimed the orang-utan could become extinct in the wild by 2025 .
it revealed that , in the last century , the number of apes fell by 91 % in its habitats of borneo and sumatra , and blames destruction of the forests for the decline .
abigail dymond , a university of wales student in aberystwyth who worked at the sepilok orang-utan rehabilitation centre in sabah , malaysia , for the last year , is concerned by the report .
" the west have to stop buying up all the oil palm which is one of the reasons for the deforestation , " she said .
" commercial logging is another problem that has to be reduced . "
ms dymond said she had " always wanted to work with orang-utans because they are extremely sweet and friendly creatures " .
" it was not easy to find a placement involving the kind of voluntary work that i had in mind , but i was delighted when i heard of this centre in sabah and i thoroughly enjoyed the experience , " she said .
the number of orang-utans has been declining rapidly for the first month of her stay , ms dymond worked with orang-utans brought from nearby rainforests who were not strong enough to look after themselves .
" some were injured and orphaned , and i spent my time feeding them every two hours and giving them two baths every day and caring for them as if they were real babies . " she said .
" i spent the second month looking after older orang-utans who were not strong enough to look after themselves in their own habitat .
" they lived in a large outdoor nursery and our work was to prepare them to return to the jungle . "
unsustainable decline almost 80 % of all forests in malaysia and indonesia have now been logged .
the wwf believes there were between 45,000 and 60,000 orang-utans alive in 1987 .
but that number had been halved by 2001 .
the sumatran orang-utan is now classified as critically endangered with only an estimated 9,000 specimens .
stuart chapman , head of the species programme at wwf-uk said the orang-utan could tolerate a loss in numbers of about 2 % annually .
" this loss of 50 % in 15 years is completely unsustainable , hence the urgency of the conservation work , " he said .

it was bought for £ 102 in a local sale room before christmas .
the items are now expected to fetch 500 times more - about £ 50,000 - than the initial price when reauctioned .
the buyer does not want his details made public but alan aldridge , from an auction firm which specialises in titanic memorabilia , explained what happened .
' gobsmacked ' he said : " he saw this postcard being offered and it said in the auction room that it had a titanic connection to mr mullen .

several personal effects of dumfries man thomas mullen , a third-class steward , were contained in the box .
it was bought for £ 102 in a local sale room before christmas .
the items are now expected to fetch 500 times more - about £ 50,000 - than the initial price when reauctioned .
the buyer does not want his details made public but alan aldridge , from an auction firm which specialises in titanic memorabilia , explained what happened .
' gobsmacked ' he said : " he saw this postcard being offered and it said in the auction room that it had a titanic connection to mr mullen .
" he asked the auctioneer what it was likely to fetch and the auctioneer gave him an opinion and from that he left a bid of £ 102 , not really expecting to get it .
" he later found out that he 'd been the winning bidder . "
mr aldridge added that had he been the salesman in the dumfries auction room , his valuation would have been a great deal higher .
" i 'd set its value at between £ 40,000 and £ 60,000 .
when i told the buyer this valuation when he brought them to me , he was certainly pleasantly surprised - gobsmacked is probably a better word for it . "

the trading update for the crucial eight-week period follows two previous disappointing christmas announcements .
dixons , which trades as dixons , currys , pc world and the link , increased its promotions and advertising over the recent holiday season .
it said sales in the period met expectations , and that dixons group had enjoyed a " solid " first half-year .
' challenging market ' the group enjoyed strong demand for flat screen tvs and digital cameras , and forecast a " satisfactory " outlook over the whole year .
group first-half pre-tax profits were £ 105.7m , up from £ 97.1m.
over christmas the group 's total like-for-like sales , including overseas , rose by 5 % .
chairman sir john collins said : " the group achieved solid results in the first half year , with good sales and profit growth in a challenging retail market .
" performance in the uk has improved throughout the period and our international businesses have continued to make good progress . "
he said the group had also been " encouraged " by the competition commission investigation into the sale of extended warranties , which could hit the company 's profits .

the document pledges support for the setting up of a free trade area for the americas in 2005 - a key us demand .
many see it as a victory for president bush in the face of fierce opposition , particularly from venezuela and brazil .
but venezuelan president hugo chavez told the bbc he did not feel they had been forced to make any concessions .
venezuela and brazil initially did not want trade to be mentioned in the document , issued after the two-day summit in monterrey , in northern mexico .
they wanted a commitment to tackling poverty and promoting development , which was also included in the declaration .
the best way to eradicate poverty is to encourage trade between nations us president george w bush however , analysts say that nearly all the key issues have been somewhat watered down in the declaration .
the bbc 's stephen gibbs in monterrey says us president george w bush has survived the fierce criticism of some of his southern neighbours and used the summit to rebuild relations with mexico and canada .
mexican president vicente fox welcomed mr bush 's proposals to give temporary permits to millions of mexican illegal workers in the us .
mr bush also found a close ally in canada 's new prime minister , paul martin , our correspondent adds , after the us president said canadian firms would now be allowed to bid for us-financed reconstruction projects in iraq .
canada had previously been barred from bidding for such contracts because it had not supported the us-led invasion .
' new moral architecture ' the planned free trade area of the americas -lrb- ftaa -rrb- aims to create the world 's largest free trade area with a market of some 800 million people .
during the summit , many of the leaders challenged mr bush 's belief that the ftaa was the right solution to the region 's deepening poverty .
bush 's attendance attracted protesters summit dominates press peruvian president alejandro toledo criticised washington for refusing to reduce agricultural subsidies , while asking the region 's poor nations " to play ball in the free trade court " .
washington originally insisted on reaffirming the goal of finishing ftaa talks by 1 january 2005 .
but the monterrey declaration only calls for following the ftaa 's " established timetable " , with no specific date mentioned .
this , said mr chavez , was a victory for those who had opposed the free trade area .
he also said the summit had helped create a new political bloc in south america against free trade and the us .
" this is the most important thing that happened at the summit , " he told the bbc in an interview .
no ' safe haven ' the declaration says the region 's nations will intensify " efforts and strengthen co-operation " to fight terrorist threats - another key demand by washington .
the leaders also pledged to deny " safe haven to corrupt officials " and to co-operate in the " return of the proceeds of corruption to their legitimate owners " .
the us wanted to bar corrupt nations from future americas summit - but the declaration only calls for consultations on countries that do not meet the requirements of the inter-american convention against corruption .
the adopted measures are expected to be fine-tuned at a next summit in nicaragua later this year .

the census is part of an initiative to preserve the biodiversity of the forest , which lies on the border between the two countries .
zoologists estimate there are 5-600 tigers left in the sundarbans , down from about 100,000 at the start of the last century .
it will be the world 's largest census of tigers in a single geographical area .
the sunderbans cover more than 10,000 square kilometres .
the census will count the tigers by collecting impressions of their paw-prints from the mangrove mud .
wildlife officials say that previous counts were probably inaccurate , because some tigers were missed out and others were counted twice as they crossed from one country to the other .
at the last count last year , the indian side of the forest contained 271 of the animals .
there has been no such count in bangladesh in recent years .
falling numbers poaching and illegal logging have affected the tigers ' habitat in the mangrove forest , reducing their number in bangladesh in the past few years .
this is despite reports that some of the tigers from the indian side have migrated to bangladesh during this period .
the un-funded project will involve not only the counting of royal bengal tigers , but also a study of their breeding and feeding behaviour .
tigers kill nearly 50 people every year in the indian sunderbans alone .

the un-funded project will involve not only the counting of royal bengal tigers , but also a study of their breeding and feeding behaviour .
tigers kill nearly 50 people every year in the indian sunderbans alone .

the census is part of an initiative to preserve the biodiversity of the forest , which lies on the border between the two countries .
zoologists estimate there are 5-600 tigers left in the sundarbans , down from about 100,000 at the start of the last century .
it will be the world 's largest census of tigers in a single geographical area .
the sunderbans cover more than 10,000 square kilometres .
the census will count the tigers by collecting impressions of their paw-prints from the mangrove mud .
wildlife officials say that previous counts were probably inaccurate , because some tigers were missed out and others were counted twice as they crossed from one country to the other .
at the last count last year , the indian side of the forest contained 271 of the animals .
there has been no such count in bangladesh in recent years .
falling numbers poaching and illegal logging have affected the tigers ' habitat in the mangrove forest , reducing their number in bangladesh in the past few years .
this is despite reports that some of the tigers from the indian side have migrated to bangladesh during this period .
the un-funded project will involve not only the counting of royal bengal tigers , but also a study of their breeding and feeding behaviour .
tigers kill nearly 50 people every year in the indian sunderbans alone .

three hydrogen buses begin a two-year trial on route 25 from oxford circus to ilford , east london .
mayor ken livingstone said the £ 750,000 buses were the " greenest , cleanest and quietest ever " .
london is one of nine european cities taking part in the trial as part of a scheme to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and noise pollution .
the route , which takes in both the west end and the east end , was chosen because it is long and has different traffic conditions .

" after the first few months we intend to integrate them into some other routes , once we know they have proven reliable on a day-to-day basis . "
the single-decker buses use fuel cell technology to power an electrical engine and can run for 125 miles before refuelling .
the liquid hydrogen is delivered to a fuelling site where it is dispensed as a gas into pressurised cylinders .
these cylinders are placed on top of the bus with the fuel-cell system and coolers .
the only emission is water , which forms into a vapour cloud as it leaves the exhaust .
