visiting germany and want to hit the mat ?
here 's where to go . yoga has long since been transformed from a flaky pursuit of ex-hippies into one of the west 's most pervasive fitness trends . throw a stone on any new york or los angeles street , and it seems you 'll hit someone on the way to a yoga class , exercise mat in tow .
stars such as madonna , sting and gwyneth paltrow have praised its virtues ; and new yoga studios are sprouting up in u.s. cities like mushrooms after a rain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bikram yoga trend started in the us now , the sport 's rocketing popularity has crossed the ocean .
in all its styles and variations , germans ca n't seem to get enough of yoga . boom times kumud schramm , spokeswoman for germany 's yoga teachers ' association , says that more than three million germans do yoga on a regular basis , and there are more than 8,000 teachers in the country who serve them . " we 're really experiencing a boom in yoga , " schramm recently told focus magazine .
" our lives are hectic , demanding , and take us to the limits of our physical and psychological limits .
people are seeking quiet , relaxation , and a look inside themselves .
that 's what they get with yoga . " germany 's latest fitness trend has its roots in a 3,500 year old system which seeks to join the body and mind , using breathing techniques and meditation mixed with a series of physical postures , or asanas .
the asanas promote strength , flexibility and balance , and different postures are said to be beneficial for different internal organs as well as body functions . fitness craze bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fine art of yoga the first german yoga studio opened in berlin in 1937 .
there was a surge of recognition in the 1960s and ' 70s , especially among young people seeking transcendental experiences . today , however , yoga has moved more into the mainstream , and its focus is often just as much physical fitness as mental well-being .
yoga today is just as often seen as a good workout or a relaxation method as a stop on the road to enlightenment . anyone interested in checking out the sport should first think about what they want to get out of it , and then see which type of yoga is best suited for them . iyengar yoga , developed by indian yogi bks iyengar , is a low-key , technique-oriented style best suited for older or injured students .
power yoga and its ascetic cousin ashtanga are flowing-style yoga that offers a heavy duty cardiovascular workout and require - or build - stamina and muscle strength .
bikram is a series of postures taught in a superheated room -lrb- around 40 degrees celsius , or 100 fahrenheit , -rrb- in order to promote sweating and blood flow .
sivananda is classical style of postures that focuses heavily on meditation , while kriya might be right for the person on a spiritual path . classes in english bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yoga is n't just for women whether in germany on business or pleasure , an english-speaking visitor who wants to check out a class or pursue an ongoing practice will face a wide range of options , especially in the larger cities .
a surprising number of classes are offered in english -lrb- and a surprising number of the teachers in germany are americans or brits who have made a business of importing their passion for the sport . -rrb-
the yoga scene tends to be an international one , and english is its lingua franca . many regular fitness studios offer trial or visitor passes that allow access to a whole range of fitness classes , yoga included .
and of course , more and more studios devoted solely to yoga - usually teaching one of the styles mentioned above - are opening all the time . want to find a yoga class in germany that 's right for you ?
here are dw-world.de 's top five yoga picks . berlin : moveo : the studio is on the cutting edge of the yoga trend .
in berlin 's kreuzberg district , moveo prides itself on offering an extremely wide array of class styles , from ashtanga to iyengar to pre- and post-natal .
check out the café , sauna and massage offerings . hamburg : bikram yoga studio hamburg opened in 1999 , is the first in germany to have offered yoga classes in this increasingly popular style .
also called ' hot yoga ' because classes are held in superheated rooms , the better to promote healing , bikram yoga was developed by bikram choudhoury , an indian who teaches in los angeles . frankfurt : balance yoga in downtown frankfurt , opened just last year , offers drop-in classes in english in various styles . munich : jivamukti .
based on a new york-style offshoot of flowing ashtanga yoga , often set to pulsing modern music . jivamukti incorporates philosophy , strength training , and spirituality . cologne : lord vishnu 's couch .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.03.2004 austria 's jörg haider fights for his future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider is campaigning to stay in the political spotlight the alpine firebrand is fighting for survival .
he 's been busy pulling out his trademark populist tactics , but it might not be enough to get him reelected when his home state of carinthia goes to the polls on sunday . jörg haider is in for the fight of his life .
when polls open in sunday in the southern austrian state of carinthia , the far-right populist will be hoping he can hold onto his position as governor .
for the enfant terrible of the alpine republic , the election will make or break his political career .
based on opinion surveys , the 54-year old politician is in for a tough challenge from the socialist party -lrb- spö -rrb- , which is leading with the support of 39 percent of voters compared to haider 's freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- with 36 percent .
a recent poll conducted by the newsmagazine format shows that less than half of all austrians believe in haider 's chances of reelection .
in the face of such statistics , the future looks pretty dim for the former fpö party leader .
but haider refuses to admit defeat before the last vote has been counted .
" i am certain i will be reelected , " he said in typical confidence , hoping to revive austrian 's faith in him .
rallying support from nationalists playing up his image as the hero of the " little people , " haider took to the campaign trail , traveling throughout the mountainous state , an entourage of yoddelers and dirndl dressed alpine beauties accompanying him and helping to pass out stuffed animals , candy and other trinkets to supporters .
at every stop he pulled out the xenophobic rhetoric - righteous anger at immigrants who steal austrians ' jobs and receive welfare funding .
" those foreigners who do not work should not be allowed to benefit from state money to the detriment of hard-working austrians , " he said in the small town of villach on thursday .
and the response was loud applause .
the nationalism goes down well in the largely rural province .
haider 's no-holds-barred campaigning in the last several weeks has helped him gain points in the polls , which show him trailing behind the spö but still way ahead of the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- of chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
as for haider 's main competition , spö candidate peter ambrozy , the local press describes him as " lacking in charm " - hardly surprising compared to the charismatic incumbent .
but that might not be enough to put haider in the lead .
a return to national politics ?
in characteristic haider fashion , the extremes lie close together : whereas a loss on sunday would most likely spell the end of his political future , a reelection could be a ticket to a national comeback .
haider himself has already said he would use a victory in carinthia as a springboard for jumping back into federal politics .
in 2000 , after he led the fpö into the national government , he withdrew from vienna and gave up his party leadership .
since then the fpö has remained a part of the ruling coalition with schüssel 's övp , but has suffered a rapid decline in support .
from the record 27 percent of votes it received in 2000 , backing for the party has dwindled down to about 10 percent .
" i want to revive the fpö from carinthia , " haider repeated in campaign speeches throughout the state .
a thorn in vienna 's south haider 's loss in the southern state could therefore turn out to be vienna 's gain .
considered hard to control and a sworn enemy of schüssel , haider 's xenophobic outbursts and political scandal riled the european union so much that it slapped six months of sanctions on austria in 2000 after the fpö entered the national government .
since retreating from vienna , haider has continued accumulating a bad track record of embarrassing austria with his brash populism .
in december he shocked the international community by saying that morally there was little difference between u.s. president george w. bush and saddam hussein , a remark he still refuses to retract .
" hitler too arrived in power democratically , " in 1933 , he reminds reporters while politicians in vienna shift uncomfortably on their seats and hope haider 's provocative statements and nationalist populism deter rather than attract voters this time around . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no surprises as haider u-turns again in a move that reflects his favored leisure activity , austria 's most infamous bungee-jumper jörg haider has bounced back from his decision to quit politics to continue his controversial career .

he 's been busy pulling out his trademark populist tactics , but it might not be enough to get him reelected when his home state of carinthia goes to the polls on sunday . jörg haider is in for the fight of his life .
when polls open in sunday in the southern austrian state of carinthia , the far-right populist will be hoping he can hold onto his position as governor .
for the enfant terrible of the alpine republic , the election will make or break his political career .
based on opinion surveys , the 54-year old politician is in for a tough challenge from the socialist party -lrb- spö -rrb- , which is leading with the support of 39 percent of voters compared to haider 's freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- with 36 percent .
a recent poll conducted by the newsmagazine format shows that less than half of all austrians believe in haider 's chances of reelection .
in the face of such statistics , the future looks pretty dim for the former fpö party leader .
but haider refuses to admit defeat before the last vote has been counted .
" i am certain i will be reelected , " he said in typical confidence , hoping to revive austrian 's faith in him .
rallying support from nationalists playing up his image as the hero of the " little people , " haider took to the campaign trail , traveling throughout the mountainous state , an entourage of yoddelers and dirndl dressed alpine beauties accompanying him and helping to pass out stuffed animals , candy and other trinkets to supporters .
at every stop he pulled out the xenophobic rhetoric - righteous anger at immigrants who steal austrians ' jobs and receive welfare funding .
" those foreigners who do not work should not be allowed to benefit from state money to the detriment of hard-working austrians , " he said in the small town of villach on thursday .
and the response was loud applause .
the nationalism goes down well in the largely rural province .
haider 's no-holds-barred campaigning in the last several weeks has helped him gain points in the polls , which show him trailing behind the spö but still way ahead of the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- of chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
as for haider 's main competition , spö candidate peter ambrozy , the local press describes him as " lacking in charm " - hardly surprising compared to the charismatic incumbent .
but that might not be enough to put haider in the lead .
a return to national politics ?
in characteristic haider fashion , the extremes lie close together : whereas a loss on sunday would most likely spell the end of his political future , a reelection could be a ticket to a national comeback .
haider himself has already said he would use a victory in carinthia as a springboard for jumping back into federal politics .
in 2000 , after he led the fpö into the national government , he withdrew from vienna and gave up his party leadership .
since then the fpö has remained a part of the ruling coalition with schüssel 's övp , but has suffered a rapid decline in support .
from the record 27 percent of votes it received in 2000 , backing for the party has dwindled down to about 10 percent .
" i want to revive the fpö from carinthia , " haider repeated in campaign speeches throughout the state .
a thorn in vienna 's south haider 's loss in the southern state could therefore turn out to be vienna 's gain .
considered hard to control and a sworn enemy of schüssel , haider 's xenophobic outbursts and political scandal riled the european union so much that it slapped six months of sanctions on austria in 2000 after the fpö entered the national government .
since retreating from vienna , haider has continued accumulating a bad track record of embarrassing austria with his brash populism .
in december he shocked the international community by saying that morally there was little difference between u.s. president george w. bush and saddam hussein , a remark he still refuses to retract .
" hitler too arrived in power democratically , " in 1933 , he reminds reporters while politicians in vienna shift uncomfortably on their seats and hope haider 's provocative statements and nationalist populism deter rather than attract voters this time around . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no surprises as haider u-turns again in a move that reflects his favored leisure activity , austria 's most infamous bungee-jumper jörg haider has bounced back from his decision to quit politics to continue his controversial career .

after receiving an official request from belgium , germany now says it is considering sending a military contingent to the democratic republic of congo to aid european soldiers currently operating there . on friday the german defense ministry confirmed earlier reports it had been asked by belgian military officials to send a stabilization force of army officers to the central african country .
a spokesman for the ministry said the request was being seriously considered but a final decision was still open .
defense minister peter struck has indicated he will agree to belgium 's request on the condition that parliamentary backing is not necessary to launch the mission , according to a report in the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper on saturday .
in the majority of cases , the decision to send german troops abroad hinges on parliamentary approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , center , casts his vote for the deployment of german troops during a un-led peacekeeping mission in kongo in the german parliament in berlin on wednesday , june 18 , 2003 .
defence minister peter struck is second from right , interior minister otto schily is at right .
last july germany participated in an eu-led peacekeeping mission to the heavily embattled eastern provinces of congo , but contribution was limited to logistical aid for other forces already operating on the ground .
although the mandate passed through parliament with a clear majority , berlin balked at approving further german involvement and the mission was limited to 350 soldiers and a two-month mandate without renewal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.03.2004 german tradesmen look east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu expansion could mean work for german companies who want it as the countdown for eu expansion continues , many small and medium-sized german companies are growing increasingly fearful of the impending competition from across the borders .
but some firms can hardly wait . with ten new countries entering the european union on may 1 , there 's potentially a lot of work for those german companies who are game enough to go and find it .
one such outfit is the mould construction and plastic processing company wolf & liegel situated in the southern german town of schwabach .
in the works hall , huge plastic injection machines pound away , shaping and creating plastic car parts with such conviction that it is hard to imagine the struggle many automobile manufacturers are currently facing .
indeed , manager klaus wolf says his company is revving up , and is set to accelerate this summer when they open a new production plant close to the skoda car manufacturer in the czech republic .
wolf , who is a great believer in increasing profit through low wages , is hoping that the labor situation at the new plant will balance out the costs at home .
" we 're hoping to do a kind of mixed calculation and to get more contracts from clients who are not already on our books in schwabach , " he told deutsche welle .
although they have n't even opened yet , wolf says his company already has a confirmed turnover of € 5 million -lrb- $ 6.19 million -rrb- from the new plant , which is perhaps not surprising given the staggeringly low wage costs .
in the czech republic , the hourly rate for employees working in the car supply service is just € 5 an hour , whereas in germany , trained employees can command up to € 40 an hour .
complex customs regulations in the southern german town of ansbach , paintbrush manufacturer feurer is just as keen to see the 1st of may roll around , but for slightly different reasons .
manager thomas hackenberger and his company , which survives on the exports of its high quality ' kolibri ' artists ' paintbrushes , is tired of running the gauntlet of customs procedures to get his product exported to eastern europe .
the removal of the cumbersome customs conditions spells ease of trade for the company , and hackenberger hopes this will boost turnover .
as it stands , in order to send goods to poland and the czech republic , he first has to fill out export documents to be certified by german customs officials before the goods can be dispatched to the target country .
once they arrive , the story continues .
" the goods are taken to the customs office responsible for a given region .
our customers then go to the customs office with their papers .
before they are given the goods , they have to pay the import tax , " says hackenberger , who believes the whole process is poison for client relations .
staying at home although there is doubtless a myriad of opportunities just waiting to present itself , many small and mid-size german companies work on a regional level , and are either skeptical of , or not greatly interested in eu expansion .
the cheap competition from across the border is their greatest fear .
with low wage and production costs , businesses in the new eu neighbors could potentially threaten long-established german companies by pulling away clients and contracts .
but the wider belief - especially among more internationally-oriented companies - is that there 's a lot of work to be done in the new member states , and someone is going to have to do it .
there are roads to be repaired and public buildings to be restored , and for those german tradesmen who are n't shy of crossing the border , there are even eu funds especially earmarked for such reconstruction projects .
the expansion process could thus prove profitable in the end . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu countries fear mass migration from the east british prime minister tony blair has said he might join an increasing number of eu countries that want to initially bar low-cost workers from new european union countries from working in the west .

but some firms can hardly wait . with ten new countries entering the european union on may 1 , there 's potentially a lot of work for those german companies who are game enough to go and find it .
one such outfit is the mould construction and plastic processing company wolf & liegel situated in the southern german town of schwabach .
in the works hall , huge plastic injection machines pound away , shaping and creating plastic car parts with such conviction that it is hard to imagine the struggle many automobile manufacturers are currently facing .
indeed , manager klaus wolf says his company is revving up , and is set to accelerate this summer when they open a new production plant close to the skoda car manufacturer in the czech republic .
wolf , who is a great believer in increasing profit through low wages , is hoping that the labor situation at the new plant will balance out the costs at home .
" we 're hoping to do a kind of mixed calculation and to get more contracts from clients who are not already on our books in schwabach , " he told deutsche welle .
although they have n't even opened yet , wolf says his company already has a confirmed turnover of € 5 million -lrb- $ 6.19 million -rrb- from the new plant , which is perhaps not surprising given the staggeringly low wage costs .
in the czech republic , the hourly rate for employees working in the car supply service is just € 5 an hour , whereas in germany , trained employees can command up to € 40 an hour .

manager thomas hackenberger and his company , which survives on the exports of its high quality ' kolibri ' artists ' paintbrushes , is tired of running the gauntlet of customs procedures to get his product exported to eastern europe .
the removal of the cumbersome customs conditions spells ease of trade for the company , and hackenberger hopes this will boost turnover .
as it stands , in order to send goods to poland and the czech republic , he first has to fill out export documents to be certified by german customs officials before the goods can be dispatched to the target country .
once they arrive , the story continues .
" the goods are taken to the customs office responsible for a given region .
our customers then go to the customs office with their papers .

staying at home although there is doubtless a myriad of opportunities just waiting to present itself , many small and mid-size german companies work on a regional level , and are either skeptical of , or not greatly interested in eu expansion .
the cheap competition from across the border is their greatest fear .
with low wage and production costs , businesses in the new eu neighbors could potentially threaten long-established german companies by pulling away clients and contracts .

but some firms can hardly wait . with ten new countries entering the european union on may 1 , there 's potentially a lot of work for those german companies who are game enough to go and find it .
one such outfit is the mould construction and plastic processing company wolf & liegel situated in the southern german town of schwabach .
in the works hall , huge plastic injection machines pound away , shaping and creating plastic car parts with such conviction that it is hard to imagine the struggle many automobile manufacturers are currently facing .
indeed , manager klaus wolf says his company is revving up , and is set to accelerate this summer when they open a new production plant close to the skoda car manufacturer in the czech republic .
wolf , who is a great believer in increasing profit through low wages , is hoping that the labor situation at the new plant will balance out the costs at home .
" we 're hoping to do a kind of mixed calculation and to get more contracts from clients who are not already on our books in schwabach , " he told deutsche welle .
although they have n't even opened yet , wolf says his company already has a confirmed turnover of € 5 million -lrb- $ 6.19 million -rrb- from the new plant , which is perhaps not surprising given the staggeringly low wage costs .
in the czech republic , the hourly rate for employees working in the car supply service is just € 5 an hour , whereas in germany , trained employees can command up to € 40 an hour .
complex customs regulations in the southern german town of ansbach , paintbrush manufacturer feurer is just as keen to see the 1st of may roll around , but for slightly different reasons .
manager thomas hackenberger and his company , which survives on the exports of its high quality ' kolibri ' artists ' paintbrushes , is tired of running the gauntlet of customs procedures to get his product exported to eastern europe .
the removal of the cumbersome customs conditions spells ease of trade for the company , and hackenberger hopes this will boost turnover .
as it stands , in order to send goods to poland and the czech republic , he first has to fill out export documents to be certified by german customs officials before the goods can be dispatched to the target country .
once they arrive , the story continues .
" the goods are taken to the customs office responsible for a given region .
our customers then go to the customs office with their papers .
before they are given the goods , they have to pay the import tax , " says hackenberger , who believes the whole process is poison for client relations .
staying at home although there is doubtless a myriad of opportunities just waiting to present itself , many small and mid-size german companies work on a regional level , and are either skeptical of , or not greatly interested in eu expansion .
the cheap competition from across the border is their greatest fear .
with low wage and production costs , businesses in the new eu neighbors could potentially threaten long-established german companies by pulling away clients and contracts .
but the wider belief - especially among more internationally-oriented companies - is that there 's a lot of work to be done in the new member states , and someone is going to have to do it .

but some firms can hardly wait . with ten new countries entering the european union on may 1 , there 's potentially a lot of work for those german companies who are game enough to go and find it .
one such outfit is the mould construction and plastic processing company wolf & liegel situated in the southern german town of schwabach .
in the works hall , huge plastic injection machines pound away , shaping and creating plastic car parts with such conviction that it is hard to imagine the struggle many automobile manufacturers are currently facing .
indeed , manager klaus wolf says his company is revving up , and is set to accelerate this summer when they open a new production plant close to the skoda car manufacturer in the czech republic .
wolf , who is a great believer in increasing profit through low wages , is hoping that the labor situation at the new plant will balance out the costs at home .
" we 're hoping to do a kind of mixed calculation and to get more contracts from clients who are not already on our books in schwabach , " he told deutsche welle .
although they have n't even opened yet , wolf says his company already has a confirmed turnover of € 5 million -lrb- $ 6.19 million -rrb- from the new plant , which is perhaps not surprising given the staggeringly low wage costs .
in the czech republic , the hourly rate for employees working in the car supply service is just € 5 an hour , whereas in germany , trained employees can command up to € 40 an hour .
complex customs regulations in the southern german town of ansbach , paintbrush manufacturer feurer is just as keen to see the 1st of may roll around , but for slightly different reasons .
manager thomas hackenberger and his company , which survives on the exports of its high quality ' kolibri ' artists ' paintbrushes , is tired of running the gauntlet of customs procedures to get his product exported to eastern europe .
the removal of the cumbersome customs conditions spells ease of trade for the company , and hackenberger hopes this will boost turnover .
as it stands , in order to send goods to poland and the czech republic , he first has to fill out export documents to be certified by german customs officials before the goods can be dispatched to the target country .
once they arrive , the story continues .
" the goods are taken to the customs office responsible for a given region .
our customers then go to the customs office with their papers .
before they are given the goods , they have to pay the import tax , " says hackenberger , who believes the whole process is poison for client relations .
staying at home although there is doubtless a myriad of opportunities just waiting to present itself , many small and mid-size german companies work on a regional level , and are either skeptical of , or not greatly interested in eu expansion .
the cheap competition from across the border is their greatest fear .
with low wage and production costs , businesses in the new eu neighbors could potentially threaten long-established german companies by pulling away clients and contracts .
but the wider belief - especially among more internationally-oriented companies - is that there 's a lot of work to be done in the new member states , and someone is going to have to do it .
there are roads to be repaired and public buildings to be restored , and for those german tradesmen who are n't shy of crossing the border , there are even eu funds especially earmarked for such reconstruction projects .
the expansion process could thus prove profitable in the end . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu countries fear mass migration from the east british prime minister tony blair has said he might join an increasing number of eu countries that want to initially bar low-cost workers from new european union countries from working in the west .

folker hönge , chairman of the voluntary film monitoring committee , justified the age limit , saying the film 's excessive violence makes it inappropriate for children and youths .
there will also be no exception made for school groups or children accompanied by adults , as is often the case with restricted viewing .
cardinal karl lehmann , chairman of the german bishop 's conference , has been equally critical of the hollywood production , albeit for theological reasons .
speaking to the mass circulation bild newspaper , the catholic church leader said , " gibson reduces the bible 's message in a problematic manner . "
nonetheless , the film is receiving a good deal of promotion in germany , and the release date has been moved ahead of the initially scheduled easter opening . more briefs 06.03.2004 -pipe- budget cuts threaten cultural institutions abroad 06.03.2004 -pipe- selection of german president is " humiliating " 05.03.2004 -pipe- schröder casts ' bild zeitung ' aside 05.03.2004 -pipe- the great german bunny count 05.03.2004 -pipe- kohl thinks memoirs will set record straight 05.03.2004 -pipe- germany refuses to foot bill for brothel visits 05.03.2004 -pipe- schröder , prodi voice optimism on eu constitution 04.03.2004 -pipe- german sportswear manufacturers under fire 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.03.2004 austria 's jörg haider fights for his future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider is campaigning to stay in the political spotlight the alpine firebrand is fighting for survival .
he 's been busy pulling out his trademark populist tactics , but it might not be enough to get him reelected when his home state of carinthia goes to the polls on sunday . jörg haider is in for the fight of his life .
when polls open in sunday in the southern austrian state of carinthia , the far-right populist will be hoping he can hold onto his position as governor .
for the enfant terrible of the alpine republic , the election will make or break his political career .
based on opinion surveys , the 54-year old politician is in for a tough challenge from the socialist party -lrb- spö -rrb- , which is leading with the support of 39 percent of voters compared to haider 's freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- with 36 percent .
a recent poll conducted by the newsmagazine format shows that less than half of all austrians believe in haider 's chances of reelection .
in the face of such statistics , the future looks pretty dim for the former fpö party leader .
but haider refuses to admit defeat before the last vote has been counted .
" i am certain i will be reelected , " he said in typical confidence , hoping to revive austrian 's faith in him .
rallying support from nationalists playing up his image as the hero of the " little people , " haider took to the campaign trail , traveling throughout the mountainous state , an entourage of yoddelers and dirndl dressed alpine beauties accompanying him and helping to pass out stuffed animals , candy and other trinkets to supporters .
at every stop he pulled out the xenophobic rhetoric - righteous anger at immigrants who steal austrians ' jobs and receive welfare funding .
" those foreigners who do not work should not be allowed to benefit from state money to the detriment of hard-working austrians , " he said in the small town of villach on thursday .
and the response was loud applause .
the nationalism goes down well in the largely rural province .
haider 's no-holds-barred campaigning in the last several weeks has helped him gain points in the polls , which show him trailing behind the spö but still way ahead of the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- of chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
as for haider 's main competition , spö candidate peter ambrozy , the local press describes him as " lacking in charm " - hardly surprising compared to the charismatic incumbent .
but that might not be enough to put haider in the lead .
a return to national politics ?
in characteristic haider fashion , the extremes lie close together : whereas a loss on sunday would most likely spell the end of his political future , a reelection could be a ticket to a national comeback .
haider himself has already said he would use a victory in carinthia as a springboard for jumping back into federal politics .
in 2000 , after he led the fpö into the national government , he withdrew from vienna and gave up his party leadership .
since then the fpö has remained a part of the ruling coalition with schüssel 's övp , but has suffered a rapid decline in support .
from the record 27 percent of votes it received in 2000 , backing for the party has dwindled down to about 10 percent .
" i want to revive the fpö from carinthia , " haider repeated in campaign speeches throughout the state .
a thorn in vienna 's south haider 's loss in the southern state could therefore turn out to be vienna 's gain .
considered hard to control and a sworn enemy of schüssel , haider 's xenophobic outbursts and political scandal riled the european union so much that it slapped six months of sanctions on austria in 2000 after the fpö entered the national government .
since retreating from vienna , haider has continued accumulating a bad track record of embarrassing austria with his brash populism .
in december he shocked the international community by saying that morally there was little difference between u.s. president george w. bush and saddam hussein , a remark he still refuses to retract .
" hitler too arrived in power democratically , " in 1933 , he reminds reporters while politicians in vienna shift uncomfortably on their seats and hope haider 's provocative statements and nationalist populism deter rather than attract voters this time around . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no surprises as haider u-turns again in a move that reflects his favored leisure activity , austria 's most infamous bungee-jumper jörg haider has bounced back from his decision to quit politics to continue his controversial career .

when polls open in sunday in the southern austrian state of carinthia , the far-right populist will be hoping he can hold onto his position as governor .
for the enfant terrible of the alpine republic , the election will make or break his political career .
based on opinion surveys , the 54-year old politician is in for a tough challenge from the socialist party -lrb- spö -rrb- , which is leading with the support of 39 percent of voters compared to haider 's freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- with 36 percent .
a recent poll conducted by the newsmagazine format shows that less than half of all austrians believe in haider 's chances of reelection .
in the face of such statistics , the future looks pretty dim for the former fpö party leader .
but haider refuses to admit defeat before the last vote has been counted .
" i am certain i will be reelected , " he said in typical confidence , hoping to revive austrian 's faith in him .
rallying support from nationalists playing up his image as the hero of the " little people , " haider took to the campaign trail , traveling throughout the mountainous state , an entourage of yoddelers and dirndl dressed alpine beauties accompanying him and helping to pass out stuffed animals , candy and other trinkets to supporters .
at every stop he pulled out the xenophobic rhetoric - righteous anger at immigrants who steal austrians ' jobs and receive welfare funding .
" those foreigners who do not work should not be allowed to benefit from state money to the detriment of hard-working austrians , " he said in the small town of villach on thursday .
and the response was loud applause .
the nationalism goes down well in the largely rural province .
haider 's no-holds-barred campaigning in the last several weeks has helped him gain points in the polls , which show him trailing behind the spö but still way ahead of the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- of chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
as for haider 's main competition , spö candidate peter ambrozy , the local press describes him as " lacking in charm " - hardly surprising compared to the charismatic incumbent .
but that might not be enough to put haider in the lead .
a return to national politics ?
in characteristic haider fashion , the extremes lie close together : whereas a loss on sunday would most likely spell the end of his political future , a reelection could be a ticket to a national comeback .
haider himself has already said he would use a victory in carinthia as a springboard for jumping back into federal politics .
in 2000 , after he led the fpö into the national government , he withdrew from vienna and gave up his party leadership .
since then the fpö has remained a part of the ruling coalition with schüssel 's övp , but has suffered a rapid decline in support .
from the record 27 percent of votes it received in 2000 , backing for the party has dwindled down to about 10 percent .
" i want to revive the fpö from carinthia , " haider repeated in campaign speeches throughout the state .
a thorn in vienna 's south haider 's loss in the southern state could therefore turn out to be vienna 's gain .
considered hard to control and a sworn enemy of schüssel , haider 's xenophobic outbursts and political scandal riled the european union so much that it slapped six months of sanctions on austria in 2000 after the fpö entered the national government .
since retreating from vienna , haider has continued accumulating a bad track record of embarrassing austria with his brash populism .
in december he shocked the international community by saying that morally there was little difference between u.s. president george w. bush and saddam hussein , a remark he still refuses to retract .
" hitler too arrived in power democratically , " in 1933 , he reminds reporters while politicians in vienna shift uncomfortably on their seats and hope haider 's provocative statements and nationalist populism deter rather than attract voters this time around . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no surprises as haider u-turns again in a move that reflects his favored leisure activity , austria 's most infamous bungee-jumper jörg haider has bounced back from his decision to quit politics to continue his controversial career .

the six-time world champion put in his best time ever on saturday to qualify for pole position in the season opener in melbourne , australia .
clocked at 1:24.404 minutes for the just over five kilometer track , schumacher secured his 56th pole start in his career .
it was a full 2.8 seconds faster than last year 's qualifier .
" i 'm very pleased , " the german ferrari pilot said after the race .
saturday was also a one-two victory for ferrari as teammate rubens barrichello from brazil came in second , only 74 thousandths of a second slower than schumi .
it is the fourth consecutive time the two drivers will be starting side by side in the front row for the australian grand prix .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.03.2004 austria 's jörg haider fights for his future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider is campaigning to stay in the political spotlight the alpine firebrand is fighting for survival .
he 's been busy pulling out his trademark populist tactics , but it might not be enough to get him reelected when his home state of carinthia goes to the polls on sunday . jörg haider is in for the fight of his life .
when polls open in sunday in the southern austrian state of carinthia , the far-right populist will be hoping he can hold onto his position as governor .
for the enfant terrible of the alpine republic , the election will make or break his political career .
based on opinion surveys , the 54-year old politician is in for a tough challenge from the socialist party -lrb- spö -rrb- , which is leading with the support of 39 percent of voters compared to haider 's freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- with 36 percent .
a recent poll conducted by the newsmagazine format shows that less than half of all austrians believe in haider 's chances of reelection .
in the face of such statistics , the future looks pretty dim for the former fpö party leader .
but haider refuses to admit defeat before the last vote has been counted .
" i am certain i will be reelected , " he said in typical confidence , hoping to revive austrian 's faith in him .
rallying support from nationalists playing up his image as the hero of the " little people , " haider took to the campaign trail , traveling throughout the mountainous state , an entourage of yoddelers and dirndl dressed alpine beauties accompanying him and helping to pass out stuffed animals , candy and other trinkets to supporters .
at every stop he pulled out the xenophobic rhetoric - righteous anger at immigrants who steal austrians ' jobs and receive welfare funding .
" those foreigners who do not work should not be allowed to benefit from state money to the detriment of hard-working austrians , " he said in the small town of villach on thursday .
and the response was loud applause .
the nationalism goes down well in the largely rural province .
haider 's no-holds-barred campaigning in the last several weeks has helped him gain points in the polls , which show him trailing behind the spö but still way ahead of the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- of chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
as for haider 's main competition , spö candidate peter ambrozy , the local press describes him as " lacking in charm " - hardly surprising compared to the charismatic incumbent .
but that might not be enough to put haider in the lead .
a return to national politics ?
in characteristic haider fashion , the extremes lie close together : whereas a loss on sunday would most likely spell the end of his political future , a reelection could be a ticket to a national comeback .
haider himself has already said he would use a victory in carinthia as a springboard for jumping back into federal politics .
in 2000 , after he led the fpö into the national government , he withdrew from vienna and gave up his party leadership .
since then the fpö has remained a part of the ruling coalition with schüssel 's övp , but has suffered a rapid decline in support .
from the record 27 percent of votes it received in 2000 , backing for the party has dwindled down to about 10 percent .
" i want to revive the fpö from carinthia , " haider repeated in campaign speeches throughout the state .
a thorn in vienna 's south haider 's loss in the southern state could therefore turn out to be vienna 's gain .
considered hard to control and a sworn enemy of schüssel , haider 's xenophobic outbursts and political scandal riled the european union so much that it slapped six months of sanctions on austria in 2000 after the fpö entered the national government .
since retreating from vienna , haider has continued accumulating a bad track record of embarrassing austria with his brash populism .
in december he shocked the international community by saying that morally there was little difference between u.s. president george w. bush and saddam hussein , a remark he still refuses to retract .
" hitler too arrived in power democratically , " in 1933 , he reminds reporters while politicians in vienna shift uncomfortably on their seats and hope haider 's provocative statements and nationalist populism deter rather than attract voters this time around . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no surprises as haider u-turns again in a move that reflects his favored leisure activity , austria 's most infamous bungee-jumper jörg haider has bounced back from his decision to quit politics to continue his controversial career .

when polls open in sunday in the southern austrian state of carinthia , the far-right populist will be hoping he can hold onto his position as governor .
for the enfant terrible of the alpine republic , the election will make or break his political career .
based on opinion surveys , the 54-year old politician is in for a tough challenge from the socialist party -lrb- spö -rrb- , which is leading with the support of 39 percent of voters compared to haider 's freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- with 36 percent .
a recent poll conducted by the newsmagazine format shows that less than half of all austrians believe in haider 's chances of reelection .
in the face of such statistics , the future looks pretty dim for the former fpö party leader .
but haider refuses to admit defeat before the last vote has been counted .
" i am certain i will be reelected , " he said in typical confidence , hoping to revive austrian 's faith in him .
rallying support from nationalists playing up his image as the hero of the " little people , " haider took to the campaign trail , traveling throughout the mountainous state , an entourage of yoddelers and dirndl dressed alpine beauties accompanying him and helping to pass out stuffed animals , candy and other trinkets to supporters .
at every stop he pulled out the xenophobic rhetoric - righteous anger at immigrants who steal austrians ' jobs and receive welfare funding .
" those foreigners who do not work should not be allowed to benefit from state money to the detriment of hard-working austrians , " he said in the small town of villach on thursday .
and the response was loud applause .
the nationalism goes down well in the largely rural province .
haider 's no-holds-barred campaigning in the last several weeks has helped him gain points in the polls , which show him trailing behind the spö but still way ahead of the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- of chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
as for haider 's main competition , spö candidate peter ambrozy , the local press describes him as " lacking in charm " - hardly surprising compared to the charismatic incumbent .
but that might not be enough to put haider in the lead .
a return to national politics ?
in characteristic haider fashion , the extremes lie close together : whereas a loss on sunday would most likely spell the end of his political future , a reelection could be a ticket to a national comeback .
haider himself has already said he would use a victory in carinthia as a springboard for jumping back into federal politics .
in 2000 , after he led the fpö into the national government , he withdrew from vienna and gave up his party leadership .
since then the fpö has remained a part of the ruling coalition with schüssel 's övp , but has suffered a rapid decline in support .
from the record 27 percent of votes it received in 2000 , backing for the party has dwindled down to about 10 percent .
" i want to revive the fpö from carinthia , " haider repeated in campaign speeches throughout the state .
a thorn in vienna 's south haider 's loss in the southern state could therefore turn out to be vienna 's gain .
considered hard to control and a sworn enemy of schüssel , haider 's xenophobic outbursts and political scandal riled the european union so much that it slapped six months of sanctions on austria in 2000 after the fpö entered the national government .
since retreating from vienna , haider has continued accumulating a bad track record of embarrassing austria with his brash populism .
in december he shocked the international community by saying that morally there was little difference between u.s. president george w. bush and saddam hussein , a remark he still refuses to retract .
" hitler too arrived in power democratically , " in 1933 , he reminds reporters while politicians in vienna shift uncomfortably on their seats and hope haider 's provocative statements and nationalist populism deter rather than attract voters this time around . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no surprises as haider u-turns again in a move that reflects his favored leisure activity , austria 's most infamous bungee-jumper jörg haider has bounced back from his decision to quit politics to continue his controversial career .

it was a full 2.8 seconds faster than last year 's qualifier .
" i 'm very pleased , " the german ferrari pilot said after the race .
saturday was also a one-two victory for ferrari as teammate rubens barrichello from brazil came in second , only 74 thousandths of a second slower than schumi .

as the formula one season kicks off , six-time champion michael schumacher is the one to watch .
securing the pole position on saturday , the german ferrari pilot poses the ultimate challenge for barrichello and montoya . the 2004 formula one season picked up where the last one left off - with a victory lap by michael schumacher .
the six-time world champion put in his best time ever on saturday to qualify for pole position in the season opener in melbourne , australia .
clocked at 1:24.404 minutes for the just over five kilometer track , schumacher secured his 56th pole start in his career .
it was a full 2.8 seconds faster than last year 's qualifier .
" i 'm very pleased , " the german ferrari pilot said after the race .
saturday was also a one-two victory for ferrari as teammate rubens barrichello from brazil came in second , only 74 thousandths of a second slower than schumi .
it is the fourth consecutive time the two drivers will be starting side by side in the front row for the australian grand prix .
hot on shumi 's tail behind the ferrari pilots will be the colombian juan pablo montoya starting for williams-bmw in third position and jenson button from england for bar-honda .
the spaniard fernando alonso -lrb- renault -rrb- and australian mark webber -lrb- jaguar-cosworth -rrb- will start in row three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombia 's juan pablo montoya for williams-bmw .
montoya , whom some have tipped as the contender for the driver 's title in 2004 , will be hot on schumi 's tail when the cars race around melbourne 's albert park track on sunday .
he finished third in the overall championship last year and is revving for a chance to take on the germans .
his bmw teammate and schumi 's brother ralf had to settle for eighth spot on the starting grid .
the surprise outcome in saturday 's line-up was the fourth place seating for the young jenson button .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.03.2004 austria 's jörg haider fights for his future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider is campaigning to stay in the political spotlight the alpine firebrand is fighting for survival .
he 's been busy pulling out his trademark populist tactics , but it might not be enough to get him reelected when his home state of carinthia goes to the polls on sunday . jörg haider is in for the fight of his life .
when polls open in sunday in the southern austrian state of carinthia , the far-right populist will be hoping he can hold onto his position as governor .
for the enfant terrible of the alpine republic , the election will make or break his political career .
based on opinion surveys , the 54-year old politician is in for a tough challenge from the socialist party -lrb- spö -rrb- , which is leading with the support of 39 percent of voters compared to haider 's freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- with 36 percent .
a recent poll conducted by the newsmagazine format shows that less than half of all austrians believe in haider 's chances of reelection .
in the face of such statistics , the future looks pretty dim for the former fpö party leader .
but haider refuses to admit defeat before the last vote has been counted .
" i am certain i will be reelected , " he said in typical confidence , hoping to revive austrian 's faith in him .
rallying support from nationalists playing up his image as the hero of the " little people , " haider took to the campaign trail , traveling throughout the mountainous state , an entourage of yoddelers and dirndl dressed alpine beauties accompanying him and helping to pass out stuffed animals , candy and other trinkets to supporters .
at every stop he pulled out the xenophobic rhetoric - righteous anger at immigrants who steal austrians ' jobs and receive welfare funding .
" those foreigners who do not work should not be allowed to benefit from state money to the detriment of hard-working austrians , " he said in the small town of villach on thursday .
and the response was loud applause .
the nationalism goes down well in the largely rural province .
haider 's no-holds-barred campaigning in the last several weeks has helped him gain points in the polls , which show him trailing behind the spö but still way ahead of the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- of chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
as for haider 's main competition , spö candidate peter ambrozy , the local press describes him as " lacking in charm " - hardly surprising compared to the charismatic incumbent .
but that might not be enough to put haider in the lead .
a return to national politics ?
in characteristic haider fashion , the extremes lie close together : whereas a loss on sunday would most likely spell the end of his political future , a reelection could be a ticket to a national comeback .
haider himself has already said he would use a victory in carinthia as a springboard for jumping back into federal politics .
in 2000 , after he led the fpö into the national government , he withdrew from vienna and gave up his party leadership .
since then the fpö has remained a part of the ruling coalition with schüssel 's övp , but has suffered a rapid decline in support .
from the record 27 percent of votes it received in 2000 , backing for the party has dwindled down to about 10 percent .
" i want to revive the fpö from carinthia , " haider repeated in campaign speeches throughout the state .
a thorn in vienna 's south haider 's loss in the southern state could therefore turn out to be vienna 's gain .
considered hard to control and a sworn enemy of schüssel , haider 's xenophobic outbursts and political scandal riled the european union so much that it slapped six months of sanctions on austria in 2000 after the fpö entered the national government .
since retreating from vienna , haider has continued accumulating a bad track record of embarrassing austria with his brash populism .
in december he shocked the international community by saying that morally there was little difference between u.s. president george w. bush and saddam hussein , a remark he still refuses to retract .
" hitler too arrived in power democratically , " in 1933 , he reminds reporters while politicians in vienna shift uncomfortably on their seats and hope haider 's provocative statements and nationalist populism deter rather than attract voters this time around . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no surprises as haider u-turns again in a move that reflects his favored leisure activity , austria 's most infamous bungee-jumper jörg haider has bounced back from his decision to quit politics to continue his controversial career .

but some firms can hardly wait . with ten new countries entering the european union on may 1 , there 's potentially a lot of work for those german companies who are game enough to go and find it .
one such outfit is the mould construction and plastic processing company wolf & liegel situated in the southern german town of schwabach .
in the works hall , huge plastic injection machines pound away , shaping and creating plastic car parts with such conviction that it is hard to imagine the struggle many automobile manufacturers are currently facing .
indeed , manager klaus wolf says his company is revving up , and is set to accelerate this summer when they open a new production plant close to the skoda car manufacturer in the czech republic .
wolf , who is a great believer in increasing profit through low wages , is hoping that the labor situation at the new plant will balance out the costs at home .
" we 're hoping to do a kind of mixed calculation and to get more contracts from clients who are not already on our books in schwabach , " he told deutsche welle .
although they have n't even opened yet , wolf says his company already has a confirmed turnover of € 5 million -lrb- $ 6.19 million -rrb- from the new plant , which is perhaps not surprising given the staggeringly low wage costs .

manager thomas hackenberger and his company , which survives on the exports of its high quality ' kolibri ' artists ' paintbrushes , is tired of running the gauntlet of customs procedures to get his product exported to eastern europe .
the removal of the cumbersome customs conditions spells ease of trade for the company , and hackenberger hopes this will boost turnover .
as it stands , in order to send goods to poland and the czech republic , he first has to fill out export documents to be certified by german customs officials before the goods can be dispatched to the target country .
once they arrive , the story continues .
" the goods are taken to the customs office responsible for a given region .
our customers then go to the customs office with their papers .

after receiving an official request from belgium , germany now says it is considering sending a military contingent to the democratic republic of congo to aid european soldiers currently operating there . on friday the german defense ministry confirmed earlier reports it had been asked by belgian military officials to send a stabilization force of army officers to the central african country .

berlin will not put forth a new candidate for the top post of the international monetary fund after the current head , horst köhler , announced he would step down to pursue a nomination as germany 's next president . according to reports out of berlin , germany will not insist on filling the vacancy at the top of the imf with one of its own .
after köhler accepted the candidacy for the country 's presidency , the german government on friday was quick to ensure its european neighbors and the rest of the world that it would not put forth another candidate .
a german successor at the imf would have no chance of acceptance , given the strong resistance from other european governments , a spokesperson for the berlin government told spiegel magazine .
typically , europe places the head of the imf while the united states selects the head of the world bank .
" it 's a gentleman 's agreement , " barbara böttcher , head of the economic and european policy issues team at deutsche bank research in frankfurt , told dw-world , but she also added that it was unlikely europe would agree to another german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler announced he would step down as managing director of the imf on march 4 , 2004 .
admitting that it will take a while before the imf finds a replacement , böttcher said it was a real shame that köhler was pulled out of his post at the imf .
" it is really unfortunate that the germans have , or think they have , so few capable people that they have to take köhler out of this position , which is after all one of the highest diplomatic representations that a german holds internationally , in order to become president . "
no german , but a european at any rate although no names have been confirmed yet , frenchman jean lemierre , who succeeded köhler as president of the european bank for reconstruction and development , has been named .
other possible candidates in the rumor mill are spanish finance minister rodrigo rato , as well as britain 's powerful finance minister chancellor gordon brown .
the search for a new managing director will not only stir up conflicting interests within europe , but it will almost certainly rekindle the debate from 2000 when köhler came into office .
at that time developing countries and many asian nations criticized the tradition of europe presenting a candidate as outdated and repeatedly called to end the u.s.-european hegemony .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.03.2004 austria 's jörg haider fights for his future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider is campaigning to stay in the political spotlight the alpine firebrand is fighting for survival .
he 's been busy pulling out his trademark populist tactics , but it might not be enough to get him reelected when his home state of carinthia goes to the polls on sunday . jörg haider is in for the fight of his life .
when polls open in sunday in the southern austrian state of carinthia , the far-right populist will be hoping he can hold onto his position as governor .
for the enfant terrible of the alpine republic , the election will make or break his political career .
based on opinion surveys , the 54-year old politician is in for a tough challenge from the socialist party -lrb- spö -rrb- , which is leading with the support of 39 percent of voters compared to haider 's freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- with 36 percent .
a recent poll conducted by the newsmagazine format shows that less than half of all austrians believe in haider 's chances of reelection .
in the face of such statistics , the future looks pretty dim for the former fpö party leader .
but haider refuses to admit defeat before the last vote has been counted .
" i am certain i will be reelected , " he said in typical confidence , hoping to revive austrian 's faith in him .
rallying support from nationalists playing up his image as the hero of the " little people , " haider took to the campaign trail , traveling throughout the mountainous state , an entourage of yoddelers and dirndl dressed alpine beauties accompanying him and helping to pass out stuffed animals , candy and other trinkets to supporters .
at every stop he pulled out the xenophobic rhetoric - righteous anger at immigrants who steal austrians ' jobs and receive welfare funding .
" those foreigners who do not work should not be allowed to benefit from state money to the detriment of hard-working austrians , " he said in the small town of villach on thursday .
and the response was loud applause .
the nationalism goes down well in the largely rural province .
haider 's no-holds-barred campaigning in the last several weeks has helped him gain points in the polls , which show him trailing behind the spö but still way ahead of the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- of chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
as for haider 's main competition , spö candidate peter ambrozy , the local press describes him as " lacking in charm " - hardly surprising compared to the charismatic incumbent .
but that might not be enough to put haider in the lead .
a return to national politics ?
in characteristic haider fashion , the extremes lie close together : whereas a loss on sunday would most likely spell the end of his political future , a reelection could be a ticket to a national comeback .
haider himself has already said he would use a victory in carinthia as a springboard for jumping back into federal politics .
in 2000 , after he led the fpö into the national government , he withdrew from vienna and gave up his party leadership .
since then the fpö has remained a part of the ruling coalition with schüssel 's övp , but has suffered a rapid decline in support .
from the record 27 percent of votes it received in 2000 , backing for the party has dwindled down to about 10 percent .
" i want to revive the fpö from carinthia , " haider repeated in campaign speeches throughout the state .
a thorn in vienna 's south haider 's loss in the southern state could therefore turn out to be vienna 's gain .
considered hard to control and a sworn enemy of schüssel , haider 's xenophobic outbursts and political scandal riled the european union so much that it slapped six months of sanctions on austria in 2000 after the fpö entered the national government .
since retreating from vienna , haider has continued accumulating a bad track record of embarrassing austria with his brash populism .
in december he shocked the international community by saying that morally there was little difference between u.s. president george w. bush and saddam hussein , a remark he still refuses to retract .
" hitler too arrived in power democratically , " in 1933 , he reminds reporters while politicians in vienna shift uncomfortably on their seats and hope haider 's provocative statements and nationalist populism deter rather than attract voters this time around . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no surprises as haider u-turns again in a move that reflects his favored leisure activity , austria 's most infamous bungee-jumper jörg haider has bounced back from his decision to quit politics to continue his controversial career .

he 's been busy pulling out his trademark populist tactics , but it might not be enough to get him reelected when his home state of carinthia goes to the polls on sunday . jörg haider is in for the fight of his life .
when polls open in sunday in the southern austrian state of carinthia , the far-right populist will be hoping he can hold onto his position as governor .
for the enfant terrible of the alpine republic , the election will make or break his political career .
based on opinion surveys , the 54-year old politician is in for a tough challenge from the socialist party -lrb- spö -rrb- , which is leading with the support of 39 percent of voters compared to haider 's freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- with 36 percent .
a recent poll conducted by the newsmagazine format shows that less than half of all austrians believe in haider 's chances of reelection .
in the face of such statistics , the future looks pretty dim for the former fpö party leader .
but haider refuses to admit defeat before the last vote has been counted .
" i am certain i will be reelected , " he said in typical confidence , hoping to revive austrian 's faith in him .
rallying support from nationalists playing up his image as the hero of the " little people , " haider took to the campaign trail , traveling throughout the mountainous state , an entourage of yoddelers and dirndl dressed alpine beauties accompanying him and helping to pass out stuffed animals , candy and other trinkets to supporters .
at every stop he pulled out the xenophobic rhetoric - righteous anger at immigrants who steal austrians ' jobs and receive welfare funding .
" those foreigners who do not work should not be allowed to benefit from state money to the detriment of hard-working austrians , " he said in the small town of villach on thursday .
and the response was loud applause .
the nationalism goes down well in the largely rural province .
haider 's no-holds-barred campaigning in the last several weeks has helped him gain points in the polls , which show him trailing behind the spö but still way ahead of the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- of chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
as for haider 's main competition , spö candidate peter ambrozy , the local press describes him as " lacking in charm " - hardly surprising compared to the charismatic incumbent .
but that might not be enough to put haider in the lead .
a return to national politics ?
in characteristic haider fashion , the extremes lie close together : whereas a loss on sunday would most likely spell the end of his political future , a reelection could be a ticket to a national comeback .
haider himself has already said he would use a victory in carinthia as a springboard for jumping back into federal politics .
in 2000 , after he led the fpö into the national government , he withdrew from vienna and gave up his party leadership .
since then the fpö has remained a part of the ruling coalition with schüssel 's övp , but has suffered a rapid decline in support .
from the record 27 percent of votes it received in 2000 , backing for the party has dwindled down to about 10 percent .
" i want to revive the fpö from carinthia , " haider repeated in campaign speeches throughout the state .
a thorn in vienna 's south haider 's loss in the southern state could therefore turn out to be vienna 's gain .
considered hard to control and a sworn enemy of schüssel , haider 's xenophobic outbursts and political scandal riled the european union so much that it slapped six months of sanctions on austria in 2000 after the fpö entered the national government .
since retreating from vienna , haider has continued accumulating a bad track record of embarrassing austria with his brash populism .
in december he shocked the international community by saying that morally there was little difference between u.s. president george w. bush and saddam hussein , a remark he still refuses to retract .
" hitler too arrived in power democratically , " in 1933 , he reminds reporters while politicians in vienna shift uncomfortably on their seats and hope haider 's provocative statements and nationalist populism deter rather than attract voters this time around . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no surprises as haider u-turns again in a move that reflects his favored leisure activity , austria 's most infamous bungee-jumper jörg haider has bounced back from his decision to quit politics to continue his controversial career .

berlin will not put forth a new candidate for the top post of the international monetary fund after the current head , horst köhler , announced he would step down to pursue a nomination as germany 's next president . according to reports out of berlin , germany will not insist on filling the vacancy at the top of the imf with one of its own .
after köhler accepted the candidacy for the country 's presidency , the german government on friday was quick to ensure its european neighbors and the rest of the world that it would not put forth another candidate .
a german successor at the imf would have no chance of acceptance , given the strong resistance from other european governments , a spokesperson for the berlin government told spiegel magazine .
typically , europe places the head of the imf while the united states selects the head of the world bank .
" it 's a gentleman 's agreement , " barbara böttcher , head of the economic and european policy issues team at deutsche bank research in frankfurt , told dw-world , but she also added that it was unlikely europe would agree to another german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler announced he would step down as managing director of the imf on march 4 , 2004 .
admitting that it will take a while before the imf finds a replacement , böttcher said it was a real shame that köhler was pulled out of his post at the imf .
" it is really unfortunate that the germans have , or think they have , so few capable people that they have to take köhler out of this position , which is after all one of the highest diplomatic representations that a german holds internationally , in order to become president . "
no german , but a european at any rate although no names have been confirmed yet , frenchman jean lemierre , who succeeded köhler as president of the european bank for reconstruction and development , has been named .
other possible candidates in the rumor mill are spanish finance minister rodrigo rato , as well as britain 's powerful finance minister chancellor gordon brown .
the search for a new managing director will not only stir up conflicting interests within europe , but it will almost certainly rekindle the debate from 2000 when köhler came into office .
at that time developing countries and many asian nations criticized the tradition of europe presenting a candidate as outdated and repeatedly called to end the u.s.-european hegemony .
european commission president romano prodi , however , said he is " deeply convinced that another european should take up the position , considering the very important economic weight which europe and the european union represents on the international stage .

it was a full 2.8 seconds faster than last year 's qualifier .
" i 'm very pleased , " the german ferrari pilot said after the race .
saturday was also a one-two victory for ferrari as teammate rubens barrichello from brazil came in second , only 74 thousandths of a second slower than schumi .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.03.2004 austria 's jörg haider fights for his future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider is campaigning to stay in the political spotlight the alpine firebrand is fighting for survival .
he 's been busy pulling out his trademark populist tactics , but it might not be enough to get him reelected when his home state of carinthia goes to the polls on sunday . jörg haider is in for the fight of his life .
when polls open in sunday in the southern austrian state of carinthia , the far-right populist will be hoping he can hold onto his position as governor .
for the enfant terrible of the alpine republic , the election will make or break his political career .
based on opinion surveys , the 54-year old politician is in for a tough challenge from the socialist party -lrb- spö -rrb- , which is leading with the support of 39 percent of voters compared to haider 's freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- with 36 percent .
a recent poll conducted by the newsmagazine format shows that less than half of all austrians believe in haider 's chances of reelection .
in the face of such statistics , the future looks pretty dim for the former fpö party leader .
but haider refuses to admit defeat before the last vote has been counted .
" i am certain i will be reelected , " he said in typical confidence , hoping to revive austrian 's faith in him .
rallying support from nationalists playing up his image as the hero of the " little people , " haider took to the campaign trail , traveling throughout the mountainous state , an entourage of yoddelers and dirndl dressed alpine beauties accompanying him and helping to pass out stuffed animals , candy and other trinkets to supporters .
at every stop he pulled out the xenophobic rhetoric - righteous anger at immigrants who steal austrians ' jobs and receive welfare funding .
" those foreigners who do not work should not be allowed to benefit from state money to the detriment of hard-working austrians , " he said in the small town of villach on thursday .
and the response was loud applause .
the nationalism goes down well in the largely rural province .
haider 's no-holds-barred campaigning in the last several weeks has helped him gain points in the polls , which show him trailing behind the spö but still way ahead of the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- of chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
as for haider 's main competition , spö candidate peter ambrozy , the local press describes him as " lacking in charm " - hardly surprising compared to the charismatic incumbent .
but that might not be enough to put haider in the lead .
a return to national politics ?
in characteristic haider fashion , the extremes lie close together : whereas a loss on sunday would most likely spell the end of his political future , a reelection could be a ticket to a national comeback .
haider himself has already said he would use a victory in carinthia as a springboard for jumping back into federal politics .
in 2000 , after he led the fpö into the national government , he withdrew from vienna and gave up his party leadership .
since then the fpö has remained a part of the ruling coalition with schüssel 's övp , but has suffered a rapid decline in support .
from the record 27 percent of votes it received in 2000 , backing for the party has dwindled down to about 10 percent .
" i want to revive the fpö from carinthia , " haider repeated in campaign speeches throughout the state .
a thorn in vienna 's south haider 's loss in the southern state could therefore turn out to be vienna 's gain .
considered hard to control and a sworn enemy of schüssel , haider 's xenophobic outbursts and political scandal riled the european union so much that it slapped six months of sanctions on austria in 2000 after the fpö entered the national government .
since retreating from vienna , haider has continued accumulating a bad track record of embarrassing austria with his brash populism .
in december he shocked the international community by saying that morally there was little difference between u.s. president george w. bush and saddam hussein , a remark he still refuses to retract .
" hitler too arrived in power democratically , " in 1933 , he reminds reporters while politicians in vienna shift uncomfortably on their seats and hope haider 's provocative statements and nationalist populism deter rather than attract voters this time around . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no surprises as haider u-turns again in a move that reflects his favored leisure activity , austria 's most infamous bungee-jumper jörg haider has bounced back from his decision to quit politics to continue his controversial career .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.03.2004 german tradesmen look east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu expansion could mean work for german companies who want it as the countdown for eu expansion continues , many small and medium-sized german companies are growing increasingly fearful of the impending competition from across the borders .
but some firms can hardly wait . with ten new countries entering the european union on may 1 , there 's potentially a lot of work for those german companies who are game enough to go and find it .
one such outfit is the mould construction and plastic processing company wolf & liegel situated in the southern german town of schwabach .
in the works hall , huge plastic injection machines pound away , shaping and creating plastic car parts with such conviction that it is hard to imagine the struggle many automobile manufacturers are currently facing .
indeed , manager klaus wolf says his company is revving up , and is set to accelerate this summer when they open a new production plant close to the skoda car manufacturer in the czech republic .
wolf , who is a great believer in increasing profit through low wages , is hoping that the labor situation at the new plant will balance out the costs at home .
" we 're hoping to do a kind of mixed calculation and to get more contracts from clients who are not already on our books in schwabach , " he told deutsche welle .
although they have n't even opened yet , wolf says his company already has a confirmed turnover of € 5 million -lrb- $ 6.19 million -rrb- from the new plant , which is perhaps not surprising given the staggeringly low wage costs .
in the czech republic , the hourly rate for employees working in the car supply service is just € 5 an hour , whereas in germany , trained employees can command up to € 40 an hour .
complex customs regulations in the southern german town of ansbach , paintbrush manufacturer feurer is just as keen to see the 1st of may roll around , but for slightly different reasons .
manager thomas hackenberger and his company , which survives on the exports of its high quality ' kolibri ' artists ' paintbrushes , is tired of running the gauntlet of customs procedures to get his product exported to eastern europe .
the removal of the cumbersome customs conditions spells ease of trade for the company , and hackenberger hopes this will boost turnover .
as it stands , in order to send goods to poland and the czech republic , he first has to fill out export documents to be certified by german customs officials before the goods can be dispatched to the target country .
once they arrive , the story continues .
" the goods are taken to the customs office responsible for a given region .
our customers then go to the customs office with their papers .
before they are given the goods , they have to pay the import tax , " says hackenberger , who believes the whole process is poison for client relations .
staying at home although there is doubtless a myriad of opportunities just waiting to present itself , many small and mid-size german companies work on a regional level , and are either skeptical of , or not greatly interested in eu expansion .
the cheap competition from across the border is their greatest fear .
with low wage and production costs , businesses in the new eu neighbors could potentially threaten long-established german companies by pulling away clients and contracts .
but the wider belief - especially among more internationally-oriented companies - is that there 's a lot of work to be done in the new member states , and someone is going to have to do it .
there are roads to be repaired and public buildings to be restored , and for those german tradesmen who are n't shy of crossing the border , there are even eu funds especially earmarked for such reconstruction projects .
the expansion process could thus prove profitable in the end . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu countries fear mass migration from the east british prime minister tony blair has said he might join an increasing number of eu countries that want to initially bar low-cost workers from new european union countries from working in the west .

as the formula one season kicks off , six-time champion michael schumacher is the one to watch .
securing the pole position on saturday , the german ferrari pilot poses the ultimate challenge for barrichello and montoya . the 2004 formula one season picked up where the last one left off - with a victory lap by michael schumacher .
the six-time world champion put in his best time ever on saturday to qualify for pole position in the season opener in melbourne , australia .
clocked at 1:24.404 minutes for the just over five kilometer track , schumacher secured his 56th pole start in his career .
it was a full 2.8 seconds faster than last year 's qualifier .
" i 'm very pleased , " the german ferrari pilot said after the race .
saturday was also a one-two victory for ferrari as teammate rubens barrichello from brazil came in second , only 74 thousandths of a second slower than schumi .
it is the fourth consecutive time the two drivers will be starting side by side in the front row for the australian grand prix .
hot on shumi 's tail behind the ferrari pilots will be the colombian juan pablo montoya starting for williams-bmw in third position and jenson button from england for bar-honda .
the spaniard fernando alonso -lrb- renault -rrb- and australian mark webber -lrb- jaguar-cosworth -rrb- will start in row three .

montoya , whom some have tipped as the contender for the driver 's title in 2004 , will be hot on schumi 's tail when the cars race around melbourne 's albert park track on sunday .
he finished third in the overall championship last year and is revving for a chance to take on the germans .
his bmw teammate and schumi 's brother ralf had to settle for eighth spot on the starting grid .
the surprise outcome in saturday 's line-up was the fourth place seating for the young jenson button .
more disappointing was kimi räikönnen 's 10th place finish for mclaren-mercedes .
the deputy world champion was 1.889 seconds behind michael schumacher , but was confident of pulling ahead in the actual race on sunday .
" let 's wait and see what the race brings , " mercedes motor sports director norbert haug said .

he 's been busy pulling out his trademark populist tactics , but it might not be enough to get him reelected when his home state of carinthia goes to the polls on sunday . jörg haider is in for the fight of his life .
when polls open in sunday in the southern austrian state of carinthia , the far-right populist will be hoping he can hold onto his position as governor .
for the enfant terrible of the alpine republic , the election will make or break his political career .
based on opinion surveys , the 54-year old politician is in for a tough challenge from the socialist party -lrb- spö -rrb- , which is leading with the support of 39 percent of voters compared to haider 's freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- with 36 percent .
a recent poll conducted by the newsmagazine format shows that less than half of all austrians believe in haider 's chances of reelection .
in the face of such statistics , the future looks pretty dim for the former fpö party leader .
but haider refuses to admit defeat before the last vote has been counted .
" i am certain i will be reelected , " he said in typical confidence , hoping to revive austrian 's faith in him .
rallying support from nationalists playing up his image as the hero of the " little people , " haider took to the campaign trail , traveling throughout the mountainous state , an entourage of yoddelers and dirndl dressed alpine beauties accompanying him and helping to pass out stuffed animals , candy and other trinkets to supporters .
at every stop he pulled out the xenophobic rhetoric - righteous anger at immigrants who steal austrians ' jobs and receive welfare funding .
" those foreigners who do not work should not be allowed to benefit from state money to the detriment of hard-working austrians , " he said in the small town of villach on thursday .
and the response was loud applause .
the nationalism goes down well in the largely rural province .
haider 's no-holds-barred campaigning in the last several weeks has helped him gain points in the polls , which show him trailing behind the spö but still way ahead of the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- of chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
as for haider 's main competition , spö candidate peter ambrozy , the local press describes him as " lacking in charm " - hardly surprising compared to the charismatic incumbent .
but that might not be enough to put haider in the lead .
a return to national politics ?
in characteristic haider fashion , the extremes lie close together : whereas a loss on sunday would most likely spell the end of his political future , a reelection could be a ticket to a national comeback .
haider himself has already said he would use a victory in carinthia as a springboard for jumping back into federal politics .
in 2000 , after he led the fpö into the national government , he withdrew from vienna and gave up his party leadership .
since then the fpö has remained a part of the ruling coalition with schüssel 's övp , but has suffered a rapid decline in support .
from the record 27 percent of votes it received in 2000 , backing for the party has dwindled down to about 10 percent .
" i want to revive the fpö from carinthia , " haider repeated in campaign speeches throughout the state .
a thorn in vienna 's south haider 's loss in the southern state could therefore turn out to be vienna 's gain .
considered hard to control and a sworn enemy of schüssel , haider 's xenophobic outbursts and political scandal riled the european union so much that it slapped six months of sanctions on austria in 2000 after the fpö entered the national government .
since retreating from vienna , haider has continued accumulating a bad track record of embarrassing austria with his brash populism .
in december he shocked the international community by saying that morally there was little difference between u.s. president george w. bush and saddam hussein , a remark he still refuses to retract .
" hitler too arrived in power democratically , " in 1933 , he reminds reporters while politicians in vienna shift uncomfortably on their seats and hope haider 's provocative statements and nationalist populism deter rather than attract voters this time around . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no surprises as haider u-turns again in a move that reflects his favored leisure activity , austria 's most infamous bungee-jumper jörg haider has bounced back from his decision to quit politics to continue his controversial career .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.03.2004 german tradesmen look east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu expansion could mean work for german companies who want it as the countdown for eu expansion continues , many small and medium-sized german companies are growing increasingly fearful of the impending competition from across the borders .
but some firms can hardly wait . with ten new countries entering the european union on may 1 , there 's potentially a lot of work for those german companies who are game enough to go and find it .
one such outfit is the mould construction and plastic processing company wolf & liegel situated in the southern german town of schwabach .
in the works hall , huge plastic injection machines pound away , shaping and creating plastic car parts with such conviction that it is hard to imagine the struggle many automobile manufacturers are currently facing .
indeed , manager klaus wolf says his company is revving up , and is set to accelerate this summer when they open a new production plant close to the skoda car manufacturer in the czech republic .
wolf , who is a great believer in increasing profit through low wages , is hoping that the labor situation at the new plant will balance out the costs at home .
" we 're hoping to do a kind of mixed calculation and to get more contracts from clients who are not already on our books in schwabach , " he told deutsche welle .
although they have n't even opened yet , wolf says his company already has a confirmed turnover of € 5 million -lrb- $ 6.19 million -rrb- from the new plant , which is perhaps not surprising given the staggeringly low wage costs .
in the czech republic , the hourly rate for employees working in the car supply service is just € 5 an hour , whereas in germany , trained employees can command up to € 40 an hour .
complex customs regulations in the southern german town of ansbach , paintbrush manufacturer feurer is just as keen to see the 1st of may roll around , but for slightly different reasons .
manager thomas hackenberger and his company , which survives on the exports of its high quality ' kolibri ' artists ' paintbrushes , is tired of running the gauntlet of customs procedures to get his product exported to eastern europe .
the removal of the cumbersome customs conditions spells ease of trade for the company , and hackenberger hopes this will boost turnover .
as it stands , in order to send goods to poland and the czech republic , he first has to fill out export documents to be certified by german customs officials before the goods can be dispatched to the target country .
once they arrive , the story continues .
" the goods are taken to the customs office responsible for a given region .
our customers then go to the customs office with their papers .
before they are given the goods , they have to pay the import tax , " says hackenberger , who believes the whole process is poison for client relations .
staying at home although there is doubtless a myriad of opportunities just waiting to present itself , many small and mid-size german companies work on a regional level , and are either skeptical of , or not greatly interested in eu expansion .
the cheap competition from across the border is their greatest fear .
with low wage and production costs , businesses in the new eu neighbors could potentially threaten long-established german companies by pulling away clients and contracts .
but the wider belief - especially among more internationally-oriented companies - is that there 's a lot of work to be done in the new member states , and someone is going to have to do it .
there are roads to be repaired and public buildings to be restored , and for those german tradesmen who are n't shy of crossing the border , there are even eu funds especially earmarked for such reconstruction projects .
the expansion process could thus prove profitable in the end . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu countries fear mass migration from the east british prime minister tony blair has said he might join an increasing number of eu countries that want to initially bar low-cost workers from new european union countries from working in the west .

he 's been busy pulling out his trademark populist tactics , but it might not be enough to get him reelected when his home state of carinthia goes to the polls on sunday . jörg haider is in for the fight of his life .
when polls open in sunday in the southern austrian state of carinthia , the far-right populist will be hoping he can hold onto his position as governor .
for the enfant terrible of the alpine republic , the election will make or break his political career .
based on opinion surveys , the 54-year old politician is in for a tough challenge from the socialist party -lrb- spö -rrb- , which is leading with the support of 39 percent of voters compared to haider 's freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- with 36 percent .
a recent poll conducted by the newsmagazine format shows that less than half of all austrians believe in haider 's chances of reelection .
in the face of such statistics , the future looks pretty dim for the former fpö party leader .
but haider refuses to admit defeat before the last vote has been counted .
" i am certain i will be reelected , " he said in typical confidence , hoping to revive austrian 's faith in him .
rallying support from nationalists playing up his image as the hero of the " little people , " haider took to the campaign trail , traveling throughout the mountainous state , an entourage of yoddelers and dirndl dressed alpine beauties accompanying him and helping to pass out stuffed animals , candy and other trinkets to supporters .

he 's been busy pulling out his trademark populist tactics , but it might not be enough to get him reelected when his home state of carinthia goes to the polls on sunday . jörg haider is in for the fight of his life .
when polls open in sunday in the southern austrian state of carinthia , the far-right populist will be hoping he can hold onto his position as governor .
for the enfant terrible of the alpine republic , the election will make or break his political career .
based on opinion surveys , the 54-year old politician is in for a tough challenge from the socialist party -lrb- spö -rrb- , which is leading with the support of 39 percent of voters compared to haider 's freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- with 36 percent .
a recent poll conducted by the newsmagazine format shows that less than half of all austrians believe in haider 's chances of reelection .
in the face of such statistics , the future looks pretty dim for the former fpö party leader .
but haider refuses to admit defeat before the last vote has been counted .
" i am certain i will be reelected , " he said in typical confidence , hoping to revive austrian 's faith in him .
rallying support from nationalists playing up his image as the hero of the " little people , " haider took to the campaign trail , traveling throughout the mountainous state , an entourage of yoddelers and dirndl dressed alpine beauties accompanying him and helping to pass out stuffed animals , candy and other trinkets to supporters .
at every stop he pulled out the xenophobic rhetoric - righteous anger at immigrants who steal austrians ' jobs and receive welfare funding .
" those foreigners who do not work should not be allowed to benefit from state money to the detriment of hard-working austrians , " he said in the small town of villach on thursday .
and the response was loud applause .
the nationalism goes down well in the largely rural province .
haider 's no-holds-barred campaigning in the last several weeks has helped him gain points in the polls , which show him trailing behind the spö but still way ahead of the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- of chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
as for haider 's main competition , spö candidate peter ambrozy , the local press describes him as " lacking in charm " - hardly surprising compared to the charismatic incumbent .
but that might not be enough to put haider in the lead .
a return to national politics ?
in characteristic haider fashion , the extremes lie close together : whereas a loss on sunday would most likely spell the end of his political future , a reelection could be a ticket to a national comeback .
haider himself has already said he would use a victory in carinthia as a springboard for jumping back into federal politics .
in 2000 , after he led the fpö into the national government , he withdrew from vienna and gave up his party leadership .
since then the fpö has remained a part of the ruling coalition with schüssel 's övp , but has suffered a rapid decline in support .
from the record 27 percent of votes it received in 2000 , backing for the party has dwindled down to about 10 percent .
" i want to revive the fpö from carinthia , " haider repeated in campaign speeches throughout the state .
a thorn in vienna 's south haider 's loss in the southern state could therefore turn out to be vienna 's gain .
considered hard to control and a sworn enemy of schüssel , haider 's xenophobic outbursts and political scandal riled the european union so much that it slapped six months of sanctions on austria in 2000 after the fpö entered the national government .
since retreating from vienna , haider has continued accumulating a bad track record of embarrassing austria with his brash populism .
in december he shocked the international community by saying that morally there was little difference between u.s. president george w. bush and saddam hussein , a remark he still refuses to retract .
" hitler too arrived in power democratically , " in 1933 , he reminds reporters while politicians in vienna shift uncomfortably on their seats and hope haider 's provocative statements and nationalist populism deter rather than attract voters this time around . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no surprises as haider u-turns again in a move that reflects his favored leisure activity , austria 's most infamous bungee-jumper jörg haider has bounced back from his decision to quit politics to continue his controversial career .

berlin will not put forth a new candidate for the top post of the international monetary fund after the current head , horst köhler , announced he would step down to pursue a nomination as germany 's next president . according to reports out of berlin , germany will not insist on filling the vacancy at the top of the imf with one of its own .

" it is really unfortunate that the germans have , or think they have , so few capable people that they have to take köhler out of this position , which is after all one of the highest diplomatic representations that a german holds internationally , in order to become president . "

the search for a new managing director will not only stir up conflicting interests within europe , but it will almost certainly rekindle the debate from 2000 when köhler came into office .
at that time developing countries and many asian nations criticized the tradition of europe presenting a candidate as outdated and repeatedly called to end the u.s.-european hegemony .

the six-time world champion put in his best time ever on saturday to qualify for pole position in the season opener in melbourne , australia .
clocked at 1:24.404 minutes for the just over five kilometer track , schumacher secured his 56th pole start in his career .
it was a full 2.8 seconds faster than last year 's qualifier .
" i 'm very pleased , " the german ferrari pilot said after the race .
saturday was also a one-two victory for ferrari as teammate rubens barrichello from brazil came in second , only 74 thousandths of a second slower than schumi .
it is the fourth consecutive time the two drivers will be starting side by side in the front row for the australian grand prix .
hot on shumi 's tail behind the ferrari pilots will be the colombian juan pablo montoya starting for williams-bmw in third position and jenson button from england for bar-honda .

berlin will not put forth a new candidate for the top post of the international monetary fund after the current head , horst köhler , announced he would step down to pursue a nomination as germany 's next president . according to reports out of berlin , germany will not insist on filling the vacancy at the top of the imf with one of its own .
after köhler accepted the candidacy for the country 's presidency , the german government on friday was quick to ensure its european neighbors and the rest of the world that it would not put forth another candidate .
a german successor at the imf would have no chance of acceptance , given the strong resistance from other european governments , a spokesperson for the berlin government told spiegel magazine .
typically , europe places the head of the imf while the united states selects the head of the world bank .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler announced he would step down as managing director of the imf on march 4 , 2004 .
admitting that it will take a while before the imf finds a replacement , böttcher said it was a real shame that köhler was pulled out of his post at the imf .
" it is really unfortunate that the germans have , or think they have , so few capable people that they have to take köhler out of this position , which is after all one of the highest diplomatic representations that a german holds internationally , in order to become president . "
no german , but a european at any rate although no names have been confirmed yet , frenchman jean lemierre , who succeeded köhler as president of the european bank for reconstruction and development , has been named .
other possible candidates in the rumor mill are spanish finance minister rodrigo rato , as well as britain 's powerful finance minister chancellor gordon brown .
the search for a new managing director will not only stir up conflicting interests within europe , but it will almost certainly rekindle the debate from 2000 when köhler came into office .
at that time developing countries and many asian nations criticized the tradition of europe presenting a candidate as outdated and repeatedly called to end the u.s.-european hegemony .

as the formula one season kicks off , six-time champion michael schumacher is the one to watch .
securing the pole position on saturday , the german ferrari pilot poses the ultimate challenge for barrichello and montoya . the 2004 formula one season picked up where the last one left off - with a victory lap by michael schumacher .
the six-time world champion put in his best time ever on saturday to qualify for pole position in the season opener in melbourne , australia .
clocked at 1:24.404 minutes for the just over five kilometer track , schumacher secured his 56th pole start in his career .
it was a full 2.8 seconds faster than last year 's qualifier .
" i 'm very pleased , " the german ferrari pilot said after the race .
saturday was also a one-two victory for ferrari as teammate rubens barrichello from brazil came in second , only 74 thousandths of a second slower than schumi .
it is the fourth consecutive time the two drivers will be starting side by side in the front row for the australian grand prix .
hot on shumi 's tail behind the ferrari pilots will be the colombian juan pablo montoya starting for williams-bmw in third position and jenson button from england for bar-honda .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombia 's juan pablo montoya for williams-bmw .
montoya , whom some have tipped as the contender for the driver 's title in 2004 , will be hot on schumi 's tail when the cars race around melbourne 's albert park track on sunday .
he finished third in the overall championship last year and is revving for a chance to take on the germans .
his bmw teammate and schumi 's brother ralf had to settle for eighth spot on the starting grid .
the surprise outcome in saturday 's line-up was the fourth place seating for the young jenson button .
more disappointing was kimi räikönnen 's 10th place finish for mclaren-mercedes .
the deputy world champion was 1.889 seconds behind michael schumacher , but was confident of pulling ahead in the actual race on sunday .
" let 's wait and see what the race brings , " mercedes motor sports director norbert haug said .

visiting germany and want to hit the mat ?
here 's where to go . yoga has long since been transformed from a flaky pursuit of ex-hippies into one of the west 's most pervasive fitness trends . throw a stone on any new york or los angeles street , and it seems you 'll hit someone on the way to a yoga class , exercise mat in tow .
stars such as madonna , sting and gwyneth paltrow have praised its virtues ; and new yoga studios are sprouting up in u.s. cities like mushrooms after a rain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bikram yoga trend started in the us now , the sport 's rocketing popularity has crossed the ocean .
in all its styles and variations , germans ca n't seem to get enough of yoga . boom times kumud schramm , spokeswoman for germany 's yoga teachers ' association , says that more than three million germans do yoga on a regular basis , and there are more than 8,000 teachers in the country who serve them . " we 're really experiencing a boom in yoga , " schramm recently told focus magazine .
" our lives are hectic , demanding , and take us to the limits of our physical and psychological limits .
people are seeking quiet , relaxation , and a look inside themselves .
that 's what they get with yoga . " germany 's latest fitness trend has its roots in a 3,500 year old system which seeks to join the body and mind , using breathing techniques and meditation mixed with a series of physical postures , or asanas .
the asanas promote strength , flexibility and balance , and different postures are said to be beneficial for different internal organs as well as body functions . fitness craze bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fine art of yoga the first german yoga studio opened in berlin in 1937 .
there was a surge of recognition in the 1960s and ' 70s , especially among young people seeking transcendental experiences . today , however , yoga has moved more into the mainstream , and its focus is often just as much physical fitness as mental well-being .
yoga today is just as often seen as a good workout or a relaxation method as a stop on the road to enlightenment . anyone interested in checking out the sport should first think about what they want to get out of it , and then see which type of yoga is best suited for them . iyengar yoga , developed by indian yogi bks iyengar , is a low-key , technique-oriented style best suited for older or injured students .
power yoga and its ascetic cousin ashtanga are flowing-style yoga that offers a heavy duty cardiovascular workout and require - or build - stamina and muscle strength .
bikram is a series of postures taught in a superheated room -lrb- around 40 degrees celsius , or 100 fahrenheit , -rrb- in order to promote sweating and blood flow .
sivananda is classical style of postures that focuses heavily on meditation , while kriya might be right for the person on a spiritual path . classes in english bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yoga is n't just for women whether in germany on business or pleasure , an english-speaking visitor who wants to check out a class or pursue an ongoing practice will face a wide range of options , especially in the larger cities .
a surprising number of classes are offered in english -lrb- and a surprising number of the teachers in germany are americans or brits who have made a business of importing their passion for the sport . -rrb-
the yoga scene tends to be an international one , and english is its lingua franca . many regular fitness studios offer trial or visitor passes that allow access to a whole range of fitness classes , yoga included .
and of course , more and more studios devoted solely to yoga - usually teaching one of the styles mentioned above - are opening all the time . want to find a yoga class in germany that 's right for you ?
here are dw-world.de 's top five yoga picks . berlin : moveo : the studio is on the cutting edge of the yoga trend .
in berlin 's kreuzberg district , moveo prides itself on offering an extremely wide array of class styles , from ashtanga to iyengar to pre- and post-natal .
check out the café , sauna and massage offerings . hamburg : bikram yoga studio hamburg opened in 1999 , is the first in germany to have offered yoga classes in this increasingly popular style .
also called ' hot yoga ' because classes are held in superheated rooms , the better to promote healing , bikram yoga was developed by bikram choudhoury , an indian who teaches in los angeles . frankfurt : balance yoga in downtown frankfurt , opened just last year , offers drop-in classes in english in various styles . munich : jivamukti .
based on a new york-style offshoot of flowing ashtanga yoga , often set to pulsing modern music . jivamukti incorporates philosophy , strength training , and spirituality . cologne : lord vishnu 's couch .
three young women , two of whom studied in the u.s. , opened this power yoga oriented studio last year . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de forget yoga , try yodeling switzerland may not be especially famous for producing world class composers or rock bands , but that does n't mean the swiss do n't love music .

visiting germany and want to hit the mat ?
here 's where to go . yoga has long since been transformed from a flaky pursuit of ex-hippies into one of the west 's most pervasive fitness trends . throw a stone on any new york or los angeles street , and it seems you 'll hit someone on the way to a yoga class , exercise mat in tow .
stars such as madonna , sting and gwyneth paltrow have praised its virtues ; and new yoga studios are sprouting up in u.s. cities like mushrooms after a rain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bikram yoga trend started in the us now , the sport 's rocketing popularity has crossed the ocean .
in all its styles and variations , germans ca n't seem to get enough of yoga . boom times kumud schramm , spokeswoman for germany 's yoga teachers ' association , says that more than three million germans do yoga on a regular basis , and there are more than 8,000 teachers in the country who serve them . " we 're really experiencing a boom in yoga , " schramm recently told focus magazine .
" our lives are hectic , demanding , and take us to the limits of our physical and psychological limits .
people are seeking quiet , relaxation , and a look inside themselves .
that 's what they get with yoga . " germany 's latest fitness trend has its roots in a 3,500 year old system which seeks to join the body and mind , using breathing techniques and meditation mixed with a series of physical postures , or asanas .
the asanas promote strength , flexibility and balance , and different postures are said to be beneficial for different internal organs as well as body functions . fitness craze bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fine art of yoga the first german yoga studio opened in berlin in 1937 .
there was a surge of recognition in the 1960s and ' 70s , especially among young people seeking transcendental experiences . today , however , yoga has moved more into the mainstream , and its focus is often just as much physical fitness as mental well-being .
yoga today is just as often seen as a good workout or a relaxation method as a stop on the road to enlightenment . anyone interested in checking out the sport should first think about what they want to get out of it , and then see which type of yoga is best suited for them . iyengar yoga , developed by indian yogi bks iyengar , is a low-key , technique-oriented style best suited for older or injured students .
power yoga and its ascetic cousin ashtanga are flowing-style yoga that offers a heavy duty cardiovascular workout and require - or build - stamina and muscle strength .
bikram is a series of postures taught in a superheated room -lrb- around 40 degrees celsius , or 100 fahrenheit , -rrb- in order to promote sweating and blood flow .
sivananda is classical style of postures that focuses heavily on meditation , while kriya might be right for the person on a spiritual path . classes in english bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yoga is n't just for women whether in germany on business or pleasure , an english-speaking visitor who wants to check out a class or pursue an ongoing practice will face a wide range of options , especially in the larger cities .
a surprising number of classes are offered in english -lrb- and a surprising number of the teachers in germany are americans or brits who have made a business of importing their passion for the sport . -rrb-
the yoga scene tends to be an international one , and english is its lingua franca . many regular fitness studios offer trial or visitor passes that allow access to a whole range of fitness classes , yoga included .
and of course , more and more studios devoted solely to yoga - usually teaching one of the styles mentioned above - are opening all the time . want to find a yoga class in germany that 's right for you ?
here are dw-world.de 's top five yoga picks . berlin : moveo : the studio is on the cutting edge of the yoga trend .

after receiving an official request from belgium , germany now says it is considering sending a military contingent to the democratic republic of congo to aid european soldiers currently operating there . on friday the german defense ministry confirmed earlier reports it had been asked by belgian military officials to send a stabilization force of army officers to the central african country .
a spokesman for the ministry said the request was being seriously considered but a final decision was still open .
defense minister peter struck has indicated he will agree to belgium 's request on the condition that parliamentary backing is not necessary to launch the mission , according to a report in the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper on saturday .
in the majority of cases , the decision to send german troops abroad hinges on parliamentary approval .

defence minister peter struck is second from right , interior minister otto schily is at right .
last july germany participated in an eu-led peacekeeping mission to the heavily embattled eastern provinces of congo , but contribution was limited to logistical aid for other forces already operating on the ground .
although the mandate passed through parliament with a clear majority , berlin balked at approving further german involvement and the mission was limited to 350 soldiers and a two-month mandate without renewal .
united nations peacekeeping troops took over after the europeans left and have been struggling to maintain peace in the region since september 2003 .

since then a new unity government has been established and is now engaged in rebuilding the country 's main institutions , including the military .
as a former colonial power , belgium agreed last month to train part of the new congolese army and sent 200 soldiers to provide assistance .
the requested german officers are intended to help provide more expertise in this area .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.03.2004 austria 's jörg haider fights for his future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider is campaigning to stay in the political spotlight the alpine firebrand is fighting for survival .
he 's been busy pulling out his trademark populist tactics , but it might not be enough to get him reelected when his home state of carinthia goes to the polls on sunday . jörg haider is in for the fight of his life .
when polls open in sunday in the southern austrian state of carinthia , the far-right populist will be hoping he can hold onto his position as governor .
for the enfant terrible of the alpine republic , the election will make or break his political career .
based on opinion surveys , the 54-year old politician is in for a tough challenge from the socialist party -lrb- spö -rrb- , which is leading with the support of 39 percent of voters compared to haider 's freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- with 36 percent .
a recent poll conducted by the newsmagazine format shows that less than half of all austrians believe in haider 's chances of reelection .
in the face of such statistics , the future looks pretty dim for the former fpö party leader .
but haider refuses to admit defeat before the last vote has been counted .
" i am certain i will be reelected , " he said in typical confidence , hoping to revive austrian 's faith in him .
rallying support from nationalists playing up his image as the hero of the " little people , " haider took to the campaign trail , traveling throughout the mountainous state , an entourage of yoddelers and dirndl dressed alpine beauties accompanying him and helping to pass out stuffed animals , candy and other trinkets to supporters .
at every stop he pulled out the xenophobic rhetoric - righteous anger at immigrants who steal austrians ' jobs and receive welfare funding .
" those foreigners who do not work should not be allowed to benefit from state money to the detriment of hard-working austrians , " he said in the small town of villach on thursday .
and the response was loud applause .
the nationalism goes down well in the largely rural province .
haider 's no-holds-barred campaigning in the last several weeks has helped him gain points in the polls , which show him trailing behind the spö but still way ahead of the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- of chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
as for haider 's main competition , spö candidate peter ambrozy , the local press describes him as " lacking in charm " - hardly surprising compared to the charismatic incumbent .
but that might not be enough to put haider in the lead .
a return to national politics ?
in characteristic haider fashion , the extremes lie close together : whereas a loss on sunday would most likely spell the end of his political future , a reelection could be a ticket to a national comeback .
haider himself has already said he would use a victory in carinthia as a springboard for jumping back into federal politics .
in 2000 , after he led the fpö into the national government , he withdrew from vienna and gave up his party leadership .
since then the fpö has remained a part of the ruling coalition with schüssel 's övp , but has suffered a rapid decline in support .
from the record 27 percent of votes it received in 2000 , backing for the party has dwindled down to about 10 percent .
" i want to revive the fpö from carinthia , " haider repeated in campaign speeches throughout the state .
a thorn in vienna 's south haider 's loss in the southern state could therefore turn out to be vienna 's gain .
considered hard to control and a sworn enemy of schüssel , haider 's xenophobic outbursts and political scandal riled the european union so much that it slapped six months of sanctions on austria in 2000 after the fpö entered the national government .
since retreating from vienna , haider has continued accumulating a bad track record of embarrassing austria with his brash populism .
in december he shocked the international community by saying that morally there was little difference between u.s. president george w. bush and saddam hussein , a remark he still refuses to retract .
" hitler too arrived in power democratically , " in 1933 , he reminds reporters while politicians in vienna shift uncomfortably on their seats and hope haider 's provocative statements and nationalist populism deter rather than attract voters this time around . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no surprises as haider u-turns again in a move that reflects his favored leisure activity , austria 's most infamous bungee-jumper jörg haider has bounced back from his decision to quit politics to continue his controversial career .

based on opinion surveys , the 54-year old politician is in for a tough challenge from the socialist party -lrb- spö -rrb- , which is leading with the support of 39 percent of voters compared to haider 's freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- with 36 percent .
a recent poll conducted by the newsmagazine format shows that less than half of all austrians believe in haider 's chances of reelection .
in the face of such statistics , the future looks pretty dim for the former fpö party leader .
but haider refuses to admit defeat before the last vote has been counted .
" i am certain i will be reelected , " he said in typical confidence , hoping to revive austrian 's faith in him .
rallying support from nationalists playing up his image as the hero of the " little people , " haider took to the campaign trail , traveling throughout the mountainous state , an entourage of yoddelers and dirndl dressed alpine beauties accompanying him and helping to pass out stuffed animals , candy and other trinkets to supporters .
at every stop he pulled out the xenophobic rhetoric - righteous anger at immigrants who steal austrians ' jobs and receive welfare funding .
" those foreigners who do not work should not be allowed to benefit from state money to the detriment of hard-working austrians , " he said in the small town of villach on thursday .
and the response was loud applause .
the nationalism goes down well in the largely rural province .
haider 's no-holds-barred campaigning in the last several weeks has helped him gain points in the polls , which show him trailing behind the spö but still way ahead of the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- of chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
as for haider 's main competition , spö candidate peter ambrozy , the local press describes him as " lacking in charm " - hardly surprising compared to the charismatic incumbent .
but that might not be enough to put haider in the lead .
a return to national politics ?
in characteristic haider fashion , the extremes lie close together : whereas a loss on sunday would most likely spell the end of his political future , a reelection could be a ticket to a national comeback .
haider himself has already said he would use a victory in carinthia as a springboard for jumping back into federal politics .
in 2000 , after he led the fpö into the national government , he withdrew from vienna and gave up his party leadership .
since then the fpö has remained a part of the ruling coalition with schüssel 's övp , but has suffered a rapid decline in support .
from the record 27 percent of votes it received in 2000 , backing for the party has dwindled down to about 10 percent .
" i want to revive the fpö from carinthia , " haider repeated in campaign speeches throughout the state .
a thorn in vienna 's south haider 's loss in the southern state could therefore turn out to be vienna 's gain .
considered hard to control and a sworn enemy of schüssel , haider 's xenophobic outbursts and political scandal riled the european union so much that it slapped six months of sanctions on austria in 2000 after the fpö entered the national government .
since retreating from vienna , haider has continued accumulating a bad track record of embarrassing austria with his brash populism .
in december he shocked the international community by saying that morally there was little difference between u.s. president george w. bush and saddam hussein , a remark he still refuses to retract .
" hitler too arrived in power democratically , " in 1933 , he reminds reporters while politicians in vienna shift uncomfortably on their seats and hope haider 's provocative statements and nationalist populism deter rather than attract voters this time around . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no surprises as haider u-turns again in a move that reflects his favored leisure activity , austria 's most infamous bungee-jumper jörg haider has bounced back from his decision to quit politics to continue his controversial career .

visiting germany and want to hit the mat ?
here 's where to go . yoga has long since been transformed from a flaky pursuit of ex-hippies into one of the west 's most pervasive fitness trends . throw a stone on any new york or los angeles street , and it seems you 'll hit someone on the way to a yoga class , exercise mat in tow .
stars such as madonna , sting and gwyneth paltrow have praised its virtues ; and new yoga studios are sprouting up in u.s. cities like mushrooms after a rain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bikram yoga trend started in the us now , the sport 's rocketing popularity has crossed the ocean .
in all its styles and variations , germans ca n't seem to get enough of yoga . boom times kumud schramm , spokeswoman for germany 's yoga teachers ' association , says that more than three million germans do yoga on a regular basis , and there are more than 8,000 teachers in the country who serve them . " we 're really experiencing a boom in yoga , " schramm recently told focus magazine .
" our lives are hectic , demanding , and take us to the limits of our physical and psychological limits .
people are seeking quiet , relaxation , and a look inside themselves .
that 's what they get with yoga . " germany 's latest fitness trend has its roots in a 3,500 year old system which seeks to join the body and mind , using breathing techniques and meditation mixed with a series of physical postures , or asanas .
the asanas promote strength , flexibility and balance , and different postures are said to be beneficial for different internal organs as well as body functions . fitness craze bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fine art of yoga the first german yoga studio opened in berlin in 1937 .
there was a surge of recognition in the 1960s and ' 70s , especially among young people seeking transcendental experiences . today , however , yoga has moved more into the mainstream , and its focus is often just as much physical fitness as mental well-being .
yoga today is just as often seen as a good workout or a relaxation method as a stop on the road to enlightenment . anyone interested in checking out the sport should first think about what they want to get out of it , and then see which type of yoga is best suited for them . iyengar yoga , developed by indian yogi bks iyengar , is a low-key , technique-oriented style best suited for older or injured students .
power yoga and its ascetic cousin ashtanga are flowing-style yoga that offers a heavy duty cardiovascular workout and require - or build - stamina and muscle strength .
bikram is a series of postures taught in a superheated room -lrb- around 40 degrees celsius , or 100 fahrenheit , -rrb- in order to promote sweating and blood flow .
sivananda is classical style of postures that focuses heavily on meditation , while kriya might be right for the person on a spiritual path . classes in english bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yoga is n't just for women whether in germany on business or pleasure , an english-speaking visitor who wants to check out a class or pursue an ongoing practice will face a wide range of options , especially in the larger cities .
a surprising number of classes are offered in english -lrb- and a surprising number of the teachers in germany are americans or brits who have made a business of importing their passion for the sport . -rrb-
the yoga scene tends to be an international one , and english is its lingua franca . many regular fitness studios offer trial or visitor passes that allow access to a whole range of fitness classes , yoga included .
and of course , more and more studios devoted solely to yoga - usually teaching one of the styles mentioned above - are opening all the time . want to find a yoga class in germany that 's right for you ?
here are dw-world.de 's top five yoga picks . berlin : moveo : the studio is on the cutting edge of the yoga trend .
in berlin 's kreuzberg district , moveo prides itself on offering an extremely wide array of class styles , from ashtanga to iyengar to pre- and post-natal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.03.2004 austria 's jörg haider fights for his future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider is campaigning to stay in the political spotlight the alpine firebrand is fighting for survival .
he 's been busy pulling out his trademark populist tactics , but it might not be enough to get him reelected when his home state of carinthia goes to the polls on sunday . jörg haider is in for the fight of his life .
when polls open in sunday in the southern austrian state of carinthia , the far-right populist will be hoping he can hold onto his position as governor .
for the enfant terrible of the alpine republic , the election will make or break his political career .
based on opinion surveys , the 54-year old politician is in for a tough challenge from the socialist party -lrb- spö -rrb- , which is leading with the support of 39 percent of voters compared to haider 's freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- with 36 percent .
a recent poll conducted by the newsmagazine format shows that less than half of all austrians believe in haider 's chances of reelection .
in the face of such statistics , the future looks pretty dim for the former fpö party leader .
but haider refuses to admit defeat before the last vote has been counted .
" i am certain i will be reelected , " he said in typical confidence , hoping to revive austrian 's faith in him .
rallying support from nationalists playing up his image as the hero of the " little people , " haider took to the campaign trail , traveling throughout the mountainous state , an entourage of yoddelers and dirndl dressed alpine beauties accompanying him and helping to pass out stuffed animals , candy and other trinkets to supporters .
at every stop he pulled out the xenophobic rhetoric - righteous anger at immigrants who steal austrians ' jobs and receive welfare funding .
" those foreigners who do not work should not be allowed to benefit from state money to the detriment of hard-working austrians , " he said in the small town of villach on thursday .
and the response was loud applause .
the nationalism goes down well in the largely rural province .
haider 's no-holds-barred campaigning in the last several weeks has helped him gain points in the polls , which show him trailing behind the spö but still way ahead of the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- of chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
as for haider 's main competition , spö candidate peter ambrozy , the local press describes him as " lacking in charm " - hardly surprising compared to the charismatic incumbent .
but that might not be enough to put haider in the lead .
a return to national politics ?
in characteristic haider fashion , the extremes lie close together : whereas a loss on sunday would most likely spell the end of his political future , a reelection could be a ticket to a national comeback .
haider himself has already said he would use a victory in carinthia as a springboard for jumping back into federal politics .
in 2000 , after he led the fpö into the national government , he withdrew from vienna and gave up his party leadership .
since then the fpö has remained a part of the ruling coalition with schüssel 's övp , but has suffered a rapid decline in support .
from the record 27 percent of votes it received in 2000 , backing for the party has dwindled down to about 10 percent .
" i want to revive the fpö from carinthia , " haider repeated in campaign speeches throughout the state .
a thorn in vienna 's south haider 's loss in the southern state could therefore turn out to be vienna 's gain .
considered hard to control and a sworn enemy of schüssel , haider 's xenophobic outbursts and political scandal riled the european union so much that it slapped six months of sanctions on austria in 2000 after the fpö entered the national government .
since retreating from vienna , haider has continued accumulating a bad track record of embarrassing austria with his brash populism .
in december he shocked the international community by saying that morally there was little difference between u.s. president george w. bush and saddam hussein , a remark he still refuses to retract .
" hitler too arrived in power democratically , " in 1933 , he reminds reporters while politicians in vienna shift uncomfortably on their seats and hope haider 's provocative statements and nationalist populism deter rather than attract voters this time around . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no surprises as haider u-turns again in a move that reflects his favored leisure activity , austria 's most infamous bungee-jumper jörg haider has bounced back from his decision to quit politics to continue his controversial career .

berlin will not put forth a new candidate for the top post of the international monetary fund after the current head , horst köhler , announced he would step down to pursue a nomination as germany 's next president . according to reports out of berlin , germany will not insist on filling the vacancy at the top of the imf with one of its own .
after köhler accepted the candidacy for the country 's presidency , the german government on friday was quick to ensure its european neighbors and the rest of the world that it would not put forth another candidate .
a german successor at the imf would have no chance of acceptance , given the strong resistance from other european governments , a spokesperson for the berlin government told spiegel magazine .
typically , europe places the head of the imf while the united states selects the head of the world bank .

admitting that it will take a while before the imf finds a replacement , böttcher said it was a real shame that köhler was pulled out of his post at the imf .
" it is really unfortunate that the germans have , or think they have , so few capable people that they have to take köhler out of this position , which is after all one of the highest diplomatic representations that a german holds internationally , in order to become president . "

other possible candidates in the rumor mill are spanish finance minister rodrigo rato , as well as britain 's powerful finance minister chancellor gordon brown .
the search for a new managing director will not only stir up conflicting interests within europe , but it will almost certainly rekindle the debate from 2000 when köhler came into office .
at that time developing countries and many asian nations criticized the tradition of europe presenting a candidate as outdated and repeatedly called to end the u.s.-european hegemony .

visiting germany and want to hit the mat ?
here 's where to go . yoga has long since been transformed from a flaky pursuit of ex-hippies into one of the west 's most pervasive fitness trends . throw a stone on any new york or los angeles street , and it seems you 'll hit someone on the way to a yoga class , exercise mat in tow .
stars such as madonna , sting and gwyneth paltrow have praised its virtues ; and new yoga studios are sprouting up in u.s. cities like mushrooms after a rain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bikram yoga trend started in the us now , the sport 's rocketing popularity has crossed the ocean .
in all its styles and variations , germans ca n't seem to get enough of yoga . boom times kumud schramm , spokeswoman for germany 's yoga teachers ' association , says that more than three million germans do yoga on a regular basis , and there are more than 8,000 teachers in the country who serve them . " we 're really experiencing a boom in yoga , " schramm recently told focus magazine .
" our lives are hectic , demanding , and take us to the limits of our physical and psychological limits .
people are seeking quiet , relaxation , and a look inside themselves .
that 's what they get with yoga . " germany 's latest fitness trend has its roots in a 3,500 year old system which seeks to join the body and mind , using breathing techniques and meditation mixed with a series of physical postures , or asanas .
the asanas promote strength , flexibility and balance , and different postures are said to be beneficial for different internal organs as well as body functions . fitness craze bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fine art of yoga the first german yoga studio opened in berlin in 1937 .
there was a surge of recognition in the 1960s and ' 70s , especially among young people seeking transcendental experiences . today , however , yoga has moved more into the mainstream , and its focus is often just as much physical fitness as mental well-being .
yoga today is just as often seen as a good workout or a relaxation method as a stop on the road to enlightenment . anyone interested in checking out the sport should first think about what they want to get out of it , and then see which type of yoga is best suited for them . iyengar yoga , developed by indian yogi bks iyengar , is a low-key , technique-oriented style best suited for older or injured students .
power yoga and its ascetic cousin ashtanga are flowing-style yoga that offers a heavy duty cardiovascular workout and require - or build - stamina and muscle strength .
bikram is a series of postures taught in a superheated room -lrb- around 40 degrees celsius , or 100 fahrenheit , -rrb- in order to promote sweating and blood flow .
sivananda is classical style of postures that focuses heavily on meditation , while kriya might be right for the person on a spiritual path . classes in english bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yoga is n't just for women whether in germany on business or pleasure , an english-speaking visitor who wants to check out a class or pursue an ongoing practice will face a wide range of options , especially in the larger cities .
a surprising number of classes are offered in english -lrb- and a surprising number of the teachers in germany are americans or brits who have made a business of importing their passion for the sport . -rrb-
the yoga scene tends to be an international one , and english is its lingua franca . many regular fitness studios offer trial or visitor passes that allow access to a whole range of fitness classes , yoga included .
and of course , more and more studios devoted solely to yoga - usually teaching one of the styles mentioned above - are opening all the time . want to find a yoga class in germany that 's right for you ?
here are dw-world.de 's top five yoga picks . berlin : moveo : the studio is on the cutting edge of the yoga trend .
in berlin 's kreuzberg district , moveo prides itself on offering an extremely wide array of class styles , from ashtanga to iyengar to pre- and post-natal .

berlin will not put forth a new candidate for the top post of the international monetary fund after the current head , horst köhler , announced he would step down to pursue a nomination as germany 's next president . according to reports out of berlin , germany will not insist on filling the vacancy at the top of the imf with one of its own .
after köhler accepted the candidacy for the country 's presidency , the german government on friday was quick to ensure its european neighbors and the rest of the world that it would not put forth another candidate .
a german successor at the imf would have no chance of acceptance , given the strong resistance from other european governments , a spokesperson for the berlin government told spiegel magazine .
typically , europe places the head of the imf while the united states selects the head of the world bank .
" it 's a gentleman 's agreement , " barbara böttcher , head of the economic and european policy issues team at deutsche bank research in frankfurt , told dw-world , but she also added that it was unlikely europe would agree to another german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler announced he would step down as managing director of the imf on march 4 , 2004 .
admitting that it will take a while before the imf finds a replacement , böttcher said it was a real shame that köhler was pulled out of his post at the imf .
" it is really unfortunate that the germans have , or think they have , so few capable people that they have to take köhler out of this position , which is after all one of the highest diplomatic representations that a german holds internationally , in order to become president . "
no german , but a european at any rate although no names have been confirmed yet , frenchman jean lemierre , who succeeded köhler as president of the european bank for reconstruction and development , has been named .
other possible candidates in the rumor mill are spanish finance minister rodrigo rato , as well as britain 's powerful finance minister chancellor gordon brown .
the search for a new managing director will not only stir up conflicting interests within europe , but it will almost certainly rekindle the debate from 2000 when köhler came into office .
at that time developing countries and many asian nations criticized the tradition of europe presenting a candidate as outdated and repeatedly called to end the u.s.-european hegemony .

after receiving an official request from belgium , germany now says it is considering sending a military contingent to the democratic republic of congo to aid european soldiers currently operating there . on friday the german defense ministry confirmed earlier reports it had been asked by belgian military officials to send a stabilization force of army officers to the central african country .
a spokesman for the ministry said the request was being seriously considered but a final decision was still open .
defense minister peter struck has indicated he will agree to belgium 's request on the condition that parliamentary backing is not necessary to launch the mission , according to a report in the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper on saturday .
in the majority of cases , the decision to send german troops abroad hinges on parliamentary approval .

defence minister peter struck is second from right , interior minister otto schily is at right .
last july germany participated in an eu-led peacekeeping mission to the heavily embattled eastern provinces of congo , but contribution was limited to logistical aid for other forces already operating on the ground .
although the mandate passed through parliament with a clear majority , berlin balked at approving further german involvement and the mission was limited to 350 soldiers and a two-month mandate without renewal .

stewart was found guilty of conspiracy , making false statements and obstruction of justice .
faced with a possible jail sentence , stewart said she was " distressed " by the jury 's verdict and would appeal .
one juror suggested the verdict sent a message to investment " bigwigs " that nobody was above the law .
" maybe it 's a victory for the little guys who lose money in the markets thanks to these kinds of transactions , " chappell hartridge said .
each charge against stewart carries up to five years in prison but legal experts say she is unlikely to receive the stiffest possible sentence .
sentencing has been set for 17 june .
appeal stewart 's former stockbroker , peter bacanovic , was found guilty of four of the five charges against him .
i will appeal the verdict and continue to fight to clear my name martha stewart he was acquitted of one charge of making a false statement .
charges of securities fraud against stewart and bacanovic , which carried a maximum 10-year jail term , had been dismissed last week .
" i am obviously distressed by the jury 's verdict but ...
i will appeal the verdict and continue to fight to clear my name , " stewart said in a statement on her website .
an earlier message said stewart was taking comfort " in knowing that i have done nothing wrong " but that was soon replaced .
share deal the charges centred on a sale by stewart of $ 228,000 worth of shares in imclone systems on 27 december 2001 .
the sale came a day before imclone announced that the us food and drug administration had not approved its anti-cancer drug , erbitux .
peter bacanovic was found guilty of four of the five charges against him the news led to a sharp fall in imclone 's shares .
stewart said that she had an agreement to sell shares in the company when the stock price fell below $ 60 .
but the government argued she sold the shares because she had been tipped off in advance about the fda announcement .
imclone 's chief executive sam waksal has admitted he sold shares ahead of the announcement and is serving a seven-year jail term for insider trading .
business threat martha stewart has become a household name in the us through her stable of books , magazines and tv shows .
her products give advice on how to eat , dress , marry , garden and entertain in greater style .
her success enabled her to build her company , martha stewart living omnimedia , into a powerful business .
stewart stepped down from the positions of chairman and chief executive last year when she was first charged , and she now holds the title of chief creative officer .
the company issued a statement saying it was " deeply saddened by the news of martha stewart 's conviction " .
" our board of directors will meet promptly to carefully evaluate the current situation and take actions as appropriate , " the firm said .
" we are confident that our assets ... are more than sufficient to continue mso 's development as a leading ' how to ' brand building company . "
analysts have speculated that the business could face a battle to survive given that it is so closely tied to stewart 's name .
on thursday , martha stewart living had revealed that the negative publicity surrounding the trial had hit revenues , with advertising pages at its main magazine down 35 % last year .

a new survey has revealed how scotland would like to see non-biodegradable products like disposable nappies taxed as a so-called " sin " to society .
nearly half of those surveyed -lrb- 47 % -rrb- believe gordon brown should place extra charges on the throwaway baby wear .
green issues dominated the top of the list with pesticides scoring the same percentage of the votes at 47 % .
fat tax and as the debate around the uk 's obesity problems continue scots suggested their own solution by asking the government to put a tax on unhealthy food fast food polled 36 % of the vote and was placed third on the " sin tax " list with 43 % of those aged between 16 and 24 in favour of such a charge .
top non-biodegradable household waste - 47 % pesticides - 47 % fast food takeaways - 36 % aerosol sprays - 35 % holiday homes - 25 % fast food ready meals - 17 % sweets and chocolate - 16 % slightly lower down the table came aerosol sprays with 35 % with just 16 % voting for a surcharge on sweets and chocolate .
the survey was conducted by tax advisers bdo stoy hayward and revealed whilst scottish taxpayers are prepared to pay some of the way for their sins they would also like to see businesses making their own contribution .
environmental problems again topped the list with 71 % of respondents saying companies should pay more for producing air pollution , 46 % voted for penalties for creating noise pollution while 44 % wanted to penalise those who used pesticides .
money issues sandy knox , tax partner for bdo stoy hayward in scotland , said : " scottish taxpayers appear to be happy to put their money where their mouths are on issues relating to health and the environment .
" they accept that a proportion of their income tax goes towards the nhs and ecological initiatives and appear to be willing to pay direct charges to help curb use of products that exacerbate problems for these services .

the foundations of a new " cyber-economy " are being laid in an attempt to halt an exodus of young people forced by plummeting farm incomes and low-salary tourism jobs to seek employment further afield .
key figures from local councils , the national park authority and a telecoms provider have this week agreed a plan to bring high-speed broadband internet access to the dales later this year .
the plan was drawn up by the richmondshire local strategic partnership , an independent group of community leaders who hope to lure home workers and small it-based businesses to the area with an irresistible cocktail of cutting-edge technology and a stunning environment .
bright ideas " we have to recognise the urgent need for different forms of employment here , " says the partnership 's chairman peter annison as he looks out across wensleydale from the office of his rope-making factory in hawes .
" tourism never produces a high-wage economy - it is part-year , part-time and part-paid .
" meanwhile , farm incomes are too low to attract young people , so you see a rapidly ageing population with fewer people taking part in an active economy .
we need desperately to have broadband to attract the people who are footloose in terms of where they live and work peter annison , local strategic partnership chairman " the areas of economic activity that seem most appropriate in a rural environment are knowledge-based businesses .
" there are lots of young people with bright ideas who would very much like to move into the countryside because of the quality of life here .
" but for them to operate successfully here we need desperately to have broadband to attract the people who are footloose in terms of where they live and work . "
broadband would also allow the development of a dales-specific " walled garden " network , providing tailor-made internet content for tourists and locals alike .
the network could be run by a co-operative and generate income for the local economy by charging users for access .
mr annison envisages holidaymakers with laptops or handheld computers accessing information such as virtual guided walks and up-to-the-minute local weather forecasts by buying a weekly access licence for a few pounds .
and dales inhabitants would benefit by tapping into an electronic reservoir of local news and community information .
once any teething problems are ironed out , the model for a rural broadband community could even be marketed and sold to other parts of the country facing similar problems .
with recent legislation freeing up radio frequencies to allow wireless broadband use in previously hard-to-reach rural areas , the high-tech vision for the dales has come at just the right time .
it also has the support of the national park authority , whose head of park management , john avison , says : " we are aware that for the park to be successful , it needs a vibrant local economy .
" we need to try and build opportunities for new business that are appropriate for the park and would support broadband in the park in principle . "
however , as the planning authority for the park , it would also have the final say on whether the radio masts needed for the wireless network could be built on strictly protected national park land .
housing crisis " we would view planning applications for masts on their individual merits but we are not opposed in principle , " he said .
employment opportunities offered by new technology are just one part of the strategic authority 's plan to manage the changing demographic of the dales .
if the sons and daughters of indigenous families are to remain in the area , the near-total lack of affordable housing must be urgently addressed .
both the national park authority and strategic partnership have put the housing problem at the top of their agendas .
" we can not build our way out of this problem because we ca n't have wall-to-wall housing that destroys the essence of the park , " said mr annison .
" so we have to be a bit more imaginative . "
plans are in place to bring broadband to the dales this year the partnership recently commissioned a feasibility study to find out how the gap between rocketing house prices and young people 's income could be bridged .
it has identified a shared-equity scheme , in which private investors contribute to the cost of buying a house , as a possible solution .
the study found that there were enough investors willing to put money in , enough properties in the right price bracket and enough young people who would take up the scheme to make it work .
" we 're hoping that within 12 to 18 months such a scheme will be operating , " said mr annison .
" that would allow us to partially deal with the problem of people being unable to afford to live here . "
the national park authority had been " hugely supportive " of the idea , he said .
" they are deeply concerned about the lack of affordable housing and have been extremely helpful in looking at ways to assist us .
local people face competition from those seeking holiday and second homes peter watson , national park head of planning peter watson , head of planning for the authority , says the problem is not a shortage of accommodation .
" there is now one house for every two residents - but the problem is soaring property prices .
three-bedroom semi-detached cottages in some villages are on the market for more than £ 200,000 , out of reach for many in a low-income area .
mr watson says they must look at ways of restricting the occupancy of new dwellings to local people .
" average wages here are below those in other parts of the country and local people face competition from those seeking holiday and second homes .
" we will continue to work closely with the local district councils and housing associations , who have responsibility for meeting the need for affordable housing , and assist them in whatever way we can . "

the foundations of a new " cyber-economy " are being laid in an attempt to halt an exodus of young people forced by plummeting farm incomes and low-salary tourism jobs to seek employment further afield .
key figures from local councils , the national park authority and a telecoms provider have this week agreed a plan to bring high-speed broadband internet access to the dales later this year .
the plan was drawn up by the richmondshire local strategic partnership , an independent group of community leaders who hope to lure home workers and small it-based businesses to the area with an irresistible cocktail of cutting-edge technology and a stunning environment .
bright ideas " we have to recognise the urgent need for different forms of employment here , " says the partnership 's chairman peter annison as he looks out across wensleydale from the office of his rope-making factory in hawes .
" tourism never produces a high-wage economy - it is part-year , part-time and part-paid .
" meanwhile , farm incomes are too low to attract young people , so you see a rapidly ageing population with fewer people taking part in an active economy .
we need desperately to have broadband to attract the people who are footloose in terms of where they live and work peter annison , local strategic partnership chairman " the areas of economic activity that seem most appropriate in a rural environment are knowledge-based businesses .
" there are lots of young people with bright ideas who would very much like to move into the countryside because of the quality of life here .
" but for them to operate successfully here we need desperately to have broadband to attract the people who are footloose in terms of where they live and work . "
broadband would also allow the development of a dales-specific " walled garden " network , providing tailor-made internet content for tourists and locals alike .
the network could be run by a co-operative and generate income for the local economy by charging users for access .
mr annison envisages holidaymakers with laptops or handheld computers accessing information such as virtual guided walks and up-to-the-minute local weather forecasts by buying a weekly access licence for a few pounds .
and dales inhabitants would benefit by tapping into an electronic reservoir of local news and community information .
once any teething problems are ironed out , the model for a rural broadband community could even be marketed and sold to other parts of the country facing similar problems .
with recent legislation freeing up radio frequencies to allow wireless broadband use in previously hard-to-reach rural areas , the high-tech vision for the dales has come at just the right time .
it also has the support of the national park authority , whose head of park management , john avison , says : " we are aware that for the park to be successful , it needs a vibrant local economy .
" we need to try and build opportunities for new business that are appropriate for the park and would support broadband in the park in principle . "
however , as the planning authority for the park , it would also have the final say on whether the radio masts needed for the wireless network could be built on strictly protected national park land .
housing crisis " we would view planning applications for masts on their individual merits but we are not opposed in principle , " he said .
employment opportunities offered by new technology are just one part of the strategic authority 's plan to manage the changing demographic of the dales .
if the sons and daughters of indigenous families are to remain in the area , the near-total lack of affordable housing must be urgently addressed .
both the national park authority and strategic partnership have put the housing problem at the top of their agendas .
" we can not build our way out of this problem because we ca n't have wall-to-wall housing that destroys the essence of the park , " said mr annison .
" so we have to be a bit more imaginative . "
plans are in place to bring broadband to the dales this year the partnership recently commissioned a feasibility study to find out how the gap between rocketing house prices and young people 's income could be bridged .
it has identified a shared-equity scheme , in which private investors contribute to the cost of buying a house , as a possible solution .
the study found that there were enough investors willing to put money in , enough properties in the right price bracket and enough young people who would take up the scheme to make it work .
" we 're hoping that within 12 to 18 months such a scheme will be operating , " said mr annison .
" that would allow us to partially deal with the problem of people being unable to afford to live here . "
the national park authority had been " hugely supportive " of the idea , he said .
" they are deeply concerned about the lack of affordable housing and have been extremely helpful in looking at ways to assist us .
local people face competition from those seeking holiday and second homes peter watson , national park head of planning peter watson , head of planning for the authority , says the problem is not a shortage of accommodation .
" there is now one house for every two residents - but the problem is soaring property prices .
three-bedroom semi-detached cottages in some villages are on the market for more than £ 200,000 , out of reach for many in a low-income area .
mr watson says they must look at ways of restricting the occupancy of new dwellings to local people .
" average wages here are below those in other parts of the country and local people face competition from those seeking holiday and second homes .
" we will continue to work closely with the local district councils and housing associations , who have responsibility for meeting the need for affordable housing , and assist them in whatever way we can . "

" tourism never produces a high-wage economy - it is part-year , part-time and part-paid .
" meanwhile , farm incomes are too low to attract young people , so you see a rapidly ageing population with fewer people taking part in an active economy .
we need desperately to have broadband to attract the people who are footloose in terms of where they live and work peter annison , local strategic partnership chairman " the areas of economic activity that seem most appropriate in a rural environment are knowledge-based businesses .
" there are lots of young people with bright ideas who would very much like to move into the countryside because of the quality of life here .
" but for them to operate successfully here we need desperately to have broadband to attract the people who are footloose in terms of where they live and work . "
broadband would also allow the development of a dales-specific " walled garden " network , providing tailor-made internet content for tourists and locals alike .
the network could be run by a co-operative and generate income for the local economy by charging users for access .
mr annison envisages holidaymakers with laptops or handheld computers accessing information such as virtual guided walks and up-to-the-minute local weather forecasts by buying a weekly access licence for a few pounds .
and dales inhabitants would benefit by tapping into an electronic reservoir of local news and community information .
once any teething problems are ironed out , the model for a rural broadband community could even be marketed and sold to other parts of the country facing similar problems .
with recent legislation freeing up radio frequencies to allow wireless broadband use in previously hard-to-reach rural areas , the high-tech vision for the dales has come at just the right time .
it also has the support of the national park authority , whose head of park management , john avison , says : " we are aware that for the park to be successful , it needs a vibrant local economy .
" we need to try and build opportunities for new business that are appropriate for the park and would support broadband in the park in principle . "
however , as the planning authority for the park , it would also have the final say on whether the radio masts needed for the wireless network could be built on strictly protected national park land .
housing crisis " we would view planning applications for masts on their individual merits but we are not opposed in principle , " he said .
employment opportunities offered by new technology are just one part of the strategic authority 's plan to manage the changing demographic of the dales .
if the sons and daughters of indigenous families are to remain in the area , the near-total lack of affordable housing must be urgently addressed .
both the national park authority and strategic partnership have put the housing problem at the top of their agendas .
" we can not build our way out of this problem because we ca n't have wall-to-wall housing that destroys the essence of the park , " said mr annison .
" so we have to be a bit more imaginative . "
plans are in place to bring broadband to the dales this year the partnership recently commissioned a feasibility study to find out how the gap between rocketing house prices and young people 's income could be bridged .
it has identified a shared-equity scheme , in which private investors contribute to the cost of buying a house , as a possible solution .
the study found that there were enough investors willing to put money in , enough properties in the right price bracket and enough young people who would take up the scheme to make it work .
" we 're hoping that within 12 to 18 months such a scheme will be operating , " said mr annison .
" that would allow us to partially deal with the problem of people being unable to afford to live here . "
the national park authority had been " hugely supportive " of the idea , he said .
" they are deeply concerned about the lack of affordable housing and have been extremely helpful in looking at ways to assist us .
local people face competition from those seeking holiday and second homes peter watson , national park head of planning peter watson , head of planning for the authority , says the problem is not a shortage of accommodation .
" there is now one house for every two residents - but the problem is soaring property prices .
three-bedroom semi-detached cottages in some villages are on the market for more than £ 200,000 , out of reach for many in a low-income area .
mr watson says they must look at ways of restricting the occupancy of new dwellings to local people .
" average wages here are below those in other parts of the country and local people face competition from those seeking holiday and second homes .
" we will continue to work closely with the local district councils and housing associations , who have responsibility for meeting the need for affordable housing , and assist them in whatever way we can . "
in the last 10 years planning permission has been approved for 1,100 dwellings , half of which have been barn conversions .
back in hawes , mr annison says he feels a bit like king canute trying to hold back the tide when he considers the complex implications of the increasingly rapid social change taking place in the dales .
but he adds : " we must buy a little time by managing this change to mitigate against the worst effects of unmanaged change . "

it has identified a shared-equity scheme , in which private investors contribute to the cost of buying a house , as a possible solution .
the study found that there were enough investors willing to put money in , enough properties in the right price bracket and enough young people who would take up the scheme to make it work .
" we 're hoping that within 12 to 18 months such a scheme will be operating , " said mr annison .

the foundations of a new " cyber-economy " are being laid in an attempt to halt an exodus of young people forced by plummeting farm incomes and low-salary tourism jobs to seek employment further afield .
key figures from local councils , the national park authority and a telecoms provider have this week agreed a plan to bring high-speed broadband internet access to the dales later this year .
the plan was drawn up by the richmondshire local strategic partnership , an independent group of community leaders who hope to lure home workers and small it-based businesses to the area with an irresistible cocktail of cutting-edge technology and a stunning environment .
bright ideas " we have to recognise the urgent need for different forms of employment here , " says the partnership 's chairman peter annison as he looks out across wensleydale from the office of his rope-making factory in hawes .
" tourism never produces a high-wage economy - it is part-year , part-time and part-paid .
" meanwhile , farm incomes are too low to attract young people , so you see a rapidly ageing population with fewer people taking part in an active economy .
we need desperately to have broadband to attract the people who are footloose in terms of where they live and work peter annison , local strategic partnership chairman " the areas of economic activity that seem most appropriate in a rural environment are knowledge-based businesses .
" there are lots of young people with bright ideas who would very much like to move into the countryside because of the quality of life here .
" but for them to operate successfully here we need desperately to have broadband to attract the people who are footloose in terms of where they live and work . "
broadband would also allow the development of a dales-specific " walled garden " network , providing tailor-made internet content for tourists and locals alike .
the network could be run by a co-operative and generate income for the local economy by charging users for access .
mr annison envisages holidaymakers with laptops or handheld computers accessing information such as virtual guided walks and up-to-the-minute local weather forecasts by buying a weekly access licence for a few pounds .
and dales inhabitants would benefit by tapping into an electronic reservoir of local news and community information .
once any teething problems are ironed out , the model for a rural broadband community could even be marketed and sold to other parts of the country facing similar problems .
with recent legislation freeing up radio frequencies to allow wireless broadband use in previously hard-to-reach rural areas , the high-tech vision for the dales has come at just the right time .
it also has the support of the national park authority , whose head of park management , john avison , says : " we are aware that for the park to be successful , it needs a vibrant local economy .
" we need to try and build opportunities for new business that are appropriate for the park and would support broadband in the park in principle . "
however , as the planning authority for the park , it would also have the final say on whether the radio masts needed for the wireless network could be built on strictly protected national park land .
housing crisis " we would view planning applications for masts on their individual merits but we are not opposed in principle , " he said .
employment opportunities offered by new technology are just one part of the strategic authority 's plan to manage the changing demographic of the dales .
if the sons and daughters of indigenous families are to remain in the area , the near-total lack of affordable housing must be urgently addressed .
both the national park authority and strategic partnership have put the housing problem at the top of their agendas .
" we can not build our way out of this problem because we ca n't have wall-to-wall housing that destroys the essence of the park , " said mr annison .

riding the boom is dangdang.com , the company hoping to become china 's version of the hugely popular amazon.com website in the west .
dangdang 's founder peggy yu argues that broadband internet in particular has had an explosive impact on the country , and many places with only intermittent access to needs such as heating and water were able to get online .
" people log onto the internet to stay connected with friends , people read news on the internet , and people use the internet to shop , " she told bbc world service 's the interview programme .
" everywhere we go there are good internet connections . "
no vested interests broadband has even become widespread in china 's remote northwest , such as xinjiang province . "
we were starting from scratch , so we have the opportunity to use the most up-to-the-minute technology " peggy yu ms yu said that recently she had visited her 88-year-old grandmother in the south of china .
she had no heating and her house was freezing cold , but she had internet access .
" that 's the kind of interesting picture here , " she said .
" on the one hand , a lot of things lag behind what they are like in western countries .
on the other , internet connection and internet usage is very prevalent . "
she added that people in china were able to simply able to log on at a telephone , type in any isp number , and get online .
ms yu said a lack of vested interests , such as cable and telephone companies , had allowed china 's rapid expansion in information technology .
" we were starting from scratch , so we have the opportunity to use the most up-to-the-minute technology , " she said .
people in china " crave " information , which has also fired the internet boom .
" when i came back to china , going through bookstores and trying to find what i wanted was such a headache , " she said .
" i just feel there has to be a place in the market .
if i create convenience for the consumers , they will want it . "
blocking interestingly , the majority of the site 's top 10 bestsellers are american self-help books , with titles like you have no excuse and seven habits of highly-effective people .
the front page currently promotes dvds of 24 and finding nemo .
in all , more than half of the books the site are translated titles from us .
dangdang is even allowed to sell george orwell 's allegory of communism , animal farm .
however , many are still vetted - hilary clinton 's recent autobiography had chapters removed by the authorities , for example .
and the authorities do maintain a strict watch on what people are able to download .
the chinese government has some of the most sophisticated blocking software in the world .
among the sites that have their content blocked is the bbc 's chinese website .
ms yu said that in her case , the authorities were more likely to hold the book publishers to account , rather than her site , over controversial content , such as references to tibet or taiwan .
she added that her way of dealing with bureaucracy and censorship in china 's constantly changing regulatory environment was to " never ask for permission , only for forgiveness afterwards . "
" we do whatever customers need , and what is right for the business .
" if that conflicts with certain regulations , we communicate with certain regulators , we come up with ways of complying with them after the event . "
she admitted she had been asked for bribes before , but had never given them .
some people wanted to see their product promoted on the site 's front page but she said that she had never received anything more extravagant than mooncakes .
she added that she thought of herself as an " amateur entrepreneur , making mistakes and still making progress . "
" the internet population is growing very fast , but to build dangdang from what it is today to the kind of company that has the kind of influence like amazon i think we still have a long way to go , " she conceded .
" there 's going to be a lot of tests ahead of us . "

denbigh hospital was bought at auction for £ 310,000 in 2002 after years of being subsidised by council tax payers .
now they will be able to have their say on the future of the grade ii- listed building which has fallen into disrepair in recent years and been vandalised .
the gothic style building has long been associated with mental health care in north east wales and patients from across the region used to be cared for there .
" there are no firm proposals in place at this time but the suggested preferred option could be a mix of employment , residential , community and leisure facilities on the site , " said county councillor mike german .
new houses " there would also be an effort to save the most historic parts of the listed building . "
before it was auctioned in 2002 , north wales health authority tried to sell the building but offers in the region of £ 1m were initially refused .
after years of delay it was eventually sold for £ 155,000 in 1999 to a lancashire businessman who planned to build a housing development on the 120-acre site .
however , gerald hitman ran into opposition from local people and the 1840 's listed building was left dormant until it was snapped up at auction by a businessman who still owns the property .
in an attempt to find a long-term future for the site and buildings , denbighshire council with the owners and other organisations to look at the options available .
the dates of the proposed exhibition for residents to see what is planned for the building are not yet known .
