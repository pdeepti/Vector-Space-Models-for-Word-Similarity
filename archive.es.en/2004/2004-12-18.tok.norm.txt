ever year , they donate some two billion euros , more than any other european country . in the days and weeks before christmas , ursula gerst receives a good deal of mail .
friends and relatives send greeting cards , and of course the insurance companies never forget to send bills for the new year .
but charities also write to the 77-year old , reminding her that christmas is a time to think of others and that the best way to do so is through donating a few euros to help out others less fortunate . “ i look at all their requests very carefully , ” she said .
“ and then i say to myself - because they keep writing and insisting – i really should donate something . ” it ’ s not a coincidence that charitable organizations increase their marketing efforts during the holiday season .
they know that germans are in the mood to give at this time of year .
of course , emotional pleas from wide-eyed and hungry children on television and posters help move even the stingiest grinch to donate money . give until it hurts despite a sputtering economy , rising unemployment and an overall financial insecurity at the moment , germans ’ willingness to spend money for a worthy cause is unbreakable .
in 2003 , they spent € 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- on charities , according to the central institute for social research . a quarter of all the money donated went towards culture and monument preservation as well as the protection of animals and the environment .
three-quarters – the greatest share of their donations - went towards humanitarian aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school project funded sos-kinderdorf in goma in the democratic republic of congo the chairman of the organization overseeing charities , bernd beder , said the catholic and protestant church were at the top of the list , followed by the sos-kinderdorf – an organization for the protection and welfare of children throughout the world – the red cross and the emergency aid service of the johanniter .
next on the list are the organizations caritas and unicef , world vision and various aid groups working with children . some 40 percent of all german adults donate money .
even if the amount spent varies greatly from person to person , statistics show that on average each spender donates € 66 every year to a good cause . but who are the people who year after year give money to help orphans in latin america or finance a school project in africa ?
the younger they are , the less they give ; and the older they are , the more generous they become , beder said . “ the older spenders contribute disproportionately more to the overall volume of donations , " he added .
" perhaps that ’ s a result of the older generations having more of a sense of charity ; but it could also simply be that older people have more money . ” contrary to an often heard rumor , women do not donate more than men .
beder said women may give to more charities more often , but the overall sum of their contributions is less – most likely owing to their generally lower incomes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those with less income realize how easy it is to slip below the poverty line and give to help others like cristine and her daughter pledano in haiti .
more interesting , he said , is the tendency among the poor to donate proportionately more than the wealthiest members of society , in terms of their financial resources . why donate ? there are some 500,000 registered organizations and approximately 12,000 foundations in germany .
nearly all of them are recorded as non-profitable .
that means , they can offer tax breaks for donations .
last year 7.5 million tax payers took advantage of the charitable donation clause to deduct from their tax payments , according to the federal statistics office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans give in the hopes of getting something back when they file their taxes but the revenue system and tax collectors don ’ t seem to be bothered by this loophole .
on the contrary , thomas hofmann , a cologne-based finance officer , said donations are actually good for the economy . “ when i donate money to a non-profitable organization , i help keep the charity afloat financially and it can build up its savings and doesn ’ t depend on state subsidies to survive , " he said .
" that ’ s one of the main reasons , why donations can be deducted from the taxes . ” that could also be another – albeit it less philanthropic – reason why germans like to donate more during the christmas season : they rediscover their charitable side just in time for a tax receipt to be written out for the next year ’ s tax forms . nadja baeva -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a supermarket for the poor shopping at a normal grocery store can sometimes push welfare recipients in germany to their financial limits .

but charities also write to the 77-year old , reminding her that christmas is a time to think of others and that the best way to do so is through donating a few euros to help out others less fortunate . “ i look at all their requests very carefully , ” she said .
“ and then i say to myself - because they keep writing and insisting – i really should donate something . ” it ’ s not a coincidence that charitable organizations increase their marketing efforts during the holiday season .
they know that germans are in the mood to give at this time of year .
of course , emotional pleas from wide-eyed and hungry children on television and posters help move even the stingiest grinch to donate money . give until it hurts despite a sputtering economy , rising unemployment and an overall financial insecurity at the moment , germans ’ willingness to spend money for a worthy cause is unbreakable .
in 2003 , they spent € 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- on charities , according to the central institute for social research . a quarter of all the money donated went towards culture and monument preservation as well as the protection of animals and the environment .
three-quarters – the greatest share of their donations - went towards humanitarian aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school project funded sos-kinderdorf in goma in the democratic republic of congo the chairman of the organization overseeing charities , bernd beder , said the catholic and protestant church were at the top of the list , followed by the sos-kinderdorf – an organization for the protection and welfare of children throughout the world – the red cross and the emergency aid service of the johanniter .
next on the list are the organizations caritas and unicef , world vision and various aid groups working with children . some 40 percent of all german adults donate money .
even if the amount spent varies greatly from person to person , statistics show that on average each spender donates € 66 every year to a good cause . but who are the people who year after year give money to help orphans in latin america or finance a school project in africa ?
the younger they are , the less they give ; and the older they are , the more generous they become , beder said . “ the older spenders contribute disproportionately more to the overall volume of donations , " he added .
" perhaps that ’ s a result of the older generations having more of a sense of charity ; but it could also simply be that older people have more money . ” contrary to an often heard rumor , women do not donate more than men .

more interesting , he said , is the tendency among the poor to donate proportionately more than the wealthiest members of society , in terms of their financial resources . why donate ? there are some 500,000 registered organizations and approximately 12,000 foundations in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.12.2004 -pipe- 12:00 utc german pop music gets political boost german lawmakers on friday passed a motion urging radio station to play more home-grown pop acts to support the domestic music industry .
the recommendation approved by parliament asks radio stations to dedicate at least 35 percent of their programming to german artists , with half of the quota featuring new bands or music .
unlike in france , where the language quota is a law , germany is only requesting a voluntary following .
nonetheless , the decision is an “ important signal to musicians in germany that they are important to us and we value their work , ” said antje vollmer , greens cultural affairs spokeswoman .
she said the move would lead to a more diversified radio output , more public exposure for new artists and would contribute to the revitalization of the music industry .
the german music business has been hit hard by declining profits and sales and has complained that radio stations play too much foreign music .
german public broadcaster ard , which runs television and radio stations , criticized parliament ’ s recommendation saying good music does not need a quota system to reach the airwaves .
authorities will check radio stations to make sure they are following the quota .
tighter laws could be implemented if needed , vollmer said . dw-world.de german radio quota debate goes live can a language quota help make german bands more popular ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.12.2004 -pipe- 15:00 utc berlin to limit immigration of russian jews germany plans to stop offering unlimited immigration to jews from russia and eastern europe starting jan .
1 , 2006 , according to several newspapers on saturday .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung cited a ministry official saying germany ’ s 16 states and federal government had agreed to draft new rules for jewish immigration .
the announcement would mean a reversal of the policy in effect since the collapse of the soviet union .
berlin began offering jews from the former soviet bloc the right to settle in the country in 1991 to help rebuild its own jewish communities .
by the end of 2003 , some 190,000 jews had taken up the offer to settle in germany .
but the fact that the number of the jewish immigrants coming to germany has exceeded those moving to israel from eastern europe has led to a policy rethink , according to the berliner zeitung .
the daily reported that around 9,400 ex-soviet jews were expected to come to germany this year , exceeding for the first time the number settling in israel by more than 1,000 .
the newspaper also said the berlin jewish community was under financial pressure because more than three-quarters of the immigrant jews were reliant on welfare payments .
new immigration rules will require potential immigrants to show knowledge of german and be under 45 years of age .
the applicants will also not be eligible for social aid , the berlin paper said . more briefs 18.12.2004 -pipe- next climate talks convene in germany 18.12.2004 -pipe- german pop music gets political boost 17.12.2004 -pipe- german federal reform fails 17.12.2004 -pipe- germany helps sweeten afghanistan 17.12.2004 -pipe- germany-based iraqis can vote 17.12.2004 -pipe- army officer arrested for corruption 17.12.2004 -pipe- spy gets probation in germany 16.12.2004 -pipe- soccer : germany beats japan 3-0 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

with some 320 million cups of coffee consumed daily , germany is the world ’ s second largest coffee-importing and drinking nation , after the us . of course the coffee empire of starbucks has gone a long way to boosting caffeine consumption and making coffee drinking cool among the younger crowd , shied away from traditional cafes with their stale interiors and gilded porcelain cups .

compared to hardcore narcotics and cigarettes , coffee is relatively harmless , but it can have its side effects and lead to addiction , say scientists , who report that caffeine is popping up everywhere . caffeine , the active ingredient in a cup of coffee is a dependency-inducing psychoactive drug , which is being consumed at increasing rates , say scientists in the latest addition of national geographic deutschland . long before they start experimenting with alcohol and cigarettes , children are getting exposed to addictions in the form of caffeine in cola and chocolate .
even before birth , babies are consuming caffeine through the womb from coffee-drinking mothers .
traces of the drug have been found in day-old infants , the scientists report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder gets a quick-fix of coffee during a long parliamentary debate as a stimulant , caffeine influences various mental and physical functions .
it also can be addictive .
a person who regularly drinks three cups of coffee , for instance , will require at least one cup in order for the brain to work in “ normal ” mode .
many people attest to the fact that they can ’ t fully wake up in the morning without a fresh brew . the majority of scientists and doctors are of the opinion , however , that one to two cups of coffee a day can not hurt anyone .
the intentional misuse of caffeine is seldom .
only in the field of sports , where the consumption of more than six cups of coffee is considered doping , are cases of caffeine drug abuse heard of . the drug of choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cofe bars are the trendy way to consume the brew given the prevalence of coffee and other caffeinated beverages in today ’ s society , it ’ s not surprising that nearly everyone consumes the stimulant .
in germany , coffee has far surpassed beer as the nation ’ s favorite beverage .
with some 320 million cups of coffee consumed daily , germany is the world ’ s second largest coffee-importing and drinking nation , after the us . of course the coffee empire of starbucks has gone a long way to boosting caffeine consumption and making coffee drinking cool among the younger crowd , shied away from traditional cafes with their stale interiors and gilded porcelain cups .
every day the seattle-based company opens up four new shops around the world and hires on 200 new employees . but caffeine is also popping up in places one normally wouldn ’ t expect : in pain killers , in sports drinks , even in women ’ s stockings . the textile industry is the latest to discover the benefits of caffeine for the production of nylons .

compared to hardcore narcotics and cigarettes , coffee is relatively harmless , but it can have its side effects and lead to addiction , say scientists , who report that caffeine is popping up everywhere . caffeine , the active ingredient in a cup of coffee is a dependency-inducing psychoactive drug , which is being consumed at increasing rates , say scientists in the latest addition of national geographic deutschland . long before they start experimenting with alcohol and cigarettes , children are getting exposed to addictions in the form of caffeine in cola and chocolate .
even before birth , babies are consuming caffeine through the womb from coffee-drinking mothers .
traces of the drug have been found in day-old infants , the scientists report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder gets a quick-fix of coffee during a long parliamentary debate as a stimulant , caffeine influences various mental and physical functions .
it also can be addictive .
a person who regularly drinks three cups of coffee , for instance , will require at least one cup in order for the brain to work in “ normal ” mode .
many people attest to the fact that they can ’ t fully wake up in the morning without a fresh brew . the majority of scientists and doctors are of the opinion , however , that one to two cups of coffee a day can not hurt anyone .
the intentional misuse of caffeine is seldom .
only in the field of sports , where the consumption of more than six cups of coffee is considered doping , are cases of caffeine drug abuse heard of . the drug of choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cofe bars are the trendy way to consume the brew given the prevalence of coffee and other caffeinated beverages in today ’ s society , it ’ s not surprising that nearly everyone consumes the stimulant .
in germany , coffee has far surpassed beer as the nation ’ s favorite beverage .
with some 320 million cups of coffee consumed daily , germany is the world ’ s second largest coffee-importing and drinking nation , after the us . of course the coffee empire of starbucks has gone a long way to boosting caffeine consumption and making coffee drinking cool among the younger crowd , shied away from traditional cafes with their stale interiors and gilded porcelain cups .
every day the seattle-based company opens up four new shops around the world and hires on 200 new employees . but caffeine is also popping up in places one normally wouldn ’ t expect : in pain killers , in sports drinks , even in women ’ s stockings . the textile industry is the latest to discover the benefits of caffeine for the production of nylons .

the recommendation approved by parliament asks radio stations to dedicate at least 35 percent of their programming to german artists , with half of the quota featuring new bands or music .
unlike in france , where the language quota is a law , germany is only requesting a voluntary following .
nonetheless , the decision is an “ important signal to musicians in germany that they are important to us and we value their work , ” said antje vollmer , greens cultural affairs spokeswoman .
she said the move would lead to a more diversified radio output , more public exposure for new artists and would contribute to the revitalization of the music industry .
the german music business has been hit hard by declining profits and sales and has complained that radio stations play too much foreign music .
german public broadcaster ard , which runs television and radio stations , criticized parliament ’ s recommendation saying good music does not need a quota system to reach the airwaves .
authorities will check radio stations to make sure they are following the quota .
tighter laws could be implemented if needed , vollmer said . dw-world.de german radio quota debate goes live can a language quota help make german bands more popular ?

ever year , they donate some two billion euros , more than any other european country . in the days and weeks before christmas , ursula gerst receives a good deal of mail .
friends and relatives send greeting cards , and of course the insurance companies never forget to send bills for the new year .
but charities also write to the 77-year old , reminding her that christmas is a time to think of others and that the best way to do so is through donating a few euros to help out others less fortunate . “ i look at all their requests very carefully , ” she said .
“ and then i say to myself - because they keep writing and insisting – i really should donate something . ” it ’ s not a coincidence that charitable organizations increase their marketing efforts during the holiday season .
they know that germans are in the mood to give at this time of year .
of course , emotional pleas from wide-eyed and hungry children on television and posters help move even the stingiest grinch to donate money . give until it hurts despite a sputtering economy , rising unemployment and an overall financial insecurity at the moment , germans ’ willingness to spend money for a worthy cause is unbreakable .
in 2003 , they spent € 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- on charities , according to the central institute for social research . a quarter of all the money donated went towards culture and monument preservation as well as the protection of animals and the environment .
three-quarters – the greatest share of their donations - went towards humanitarian aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school project funded sos-kinderdorf in goma in the democratic republic of congo the chairman of the organization overseeing charities , bernd beder , said the catholic and protestant church were at the top of the list , followed by the sos-kinderdorf – an organization for the protection and welfare of children throughout the world – the red cross and the emergency aid service of the johanniter .
next on the list are the organizations caritas and unicef , world vision and various aid groups working with children . some 40 percent of all german adults donate money .
even if the amount spent varies greatly from person to person , statistics show that on average each spender donates € 66 every year to a good cause . but who are the people who year after year give money to help orphans in latin america or finance a school project in africa ?
the younger they are , the less they give ; and the older they are , the more generous they become , beder said . “ the older spenders contribute disproportionately more to the overall volume of donations , " he added .
" perhaps that ’ s a result of the older generations having more of a sense of charity ; but it could also simply be that older people have more money . ” contrary to an often heard rumor , women do not donate more than men .
beder said women may give to more charities more often , but the overall sum of their contributions is less – most likely owing to their generally lower incomes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those with less income realize how easy it is to slip below the poverty line and give to help others like cristine and her daughter pledano in haiti .
more interesting , he said , is the tendency among the poor to donate proportionately more than the wealthiest members of society , in terms of their financial resources . why donate ? there are some 500,000 registered organizations and approximately 12,000 foundations in germany .
nearly all of them are recorded as non-profitable .
that means , they can offer tax breaks for donations .
last year 7.5 million tax payers took advantage of the charitable donation clause to deduct from their tax payments , according to the federal statistics office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans give in the hopes of getting something back when they file their taxes but the revenue system and tax collectors don ’ t seem to be bothered by this loophole .
on the contrary , thomas hofmann , a cologne-based finance officer , said donations are actually good for the economy . “ when i donate money to a non-profitable organization , i help keep the charity afloat financially and it can build up its savings and doesn ’ t depend on state subsidies to survive , " he said .
" that ’ s one of the main reasons , why donations can be deducted from the taxes . ” that could also be another – albeit it less philanthropic – reason why germans like to donate more during the christmas season : they rediscover their charitable side just in time for a tax receipt to be written out for the next year ’ s tax forms . nadja baeva -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a supermarket for the poor shopping at a normal grocery store can sometimes push welfare recipients in germany to their financial limits .

of course , emotional pleas from wide-eyed and hungry children on television and posters help move even the stingiest grinch to donate money . give until it hurts despite a sputtering economy , rising unemployment and an overall financial insecurity at the moment , germans ’ willingness to spend money for a worthy cause is unbreakable .
in 2003 , they spent € 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- on charities , according to the central institute for social research . a quarter of all the money donated went towards culture and monument preservation as well as the protection of animals and the environment .
three-quarters – the greatest share of their donations - went towards humanitarian aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school project funded sos-kinderdorf in goma in the democratic republic of congo the chairman of the organization overseeing charities , bernd beder , said the catholic and protestant church were at the top of the list , followed by the sos-kinderdorf – an organization for the protection and welfare of children throughout the world – the red cross and the emergency aid service of the johanniter .
next on the list are the organizations caritas and unicef , world vision and various aid groups working with children . some 40 percent of all german adults donate money .
even if the amount spent varies greatly from person to person , statistics show that on average each spender donates € 66 every year to a good cause . but who are the people who year after year give money to help orphans in latin america or finance a school project in africa ?
the younger they are , the less they give ; and the older they are , the more generous they become , beder said . “ the older spenders contribute disproportionately more to the overall volume of donations , " he added .
" perhaps that ’ s a result of the older generations having more of a sense of charity ; but it could also simply be that older people have more money . ” contrary to an often heard rumor , women do not donate more than men .
beder said women may give to more charities more often , but the overall sum of their contributions is less – most likely owing to their generally lower incomes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those with less income realize how easy it is to slip below the poverty line and give to help others like cristine and her daughter pledano in haiti .
more interesting , he said , is the tendency among the poor to donate proportionately more than the wealthiest members of society , in terms of their financial resources . why donate ? there are some 500,000 registered organizations and approximately 12,000 foundations in germany .
nearly all of them are recorded as non-profitable .
that means , they can offer tax breaks for donations .
last year 7.5 million tax payers took advantage of the charitable donation clause to deduct from their tax payments , according to the federal statistics office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans give in the hopes of getting something back when they file their taxes but the revenue system and tax collectors don ’ t seem to be bothered by this loophole .
on the contrary , thomas hofmann , a cologne-based finance officer , said donations are actually good for the economy . “ when i donate money to a non-profitable organization , i help keep the charity afloat financially and it can build up its savings and doesn ’ t depend on state subsidies to survive , " he said .
" that ’ s one of the main reasons , why donations can be deducted from the taxes . ” that could also be another – albeit it less philanthropic – reason why germans like to donate more during the christmas season : they rediscover their charitable side just in time for a tax receipt to be written out for the next year ’ s tax forms . nadja baeva -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a supermarket for the poor shopping at a normal grocery store can sometimes push welfare recipients in germany to their financial limits .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.12.2004 ' tis the season to give großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collection pots are fuller at this time of year as christmas approaches , germans reach deeper into their pockets to give to the poor .
ever year , they donate some two billion euros , more than any other european country . in the days and weeks before christmas , ursula gerst receives a good deal of mail .
friends and relatives send greeting cards , and of course the insurance companies never forget to send bills for the new year .
but charities also write to the 77-year old , reminding her that christmas is a time to think of others and that the best way to do so is through donating a few euros to help out others less fortunate . “ i look at all their requests very carefully , ” she said .
“ and then i say to myself - because they keep writing and insisting – i really should donate something . ” it ’ s not a coincidence that charitable organizations increase their marketing efforts during the holiday season .
they know that germans are in the mood to give at this time of year .
of course , emotional pleas from wide-eyed and hungry children on television and posters help move even the stingiest grinch to donate money . give until it hurts despite a sputtering economy , rising unemployment and an overall financial insecurity at the moment , germans ’ willingness to spend money for a worthy cause is unbreakable .
in 2003 , they spent € 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- on charities , according to the central institute for social research . a quarter of all the money donated went towards culture and monument preservation as well as the protection of animals and the environment .
three-quarters – the greatest share of their donations - went towards humanitarian aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school project funded sos-kinderdorf in goma in the democratic republic of congo the chairman of the organization overseeing charities , bernd beder , said the catholic and protestant church were at the top of the list , followed by the sos-kinderdorf – an organization for the protection and welfare of children throughout the world – the red cross and the emergency aid service of the johanniter .
next on the list are the organizations caritas and unicef , world vision and various aid groups working with children . some 40 percent of all german adults donate money .
even if the amount spent varies greatly from person to person , statistics show that on average each spender donates € 66 every year to a good cause . but who are the people who year after year give money to help orphans in latin america or finance a school project in africa ?
the younger they are , the less they give ; and the older they are , the more generous they become , beder said . “ the older spenders contribute disproportionately more to the overall volume of donations , " he added .
" perhaps that ’ s a result of the older generations having more of a sense of charity ; but it could also simply be that older people have more money . ” contrary to an often heard rumor , women do not donate more than men .
beder said women may give to more charities more often , but the overall sum of their contributions is less – most likely owing to their generally lower incomes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those with less income realize how easy it is to slip below the poverty line and give to help others like cristine and her daughter pledano in haiti .
more interesting , he said , is the tendency among the poor to donate proportionately more than the wealthiest members of society , in terms of their financial resources . why donate ? there are some 500,000 registered organizations and approximately 12,000 foundations in germany .
nearly all of them are recorded as non-profitable .
that means , they can offer tax breaks for donations .
last year 7.5 million tax payers took advantage of the charitable donation clause to deduct from their tax payments , according to the federal statistics office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans give in the hopes of getting something back when they file their taxes but the revenue system and tax collectors don ’ t seem to be bothered by this loophole .
on the contrary , thomas hofmann , a cologne-based finance officer , said donations are actually good for the economy . “ when i donate money to a non-profitable organization , i help keep the charity afloat financially and it can build up its savings and doesn ’ t depend on state subsidies to survive , " he said .
" that ’ s one of the main reasons , why donations can be deducted from the taxes . ” that could also be another – albeit it less philanthropic – reason why germans like to donate more during the christmas season : they rediscover their charitable side just in time for a tax receipt to be written out for the next year ’ s tax forms . nadja baeva -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a supermarket for the poor shopping at a normal grocery store can sometimes push welfare recipients in germany to their financial limits .

ever year , they donate some two billion euros , more than any other european country . in the days and weeks before christmas , ursula gerst receives a good deal of mail .
friends and relatives send greeting cards , and of course the insurance companies never forget to send bills for the new year .
but charities also write to the 77-year old , reminding her that christmas is a time to think of others and that the best way to do so is through donating a few euros to help out others less fortunate . “ i look at all their requests very carefully , ” she said .
“ and then i say to myself - because they keep writing and insisting – i really should donate something . ” it ’ s not a coincidence that charitable organizations increase their marketing efforts during the holiday season .
they know that germans are in the mood to give at this time of year .
of course , emotional pleas from wide-eyed and hungry children on television and posters help move even the stingiest grinch to donate money . give until it hurts despite a sputtering economy , rising unemployment and an overall financial insecurity at the moment , germans ’ willingness to spend money for a worthy cause is unbreakable .
in 2003 , they spent € 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- on charities , according to the central institute for social research . a quarter of all the money donated went towards culture and monument preservation as well as the protection of animals and the environment .
three-quarters – the greatest share of their donations - went towards humanitarian aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school project funded sos-kinderdorf in goma in the democratic republic of congo the chairman of the organization overseeing charities , bernd beder , said the catholic and protestant church were at the top of the list , followed by the sos-kinderdorf – an organization for the protection and welfare of children throughout the world – the red cross and the emergency aid service of the johanniter .
next on the list are the organizations caritas and unicef , world vision and various aid groups working with children . some 40 percent of all german adults donate money .
even if the amount spent varies greatly from person to person , statistics show that on average each spender donates € 66 every year to a good cause . but who are the people who year after year give money to help orphans in latin america or finance a school project in africa ?
the younger they are , the less they give ; and the older they are , the more generous they become , beder said . “ the older spenders contribute disproportionately more to the overall volume of donations , " he added .
" perhaps that ’ s a result of the older generations having more of a sense of charity ; but it could also simply be that older people have more money . ” contrary to an often heard rumor , women do not donate more than men .
beder said women may give to more charities more often , but the overall sum of their contributions is less – most likely owing to their generally lower incomes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those with less income realize how easy it is to slip below the poverty line and give to help others like cristine and her daughter pledano in haiti .
more interesting , he said , is the tendency among the poor to donate proportionately more than the wealthiest members of society , in terms of their financial resources . why donate ? there are some 500,000 registered organizations and approximately 12,000 foundations in germany .
nearly all of them are recorded as non-profitable .
that means , they can offer tax breaks for donations .
last year 7.5 million tax payers took advantage of the charitable donation clause to deduct from their tax payments , according to the federal statistics office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans give in the hopes of getting something back when they file their taxes but the revenue system and tax collectors don ’ t seem to be bothered by this loophole .
on the contrary , thomas hofmann , a cologne-based finance officer , said donations are actually good for the economy . “ when i donate money to a non-profitable organization , i help keep the charity afloat financially and it can build up its savings and doesn ’ t depend on state subsidies to survive , " he said .
" that ’ s one of the main reasons , why donations can be deducted from the taxes . ” that could also be another – albeit it less philanthropic – reason why germans like to donate more during the christmas season : they rediscover their charitable side just in time for a tax receipt to be written out for the next year ’ s tax forms . nadja baeva -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a supermarket for the poor shopping at a normal grocery store can sometimes push welfare recipients in germany to their financial limits .

compared to hardcore narcotics and cigarettes , coffee is relatively harmless , but it can have its side effects and lead to addiction , say scientists , who report that caffeine is popping up everywhere . caffeine , the active ingredient in a cup of coffee is a dependency-inducing psychoactive drug , which is being consumed at increasing rates , say scientists in the latest addition of national geographic deutschland . long before they start experimenting with alcohol and cigarettes , children are getting exposed to addictions in the form of caffeine in cola and chocolate .
even before birth , babies are consuming caffeine through the womb from coffee-drinking mothers .
traces of the drug have been found in day-old infants , the scientists report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder gets a quick-fix of coffee during a long parliamentary debate as a stimulant , caffeine influences various mental and physical functions .
it also can be addictive .
a person who regularly drinks three cups of coffee , for instance , will require at least one cup in order for the brain to work in “ normal ” mode .
many people attest to the fact that they can ’ t fully wake up in the morning without a fresh brew . the majority of scientists and doctors are of the opinion , however , that one to two cups of coffee a day can not hurt anyone .
the intentional misuse of caffeine is seldom .
only in the field of sports , where the consumption of more than six cups of coffee is considered doping , are cases of caffeine drug abuse heard of . the drug of choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cofe bars are the trendy way to consume the brew given the prevalence of coffee and other caffeinated beverages in today ’ s society , it ’ s not surprising that nearly everyone consumes the stimulant .
in germany , coffee has far surpassed beer as the nation ’ s favorite beverage .
with some 320 million cups of coffee consumed daily , germany is the world ’ s second largest coffee-importing and drinking nation , after the us . of course the coffee empire of starbucks has gone a long way to boosting caffeine consumption and making coffee drinking cool among the younger crowd , shied away from traditional cafes with their stale interiors and gilded porcelain cups .
every day the seattle-based company opens up four new shops around the world and hires on 200 new employees . but caffeine is also popping up in places one normally wouldn ’ t expect : in pain killers , in sports drinks , even in women ’ s stockings . the textile industry is the latest to discover the benefits of caffeine for the production of nylons .
the stimulant is woven into the fibers to create an uplifting , sliming effect on the upper thighs – a pick-me-up the majority of women certainly can appreciate as much as a good cup of joe . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conquering the world , one frappuccino at a time the first starbucks in berlin might as well have been the first starbucks in seattle or singapore for all it 's originality and local flair .

after the initial celebration , the doubts and worries are setting in . the eyes and ears of the turkish people were firmly tuned to brussels this past week , with the main television channels and newspapers providing blanket coverage of the european union summit .
much was at stake for the primarily muslim nation of 70 million people on the fringe of europe , and anything less than a definite “ yes ” vote from the 25 eu leaders could have spelled the end of turkey ’ s dreams of gaining entry into the illustrious bloc . up until the last minute , everything seemed possible , especially after the turkish delegation appeared on the verge of walking out over eu demands that ankara recognize the greek cypriot government , which became a member in may 2004 . deniz baykal , the leader of the main opposition people ’ s republican party , was one of the most critical voices .
“ the european union is demanding that turkey recognize the greek cypriot government as a precondition to starting accession talks .
if turkey agrees on that , then all the decades of struggle and effort will be erased , ” he said leading up to friday ’ s historic announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey sees itself as a bridge between europe and the middle east but even if such criticisms are likely to resonate within sections of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan ’ s ruling ak party and he has difficulty persuading opponents that he is not sacrificing the turkish cypriot community for ankara ’ s eu aspirations , the majority of the population is breathing a sigh of relief now that an agreement has been reached and a date set for accession talks to begin . looking ahead international relations expert soli ozel said securing a date for euu membership talks was of crucial importance to turkey , both politically and economically .
“ the start of accession negotiations is basically a seal of approval on the fact that turkey is not only eligible , but is ready as a very stable country to take on a role in which it can actually fulfil its maximum economic potential , ” he said . “ there are no longer any questions about the path turkey is on . ” indeed one of the first offshoots of the deal in brussels was that the turkish stock market soared to a record level once news of the accession agreement reached the market floor just before closing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish woman walks past a billboard showing the turkish flag blending with eu flag .
the billboard says " this star will go very well here . "
in taksim square at the heart of istanbul , similar feelings of optimism abounded , although less outright , and more tempered by the reality of the long road ahead .
it will be at least 10 years before turkey is ready for the european union and the average citizen is unlikely to profit much until then . akif emre , a turkish columnist for the pro-government yeni safak newspaper said the coming years will be a testing time for both turkey and the european union .
“ they are both about to embark on a unique experiment , ” he said . “ now that the european union accepts turkey it means we will live together as partners , but we will have different values .
the european union has different values from us – this is a historic testing , ” he said . “ i am not sure turkey and the european union will pass the exam .

compared to hardcore narcotics and cigarettes , coffee is relatively harmless , but it can have its side effects and lead to addiction , say scientists , who report that caffeine is popping up everywhere . caffeine , the active ingredient in a cup of coffee is a dependency-inducing psychoactive drug , which is being consumed at increasing rates , say scientists in the latest addition of national geographic deutschland . long before they start experimenting with alcohol and cigarettes , children are getting exposed to addictions in the form of caffeine in cola and chocolate .
even before birth , babies are consuming caffeine through the womb from coffee-drinking mothers .
traces of the drug have been found in day-old infants , the scientists report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder gets a quick-fix of coffee during a long parliamentary debate as a stimulant , caffeine influences various mental and physical functions .
it also can be addictive .
a person who regularly drinks three cups of coffee , for instance , will require at least one cup in order for the brain to work in “ normal ” mode .
many people attest to the fact that they can ’ t fully wake up in the morning without a fresh brew . the majority of scientists and doctors are of the opinion , however , that one to two cups of coffee a day can not hurt anyone .
the intentional misuse of caffeine is seldom .
only in the field of sports , where the consumption of more than six cups of coffee is considered doping , are cases of caffeine drug abuse heard of . the drug of choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cofe bars are the trendy way to consume the brew given the prevalence of coffee and other caffeinated beverages in today ’ s society , it ’ s not surprising that nearly everyone consumes the stimulant .
in germany , coffee has far surpassed beer as the nation ’ s favorite beverage .
with some 320 million cups of coffee consumed daily , germany is the world ’ s second largest coffee-importing and drinking nation , after the us . of course the coffee empire of starbucks has gone a long way to boosting caffeine consumption and making coffee drinking cool among the younger crowd , shied away from traditional cafes with their stale interiors and gilded porcelain cups .
every day the seattle-based company opens up four new shops around the world and hires on 200 new employees . but caffeine is also popping up in places one normally wouldn ’ t expect : in pain killers , in sports drinks , even in women ’ s stockings . the textile industry is the latest to discover the benefits of caffeine for the production of nylons .
the stimulant is woven into the fibers to create an uplifting , sliming effect on the upper thighs – a pick-me-up the majority of women certainly can appreciate as much as a good cup of joe . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conquering the world , one frappuccino at a time the first starbucks in berlin might as well have been the first starbucks in seattle or singapore for all it 's originality and local flair .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.12.2004 ' tis the season to give großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collection pots are fuller at this time of year as christmas approaches , germans reach deeper into their pockets to give to the poor .
ever year , they donate some two billion euros , more than any other european country . in the days and weeks before christmas , ursula gerst receives a good deal of mail .
friends and relatives send greeting cards , and of course the insurance companies never forget to send bills for the new year .
but charities also write to the 77-year old , reminding her that christmas is a time to think of others and that the best way to do so is through donating a few euros to help out others less fortunate . “ i look at all their requests very carefully , ” she said .
“ and then i say to myself - because they keep writing and insisting – i really should donate something . ” it ’ s not a coincidence that charitable organizations increase their marketing efforts during the holiday season .
they know that germans are in the mood to give at this time of year .
of course , emotional pleas from wide-eyed and hungry children on television and posters help move even the stingiest grinch to donate money . give until it hurts despite a sputtering economy , rising unemployment and an overall financial insecurity at the moment , germans ’ willingness to spend money for a worthy cause is unbreakable .
in 2003 , they spent € 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- on charities , according to the central institute for social research . a quarter of all the money donated went towards culture and monument preservation as well as the protection of animals and the environment .
three-quarters – the greatest share of their donations - went towards humanitarian aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school project funded sos-kinderdorf in goma in the democratic republic of congo the chairman of the organization overseeing charities , bernd beder , said the catholic and protestant church were at the top of the list , followed by the sos-kinderdorf – an organization for the protection and welfare of children throughout the world – the red cross and the emergency aid service of the johanniter .
next on the list are the organizations caritas and unicef , world vision and various aid groups working with children . some 40 percent of all german adults donate money .
even if the amount spent varies greatly from person to person , statistics show that on average each spender donates € 66 every year to a good cause . but who are the people who year after year give money to help orphans in latin america or finance a school project in africa ?
the younger they are , the less they give ; and the older they are , the more generous they become , beder said . “ the older spenders contribute disproportionately more to the overall volume of donations , " he added .
" perhaps that ’ s a result of the older generations having more of a sense of charity ; but it could also simply be that older people have more money . ” contrary to an often heard rumor , women do not donate more than men .
beder said women may give to more charities more often , but the overall sum of their contributions is less – most likely owing to their generally lower incomes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those with less income realize how easy it is to slip below the poverty line and give to help others like cristine and her daughter pledano in haiti .
more interesting , he said , is the tendency among the poor to donate proportionately more than the wealthiest members of society , in terms of their financial resources . why donate ? there are some 500,000 registered organizations and approximately 12,000 foundations in germany .
nearly all of them are recorded as non-profitable .
that means , they can offer tax breaks for donations .
last year 7.5 million tax payers took advantage of the charitable donation clause to deduct from their tax payments , according to the federal statistics office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans give in the hopes of getting something back when they file their taxes but the revenue system and tax collectors don ’ t seem to be bothered by this loophole .
on the contrary , thomas hofmann , a cologne-based finance officer , said donations are actually good for the economy . “ when i donate money to a non-profitable organization , i help keep the charity afloat financially and it can build up its savings and doesn ’ t depend on state subsidies to survive , " he said .
" that ’ s one of the main reasons , why donations can be deducted from the taxes . ” that could also be another – albeit it less philanthropic – reason why germans like to donate more during the christmas season : they rediscover their charitable side just in time for a tax receipt to be written out for the next year ’ s tax forms . nadja baeva -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a supermarket for the poor shopping at a normal grocery store can sometimes push welfare recipients in germany to their financial limits .

ever year , they donate some two billion euros , more than any other european country . in the days and weeks before christmas , ursula gerst receives a good deal of mail .
friends and relatives send greeting cards , and of course the insurance companies never forget to send bills for the new year .
but charities also write to the 77-year old , reminding her that christmas is a time to think of others and that the best way to do so is through donating a few euros to help out others less fortunate . “ i look at all their requests very carefully , ” she said .
“ and then i say to myself - because they keep writing and insisting – i really should donate something . ” it ’ s not a coincidence that charitable organizations increase their marketing efforts during the holiday season .
they know that germans are in the mood to give at this time of year .
of course , emotional pleas from wide-eyed and hungry children on television and posters help move even the stingiest grinch to donate money . give until it hurts despite a sputtering economy , rising unemployment and an overall financial insecurity at the moment , germans ’ willingness to spend money for a worthy cause is unbreakable .
in 2003 , they spent € 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- on charities , according to the central institute for social research . a quarter of all the money donated went towards culture and monument preservation as well as the protection of animals and the environment .
three-quarters – the greatest share of their donations - went towards humanitarian aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school project funded sos-kinderdorf in goma in the democratic republic of congo the chairman of the organization overseeing charities , bernd beder , said the catholic and protestant church were at the top of the list , followed by the sos-kinderdorf – an organization for the protection and welfare of children throughout the world – the red cross and the emergency aid service of the johanniter .
next on the list are the organizations caritas and unicef , world vision and various aid groups working with children . some 40 percent of all german adults donate money .
even if the amount spent varies greatly from person to person , statistics show that on average each spender donates € 66 every year to a good cause . but who are the people who year after year give money to help orphans in latin america or finance a school project in africa ?
the younger they are , the less they give ; and the older they are , the more generous they become , beder said . “ the older spenders contribute disproportionately more to the overall volume of donations , " he added .
" perhaps that ’ s a result of the older generations having more of a sense of charity ; but it could also simply be that older people have more money . ” contrary to an often heard rumor , women do not donate more than men .

ever year , they donate some two billion euros , more than any other european country . in the days and weeks before christmas , ursula gerst receives a good deal of mail .
friends and relatives send greeting cards , and of course the insurance companies never forget to send bills for the new year .
but charities also write to the 77-year old , reminding her that christmas is a time to think of others and that the best way to do so is through donating a few euros to help out others less fortunate . “ i look at all their requests very carefully , ” she said .
“ and then i say to myself - because they keep writing and insisting – i really should donate something . ” it ’ s not a coincidence that charitable organizations increase their marketing efforts during the holiday season .
they know that germans are in the mood to give at this time of year .
of course , emotional pleas from wide-eyed and hungry children on television and posters help move even the stingiest grinch to donate money . give until it hurts despite a sputtering economy , rising unemployment and an overall financial insecurity at the moment , germans ’ willingness to spend money for a worthy cause is unbreakable .
in 2003 , they spent € 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- on charities , according to the central institute for social research . a quarter of all the money donated went towards culture and monument preservation as well as the protection of animals and the environment .
three-quarters – the greatest share of their donations - went towards humanitarian aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school project funded sos-kinderdorf in goma in the democratic republic of congo the chairman of the organization overseeing charities , bernd beder , said the catholic and protestant church were at the top of the list , followed by the sos-kinderdorf – an organization for the protection and welfare of children throughout the world – the red cross and the emergency aid service of the johanniter .
next on the list are the organizations caritas and unicef , world vision and various aid groups working with children . some 40 percent of all german adults donate money .
even if the amount spent varies greatly from person to person , statistics show that on average each spender donates € 66 every year to a good cause . but who are the people who year after year give money to help orphans in latin america or finance a school project in africa ?
the younger they are , the less they give ; and the older they are , the more generous they become , beder said . “ the older spenders contribute disproportionately more to the overall volume of donations , " he added .
" perhaps that ’ s a result of the older generations having more of a sense of charity ; but it could also simply be that older people have more money . ” contrary to an often heard rumor , women do not donate more than men .
beder said women may give to more charities more often , but the overall sum of their contributions is less – most likely owing to their generally lower incomes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those with less income realize how easy it is to slip below the poverty line and give to help others like cristine and her daughter pledano in haiti .
more interesting , he said , is the tendency among the poor to donate proportionately more than the wealthiest members of society , in terms of their financial resources . why donate ? there are some 500,000 registered organizations and approximately 12,000 foundations in germany .
nearly all of them are recorded as non-profitable .

on the contrary , thomas hofmann , a cologne-based finance officer , said donations are actually good for the economy . “ when i donate money to a non-profitable organization , i help keep the charity afloat financially and it can build up its savings and doesn ’ t depend on state subsidies to survive , " he said .
" that ’ s one of the main reasons , why donations can be deducted from the taxes . ” that could also be another – albeit it less philanthropic – reason why germans like to donate more during the christmas season : they rediscover their charitable side just in time for a tax receipt to be written out for the next year ’ s tax forms . nadja baeva -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a supermarket for the poor shopping at a normal grocery store can sometimes push welfare recipients in germany to their financial limits .

1 , 2006 , according to several newspapers on saturday .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung cited a ministry official saying germany ’ s 16 states and federal government had agreed to draft new rules for jewish immigration .
the announcement would mean a reversal of the policy in effect since the collapse of the soviet union .
berlin began offering jews from the former soviet bloc the right to settle in the country in 1991 to help rebuild its own jewish communities .
by the end of 2003 , some 190,000 jews had taken up the offer to settle in germany .
but the fact that the number of the jewish immigrants coming to germany has exceeded those moving to israel from eastern europe has led to a policy rethink , according to the berliner zeitung .
the daily reported that around 9,400 ex-soviet jews were expected to come to germany this year , exceeding for the first time the number settling in israel by more than 1,000 .
the newspaper also said the berlin jewish community was under financial pressure because more than three-quarters of the immigrant jews were reliant on welfare payments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.12.2004 turkey sobers up after eu dream großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the celebration , questions and doubts still remain brussels ’ announcement of a date to start eu membership talks comes as a relief to tukey , after the issue of cyprus threatened to derail negotiations .
after the initial celebration , the doubts and worries are setting in . the eyes and ears of the turkish people were firmly tuned to brussels this past week , with the main television channels and newspapers providing blanket coverage of the european union summit .
much was at stake for the primarily muslim nation of 70 million people on the fringe of europe , and anything less than a definite “ yes ” vote from the 25 eu leaders could have spelled the end of turkey ’ s dreams of gaining entry into the illustrious bloc . up until the last minute , everything seemed possible , especially after the turkish delegation appeared on the verge of walking out over eu demands that ankara recognize the greek cypriot government , which became a member in may 2004 . deniz baykal , the leader of the main opposition people ’ s republican party , was one of the most critical voices .

after the initial celebration , the doubts and worries are setting in . the eyes and ears of the turkish people were firmly tuned to brussels this past week , with the main television channels and newspapers providing blanket coverage of the european union summit .
much was at stake for the primarily muslim nation of 70 million people on the fringe of europe , and anything less than a definite “ yes ” vote from the 25 eu leaders could have spelled the end of turkey ’ s dreams of gaining entry into the illustrious bloc . up until the last minute , everything seemed possible , especially after the turkish delegation appeared on the verge of walking out over eu demands that ankara recognize the greek cypriot government , which became a member in may 2004 . deniz baykal , the leader of the main opposition people ’ s republican party , was one of the most critical voices .
“ the european union is demanding that turkey recognize the greek cypriot government as a precondition to starting accession talks .
if turkey agrees on that , then all the decades of struggle and effort will be erased , ” he said leading up to friday ’ s historic announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey sees itself as a bridge between europe and the middle east but even if such criticisms are likely to resonate within sections of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan ’ s ruling ak party and he has difficulty persuading opponents that he is not sacrificing the turkish cypriot community for ankara ’ s eu aspirations , the majority of the population is breathing a sigh of relief now that an agreement has been reached and a date set for accession talks to begin . looking ahead international relations expert soli ozel said securing a date for euu membership talks was of crucial importance to turkey , both politically and economically .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.12.2004 -pipe- 15:00 utc berlin to limit immigration of russian jews germany plans to stop offering unlimited immigration to jews from russia and eastern europe starting jan .
1 , 2006 , according to several newspapers on saturday .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung cited a ministry official saying germany ’ s 16 states and federal government had agreed to draft new rules for jewish immigration .
the announcement would mean a reversal of the policy in effect since the collapse of the soviet union .
berlin began offering jews from the former soviet bloc the right to settle in the country in 1991 to help rebuild its own jewish communities .
by the end of 2003 , some 190,000 jews had taken up the offer to settle in germany .
but the fact that the number of the jewish immigrants coming to germany has exceeded those moving to israel from eastern europe has led to a policy rethink , according to the berliner zeitung .
the daily reported that around 9,400 ex-soviet jews were expected to come to germany this year , exceeding for the first time the number settling in israel by more than 1,000 .
the newspaper also said the berlin jewish community was under financial pressure because more than three-quarters of the immigrant jews were reliant on welfare payments .
new immigration rules will require potential immigrants to show knowledge of german and be under 45 years of age .
the applicants will also not be eligible for social aid , the berlin paper said . more briefs 18.12.2004 -pipe- next climate talks convene in germany 18.12.2004 -pipe- german pop music gets political boost 17.12.2004 -pipe- german federal reform fails 17.12.2004 -pipe- germany helps sweeten afghanistan 17.12.2004 -pipe- germany-based iraqis can vote 17.12.2004 -pipe- army officer arrested for corruption 17.12.2004 -pipe- spy gets probation in germany 16.12.2004 -pipe- soccer : germany beats japan 3-0 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

ever year , they donate some two billion euros , more than any other european country . in the days and weeks before christmas , ursula gerst receives a good deal of mail .
friends and relatives send greeting cards , and of course the insurance companies never forget to send bills for the new year .
but charities also write to the 77-year old , reminding her that christmas is a time to think of others and that the best way to do so is through donating a few euros to help out others less fortunate . “ i look at all their requests very carefully , ” she said .
“ and then i say to myself - because they keep writing and insisting – i really should donate something . ” it ’ s not a coincidence that charitable organizations increase their marketing efforts during the holiday season .
they know that germans are in the mood to give at this time of year .
of course , emotional pleas from wide-eyed and hungry children on television and posters help move even the stingiest grinch to donate money . give until it hurts despite a sputtering economy , rising unemployment and an overall financial insecurity at the moment , germans ’ willingness to spend money for a worthy cause is unbreakable .
in 2003 , they spent € 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- on charities , according to the central institute for social research . a quarter of all the money donated went towards culture and monument preservation as well as the protection of animals and the environment .
three-quarters – the greatest share of their donations - went towards humanitarian aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school project funded sos-kinderdorf in goma in the democratic republic of congo the chairman of the organization overseeing charities , bernd beder , said the catholic and protestant church were at the top of the list , followed by the sos-kinderdorf – an organization for the protection and welfare of children throughout the world – the red cross and the emergency aid service of the johanniter .
next on the list are the organizations caritas and unicef , world vision and various aid groups working with children . some 40 percent of all german adults donate money .
even if the amount spent varies greatly from person to person , statistics show that on average each spender donates € 66 every year to a good cause . but who are the people who year after year give money to help orphans in latin america or finance a school project in africa ?
the younger they are , the less they give ; and the older they are , the more generous they become , beder said . “ the older spenders contribute disproportionately more to the overall volume of donations , " he added .
" perhaps that ’ s a result of the older generations having more of a sense of charity ; but it could also simply be that older people have more money . ” contrary to an often heard rumor , women do not donate more than men .

more interesting , he said , is the tendency among the poor to donate proportionately more than the wealthiest members of society , in terms of their financial resources . why donate ? there are some 500,000 registered organizations and approximately 12,000 foundations in germany .
nearly all of them are recorded as non-profitable .

three-quarters – the greatest share of their donations - went towards humanitarian aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school project funded sos-kinderdorf in goma in the democratic republic of congo the chairman of the organization overseeing charities , bernd beder , said the catholic and protestant church were at the top of the list , followed by the sos-kinderdorf – an organization for the protection and welfare of children throughout the world – the red cross and the emergency aid service of the johanniter .
next on the list are the organizations caritas and unicef , world vision and various aid groups working with children . some 40 percent of all german adults donate money .
even if the amount spent varies greatly from person to person , statistics show that on average each spender donates € 66 every year to a good cause . but who are the people who year after year give money to help orphans in latin america or finance a school project in africa ?
the younger they are , the less they give ; and the older they are , the more generous they become , beder said . “ the older spenders contribute disproportionately more to the overall volume of donations , " he added .
" perhaps that ’ s a result of the older generations having more of a sense of charity ; but it could also simply be that older people have more money . ” contrary to an often heard rumor , women do not donate more than men .
beder said women may give to more charities more often , but the overall sum of their contributions is less – most likely owing to their generally lower incomes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those with less income realize how easy it is to slip below the poverty line and give to help others like cristine and her daughter pledano in haiti .
more interesting , he said , is the tendency among the poor to donate proportionately more than the wealthiest members of society , in terms of their financial resources . why donate ? there are some 500,000 registered organizations and approximately 12,000 foundations in germany .
nearly all of them are recorded as non-profitable .
that means , they can offer tax breaks for donations .
last year 7.5 million tax payers took advantage of the charitable donation clause to deduct from their tax payments , according to the federal statistics office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans give in the hopes of getting something back when they file their taxes but the revenue system and tax collectors don ’ t seem to be bothered by this loophole .
on the contrary , thomas hofmann , a cologne-based finance officer , said donations are actually good for the economy . “ when i donate money to a non-profitable organization , i help keep the charity afloat financially and it can build up its savings and doesn ’ t depend on state subsidies to survive , " he said .
" that ’ s one of the main reasons , why donations can be deducted from the taxes . ” that could also be another – albeit it less philanthropic – reason why germans like to donate more during the christmas season : they rediscover their charitable side just in time for a tax receipt to be written out for the next year ’ s tax forms . nadja baeva -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a supermarket for the poor shopping at a normal grocery store can sometimes push welfare recipients in germany to their financial limits .

but while the man in the street is hoping that he ’ ll obtain one of the coveted tickets , german parliamentarians can reportedly take it easy . all of germany ’ s 603 federal members of parliament recently received a letter which is bound to be attended to far more quickly than most of the other correspondence in their in-trays . according to a report in saarbrücker zeitung on friday , the letter came from two members of the parliamentary sports committee and invited parliamentarians to pre-book two tickets each for a match of their choice in the preliminary round of the 2006 world soccer championship . the sports committee has admitted that it sent a special request to the organizing team of the championship to provide a fixed amount of tickets up front for the honorable members of parliament . organizers deny allegations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waving the german flag in berlin 's olympic stadium organizers of the championship have rejected allegations that parliamentarians have been promised tickets , saying that there was only an agreement with the parliamentary sports committee to gather ticket requests and check whether they could be taken care of . nevertheless , the news about the special treatment granted to lawmakers has been raising the hackles of ordinary football fans who will have to wait until feb .
1 , when preliminary ticket sales are scheduled . three million tickets will be on sale for the championship .
but for every fan who secures a ticket , there will be at least ten other fans who will go away empty-handed .
in other words , the chance of actually getting a ticket are very slim .
and germans wo n't be given preferential treatment even though their country is hosting the tournament . cynics , commenting on the letter , have been echoing a famous quote by the british novelist george orwell .
" everyone ’ s equal in this country , " they say , " but some are more equal than others . " concern about dubious sellers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trophy 's a given , but tickets have not been designed yet but the deputy chief of the organizing committee , wolfgang niersbach , said he ’ s more concerned by the mushrooming of ticket sales by dubious agencies on the internet . " let me assure you that there are no tickets on the market yet at all , " he said .
" we ’ ve not even agreed yet on the design and the format of the tickets .
you can clearly see from this that there just can ’ t be any tickets up for sale at present . " niersbach added that those already selling tickets on the internet are probably hoping to secure some themselves and then re-sell them .
but there is no guarantee whatsoever that buyers will be refunded if sellers are unable to deliver , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a japanese soccer fan checks his world cup ticket next to an automatic ticket issuing counter during the world cup 2002 in tokyo " people who make use of the various offers on the internet need to be warned , " he said .
" these self-styled ticket agents are not be trusted .
so , anyone who chooses to buy tickets from them is running the high risk of losing a lot of money and never seeing any of the 2006 championship matches from inside a stadium in germany . " niersbach also pointed out that an agency by the name of ise-hospitality is the only one which has been granted a licence by fifa to sell championship tickets with vip status .
the company has paid € 180 million -lrb- $ 239 million -rrb- for the licence which includes exclusive rights to provide catering facilities inside the stadiums . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german authorities close illegal world cup ticket site a website that was illegally offering tickets for the 2006 world cup in germany has been shut down by german authorities .

ever year , they donate some two billion euros , more than any other european country . in the days and weeks before christmas , ursula gerst receives a good deal of mail .
friends and relatives send greeting cards , and of course the insurance companies never forget to send bills for the new year .
but charities also write to the 77-year old , reminding her that christmas is a time to think of others and that the best way to do so is through donating a few euros to help out others less fortunate . “ i look at all their requests very carefully , ” she said .
“ and then i say to myself - because they keep writing and insisting – i really should donate something . ” it ’ s not a coincidence that charitable organizations increase their marketing efforts during the holiday season .
they know that germans are in the mood to give at this time of year .
of course , emotional pleas from wide-eyed and hungry children on television and posters help move even the stingiest grinch to donate money . give until it hurts despite a sputtering economy , rising unemployment and an overall financial insecurity at the moment , germans ’ willingness to spend money for a worthy cause is unbreakable .
in 2003 , they spent € 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- on charities , according to the central institute for social research . a quarter of all the money donated went towards culture and monument preservation as well as the protection of animals and the environment .
three-quarters – the greatest share of their donations - went towards humanitarian aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school project funded sos-kinderdorf in goma in the democratic republic of congo the chairman of the organization overseeing charities , bernd beder , said the catholic and protestant church were at the top of the list , followed by the sos-kinderdorf – an organization for the protection and welfare of children throughout the world – the red cross and the emergency aid service of the johanniter .
next on the list are the organizations caritas and unicef , world vision and various aid groups working with children . some 40 percent of all german adults donate money .
even if the amount spent varies greatly from person to person , statistics show that on average each spender donates € 66 every year to a good cause . but who are the people who year after year give money to help orphans in latin america or finance a school project in africa ?
the younger they are , the less they give ; and the older they are , the more generous they become , beder said . “ the older spenders contribute disproportionately more to the overall volume of donations , " he added .
" perhaps that ’ s a result of the older generations having more of a sense of charity ; but it could also simply be that older people have more money . ” contrary to an often heard rumor , women do not donate more than men .
beder said women may give to more charities more often , but the overall sum of their contributions is less – most likely owing to their generally lower incomes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those with less income realize how easy it is to slip below the poverty line and give to help others like cristine and her daughter pledano in haiti .
more interesting , he said , is the tendency among the poor to donate proportionately more than the wealthiest members of society , in terms of their financial resources . why donate ? there are some 500,000 registered organizations and approximately 12,000 foundations in germany .
nearly all of them are recorded as non-profitable .
that means , they can offer tax breaks for donations .

on the contrary , thomas hofmann , a cologne-based finance officer , said donations are actually good for the economy . “ when i donate money to a non-profitable organization , i help keep the charity afloat financially and it can build up its savings and doesn ’ t depend on state subsidies to survive , " he said .
" that ’ s one of the main reasons , why donations can be deducted from the taxes . ” that could also be another – albeit it less philanthropic – reason why germans like to donate more during the christmas season : they rediscover their charitable side just in time for a tax receipt to be written out for the next year ’ s tax forms . nadja baeva -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a supermarket for the poor shopping at a normal grocery store can sometimes push welfare recipients in germany to their financial limits .

compared to hardcore narcotics and cigarettes , coffee is relatively harmless , but it can have its side effects and lead to addiction , say scientists , who report that caffeine is popping up everywhere . caffeine , the active ingredient in a cup of coffee is a dependency-inducing psychoactive drug , which is being consumed at increasing rates , say scientists in the latest addition of national geographic deutschland . long before they start experimenting with alcohol and cigarettes , children are getting exposed to addictions in the form of caffeine in cola and chocolate .
even before birth , babies are consuming caffeine through the womb from coffee-drinking mothers .
traces of the drug have been found in day-old infants , the scientists report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder gets a quick-fix of coffee during a long parliamentary debate as a stimulant , caffeine influences various mental and physical functions .
it also can be addictive .
a person who regularly drinks three cups of coffee , for instance , will require at least one cup in order for the brain to work in “ normal ” mode .
many people attest to the fact that they can ’ t fully wake up in the morning without a fresh brew . the majority of scientists and doctors are of the opinion , however , that one to two cups of coffee a day can not hurt anyone .
the intentional misuse of caffeine is seldom .
only in the field of sports , where the consumption of more than six cups of coffee is considered doping , are cases of caffeine drug abuse heard of . the drug of choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cofe bars are the trendy way to consume the brew given the prevalence of coffee and other caffeinated beverages in today ’ s society , it ’ s not surprising that nearly everyone consumes the stimulant .
in germany , coffee has far surpassed beer as the nation ’ s favorite beverage .
with some 320 million cups of coffee consumed daily , germany is the world ’ s second largest coffee-importing and drinking nation , after the us . of course the coffee empire of starbucks has gone a long way to boosting caffeine consumption and making coffee drinking cool among the younger crowd , shied away from traditional cafes with their stale interiors and gilded porcelain cups .
every day the seattle-based company opens up four new shops around the world and hires on 200 new employees . but caffeine is also popping up in places one normally wouldn ’ t expect : in pain killers , in sports drinks , even in women ’ s stockings . the textile industry is the latest to discover the benefits of caffeine for the production of nylons .
the stimulant is woven into the fibers to create an uplifting , sliming effect on the upper thighs – a pick-me-up the majority of women certainly can appreciate as much as a good cup of joe . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conquering the world , one frappuccino at a time the first starbucks in berlin might as well have been the first starbucks in seattle or singapore for all it 's originality and local flair .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.12.2004 -pipe- 15:00 utc berlin to limit immigration of russian jews germany plans to stop offering unlimited immigration to jews from russia and eastern europe starting jan .
1 , 2006 , according to several newspapers on saturday .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung cited a ministry official saying germany ’ s 16 states and federal government had agreed to draft new rules for jewish immigration .
the announcement would mean a reversal of the policy in effect since the collapse of the soviet union .
berlin began offering jews from the former soviet bloc the right to settle in the country in 1991 to help rebuild its own jewish communities .
by the end of 2003 , some 190,000 jews had taken up the offer to settle in germany .
but the fact that the number of the jewish immigrants coming to germany has exceeded those moving to israel from eastern europe has led to a policy rethink , according to the berliner zeitung .
the daily reported that around 9,400 ex-soviet jews were expected to come to germany this year , exceeding for the first time the number settling in israel by more than 1,000 .
the newspaper also said the berlin jewish community was under financial pressure because more than three-quarters of the immigrant jews were reliant on welfare payments .
new immigration rules will require potential immigrants to show knowledge of german and be under 45 years of age .
the applicants will also not be eligible for social aid , the berlin paper said . more briefs 18.12.2004 -pipe- next climate talks convene in germany 18.12.2004 -pipe- german pop music gets political boost 17.12.2004 -pipe- german federal reform fails 17.12.2004 -pipe- germany helps sweeten afghanistan 17.12.2004 -pipe- germany-based iraqis can vote 17.12.2004 -pipe- army officer arrested for corruption 17.12.2004 -pipe- spy gets probation in germany 16.12.2004 -pipe- soccer : germany beats japan 3-0 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.12.2004 ' tis the season to give großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collection pots are fuller at this time of year as christmas approaches , germans reach deeper into their pockets to give to the poor .
ever year , they donate some two billion euros , more than any other european country . in the days and weeks before christmas , ursula gerst receives a good deal of mail .
friends and relatives send greeting cards , and of course the insurance companies never forget to send bills for the new year .
but charities also write to the 77-year old , reminding her that christmas is a time to think of others and that the best way to do so is through donating a few euros to help out others less fortunate . “ i look at all their requests very carefully , ” she said .
“ and then i say to myself - because they keep writing and insisting – i really should donate something . ” it ’ s not a coincidence that charitable organizations increase their marketing efforts during the holiday season .
they know that germans are in the mood to give at this time of year .
of course , emotional pleas from wide-eyed and hungry children on television and posters help move even the stingiest grinch to donate money . give until it hurts despite a sputtering economy , rising unemployment and an overall financial insecurity at the moment , germans ’ willingness to spend money for a worthy cause is unbreakable .
in 2003 , they spent € 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- on charities , according to the central institute for social research . a quarter of all the money donated went towards culture and monument preservation as well as the protection of animals and the environment .
three-quarters – the greatest share of their donations - went towards humanitarian aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school project funded sos-kinderdorf in goma in the democratic republic of congo the chairman of the organization overseeing charities , bernd beder , said the catholic and protestant church were at the top of the list , followed by the sos-kinderdorf – an organization for the protection and welfare of children throughout the world – the red cross and the emergency aid service of the johanniter .
next on the list are the organizations caritas and unicef , world vision and various aid groups working with children . some 40 percent of all german adults donate money .
even if the amount spent varies greatly from person to person , statistics show that on average each spender donates € 66 every year to a good cause . but who are the people who year after year give money to help orphans in latin america or finance a school project in africa ?
the younger they are , the less they give ; and the older they are , the more generous they become , beder said . “ the older spenders contribute disproportionately more to the overall volume of donations , " he added .
" perhaps that ’ s a result of the older generations having more of a sense of charity ; but it could also simply be that older people have more money . ” contrary to an often heard rumor , women do not donate more than men .
beder said women may give to more charities more often , but the overall sum of their contributions is less – most likely owing to their generally lower incomes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those with less income realize how easy it is to slip below the poverty line and give to help others like cristine and her daughter pledano in haiti .
more interesting , he said , is the tendency among the poor to donate proportionately more than the wealthiest members of society , in terms of their financial resources . why donate ? there are some 500,000 registered organizations and approximately 12,000 foundations in germany .
nearly all of them are recorded as non-profitable .
that means , they can offer tax breaks for donations .
last year 7.5 million tax payers took advantage of the charitable donation clause to deduct from their tax payments , according to the federal statistics office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans give in the hopes of getting something back when they file their taxes but the revenue system and tax collectors don ’ t seem to be bothered by this loophole .
on the contrary , thomas hofmann , a cologne-based finance officer , said donations are actually good for the economy . “ when i donate money to a non-profitable organization , i help keep the charity afloat financially and it can build up its savings and doesn ’ t depend on state subsidies to survive , " he said .
" that ’ s one of the main reasons , why donations can be deducted from the taxes . ” that could also be another – albeit it less philanthropic – reason why germans like to donate more during the christmas season : they rediscover their charitable side just in time for a tax receipt to be written out for the next year ’ s tax forms . nadja baeva -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a supermarket for the poor shopping at a normal grocery store can sometimes push welfare recipients in germany to their financial limits .

1 , 2006 , according to several newspapers on saturday .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung cited a ministry official saying germany ’ s 16 states and federal government had agreed to draft new rules for jewish immigration .
the announcement would mean a reversal of the policy in effect since the collapse of the soviet union .
berlin began offering jews from the former soviet bloc the right to settle in the country in 1991 to help rebuild its own jewish communities .
by the end of 2003 , some 190,000 jews had taken up the offer to settle in germany .
but the fact that the number of the jewish immigrants coming to germany has exceeded those moving to israel from eastern europe has led to a policy rethink , according to the berliner zeitung .
the daily reported that around 9,400 ex-soviet jews were expected to come to germany this year , exceeding for the first time the number settling in israel by more than 1,000 .
the newspaper also said the berlin jewish community was under financial pressure because more than three-quarters of the immigrant jews were reliant on welfare payments .
new immigration rules will require potential immigrants to show knowledge of german and be under 45 years of age .
the applicants will also not be eligible for social aid , the berlin paper said . more briefs 18.12.2004 -pipe- next climate talks convene in germany 18.12.2004 -pipe- german pop music gets political boost 17.12.2004 -pipe- german federal reform fails 17.12.2004 -pipe- germany helps sweeten afghanistan 17.12.2004 -pipe- germany-based iraqis can vote 17.12.2004 -pipe- army officer arrested for corruption 17.12.2004 -pipe- spy gets probation in germany 16.12.2004 -pipe- soccer : germany beats japan 3-0 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

after the initial celebration , the doubts and worries are setting in . the eyes and ears of the turkish people were firmly tuned to brussels this past week , with the main television channels and newspapers providing blanket coverage of the european union summit .
much was at stake for the primarily muslim nation of 70 million people on the fringe of europe , and anything less than a definite “ yes ” vote from the 25 eu leaders could have spelled the end of turkey ’ s dreams of gaining entry into the illustrious bloc . up until the last minute , everything seemed possible , especially after the turkish delegation appeared on the verge of walking out over eu demands that ankara recognize the greek cypriot government , which became a member in may 2004 . deniz baykal , the leader of the main opposition people ’ s republican party , was one of the most critical voices .
“ the european union is demanding that turkey recognize the greek cypriot government as a precondition to starting accession talks .

“ the start of accession negotiations is basically a seal of approval on the fact that turkey is not only eligible , but is ready as a very stable country to take on a role in which it can actually fulfil its maximum economic potential , ” he said . “ there are no longer any questions about the path turkey is on . ” indeed one of the first offshoots of the deal in brussels was that the turkish stock market soared to a record level once news of the accession agreement reached the market floor just before closing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish woman walks past a billboard showing the turkish flag blending with eu flag .

ever year , they donate some two billion euros , more than any other european country . in the days and weeks before christmas , ursula gerst receives a good deal of mail .
friends and relatives send greeting cards , and of course the insurance companies never forget to send bills for the new year .
but charities also write to the 77-year old , reminding her that christmas is a time to think of others and that the best way to do so is through donating a few euros to help out others less fortunate . “ i look at all their requests very carefully , ” she said .
“ and then i say to myself - because they keep writing and insisting – i really should donate something . ” it ’ s not a coincidence that charitable organizations increase their marketing efforts during the holiday season .
they know that germans are in the mood to give at this time of year .
of course , emotional pleas from wide-eyed and hungry children on television and posters help move even the stingiest grinch to donate money . give until it hurts despite a sputtering economy , rising unemployment and an overall financial insecurity at the moment , germans ’ willingness to spend money for a worthy cause is unbreakable .
in 2003 , they spent € 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- on charities , according to the central institute for social research . a quarter of all the money donated went towards culture and monument preservation as well as the protection of animals and the environment .
three-quarters – the greatest share of their donations - went towards humanitarian aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school project funded sos-kinderdorf in goma in the democratic republic of congo the chairman of the organization overseeing charities , bernd beder , said the catholic and protestant church were at the top of the list , followed by the sos-kinderdorf – an organization for the protection and welfare of children throughout the world – the red cross and the emergency aid service of the johanniter .
next on the list are the organizations caritas and unicef , world vision and various aid groups working with children . some 40 percent of all german adults donate money .
even if the amount spent varies greatly from person to person , statistics show that on average each spender donates € 66 every year to a good cause . but who are the people who year after year give money to help orphans in latin america or finance a school project in africa ?
the younger they are , the less they give ; and the older they are , the more generous they become , beder said . “ the older spenders contribute disproportionately more to the overall volume of donations , " he added .
" perhaps that ’ s a result of the older generations having more of a sense of charity ; but it could also simply be that older people have more money . ” contrary to an often heard rumor , women do not donate more than men .
beder said women may give to more charities more often , but the overall sum of their contributions is less – most likely owing to their generally lower incomes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those with less income realize how easy it is to slip below the poverty line and give to help others like cristine and her daughter pledano in haiti .
more interesting , he said , is the tendency among the poor to donate proportionately more than the wealthiest members of society , in terms of their financial resources . why donate ? there are some 500,000 registered organizations and approximately 12,000 foundations in germany .
nearly all of them are recorded as non-profitable .
that means , they can offer tax breaks for donations .
last year 7.5 million tax payers took advantage of the charitable donation clause to deduct from their tax payments , according to the federal statistics office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans give in the hopes of getting something back when they file their taxes but the revenue system and tax collectors don ’ t seem to be bothered by this loophole .
on the contrary , thomas hofmann , a cologne-based finance officer , said donations are actually good for the economy . “ when i donate money to a non-profitable organization , i help keep the charity afloat financially and it can build up its savings and doesn ’ t depend on state subsidies to survive , " he said .
" that ’ s one of the main reasons , why donations can be deducted from the taxes . ” that could also be another – albeit it less philanthropic – reason why germans like to donate more during the christmas season : they rediscover their charitable side just in time for a tax receipt to be written out for the next year ’ s tax forms . nadja baeva -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a supermarket for the poor shopping at a normal grocery store can sometimes push welfare recipients in germany to their financial limits .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.12.2004 turkey sobers up after eu dream großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the celebration , questions and doubts still remain brussels ’ announcement of a date to start eu membership talks comes as a relief to tukey , after the issue of cyprus threatened to derail negotiations .
after the initial celebration , the doubts and worries are setting in . the eyes and ears of the turkish people were firmly tuned to brussels this past week , with the main television channels and newspapers providing blanket coverage of the european union summit .
much was at stake for the primarily muslim nation of 70 million people on the fringe of europe , and anything less than a definite “ yes ” vote from the 25 eu leaders could have spelled the end of turkey ’ s dreams of gaining entry into the illustrious bloc . up until the last minute , everything seemed possible , especially after the turkish delegation appeared on the verge of walking out over eu demands that ankara recognize the greek cypriot government , which became a member in may 2004 . deniz baykal , the leader of the main opposition people ’ s republican party , was one of the most critical voices .
“ the european union is demanding that turkey recognize the greek cypriot government as a precondition to starting accession talks .
if turkey agrees on that , then all the decades of struggle and effort will be erased , ” he said leading up to friday ’ s historic announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey sees itself as a bridge between europe and the middle east but even if such criticisms are likely to resonate within sections of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan ’ s ruling ak party and he has difficulty persuading opponents that he is not sacrificing the turkish cypriot community for ankara ’ s eu aspirations , the majority of the population is breathing a sigh of relief now that an agreement has been reached and a date set for accession talks to begin . looking ahead international relations expert soli ozel said securing a date for euu membership talks was of crucial importance to turkey , both politically and economically .
“ the start of accession negotiations is basically a seal of approval on the fact that turkey is not only eligible , but is ready as a very stable country to take on a role in which it can actually fulfil its maximum economic potential , ” he said . “ there are no longer any questions about the path turkey is on . ” indeed one of the first offshoots of the deal in brussels was that the turkish stock market soared to a record level once news of the accession agreement reached the market floor just before closing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish woman walks past a billboard showing the turkish flag blending with eu flag .
the billboard says " this star will go very well here . "
in taksim square at the heart of istanbul , similar feelings of optimism abounded , although less outright , and more tempered by the reality of the long road ahead .
it will be at least 10 years before turkey is ready for the european union and the average citizen is unlikely to profit much until then . akif emre , a turkish columnist for the pro-government yeni safak newspaper said the coming years will be a testing time for both turkey and the european union .
“ they are both about to embark on a unique experiment , ” he said . “ now that the european union accepts turkey it means we will live together as partners , but we will have different values .
the european union has different values from us – this is a historic testing , ” he said . “ i am not sure turkey and the european union will pass the exam .
there are so many difficult ways in front of us , ” he added . dorian jones , istanbul send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough at eu-turkey talks turkey and the eu 's presidency struck an agreement friday to end an impasse blocking the launch of eu membership talks with ankara , a turkish diplomat said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.12.2004 ' tis the season to give großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collection pots are fuller at this time of year as christmas approaches , germans reach deeper into their pockets to give to the poor .
ever year , they donate some two billion euros , more than any other european country . in the days and weeks before christmas , ursula gerst receives a good deal of mail .
friends and relatives send greeting cards , and of course the insurance companies never forget to send bills for the new year .
but charities also write to the 77-year old , reminding her that christmas is a time to think of others and that the best way to do so is through donating a few euros to help out others less fortunate . “ i look at all their requests very carefully , ” she said .
“ and then i say to myself - because they keep writing and insisting – i really should donate something . ” it ’ s not a coincidence that charitable organizations increase their marketing efforts during the holiday season .
they know that germans are in the mood to give at this time of year .
of course , emotional pleas from wide-eyed and hungry children on television and posters help move even the stingiest grinch to donate money . give until it hurts despite a sputtering economy , rising unemployment and an overall financial insecurity at the moment , germans ’ willingness to spend money for a worthy cause is unbreakable .
in 2003 , they spent € 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- on charities , according to the central institute for social research . a quarter of all the money donated went towards culture and monument preservation as well as the protection of animals and the environment .
three-quarters – the greatest share of their donations - went towards humanitarian aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school project funded sos-kinderdorf in goma in the democratic republic of congo the chairman of the organization overseeing charities , bernd beder , said the catholic and protestant church were at the top of the list , followed by the sos-kinderdorf – an organization for the protection and welfare of children throughout the world – the red cross and the emergency aid service of the johanniter .
next on the list are the organizations caritas and unicef , world vision and various aid groups working with children . some 40 percent of all german adults donate money .
even if the amount spent varies greatly from person to person , statistics show that on average each spender donates € 66 every year to a good cause . but who are the people who year after year give money to help orphans in latin america or finance a school project in africa ?

" that ’ s one of the main reasons , why donations can be deducted from the taxes . ” that could also be another – albeit it less philanthropic – reason why germans like to donate more during the christmas season : they rediscover their charitable side just in time for a tax receipt to be written out for the next year ’ s tax forms . nadja baeva -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a supermarket for the poor shopping at a normal grocery store can sometimes push welfare recipients in germany to their financial limits .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.12.2004 turkey sobers up after eu dream großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the celebration , questions and doubts still remain brussels ’ announcement of a date to start eu membership talks comes as a relief to tukey , after the issue of cyprus threatened to derail negotiations .
after the initial celebration , the doubts and worries are setting in . the eyes and ears of the turkish people were firmly tuned to brussels this past week , with the main television channels and newspapers providing blanket coverage of the european union summit .
much was at stake for the primarily muslim nation of 70 million people on the fringe of europe , and anything less than a definite “ yes ” vote from the 25 eu leaders could have spelled the end of turkey ’ s dreams of gaining entry into the illustrious bloc . up until the last minute , everything seemed possible , especially after the turkish delegation appeared on the verge of walking out over eu demands that ankara recognize the greek cypriot government , which became a member in may 2004 . deniz baykal , the leader of the main opposition people ’ s republican party , was one of the most critical voices .
“ the european union is demanding that turkey recognize the greek cypriot government as a precondition to starting accession talks .
if turkey agrees on that , then all the decades of struggle and effort will be erased , ” he said leading up to friday ’ s historic announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey sees itself as a bridge between europe and the middle east but even if such criticisms are likely to resonate within sections of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan ’ s ruling ak party and he has difficulty persuading opponents that he is not sacrificing the turkish cypriot community for ankara ’ s eu aspirations , the majority of the population is breathing a sigh of relief now that an agreement has been reached and a date set for accession talks to begin . looking ahead international relations expert soli ozel said securing a date for euu membership talks was of crucial importance to turkey , both politically and economically .
“ the start of accession negotiations is basically a seal of approval on the fact that turkey is not only eligible , but is ready as a very stable country to take on a role in which it can actually fulfil its maximum economic potential , ” he said . “ there are no longer any questions about the path turkey is on . ” indeed one of the first offshoots of the deal in brussels was that the turkish stock market soared to a record level once news of the accession agreement reached the market floor just before closing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish woman walks past a billboard showing the turkish flag blending with eu flag .
the billboard says " this star will go very well here . "
in taksim square at the heart of istanbul , similar feelings of optimism abounded , although less outright , and more tempered by the reality of the long road ahead .
it will be at least 10 years before turkey is ready for the european union and the average citizen is unlikely to profit much until then . akif emre , a turkish columnist for the pro-government yeni safak newspaper said the coming years will be a testing time for both turkey and the european union .
“ they are both about to embark on a unique experiment , ” he said . “ now that the european union accepts turkey it means we will live together as partners , but we will have different values .
the european union has different values from us – this is a historic testing , ” he said . “ i am not sure turkey and the european union will pass the exam .
there are so many difficult ways in front of us , ” he added . dorian jones , istanbul send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough at eu-turkey talks turkey and the eu 's presidency struck an agreement friday to end an impasse blocking the launch of eu membership talks with ankara , a turkish diplomat said .

compared to hardcore narcotics and cigarettes , coffee is relatively harmless , but it can have its side effects and lead to addiction , say scientists , who report that caffeine is popping up everywhere . caffeine , the active ingredient in a cup of coffee is a dependency-inducing psychoactive drug , which is being consumed at increasing rates , say scientists in the latest addition of national geographic deutschland . long before they start experimenting with alcohol and cigarettes , children are getting exposed to addictions in the form of caffeine in cola and chocolate .
even before birth , babies are consuming caffeine through the womb from coffee-drinking mothers .
traces of the drug have been found in day-old infants , the scientists report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder gets a quick-fix of coffee during a long parliamentary debate as a stimulant , caffeine influences various mental and physical functions .
it also can be addictive .
a person who regularly drinks three cups of coffee , for instance , will require at least one cup in order for the brain to work in “ normal ” mode .
many people attest to the fact that they can ’ t fully wake up in the morning without a fresh brew . the majority of scientists and doctors are of the opinion , however , that one to two cups of coffee a day can not hurt anyone .
the intentional misuse of caffeine is seldom .
only in the field of sports , where the consumption of more than six cups of coffee is considered doping , are cases of caffeine drug abuse heard of . the drug of choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cofe bars are the trendy way to consume the brew given the prevalence of coffee and other caffeinated beverages in today ’ s society , it ’ s not surprising that nearly everyone consumes the stimulant .
in germany , coffee has far surpassed beer as the nation ’ s favorite beverage .
with some 320 million cups of coffee consumed daily , germany is the world ’ s second largest coffee-importing and drinking nation , after the us . of course the coffee empire of starbucks has gone a long way to boosting caffeine consumption and making coffee drinking cool among the younger crowd , shied away from traditional cafes with their stale interiors and gilded porcelain cups .
every day the seattle-based company opens up four new shops around the world and hires on 200 new employees . but caffeine is also popping up in places one normally wouldn ’ t expect : in pain killers , in sports drinks , even in women ’ s stockings . the textile industry is the latest to discover the benefits of caffeine for the production of nylons .
the stimulant is woven into the fibers to create an uplifting , sliming effect on the upper thighs – a pick-me-up the majority of women certainly can appreciate as much as a good cup of joe . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conquering the world , one frappuccino at a time the first starbucks in berlin might as well have been the first starbucks in seattle or singapore for all it 's originality and local flair .

ever year , they donate some two billion euros , more than any other european country . in the days and weeks before christmas , ursula gerst receives a good deal of mail .
friends and relatives send greeting cards , and of course the insurance companies never forget to send bills for the new year .
but charities also write to the 77-year old , reminding her that christmas is a time to think of others and that the best way to do so is through donating a few euros to help out others less fortunate . “ i look at all their requests very carefully , ” she said .
“ and then i say to myself - because they keep writing and insisting – i really should donate something . ” it ’ s not a coincidence that charitable organizations increase their marketing efforts during the holiday season .
they know that germans are in the mood to give at this time of year .
of course , emotional pleas from wide-eyed and hungry children on television and posters help move even the stingiest grinch to donate money . give until it hurts despite a sputtering economy , rising unemployment and an overall financial insecurity at the moment , germans ’ willingness to spend money for a worthy cause is unbreakable .
in 2003 , they spent € 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- on charities , according to the central institute for social research . a quarter of all the money donated went towards culture and monument preservation as well as the protection of animals and the environment .
three-quarters – the greatest share of their donations - went towards humanitarian aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school project funded sos-kinderdorf in goma in the democratic republic of congo the chairman of the organization overseeing charities , bernd beder , said the catholic and protestant church were at the top of the list , followed by the sos-kinderdorf – an organization for the protection and welfare of children throughout the world – the red cross and the emergency aid service of the johanniter .
next on the list are the organizations caritas and unicef , world vision and various aid groups working with children . some 40 percent of all german adults donate money .
even if the amount spent varies greatly from person to person , statistics show that on average each spender donates € 66 every year to a good cause . but who are the people who year after year give money to help orphans in latin america or finance a school project in africa ?
the younger they are , the less they give ; and the older they are , the more generous they become , beder said . “ the older spenders contribute disproportionately more to the overall volume of donations , " he added .
" perhaps that ’ s a result of the older generations having more of a sense of charity ; but it could also simply be that older people have more money . ” contrary to an often heard rumor , women do not donate more than men .
beder said women may give to more charities more often , but the overall sum of their contributions is less – most likely owing to their generally lower incomes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those with less income realize how easy it is to slip below the poverty line and give to help others like cristine and her daughter pledano in haiti .
more interesting , he said , is the tendency among the poor to donate proportionately more than the wealthiest members of society , in terms of their financial resources . why donate ? there are some 500,000 registered organizations and approximately 12,000 foundations in germany .
nearly all of them are recorded as non-profitable .
that means , they can offer tax breaks for donations .
last year 7.5 million tax payers took advantage of the charitable donation clause to deduct from their tax payments , according to the federal statistics office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans give in the hopes of getting something back when they file their taxes but the revenue system and tax collectors don ’ t seem to be bothered by this loophole .

after the initial celebration , the doubts and worries are setting in . the eyes and ears of the turkish people were firmly tuned to brussels this past week , with the main television channels and newspapers providing blanket coverage of the european union summit .
much was at stake for the primarily muslim nation of 70 million people on the fringe of europe , and anything less than a definite “ yes ” vote from the 25 eu leaders could have spelled the end of turkey ’ s dreams of gaining entry into the illustrious bloc . up until the last minute , everything seemed possible , especially after the turkish delegation appeared on the verge of walking out over eu demands that ankara recognize the greek cypriot government , which became a member in may 2004 . deniz baykal , the leader of the main opposition people ’ s republican party , was one of the most critical voices .
“ the european union is demanding that turkey recognize the greek cypriot government as a precondition to starting accession talks .
if turkey agrees on that , then all the decades of struggle and effort will be erased , ” he said leading up to friday ’ s historic announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey sees itself as a bridge between europe and the middle east but even if such criticisms are likely to resonate within sections of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan ’ s ruling ak party and he has difficulty persuading opponents that he is not sacrificing the turkish cypriot community for ankara ’ s eu aspirations , the majority of the population is breathing a sigh of relief now that an agreement has been reached and a date set for accession talks to begin . looking ahead international relations expert soli ozel said securing a date for euu membership talks was of crucial importance to turkey , both politically and economically .
“ the start of accession negotiations is basically a seal of approval on the fact that turkey is not only eligible , but is ready as a very stable country to take on a role in which it can actually fulfil its maximum economic potential , ” he said . “ there are no longer any questions about the path turkey is on . ” indeed one of the first offshoots of the deal in brussels was that the turkish stock market soared to a record level once news of the accession agreement reached the market floor just before closing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish woman walks past a billboard showing the turkish flag blending with eu flag .
the billboard says " this star will go very well here . "
in taksim square at the heart of istanbul , similar feelings of optimism abounded , although less outright , and more tempered by the reality of the long road ahead .
it will be at least 10 years before turkey is ready for the european union and the average citizen is unlikely to profit much until then . akif emre , a turkish columnist for the pro-government yeni safak newspaper said the coming years will be a testing time for both turkey and the european union .
“ they are both about to embark on a unique experiment , ” he said . “ now that the european union accepts turkey it means we will live together as partners , but we will have different values .

ever year , they donate some two billion euros , more than any other european country . in the days and weeks before christmas , ursula gerst receives a good deal of mail .
friends and relatives send greeting cards , and of course the insurance companies never forget to send bills for the new year .
but charities also write to the 77-year old , reminding her that christmas is a time to think of others and that the best way to do so is through donating a few euros to help out others less fortunate . “ i look at all their requests very carefully , ” she said .
“ and then i say to myself - because they keep writing and insisting – i really should donate something . ” it ’ s not a coincidence that charitable organizations increase their marketing efforts during the holiday season .
they know that germans are in the mood to give at this time of year .
of course , emotional pleas from wide-eyed and hungry children on television and posters help move even the stingiest grinch to donate money . give until it hurts despite a sputtering economy , rising unemployment and an overall financial insecurity at the moment , germans ’ willingness to spend money for a worthy cause is unbreakable .
in 2003 , they spent € 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- on charities , according to the central institute for social research . a quarter of all the money donated went towards culture and monument preservation as well as the protection of animals and the environment .
three-quarters – the greatest share of their donations - went towards humanitarian aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school project funded sos-kinderdorf in goma in the democratic republic of congo the chairman of the organization overseeing charities , bernd beder , said the catholic and protestant church were at the top of the list , followed by the sos-kinderdorf – an organization for the protection and welfare of children throughout the world – the red cross and the emergency aid service of the johanniter .
next on the list are the organizations caritas and unicef , world vision and various aid groups working with children . some 40 percent of all german adults donate money .
even if the amount spent varies greatly from person to person , statistics show that on average each spender donates € 66 every year to a good cause . but who are the people who year after year give money to help orphans in latin america or finance a school project in africa ?
the younger they are , the less they give ; and the older they are , the more generous they become , beder said . “ the older spenders contribute disproportionately more to the overall volume of donations , " he added .
" perhaps that ’ s a result of the older generations having more of a sense of charity ; but it could also simply be that older people have more money . ” contrary to an often heard rumor , women do not donate more than men .
beder said women may give to more charities more often , but the overall sum of their contributions is less – most likely owing to their generally lower incomes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those with less income realize how easy it is to slip below the poverty line and give to help others like cristine and her daughter pledano in haiti .
more interesting , he said , is the tendency among the poor to donate proportionately more than the wealthiest members of society , in terms of their financial resources . why donate ? there are some 500,000 registered organizations and approximately 12,000 foundations in germany .
nearly all of them are recorded as non-profitable .
that means , they can offer tax breaks for donations .
last year 7.5 million tax payers took advantage of the charitable donation clause to deduct from their tax payments , according to the federal statistics office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans give in the hopes of getting something back when they file their taxes but the revenue system and tax collectors don ’ t seem to be bothered by this loophole .
on the contrary , thomas hofmann , a cologne-based finance officer , said donations are actually good for the economy . “ when i donate money to a non-profitable organization , i help keep the charity afloat financially and it can build up its savings and doesn ’ t depend on state subsidies to survive , " he said .
" that ’ s one of the main reasons , why donations can be deducted from the taxes . ” that could also be another – albeit it less philanthropic – reason why germans like to donate more during the christmas season : they rediscover their charitable side just in time for a tax receipt to be written out for the next year ’ s tax forms . nadja baeva -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a supermarket for the poor shopping at a normal grocery store can sometimes push welfare recipients in germany to their financial limits .

compared to hardcore narcotics and cigarettes , coffee is relatively harmless , but it can have its side effects and lead to addiction , say scientists , who report that caffeine is popping up everywhere . caffeine , the active ingredient in a cup of coffee is a dependency-inducing psychoactive drug , which is being consumed at increasing rates , say scientists in the latest addition of national geographic deutschland . long before they start experimenting with alcohol and cigarettes , children are getting exposed to addictions in the form of caffeine in cola and chocolate .
even before birth , babies are consuming caffeine through the womb from coffee-drinking mothers .
traces of the drug have been found in day-old infants , the scientists report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder gets a quick-fix of coffee during a long parliamentary debate as a stimulant , caffeine influences various mental and physical functions .
it also can be addictive .
a person who regularly drinks three cups of coffee , for instance , will require at least one cup in order for the brain to work in “ normal ” mode .
many people attest to the fact that they can ’ t fully wake up in the morning without a fresh brew . the majority of scientists and doctors are of the opinion , however , that one to two cups of coffee a day can not hurt anyone .
the intentional misuse of caffeine is seldom .
only in the field of sports , where the consumption of more than six cups of coffee is considered doping , are cases of caffeine drug abuse heard of . the drug of choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cofe bars are the trendy way to consume the brew given the prevalence of coffee and other caffeinated beverages in today ’ s society , it ’ s not surprising that nearly everyone consumes the stimulant .
in germany , coffee has far surpassed beer as the nation ’ s favorite beverage .
with some 320 million cups of coffee consumed daily , germany is the world ’ s second largest coffee-importing and drinking nation , after the us . of course the coffee empire of starbucks has gone a long way to boosting caffeine consumption and making coffee drinking cool among the younger crowd , shied away from traditional cafes with their stale interiors and gilded porcelain cups .
every day the seattle-based company opens up four new shops around the world and hires on 200 new employees . but caffeine is also popping up in places one normally wouldn ’ t expect : in pain killers , in sports drinks , even in women ’ s stockings . the textile industry is the latest to discover the benefits of caffeine for the production of nylons .
the stimulant is woven into the fibers to create an uplifting , sliming effect on the upper thighs – a pick-me-up the majority of women certainly can appreciate as much as a good cup of joe . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conquering the world , one frappuccino at a time the first starbucks in berlin might as well have been the first starbucks in seattle or singapore for all it 's originality and local flair .

1 , 2006 , according to several newspapers on saturday .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung cited a ministry official saying germany ’ s 16 states and federal government had agreed to draft new rules for jewish immigration .
the announcement would mean a reversal of the policy in effect since the collapse of the soviet union .
berlin began offering jews from the former soviet bloc the right to settle in the country in 1991 to help rebuild its own jewish communities .
by the end of 2003 , some 190,000 jews had taken up the offer to settle in germany .
but the fact that the number of the jewish immigrants coming to germany has exceeded those moving to israel from eastern europe has led to a policy rethink , according to the berliner zeitung .
the daily reported that around 9,400 ex-soviet jews were expected to come to germany this year , exceeding for the first time the number settling in israel by more than 1,000 .
the newspaper also said the berlin jewish community was under financial pressure because more than three-quarters of the immigrant jews were reliant on welfare payments .
new immigration rules will require potential immigrants to show knowledge of german and be under 45 years of age .
the applicants will also not be eligible for social aid , the berlin paper said . more briefs 18.12.2004 -pipe- next climate talks convene in germany 18.12.2004 -pipe- german pop music gets political boost 17.12.2004 -pipe- german federal reform fails 17.12.2004 -pipe- germany helps sweeten afghanistan 17.12.2004 -pipe- germany-based iraqis can vote 17.12.2004 -pipe- army officer arrested for corruption 17.12.2004 -pipe- spy gets probation in germany 16.12.2004 -pipe- soccer : germany beats japan 3-0 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.12.2004 ' tis the season to give großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collection pots are fuller at this time of year as christmas approaches , germans reach deeper into their pockets to give to the poor .
ever year , they donate some two billion euros , more than any other european country . in the days and weeks before christmas , ursula gerst receives a good deal of mail .
friends and relatives send greeting cards , and of course the insurance companies never forget to send bills for the new year .
but charities also write to the 77-year old , reminding her that christmas is a time to think of others and that the best way to do so is through donating a few euros to help out others less fortunate . “ i look at all their requests very carefully , ” she said .
“ and then i say to myself - because they keep writing and insisting – i really should donate something . ” it ’ s not a coincidence that charitable organizations increase their marketing efforts during the holiday season .
they know that germans are in the mood to give at this time of year .
of course , emotional pleas from wide-eyed and hungry children on television and posters help move even the stingiest grinch to donate money . give until it hurts despite a sputtering economy , rising unemployment and an overall financial insecurity at the moment , germans ’ willingness to spend money for a worthy cause is unbreakable .
in 2003 , they spent € 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- on charities , according to the central institute for social research . a quarter of all the money donated went towards culture and monument preservation as well as the protection of animals and the environment .
three-quarters – the greatest share of their donations - went towards humanitarian aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school project funded sos-kinderdorf in goma in the democratic republic of congo the chairman of the organization overseeing charities , bernd beder , said the catholic and protestant church were at the top of the list , followed by the sos-kinderdorf – an organization for the protection and welfare of children throughout the world – the red cross and the emergency aid service of the johanniter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.12.2004 world cup perks for parliamentarians ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's politicians will be catching all the action on the field soccer fans are already looking ahead to the 2006 world cup in germany .
but while the man in the street is hoping that he ’ ll obtain one of the coveted tickets , german parliamentarians can reportedly take it easy . all of germany ’ s 603 federal members of parliament recently received a letter which is bound to be attended to far more quickly than most of the other correspondence in their in-trays . according to a report in saarbrücker zeitung on friday , the letter came from two members of the parliamentary sports committee and invited parliamentarians to pre-book two tickets each for a match of their choice in the preliminary round of the 2006 world soccer championship . the sports committee has admitted that it sent a special request to the organizing team of the championship to provide a fixed amount of tickets up front for the honorable members of parliament . organizers deny allegations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waving the german flag in berlin 's olympic stadium organizers of the championship have rejected allegations that parliamentarians have been promised tickets , saying that there was only an agreement with the parliamentary sports committee to gather ticket requests and check whether they could be taken care of . nevertheless , the news about the special treatment granted to lawmakers has been raising the hackles of ordinary football fans who will have to wait until feb .
1 , when preliminary ticket sales are scheduled . three million tickets will be on sale for the championship .
but for every fan who secures a ticket , there will be at least ten other fans who will go away empty-handed .
in other words , the chance of actually getting a ticket are very slim .
and germans wo n't be given preferential treatment even though their country is hosting the tournament . cynics , commenting on the letter , have been echoing a famous quote by the british novelist george orwell .
" everyone ’ s equal in this country , " they say , " but some are more equal than others . " concern about dubious sellers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trophy 's a given , but tickets have not been designed yet but the deputy chief of the organizing committee , wolfgang niersbach , said he ’ s more concerned by the mushrooming of ticket sales by dubious agencies on the internet . " let me assure you that there are no tickets on the market yet at all , " he said .
" we ’ ve not even agreed yet on the design and the format of the tickets .
you can clearly see from this that there just can ’ t be any tickets up for sale at present . " niersbach added that those already selling tickets on the internet are probably hoping to secure some themselves and then re-sell them .
but there is no guarantee whatsoever that buyers will be refunded if sellers are unable to deliver , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a japanese soccer fan checks his world cup ticket next to an automatic ticket issuing counter during the world cup 2002 in tokyo " people who make use of the various offers on the internet need to be warned , " he said .
" these self-styled ticket agents are not be trusted .
so , anyone who chooses to buy tickets from them is running the high risk of losing a lot of money and never seeing any of the 2006 championship matches from inside a stadium in germany . " niersbach also pointed out that an agency by the name of ise-hospitality is the only one which has been granted a licence by fifa to sell championship tickets with vip status .

but while the man in the street is hoping that he ’ ll obtain one of the coveted tickets , german parliamentarians can reportedly take it easy . all of germany ’ s 603 federal members of parliament recently received a letter which is bound to be attended to far more quickly than most of the other correspondence in their in-trays . according to a report in saarbrücker zeitung on friday , the letter came from two members of the parliamentary sports committee and invited parliamentarians to pre-book two tickets each for a match of their choice in the preliminary round of the 2006 world soccer championship . the sports committee has admitted that it sent a special request to the organizing team of the championship to provide a fixed amount of tickets up front for the honorable members of parliament . organizers deny allegations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waving the german flag in berlin 's olympic stadium organizers of the championship have rejected allegations that parliamentarians have been promised tickets , saying that there was only an agreement with the parliamentary sports committee to gather ticket requests and check whether they could be taken care of . nevertheless , the news about the special treatment granted to lawmakers has been raising the hackles of ordinary football fans who will have to wait until feb .
1 , when preliminary ticket sales are scheduled . three million tickets will be on sale for the championship .
but for every fan who secures a ticket , there will be at least ten other fans who will go away empty-handed .
in other words , the chance of actually getting a ticket are very slim .
and germans wo n't be given preferential treatment even though their country is hosting the tournament . cynics , commenting on the letter , have been echoing a famous quote by the british novelist george orwell .
" everyone ’ s equal in this country , " they say , " but some are more equal than others . " concern about dubious sellers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trophy 's a given , but tickets have not been designed yet but the deputy chief of the organizing committee , wolfgang niersbach , said he ’ s more concerned by the mushrooming of ticket sales by dubious agencies on the internet . " let me assure you that there are no tickets on the market yet at all , " he said .
" we ’ ve not even agreed yet on the design and the format of the tickets .
you can clearly see from this that there just can ’ t be any tickets up for sale at present . " niersbach added that those already selling tickets on the internet are probably hoping to secure some themselves and then re-sell them .
but there is no guarantee whatsoever that buyers will be refunded if sellers are unable to deliver , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a japanese soccer fan checks his world cup ticket next to an automatic ticket issuing counter during the world cup 2002 in tokyo " people who make use of the various offers on the internet need to be warned , " he said .
" these self-styled ticket agents are not be trusted .
so , anyone who chooses to buy tickets from them is running the high risk of losing a lot of money and never seeing any of the 2006 championship matches from inside a stadium in germany . " niersbach also pointed out that an agency by the name of ise-hospitality is the only one which has been granted a licence by fifa to sell championship tickets with vip status .
the company has paid € 180 million -lrb- $ 239 million -rrb- for the licence which includes exclusive rights to provide catering facilities inside the stadiums . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german authorities close illegal world cup ticket site a website that was illegally offering tickets for the 2006 world cup in germany has been shut down by german authorities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.12.2004 ' tis the season to give großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collection pots are fuller at this time of year as christmas approaches , germans reach deeper into their pockets to give to the poor .
ever year , they donate some two billion euros , more than any other european country . in the days and weeks before christmas , ursula gerst receives a good deal of mail .
friends and relatives send greeting cards , and of course the insurance companies never forget to send bills for the new year .
but charities also write to the 77-year old , reminding her that christmas is a time to think of others and that the best way to do so is through donating a few euros to help out others less fortunate . “ i look at all their requests very carefully , ” she said .
“ and then i say to myself - because they keep writing and insisting – i really should donate something . ” it ’ s not a coincidence that charitable organizations increase their marketing efforts during the holiday season .
they know that germans are in the mood to give at this time of year .
of course , emotional pleas from wide-eyed and hungry children on television and posters help move even the stingiest grinch to donate money . give until it hurts despite a sputtering economy , rising unemployment and an overall financial insecurity at the moment , germans ’ willingness to spend money for a worthy cause is unbreakable .
in 2003 , they spent € 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- on charities , according to the central institute for social research . a quarter of all the money donated went towards culture and monument preservation as well as the protection of animals and the environment .
three-quarters – the greatest share of their donations - went towards humanitarian aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school project funded sos-kinderdorf in goma in the democratic republic of congo the chairman of the organization overseeing charities , bernd beder , said the catholic and protestant church were at the top of the list , followed by the sos-kinderdorf – an organization for the protection and welfare of children throughout the world – the red cross and the emergency aid service of the johanniter .
next on the list are the organizations caritas and unicef , world vision and various aid groups working with children . some 40 percent of all german adults donate money .
even if the amount spent varies greatly from person to person , statistics show that on average each spender donates € 66 every year to a good cause . but who are the people who year after year give money to help orphans in latin america or finance a school project in africa ?
the younger they are , the less they give ; and the older they are , the more generous they become , beder said . “ the older spenders contribute disproportionately more to the overall volume of donations , " he added .
" perhaps that ’ s a result of the older generations having more of a sense of charity ; but it could also simply be that older people have more money . ” contrary to an often heard rumor , women do not donate more than men .
beder said women may give to more charities more often , but the overall sum of their contributions is less – most likely owing to their generally lower incomes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those with less income realize how easy it is to slip below the poverty line and give to help others like cristine and her daughter pledano in haiti .
more interesting , he said , is the tendency among the poor to donate proportionately more than the wealthiest members of society , in terms of their financial resources . why donate ? there are some 500,000 registered organizations and approximately 12,000 foundations in germany .
nearly all of them are recorded as non-profitable .
that means , they can offer tax breaks for donations .
last year 7.5 million tax payers took advantage of the charitable donation clause to deduct from their tax payments , according to the federal statistics office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans give in the hopes of getting something back when they file their taxes but the revenue system and tax collectors don ’ t seem to be bothered by this loophole .
on the contrary , thomas hofmann , a cologne-based finance officer , said donations are actually good for the economy . “ when i donate money to a non-profitable organization , i help keep the charity afloat financially and it can build up its savings and doesn ’ t depend on state subsidies to survive , " he said .
" that ’ s one of the main reasons , why donations can be deducted from the taxes . ” that could also be another – albeit it less philanthropic – reason why germans like to donate more during the christmas season : they rediscover their charitable side just in time for a tax receipt to be written out for the next year ’ s tax forms . nadja baeva -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a supermarket for the poor shopping at a normal grocery store can sometimes push welfare recipients in germany to their financial limits .

1 , 2006 , according to several newspapers on saturday .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung cited a ministry official saying germany ’ s 16 states and federal government had agreed to draft new rules for jewish immigration .
the announcement would mean a reversal of the policy in effect since the collapse of the soviet union .
berlin began offering jews from the former soviet bloc the right to settle in the country in 1991 to help rebuild its own jewish communities .
by the end of 2003 , some 190,000 jews had taken up the offer to settle in germany .
but the fact that the number of the jewish immigrants coming to germany has exceeded those moving to israel from eastern europe has led to a policy rethink , according to the berliner zeitung .
the daily reported that around 9,400 ex-soviet jews were expected to come to germany this year , exceeding for the first time the number settling in israel by more than 1,000 .
the newspaper also said the berlin jewish community was under financial pressure because more than three-quarters of the immigrant jews were reliant on welfare payments .
new immigration rules will require potential immigrants to show knowledge of german and be under 45 years of age .
the applicants will also not be eligible for social aid , the berlin paper said . more briefs 18.12.2004 -pipe- next climate talks convene in germany 18.12.2004 -pipe- german pop music gets political boost 17.12.2004 -pipe- german federal reform fails 17.12.2004 -pipe- germany helps sweeten afghanistan 17.12.2004 -pipe- germany-based iraqis can vote 17.12.2004 -pipe- army officer arrested for corruption 17.12.2004 -pipe- spy gets probation in germany 16.12.2004 -pipe- soccer : germany beats japan 3-0 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

ever year , they donate some two billion euros , more than any other european country . in the days and weeks before christmas , ursula gerst receives a good deal of mail .
friends and relatives send greeting cards , and of course the insurance companies never forget to send bills for the new year .
but charities also write to the 77-year old , reminding her that christmas is a time to think of others and that the best way to do so is through donating a few euros to help out others less fortunate . “ i look at all their requests very carefully , ” she said .
“ and then i say to myself - because they keep writing and insisting – i really should donate something . ” it ’ s not a coincidence that charitable organizations increase their marketing efforts during the holiday season .
they know that germans are in the mood to give at this time of year .
of course , emotional pleas from wide-eyed and hungry children on television and posters help move even the stingiest grinch to donate money . give until it hurts despite a sputtering economy , rising unemployment and an overall financial insecurity at the moment , germans ’ willingness to spend money for a worthy cause is unbreakable .
in 2003 , they spent € 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- on charities , according to the central institute for social research . a quarter of all the money donated went towards culture and monument preservation as well as the protection of animals and the environment .
three-quarters – the greatest share of their donations - went towards humanitarian aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school project funded sos-kinderdorf in goma in the democratic republic of congo the chairman of the organization overseeing charities , bernd beder , said the catholic and protestant church were at the top of the list , followed by the sos-kinderdorf – an organization for the protection and welfare of children throughout the world – the red cross and the emergency aid service of the johanniter .
next on the list are the organizations caritas and unicef , world vision and various aid groups working with children . some 40 percent of all german adults donate money .
even if the amount spent varies greatly from person to person , statistics show that on average each spender donates € 66 every year to a good cause . but who are the people who year after year give money to help orphans in latin america or finance a school project in africa ?
the younger they are , the less they give ; and the older they are , the more generous they become , beder said . “ the older spenders contribute disproportionately more to the overall volume of donations , " he added .
" perhaps that ’ s a result of the older generations having more of a sense of charity ; but it could also simply be that older people have more money . ” contrary to an often heard rumor , women do not donate more than men .

but while the man in the street is hoping that he ’ ll obtain one of the coveted tickets , german parliamentarians can reportedly take it easy . all of germany ’ s 603 federal members of parliament recently received a letter which is bound to be attended to far more quickly than most of the other correspondence in their in-trays . according to a report in saarbrücker zeitung on friday , the letter came from two members of the parliamentary sports committee and invited parliamentarians to pre-book two tickets each for a match of their choice in the preliminary round of the 2006 world soccer championship . the sports committee has admitted that it sent a special request to the organizing team of the championship to provide a fixed amount of tickets up front for the honorable members of parliament . organizers deny allegations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waving the german flag in berlin 's olympic stadium organizers of the championship have rejected allegations that parliamentarians have been promised tickets , saying that there was only an agreement with the parliamentary sports committee to gather ticket requests and check whether they could be taken care of . nevertheless , the news about the special treatment granted to lawmakers has been raising the hackles of ordinary football fans who will have to wait until feb .
1 , when preliminary ticket sales are scheduled . three million tickets will be on sale for the championship .
but for every fan who secures a ticket , there will be at least ten other fans who will go away empty-handed .
in other words , the chance of actually getting a ticket are very slim .
and germans wo n't be given preferential treatment even though their country is hosting the tournament . cynics , commenting on the letter , have been echoing a famous quote by the british novelist george orwell .
" everyone ’ s equal in this country , " they say , " but some are more equal than others . " concern about dubious sellers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trophy 's a given , but tickets have not been designed yet but the deputy chief of the organizing committee , wolfgang niersbach , said he ’ s more concerned by the mushrooming of ticket sales by dubious agencies on the internet . " let me assure you that there are no tickets on the market yet at all , " he said .
" we ’ ve not even agreed yet on the design and the format of the tickets .
you can clearly see from this that there just can ’ t be any tickets up for sale at present . " niersbach added that those already selling tickets on the internet are probably hoping to secure some themselves and then re-sell them .
but there is no guarantee whatsoever that buyers will be refunded if sellers are unable to deliver , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a japanese soccer fan checks his world cup ticket next to an automatic ticket issuing counter during the world cup 2002 in tokyo " people who make use of the various offers on the internet need to be warned , " he said .
" these self-styled ticket agents are not be trusted .
so , anyone who chooses to buy tickets from them is running the high risk of losing a lot of money and never seeing any of the 2006 championship matches from inside a stadium in germany . " niersbach also pointed out that an agency by the name of ise-hospitality is the only one which has been granted a licence by fifa to sell championship tickets with vip status .

1 , 2006 , according to several newspapers on saturday .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung cited a ministry official saying germany ’ s 16 states and federal government had agreed to draft new rules for jewish immigration .
the announcement would mean a reversal of the policy in effect since the collapse of the soviet union .
berlin began offering jews from the former soviet bloc the right to settle in the country in 1991 to help rebuild its own jewish communities .
by the end of 2003 , some 190,000 jews had taken up the offer to settle in germany .
but the fact that the number of the jewish immigrants coming to germany has exceeded those moving to israel from eastern europe has led to a policy rethink , according to the berliner zeitung .
the daily reported that around 9,400 ex-soviet jews were expected to come to germany this year , exceeding for the first time the number settling in israel by more than 1,000 .
the newspaper also said the berlin jewish community was under financial pressure because more than three-quarters of the immigrant jews were reliant on welfare payments .
new immigration rules will require potential immigrants to show knowledge of german and be under 45 years of age .
the applicants will also not be eligible for social aid , the berlin paper said . more briefs 18.12.2004 -pipe- next climate talks convene in germany 18.12.2004 -pipe- german pop music gets political boost 17.12.2004 -pipe- german federal reform fails 17.12.2004 -pipe- germany helps sweeten afghanistan 17.12.2004 -pipe- germany-based iraqis can vote 17.12.2004 -pipe- army officer arrested for corruption 17.12.2004 -pipe- spy gets probation in germany 16.12.2004 -pipe- soccer : germany beats japan 3-0 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

compared to hardcore narcotics and cigarettes , coffee is relatively harmless , but it can have its side effects and lead to addiction , say scientists , who report that caffeine is popping up everywhere . caffeine , the active ingredient in a cup of coffee is a dependency-inducing psychoactive drug , which is being consumed at increasing rates , say scientists in the latest addition of national geographic deutschland . long before they start experimenting with alcohol and cigarettes , children are getting exposed to addictions in the form of caffeine in cola and chocolate .

with some 320 million cups of coffee consumed daily , germany is the world ’ s second largest coffee-importing and drinking nation , after the us . of course the coffee empire of starbucks has gone a long way to boosting caffeine consumption and making coffee drinking cool among the younger crowd , shied away from traditional cafes with their stale interiors and gilded porcelain cups .

compared to hardcore narcotics and cigarettes , coffee is relatively harmless , but it can have its side effects and lead to addiction , say scientists , who report that caffeine is popping up everywhere . caffeine , the active ingredient in a cup of coffee is a dependency-inducing psychoactive drug , which is being consumed at increasing rates , say scientists in the latest addition of national geographic deutschland . long before they start experimenting with alcohol and cigarettes , children are getting exposed to addictions in the form of caffeine in cola and chocolate .
even before birth , babies are consuming caffeine through the womb from coffee-drinking mothers .
traces of the drug have been found in day-old infants , the scientists report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder gets a quick-fix of coffee during a long parliamentary debate as a stimulant , caffeine influences various mental and physical functions .
it also can be addictive .
a person who regularly drinks three cups of coffee , for instance , will require at least one cup in order for the brain to work in “ normal ” mode .
many people attest to the fact that they can ’ t fully wake up in the morning without a fresh brew . the majority of scientists and doctors are of the opinion , however , that one to two cups of coffee a day can not hurt anyone .
the intentional misuse of caffeine is seldom .
only in the field of sports , where the consumption of more than six cups of coffee is considered doping , are cases of caffeine drug abuse heard of . the drug of choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cofe bars are the trendy way to consume the brew given the prevalence of coffee and other caffeinated beverages in today ’ s society , it ’ s not surprising that nearly everyone consumes the stimulant .
in germany , coffee has far surpassed beer as the nation ’ s favorite beverage .
with some 320 million cups of coffee consumed daily , germany is the world ’ s second largest coffee-importing and drinking nation , after the us . of course the coffee empire of starbucks has gone a long way to boosting caffeine consumption and making coffee drinking cool among the younger crowd , shied away from traditional cafes with their stale interiors and gilded porcelain cups .
every day the seattle-based company opens up four new shops around the world and hires on 200 new employees . but caffeine is also popping up in places one normally wouldn ’ t expect : in pain killers , in sports drinks , even in women ’ s stockings . the textile industry is the latest to discover the benefits of caffeine for the production of nylons .
the stimulant is woven into the fibers to create an uplifting , sliming effect on the upper thighs – a pick-me-up the majority of women certainly can appreciate as much as a good cup of joe . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conquering the world , one frappuccino at a time the first starbucks in berlin might as well have been the first starbucks in seattle or singapore for all it 's originality and local flair .

after the initial celebration , the doubts and worries are setting in . the eyes and ears of the turkish people were firmly tuned to brussels this past week , with the main television channels and newspapers providing blanket coverage of the european union summit .
much was at stake for the primarily muslim nation of 70 million people on the fringe of europe , and anything less than a definite “ yes ” vote from the 25 eu leaders could have spelled the end of turkey ’ s dreams of gaining entry into the illustrious bloc . up until the last minute , everything seemed possible , especially after the turkish delegation appeared on the verge of walking out over eu demands that ankara recognize the greek cypriot government , which became a member in may 2004 . deniz baykal , the leader of the main opposition people ’ s republican party , was one of the most critical voices .
“ the european union is demanding that turkey recognize the greek cypriot government as a precondition to starting accession talks .
if turkey agrees on that , then all the decades of struggle and effort will be erased , ” he said leading up to friday ’ s historic announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey sees itself as a bridge between europe and the middle east but even if such criticisms are likely to resonate within sections of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan ’ s ruling ak party and he has difficulty persuading opponents that he is not sacrificing the turkish cypriot community for ankara ’ s eu aspirations , the majority of the population is breathing a sigh of relief now that an agreement has been reached and a date set for accession talks to begin . looking ahead international relations expert soli ozel said securing a date for euu membership talks was of crucial importance to turkey , both politically and economically .
“ the start of accession negotiations is basically a seal of approval on the fact that turkey is not only eligible , but is ready as a very stable country to take on a role in which it can actually fulfil its maximum economic potential , ” he said . “ there are no longer any questions about the path turkey is on . ” indeed one of the first offshoots of the deal in brussels was that the turkish stock market soared to a record level once news of the accession agreement reached the market floor just before closing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish woman walks past a billboard showing the turkish flag blending with eu flag .
the billboard says " this star will go very well here . "
in taksim square at the heart of istanbul , similar feelings of optimism abounded , although less outright , and more tempered by the reality of the long road ahead .
it will be at least 10 years before turkey is ready for the european union and the average citizen is unlikely to profit much until then . akif emre , a turkish columnist for the pro-government yeni safak newspaper said the coming years will be a testing time for both turkey and the european union .
“ they are both about to embark on a unique experiment , ” he said . “ now that the european union accepts turkey it means we will live together as partners , but we will have different values .
the european union has different values from us – this is a historic testing , ” he said . “ i am not sure turkey and the european union will pass the exam .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.12.2004 turkey sobers up after eu dream großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the celebration , questions and doubts still remain brussels ’ announcement of a date to start eu membership talks comes as a relief to tukey , after the issue of cyprus threatened to derail negotiations .
after the initial celebration , the doubts and worries are setting in . the eyes and ears of the turkish people were firmly tuned to brussels this past week , with the main television channels and newspapers providing blanket coverage of the european union summit .
much was at stake for the primarily muslim nation of 70 million people on the fringe of europe , and anything less than a definite “ yes ” vote from the 25 eu leaders could have spelled the end of turkey ’ s dreams of gaining entry into the illustrious bloc . up until the last minute , everything seemed possible , especially after the turkish delegation appeared on the verge of walking out over eu demands that ankara recognize the greek cypriot government , which became a member in may 2004 . deniz baykal , the leader of the main opposition people ’ s republican party , was one of the most critical voices .
“ the european union is demanding that turkey recognize the greek cypriot government as a precondition to starting accession talks .
if turkey agrees on that , then all the decades of struggle and effort will be erased , ” he said leading up to friday ’ s historic announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey sees itself as a bridge between europe and the middle east but even if such criticisms are likely to resonate within sections of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan ’ s ruling ak party and he has difficulty persuading opponents that he is not sacrificing the turkish cypriot community for ankara ’ s eu aspirations , the majority of the population is breathing a sigh of relief now that an agreement has been reached and a date set for accession talks to begin . looking ahead international relations expert soli ozel said securing a date for euu membership talks was of crucial importance to turkey , both politically and economically .
“ the start of accession negotiations is basically a seal of approval on the fact that turkey is not only eligible , but is ready as a very stable country to take on a role in which it can actually fulfil its maximum economic potential , ” he said . “ there are no longer any questions about the path turkey is on . ” indeed one of the first offshoots of the deal in brussels was that the turkish stock market soared to a record level once news of the accession agreement reached the market floor just before closing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish woman walks past a billboard showing the turkish flag blending with eu flag .
the billboard says " this star will go very well here . "
in taksim square at the heart of istanbul , similar feelings of optimism abounded , although less outright , and more tempered by the reality of the long road ahead .
it will be at least 10 years before turkey is ready for the european union and the average citizen is unlikely to profit much until then . akif emre , a turkish columnist for the pro-government yeni safak newspaper said the coming years will be a testing time for both turkey and the european union .
“ they are both about to embark on a unique experiment , ” he said . “ now that the european union accepts turkey it means we will live together as partners , but we will have different values .
the european union has different values from us – this is a historic testing , ” he said . “ i am not sure turkey and the european union will pass the exam .
there are so many difficult ways in front of us , ” he added . dorian jones , istanbul send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough at eu-turkey talks turkey and the eu 's presidency struck an agreement friday to end an impasse blocking the launch of eu membership talks with ankara , a turkish diplomat said .

1 , 2006 , according to several newspapers on saturday .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung cited a ministry official saying germany ’ s 16 states and federal government had agreed to draft new rules for jewish immigration .
the announcement would mean a reversal of the policy in effect since the collapse of the soviet union .
berlin began offering jews from the former soviet bloc the right to settle in the country in 1991 to help rebuild its own jewish communities .
by the end of 2003 , some 190,000 jews had taken up the offer to settle in germany .
but the fact that the number of the jewish immigrants coming to germany has exceeded those moving to israel from eastern europe has led to a policy rethink , according to the berliner zeitung .
the daily reported that around 9,400 ex-soviet jews were expected to come to germany this year , exceeding for the first time the number settling in israel by more than 1,000 .
the newspaper also said the berlin jewish community was under financial pressure because more than three-quarters of the immigrant jews were reliant on welfare payments .
new immigration rules will require potential immigrants to show knowledge of german and be under 45 years of age .
the applicants will also not be eligible for social aid , the berlin paper said . more briefs 18.12.2004 -pipe- next climate talks convene in germany 18.12.2004 -pipe- german pop music gets political boost 17.12.2004 -pipe- german federal reform fails 17.12.2004 -pipe- germany helps sweeten afghanistan 17.12.2004 -pipe- germany-based iraqis can vote 17.12.2004 -pipe- army officer arrested for corruption 17.12.2004 -pipe- spy gets probation in germany 16.12.2004 -pipe- soccer : germany beats japan 3-0 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

us police believe they have found alive a baby girl who was taken from her murdered mother 's womb .
eight-months pregnant bobbi jo stinnett was found strangled in her missouri home on thursday .
her unborn child had been cut from her womb .
police raided a house in neighbouring kansas on friday and found what they believe is mrs stinnett 's baby .
a 36-year-old woman has been charged with kidnapping resulting in death , us attorney todd graves said .
mrs stinnett 's mother reportedly found her daughter at her home in the small missouri town of skidmore .
paramedics tried to revive her but she was pronounced dead at hospital .
police said they were now carrying out dna tests to confirm that the baby they found in kansas was mrs stinnett 's .
medical checks they have called off an alert issued following the baby 's disappearance .
" we 're confident we have the little girl that was taken from skidmore , " said nodaway county sheriff ben espey .
he said the baby " appears to be fine " .
" we have no indications that the child was hurt in any way .
the child is in hospital being checked out by paediatricians , " he added .
medical experts warn she could have suffered a variety of injuries during the assault , including lack of oxygen .

their creations , small synthetic vesicles that can process -lrb- express -rrb- genes , resemble a crude kind of biological cell .
the parts for their " vesicle bioreactors " , as they call them , all come from diverse realms of life .
the soft cell walls are made of fat molecules taken from egg white .
the cell contents are an extract of the common gut bug e. coli , stripped of all its genetic material .
this essence of life contains ready-made much of the biological machinery needed to make proteins ; the researchers also added an enzyme from a virus to allow the vesicle to translate dna code .
when they added genes , the cell fluid started to make proteins , just like a normal cell would .
jelly fish a gene for green fluorescent protein taken from a species of jellyfish was the first they tried .
the glow from the protein showed that the genes were being transcribed .
with a second gene , from the bacterium staphylococcus aureus , the researchers got their cells to make small pores in their walls .
some bacteria can survive with just a few hundred genes these let nutrients in from the surrounding " soup " , so that the cells could function , in some instances , for several days .
albert libchaber , who heads the project , stresses that these bioreactors are not alive - they 're performing simple chemical reactions that can also happen in cell-free biological fluids .
but the research is one strand in a new field called synthetic biology , where the aim is to re-design entire organisms , or recreate them from scratch .
the bio-entrepreneur craig venter , who headed the commercial venture to decode the human genome , is currently trying to strip a bacterium down to the minimum set of genes needed for survival .
synthetic virus two years ago , another team showed that polio viruses could assemble themselves from off-the-shelf chemical components mixed in a test-tube .
and several chemists are exploring the kinds of chemical reactions that may have preceded life .
albert libchaber 's hope is to build up towards a minimal synthetic organism , with a designed cell wall , and a mixture of gene circuits that would let it maintain itself like a living cell .
as these constructs become more lifelike , the rest of us will have to start rethinking the nature of life .
" this is rather philosophical , " says dr libchaber .
" for me , life is just like a machine - a machine with a computer program .
there 's no more to it than that .
but not everyone shares this point of view , " he told the bbc .
he also stresses that there is no danger in the experiments .
not only are his cells artificial , they can function only in the nutrient medium he supplies them .
he said : " if you take our system out of its environment , it just does n't function . "
