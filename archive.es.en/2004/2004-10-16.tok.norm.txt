another five people were killed in eastern kunar province when a remote-controlled bomb exploded after a crowd had gathered near a truck that had been set alight as it was delivering food to us bases , an afghan official said . afghans fear return of violence many afghans who voted in the country 's first presidential election said they hoped it would herald a new era of peace in the rugged land , wracked by decades of war and insurgency .
vote counting started in most areas on thursday after a delay caused by allegations of irregularities . it resumed saturday after a break friday for the start of the muslim holy month of ramadan , kicking off for the first time at the regional counting centers of western herat , eastern jalalabad and bamiyan .
" counting has begun again everywhere - in all eight regional counting centers , " said afghan electoral commission spokesman aykut tavsel . karzai steams ahead in estimated result with just 0.7 percent of estimated total votes counted , us-backed karzai , the pre-poll favorite , was far ahead with a 72 percent lead over his rivals .
he was trailed by former education minister yunus qanooni with 11 percent , the afghan joint electoral management body said on its website . in third place with just over nine percent was uzbek warlord abdul rashid dostam and in fourth was ethic hazara military strongman mohammed mohaqeq with 1.6 percent . afghanistan 's only female candidate masooda jalal was lying fifth with 1.4 percent of the votes .
the other 13 presidential candidates all had less that 1.1 percent of the ballots .
the initial count included votes from only seven of the country 's 34 provinces . allegations of fraud die down the elections were marred by allegations of fraud and mismanagement after supposedly indelible ink used to mark voters ' fingers and prevent multiple voting was found to wash off .
an international panel of experts was appointed at the last minute to investigate the complaints , averting a boycott called by disgruntled candidates , some of whom alleged the vote was rigged to favor karzai , and opening the way for the count to begin . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's kabul visit sparks criticism german chancellor schröder arrived in kabul on monday to , among other things , visit expected presidential election winner hamid karzai .

a last-minute promise would not be enough to avoid the security council . diplomats fear iran will miss last chance " i fear iran has moved towards a greater determination to continue its enrichment activities .
it will be difficult to get them to say we completely stop , " one senior eu diplomat told reporters after the meeting in washington .
iranian leaders insist on their legal right to carry out nuclear fuel enrichment , rather than discussing whether it is really in their national interest to do so , he said . the senior diplomat said the risk if iran were hauled before the security council was that tehran would retaliate by resuming enrichment and that each further step by the international community would prompt a move away from compliance .
" there is a risk of negative escalation , reciprocating every measure , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei .
if iran refuses to comply , the 25 eu member states would recommend the sending of the iranian case to the security council when they meet with mohammed el baradei and his international atomic energy agency board on nov .

diplomats predicted that eu leaders or foreign ministers might make a public statement to that effect in early november to build pressure . solana to offer incentives eu foreign policy chief javier solana was charged with devising a package of " carrots and sticks " to encourage iran to cooperate when he met with ministers earlier in the week .
among the " carrots " would be a commitment to resume stalled talks on an eu-iran trade and aid agreement and some more specific offer of energy cooperation , including a willingness to supply peaceful nuclear technology and fuel , the sources said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's mohsen mirdamadi with eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" the appearance of solana is a new element , " said a european diplomat in vienna .
" the eu three -lrb- germany , france and britain -rrb- has never been able to bring in the entire eu .
pulling everything together would be new . "
imprecision in an agreement struck with tehran by the three big eu powers - britain , france and germany - last october has led to a year of disputes . eu hopes for us assistance and influence eu officials acknowledge that europe alone can not offer iran big enough incentives to abandon what it insists is peaceful nuclear research , without the prospect of the united states ending its isolation of the islamic republic . the united states has so far publicly opposed offering any incentives to iran , which president george w. bush bracketed with iraq and north korea in 2002 as part of an " axis of evil . " hawks in the bush administration advocate isolating and punishing iran , and some influential u.s. neo-conservatives argue for a policy of " regime change " in tehran .

25 when the international atomic energy agency board meets in vienna .
a last-minute promise would not be enough to avoid the security council . diplomats fear iran will miss last chance " i fear iran has moved towards a greater determination to continue its enrichment activities .
it will be difficult to get them to say we completely stop , " one senior eu diplomat told reporters after the meeting in washington .
iranian leaders insist on their legal right to carry out nuclear fuel enrichment , rather than discussing whether it is really in their national interest to do so , he said . the senior diplomat said the risk if iran were hauled before the security council was that tehran would retaliate by resuming enrichment and that each further step by the international community would prompt a move away from compliance .
" there is a risk of negative escalation , reciprocating every measure , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei .
if iran refuses to comply , the 25 eu member states would recommend the sending of the iranian case to the security council when they meet with mohammed el baradei and his international atomic energy agency board on nov .
25 .
diplomats predicted that eu leaders or foreign ministers might make a public statement to that effect in early november to build pressure . solana to offer incentives eu foreign policy chief javier solana was charged with devising a package of " carrots and sticks " to encourage iran to cooperate when he met with ministers earlier in the week .
among the " carrots " would be a commitment to resume stalled talks on an eu-iran trade and aid agreement and some more specific offer of energy cooperation , including a willingness to supply peaceful nuclear technology and fuel , the sources said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's mohsen mirdamadi with eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" the appearance of solana is a new element , " said a european diplomat in vienna .
" the eu three -lrb- germany , france and britain -rrb- has never been able to bring in the entire eu .
pulling everything together would be new . "
imprecision in an agreement struck with tehran by the three big eu powers - britain , france and germany - last october has led to a year of disputes . eu hopes for us assistance and influence eu officials acknowledge that europe alone can not offer iran big enough incentives to abandon what it insists is peaceful nuclear research , without the prospect of the united states ending its isolation of the islamic republic . the united states has so far publicly opposed offering any incentives to iran , which president george w. bush bracketed with iraq and north korea in 2002 as part of an " axis of evil . " hawks in the bush administration advocate isolating and punishing iran , and some influential u.s. neo-conservatives argue for a policy of " regime change " in tehran .
like north korea , which may already have the bomb , iran wants a guarantee that its regime is left alone , diplomats say . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran vows to continue nuclear program statements made by iranian officials on tuesday confirmed earlier reports that uranium enrichment processes had begun in iran and that un pressure would not divert tehran from pursuing its nuclear program .

" we would be willing to consider any package that recognizes the full right of iran to enjoy peaceful nuclear technology within the framework of the npt -lrb- nuclear non-proliferation treaty -rrb- , " hossein mousavian , a senior national security official involved in the nuclear negotiations , said .
" but iran is not prepared for cessation .
any package including a cessation of fuel cycle work would be rejected by iran , " he added . mousavian said iran expected the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to recognize its right under the npt to possess the full nuclear fuel cycle .
if this were the case , he said the islamic republic was ready to consider extending its suspension of uranium enrichment and discuss new initiatives that would provide long-term guarantees that the process would never be diverted to military purposes . his comments came after britain , france and germany - who have been spearheading negotiations with iran - told the united states they will in the coming days offer iran incentives to persuade it to halt uranium enrichment activities . the so-called " eu three " will offer the package of inducements as a november 25 deadline looms for iran to comply with iaea demands to suspend uranium enrichment and come clean about its nuclear ambitions or be referred to the un security council for possible sanctions . eu package comes from mistrust , says iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant was iran 's first and is central to claims of a weapons program .
diplomats say the package would give iran access to imported nuclear fuel and other perks in return for a total suspension of its own work on the nuclear fuel cycle .
" iran is definitely open to confidence-building measures , full cooperation with the iaea , full transparency and all confidence building measures that are required to assure the world that all enrichment activities would always remain peaceful and never be for military purposes , " mousavian said . " if they have a mistrust of our future enrichment activities and fear its diversion to nuclear weapons , this chapter is open to the iaea to implement a mechanism that assures it remains peaceful . "
but he repeated that " the fuel cycle is definitely a legitimate right of every member " of the iaea .
" cessation would be discrimination against an iaea member in the implementation of the npt and safeguards , " he added . diplomats say they have been trying to convince iran to strike a " libya-style deal " , whereby the country surrenders some of its sensitive nuclear capabilities - such as the fuel cycle - in return for diplomatic and trade incentives .
while the talk has been of suspending or halting fuel cycle work , the europeans and the united states would eventually like to see iran give it up altogether . libyan model will not work on iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder and libyan leader moammar gadhafi .
but mousavian said iran was not libya .
" the libyan formula would not work with iran .
iran is a country with thousands of years of history , with huge human resources .
with such a nation , you can not talk and discuss like you do with libya .
and we have the technology already .
we have the know-how already , " he asserted . " we are prepared for the continuation of confidence-building measures .
but there are two conditions : that the rights of iran are respected and the contents of the package .
is it sellable ?
are they serious in implementing the package ? " " mistrust is bilateral .
if the americans and the europeans do not trust iran , we can not trust them . " iran has no interest in nuclear weapons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's armed forces display the shahab-3 missile , capable of carrying a nuclear warhead .
the official , responsible for foreign affairs within iran 's supreme national security council , also reiterated denials that the country was even interested in nuclear weapons .
" we really believe weapons of mass destruction do not bring security for any country .
not pakistan , india or israel .
they would never be able to use these weapons , so they are just for power prestige .
hundreds of millions of dollars spent for nothing , " he said . referring to the 1980-1988 war with iraq , he said " iran was the first victim of weapons of mass destruction after world war ii .
but we did not retaliate with mass destruction weapons : that is confidence building .

the burgeoning chinese arms industry is also catching up fast . and german arms are highly sought-after .

" nonetheless , the present government as well as its predecessors have been relatively restrained when it comes to exporting armored vehicles , " he explained .
" their export is only permitted to other nato and eu countries , with certain exceptions . " one of the most notable exceptions was a controversial delivery to saudi arabia of 36 german tanks equipped to detect wmd back in 1991 .
another is the planned deployment of german transport tanks in iraqi army training programs . arms report promotes transparency in 2000 , berlin began publishing an annual arms export report , which aims for public transparency by listing which countries receive military hardware from germany every year . " last year the main recipients of german arms included south korea , greece and turkey , " said michael brzoska .
" in earlier years , it was indonesia and israel . " germany has a history of supplying arms to israel , even though the ministry for defense supposedly operates a policy of limiting arms exports to conflict regions .

poor countries in particular are buying ever fewer weapons from abroad .
many fear that this drop in profits this has led to a less discerning arms export policy . military production as a mainstay michael brzoska stresses it 's important to look at individual cases .

" we would be willing to consider any package that recognizes the full right of iran to enjoy peaceful nuclear technology within the framework of the npt -lrb- nuclear non-proliferation treaty -rrb- , " hossein mousavian , a senior national security official involved in the nuclear negotiations , said .
" but iran is not prepared for cessation .
any package including a cessation of fuel cycle work would be rejected by iran , " he added . mousavian said iran expected the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to recognize its right under the npt to possess the full nuclear fuel cycle .
if this were the case , he said the islamic republic was ready to consider extending its suspension of uranium enrichment and discuss new initiatives that would provide long-term guarantees that the process would never be diverted to military purposes . his comments came after britain , france and germany - who have been spearheading negotiations with iran - told the united states they will in the coming days offer iran incentives to persuade it to halt uranium enrichment activities . the so-called " eu three " will offer the package of inducements as a november 25 deadline looms for iran to comply with iaea demands to suspend uranium enrichment and come clean about its nuclear ambitions or be referred to the un security council for possible sanctions . eu package comes from mistrust , says iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant was iran 's first and is central to claims of a weapons program .
diplomats say the package would give iran access to imported nuclear fuel and other perks in return for a total suspension of its own work on the nuclear fuel cycle .
" iran is definitely open to confidence-building measures , full cooperation with the iaea , full transparency and all confidence building measures that are required to assure the world that all enrichment activities would always remain peaceful and never be for military purposes , " mousavian said . " if they have a mistrust of our future enrichment activities and fear its diversion to nuclear weapons , this chapter is open to the iaea to implement a mechanism that assures it remains peaceful . "
but he repeated that " the fuel cycle is definitely a legitimate right of every member " of the iaea .
" cessation would be discrimination against an iaea member in the implementation of the npt and safeguards , " he added . diplomats say they have been trying to convince iran to strike a " libya-style deal " , whereby the country surrenders some of its sensitive nuclear capabilities - such as the fuel cycle - in return for diplomatic and trade incentives .

" we would be willing to consider any package that recognizes the full right of iran to enjoy peaceful nuclear technology within the framework of the npt -lrb- nuclear non-proliferation treaty -rrb- , " hossein mousavian , a senior national security official involved in the nuclear negotiations , said .
" but iran is not prepared for cessation .
any package including a cessation of fuel cycle work would be rejected by iran , " he added . mousavian said iran expected the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to recognize its right under the npt to possess the full nuclear fuel cycle .
if this were the case , he said the islamic republic was ready to consider extending its suspension of uranium enrichment and discuss new initiatives that would provide long-term guarantees that the process would never be diverted to military purposes . his comments came after britain , france and germany - who have been spearheading negotiations with iran - told the united states they will in the coming days offer iran incentives to persuade it to halt uranium enrichment activities . the so-called " eu three " will offer the package of inducements as a november 25 deadline looms for iran to comply with iaea demands to suspend uranium enrichment and come clean about its nuclear ambitions or be referred to the un security council for possible sanctions . eu package comes from mistrust , says iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant was iran 's first and is central to claims of a weapons program .
diplomats say the package would give iran access to imported nuclear fuel and other perks in return for a total suspension of its own work on the nuclear fuel cycle .
" iran is definitely open to confidence-building measures , full cooperation with the iaea , full transparency and all confidence building measures that are required to assure the world that all enrichment activities would always remain peaceful and never be for military purposes , " mousavian said . " if they have a mistrust of our future enrichment activities and fear its diversion to nuclear weapons , this chapter is open to the iaea to implement a mechanism that assures it remains peaceful . "
but he repeated that " the fuel cycle is definitely a legitimate right of every member " of the iaea .
" cessation would be discrimination against an iaea member in the implementation of the npt and safeguards , " he added . diplomats say they have been trying to convince iran to strike a " libya-style deal " , whereby the country surrenders some of its sensitive nuclear capabilities - such as the fuel cycle - in return for diplomatic and trade incentives .

another five people were killed in eastern kunar province when a remote-controlled bomb exploded after a crowd had gathered near a truck that had been set alight as it was delivering food to us bases , an afghan official said . afghans fear return of violence many afghans who voted in the country 's first presidential election said they hoped it would herald a new era of peace in the rugged land , wracked by decades of war and insurgency .
vote counting started in most areas on thursday after a delay caused by allegations of irregularities . it resumed saturday after a break friday for the start of the muslim holy month of ramadan , kicking off for the first time at the regional counting centers of western herat , eastern jalalabad and bamiyan .

the other 13 presidential candidates all had less that 1.1 percent of the ballots .
the initial count included votes from only seven of the country 's 34 provinces . allegations of fraud die down the elections were marred by allegations of fraud and mismanagement after supposedly indelible ink used to mark voters ' fingers and prevent multiple voting was found to wash off .
an international panel of experts was appointed at the last minute to investigate the complaints , averting a boycott called by disgruntled candidates , some of whom alleged the vote was rigged to favor karzai , and opening the way for the count to begin . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's kabul visit sparks criticism german chancellor schröder arrived in kabul on monday to , among other things , visit expected presidential election winner hamid karzai .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.10.2004 eu launches last ditch iran plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranians may have turned their backs on the eu one too many times eu officials have launched a final bid to persuade iran to comply with international nuclear guidelines in an attempt to save the islamic state from being hauled in front of the un security council . the european union called on the united states and russia for support as it launched last-ditch efforts to persuade iran to curtail its nuclear program on friday before the issue is referred to the u.n. security council . at a meeting of senior officials of the group of eight industrial powers in washington , the eu sought support for a plan to offer tehran economic and technological benefits if it halts all uranium enrichment activities that could enable it to build a bomb . senior iranian nuclear negotiator hassan rohani is expected to visit europe for talks in the next two weeks but the eu diplomats he is likely to meet with during his tour are not optimistic tehran will comply with the plan , even though iran is anxious not to be put in the dock at the security council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hasan rohani rohani would be told a suspension of enrichment-related activities would have to be clearly defined and verifiable before nov .
25 when the international atomic energy agency board meets in vienna .
a last-minute promise would not be enough to avoid the security council . diplomats fear iran will miss last chance " i fear iran has moved towards a greater determination to continue its enrichment activities .
it will be difficult to get them to say we completely stop , " one senior eu diplomat told reporters after the meeting in washington .
iranian leaders insist on their legal right to carry out nuclear fuel enrichment , rather than discussing whether it is really in their national interest to do so , he said . the senior diplomat said the risk if iran were hauled before the security council was that tehran would retaliate by resuming enrichment and that each further step by the international community would prompt a move away from compliance .
" there is a risk of negative escalation , reciprocating every measure , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei .
if iran refuses to comply , the 25 eu member states would recommend the sending of the iranian case to the security council when they meet with mohammed el baradei and his international atomic energy agency board on nov .
25 .
diplomats predicted that eu leaders or foreign ministers might make a public statement to that effect in early november to build pressure . solana to offer incentives eu foreign policy chief javier solana was charged with devising a package of " carrots and sticks " to encourage iran to cooperate when he met with ministers earlier in the week .
among the " carrots " would be a commitment to resume stalled talks on an eu-iran trade and aid agreement and some more specific offer of energy cooperation , including a willingness to supply peaceful nuclear technology and fuel , the sources said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's mohsen mirdamadi with eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" the appearance of solana is a new element , " said a european diplomat in vienna .
" the eu three -lrb- germany , france and britain -rrb- has never been able to bring in the entire eu .
pulling everything together would be new . "
imprecision in an agreement struck with tehran by the three big eu powers - britain , france and germany - last october has led to a year of disputes . eu hopes for us assistance and influence eu officials acknowledge that europe alone can not offer iran big enough incentives to abandon what it insists is peaceful nuclear research , without the prospect of the united states ending its isolation of the islamic republic . the united states has so far publicly opposed offering any incentives to iran , which president george w. bush bracketed with iraq and north korea in 2002 as part of an " axis of evil . " hawks in the bush administration advocate isolating and punishing iran , and some influential u.s. neo-conservatives argue for a policy of " regime change " in tehran .
like north korea , which may already have the bomb , iran wants a guarantee that its regime is left alone , diplomats say . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran vows to continue nuclear program statements made by iranian officials on tuesday confirmed earlier reports that uranium enrichment processes had begun in iran and that un pressure would not divert tehran from pursuing its nuclear program .

the burgeoning chinese arms industry is also catching up fast . and german arms are highly sought-after .
according to michael brzoska , a weapons expert at the bonn international center for conversion , the industry has two outstandingly good sellers . " along with ships , germany 's armored vehicles are in huge demand , " he told dw-radio .
" nonetheless , the present government as well as its predecessors have been relatively restrained when it comes to exporting armored vehicles , " he explained .
" their export is only permitted to other nato and eu countries , with certain exceptions . " one of the most notable exceptions was a controversial delivery to saudi arabia of 36 german tanks equipped to detect wmd back in 1991 .
another is the planned deployment of german transport tanks in iraqi army training programs . arms report promotes transparency in 2000 , berlin began publishing an annual arms export report , which aims for public transparency by listing which countries receive military hardware from germany every year . " last year the main recipients of german arms included south korea , greece and turkey , " said michael brzoska .
" in earlier years , it was indonesia and israel . " germany has a history of supplying arms to israel , even though the ministry for defense supposedly operates a policy of limiting arms exports to conflict regions .
critics point to germany 's sale of three " dolphin " -class submarines to israel in 1999 and 2000 as a clear breach of this policy and accuse germany of ignoring its potential complicity in the middle east nuclear-weapons build-up . international customers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german navy special forces wade ashore during exercises in the baltic sea .
israel is n't the only country with an interest in germany 's maritime military know-how .
india is another keen customer .
and another country , previously subject to a trade embargo and therefore absent from germany 's arms export report , is now set to top the list . " south africa is tipped to be germany 's biggest arms buyer because german shipyards have sold several warships to south africa which are about to be delivered , " explains michael brzoska . undiscerning arms export policies but nato and eu countries are still germany 's primary arms partners . at just 20 percent , exports to developing countries are modest in comparison , and that 's not just because of the arms export restrictions introduced by berlin four years ago . according to a us congress study , international investment in military hardware fell by 40 percent between 2000 and 2003 .
poor countries in particular are buying ever fewer weapons from abroad .
many fear that this drop in profits this has led to a less discerning arms export policy . military production as a mainstay michael brzoska stresses it 's important to look at individual cases .
" a lot has changed in turkey , for example , which has made it acceptable to reconsider possible tank exports there , " he pointed out . " i would be far more hesitant about exporting tanks to iraq , " he added .
" so far , germany has refrained from supplying weapons and munitions as armament aid , but in recent years there has been a broad willingness to approve sales to the middle east . " germany sells military hardware to a total 100 countries .
but with just 90,000 employees , its arms industry is not as extensive as might be expected .

many fear that this drop in profits this has led to a less discerning arms export policy . military production as a mainstay michael brzoska stresses it 's important to look at individual cases .
" a lot has changed in turkey , for example , which has made it acceptable to reconsider possible tank exports there , " he pointed out . " i would be far more hesitant about exporting tanks to iraq , " he added .
" so far , germany has refrained from supplying weapons and munitions as armament aid , but in recent years there has been a broad willingness to approve sales to the middle east . " germany sells military hardware to a total 100 countries .
but with just 90,000 employees , its arms industry is not as extensive as might be expected .
it makes up just one percent of the country 's total exports .
nonetheless , areas such as ship building depend on military production for survival . andreas noll -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany mulls tanks sale to turkey barely a week after the european commission recommended initiating membership talks with turkey , the german government is reportedly considering to deliver tanks to that country . -lrb- october 12 , 2004 -rrb- no german aid for israel sub purchase on his first official visit to israel , german defense minister peter struck said berlin supported strengthening israeli security defenses but it would not subsidize the purchase of german submarines .

it will be difficult to get them to say we completely stop , " one senior eu diplomat told reporters after the meeting in washington .
iranian leaders insist on their legal right to carry out nuclear fuel enrichment , rather than discussing whether it is really in their national interest to do so , he said . the senior diplomat said the risk if iran were hauled before the security council was that tehran would retaliate by resuming enrichment and that each further step by the international community would prompt a move away from compliance .
" there is a risk of negative escalation , reciprocating every measure , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei .

diplomats predicted that eu leaders or foreign ministers might make a public statement to that effect in early november to build pressure . solana to offer incentives eu foreign policy chief javier solana was charged with devising a package of " carrots and sticks " to encourage iran to cooperate when he met with ministers earlier in the week .
among the " carrots " would be a commitment to resume stalled talks on an eu-iran trade and aid agreement and some more specific offer of energy cooperation , including a willingness to supply peaceful nuclear technology and fuel , the sources said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's mohsen mirdamadi with eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" the appearance of solana is a new element , " said a european diplomat in vienna .
" the eu three -lrb- germany , france and britain -rrb- has never been able to bring in the entire eu .
pulling everything together would be new . "
imprecision in an agreement struck with tehran by the three big eu powers - britain , france and germany - last october has led to a year of disputes . eu hopes for us assistance and influence eu officials acknowledge that europe alone can not offer iran big enough incentives to abandon what it insists is peaceful nuclear research , without the prospect of the united states ending its isolation of the islamic republic . the united states has so far publicly opposed offering any incentives to iran , which president george w. bush bracketed with iraq and north korea in 2002 as part of an " axis of evil . " hawks in the bush administration advocate isolating and punishing iran , and some influential u.s. neo-conservatives argue for a policy of " regime change " in tehran .

" we would be willing to consider any package that recognizes the full right of iran to enjoy peaceful nuclear technology within the framework of the npt -lrb- nuclear non-proliferation treaty -rrb- , " hossein mousavian , a senior national security official involved in the nuclear negotiations , said .
" but iran is not prepared for cessation .
any package including a cessation of fuel cycle work would be rejected by iran , " he added . mousavian said iran expected the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to recognize its right under the npt to possess the full nuclear fuel cycle .
if this were the case , he said the islamic republic was ready to consider extending its suspension of uranium enrichment and discuss new initiatives that would provide long-term guarantees that the process would never be diverted to military purposes . his comments came after britain , france and germany - who have been spearheading negotiations with iran - told the united states they will in the coming days offer iran incentives to persuade it to halt uranium enrichment activities . the so-called " eu three " will offer the package of inducements as a november 25 deadline looms for iran to comply with iaea demands to suspend uranium enrichment and come clean about its nuclear ambitions or be referred to the un security council for possible sanctions . eu package comes from mistrust , says iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant was iran 's first and is central to claims of a weapons program .
diplomats say the package would give iran access to imported nuclear fuel and other perks in return for a total suspension of its own work on the nuclear fuel cycle .
" iran is definitely open to confidence-building measures , full cooperation with the iaea , full transparency and all confidence building measures that are required to assure the world that all enrichment activities would always remain peaceful and never be for military purposes , " mousavian said .

" we would be willing to consider any package that recognizes the full right of iran to enjoy peaceful nuclear technology within the framework of the npt -lrb- nuclear non-proliferation treaty -rrb- , " hossein mousavian , a senior national security official involved in the nuclear negotiations , said .
" but iran is not prepared for cessation .
any package including a cessation of fuel cycle work would be rejected by iran , " he added . mousavian said iran expected the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to recognize its right under the npt to possess the full nuclear fuel cycle .
if this were the case , he said the islamic republic was ready to consider extending its suspension of uranium enrichment and discuss new initiatives that would provide long-term guarantees that the process would never be diverted to military purposes . his comments came after britain , france and germany - who have been spearheading negotiations with iran - told the united states they will in the coming days offer iran incentives to persuade it to halt uranium enrichment activities . the so-called " eu three " will offer the package of inducements as a november 25 deadline looms for iran to comply with iaea demands to suspend uranium enrichment and come clean about its nuclear ambitions or be referred to the un security council for possible sanctions . eu package comes from mistrust , says iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant was iran 's first and is central to claims of a weapons program .
diplomats say the package would give iran access to imported nuclear fuel and other perks in return for a total suspension of its own work on the nuclear fuel cycle .
" iran is definitely open to confidence-building measures , full cooperation with the iaea , full transparency and all confidence building measures that are required to assure the world that all enrichment activities would always remain peaceful and never be for military purposes , " mousavian said . " if they have a mistrust of our future enrichment activities and fear its diversion to nuclear weapons , this chapter is open to the iaea to implement a mechanism that assures it remains peaceful .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.10.2004 german military hardware in international demand großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fuchs tanks are sought-after military hardware germany might not quite rival the us and russia when it comes to weapons exports , but it still accounts for up to six percent of the global arms market . although the german foreign office insists that its " traditionally restrictive arms export policy dovetails with the country 's foreign and security policy , aimed at preserving peace , " germany is among the world 's top ten arms manufacturers , along with france and britain .
the burgeoning chinese arms industry is also catching up fast . and german arms are highly sought-after .
according to michael brzoska , a weapons expert at the bonn international center for conversion , the industry has two outstandingly good sellers . " along with ships , germany 's armored vehicles are in huge demand , " he told dw-radio .
" nonetheless , the present government as well as its predecessors have been relatively restrained when it comes to exporting armored vehicles , " he explained .
" their export is only permitted to other nato and eu countries , with certain exceptions . " one of the most notable exceptions was a controversial delivery to saudi arabia of 36 german tanks equipped to detect wmd back in 1991 .
another is the planned deployment of german transport tanks in iraqi army training programs . arms report promotes transparency in 2000 , berlin began publishing an annual arms export report , which aims for public transparency by listing which countries receive military hardware from germany every year . " last year the main recipients of german arms included south korea , greece and turkey , " said michael brzoska .
" in earlier years , it was indonesia and israel . " germany has a history of supplying arms to israel , even though the ministry for defense supposedly operates a policy of limiting arms exports to conflict regions .
critics point to germany 's sale of three " dolphin " -class submarines to israel in 1999 and 2000 as a clear breach of this policy and accuse germany of ignoring its potential complicity in the middle east nuclear-weapons build-up . international customers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german navy special forces wade ashore during exercises in the baltic sea .
israel is n't the only country with an interest in germany 's maritime military know-how .
india is another keen customer .
and another country , previously subject to a trade embargo and therefore absent from germany 's arms export report , is now set to top the list . " south africa is tipped to be germany 's biggest arms buyer because german shipyards have sold several warships to south africa which are about to be delivered , " explains michael brzoska . undiscerning arms export policies but nato and eu countries are still germany 's primary arms partners . at just 20 percent , exports to developing countries are modest in comparison , and that 's not just because of the arms export restrictions introduced by berlin four years ago . according to a us congress study , international investment in military hardware fell by 40 percent between 2000 and 2003 .
poor countries in particular are buying ever fewer weapons from abroad .
many fear that this drop in profits this has led to a less discerning arms export policy . military production as a mainstay michael brzoska stresses it 's important to look at individual cases .
" a lot has changed in turkey , for example , which has made it acceptable to reconsider possible tank exports there , " he pointed out . " i would be far more hesitant about exporting tanks to iraq , " he added .
" so far , germany has refrained from supplying weapons and munitions as armament aid , but in recent years there has been a broad willingness to approve sales to the middle east . " germany sells military hardware to a total 100 countries .
but with just 90,000 employees , its arms industry is not as extensive as might be expected .
it makes up just one percent of the country 's total exports .
nonetheless , areas such as ship building depend on military production for survival . andreas noll -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany mulls tanks sale to turkey barely a week after the european commission recommended initiating membership talks with turkey , the german government is reportedly considering to deliver tanks to that country . -lrb- october 12 , 2004 -rrb- no german aid for israel sub purchase on his first official visit to israel , german defense minister peter struck said berlin supported strengthening israeli security defenses but it would not subsidize the purchase of german submarines .

another five people were killed in eastern kunar province when a remote-controlled bomb exploded after a crowd had gathered near a truck that had been set alight as it was delivering food to us bases , an afghan official said . afghans fear return of violence many afghans who voted in the country 's first presidential election said they hoped it would herald a new era of peace in the rugged land , wracked by decades of war and insurgency .
vote counting started in most areas on thursday after a delay caused by allegations of irregularities . it resumed saturday after a break friday for the start of the muslim holy month of ramadan , kicking off for the first time at the regional counting centers of western herat , eastern jalalabad and bamiyan .
" counting has begun again everywhere - in all eight regional counting centers , " said afghan electoral commission spokesman aykut tavsel . karzai steams ahead in estimated result with just 0.7 percent of estimated total votes counted , us-backed karzai , the pre-poll favorite , was far ahead with a 72 percent lead over his rivals .
he was trailed by former education minister yunus qanooni with 11 percent , the afghan joint electoral management body said on its website . in third place with just over nine percent was uzbek warlord abdul rashid dostam and in fourth was ethic hazara military strongman mohammed mohaqeq with 1.6 percent . afghanistan 's only female candidate masooda jalal was lying fifth with 1.4 percent of the votes .
the other 13 presidential candidates all had less that 1.1 percent of the ballots .
the initial count included votes from only seven of the country 's 34 provinces . allegations of fraud die down the elections were marred by allegations of fraud and mismanagement after supposedly indelible ink used to mark voters ' fingers and prevent multiple voting was found to wash off .
an international panel of experts was appointed at the last minute to investigate the complaints , averting a boycott called by disgruntled candidates , some of whom alleged the vote was rigged to favor karzai , and opening the way for the count to begin . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's kabul visit sparks criticism german chancellor schröder arrived in kabul on monday to , among other things , visit expected presidential election winner hamid karzai .

if this were the case , he said the islamic republic was ready to consider extending its suspension of uranium enrichment and discuss new initiatives that would provide long-term guarantees that the process would never be diverted to military purposes . his comments came after britain , france and germany - who have been spearheading negotiations with iran - told the united states they will in the coming days offer iran incentives to persuade it to halt uranium enrichment activities . the so-called " eu three " will offer the package of inducements as a november 25 deadline looms for iran to comply with iaea demands to suspend uranium enrichment and come clean about its nuclear ambitions or be referred to the un security council for possible sanctions . eu package comes from mistrust , says iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant was iran 's first and is central to claims of a weapons program .
diplomats say the package would give iran access to imported nuclear fuel and other perks in return for a total suspension of its own work on the nuclear fuel cycle .
" iran is definitely open to confidence-building measures , full cooperation with the iaea , full transparency and all confidence building measures that are required to assure the world that all enrichment activities would always remain peaceful and never be for military purposes , " mousavian said . " if they have a mistrust of our future enrichment activities and fear its diversion to nuclear weapons , this chapter is open to the iaea to implement a mechanism that assures it remains peaceful . "
but he repeated that " the fuel cycle is definitely a legitimate right of every member " of the iaea .
" cessation would be discrimination against an iaea member in the implementation of the npt and safeguards , " he added . diplomats say they have been trying to convince iran to strike a " libya-style deal " , whereby the country surrenders some of its sensitive nuclear capabilities - such as the fuel cycle - in return for diplomatic and trade incentives .

another five people were killed in eastern kunar province when a remote-controlled bomb exploded after a crowd had gathered near a truck that had been set alight as it was delivering food to us bases , an afghan official said . afghans fear return of violence many afghans who voted in the country 's first presidential election said they hoped it would herald a new era of peace in the rugged land , wracked by decades of war and insurgency .
vote counting started in most areas on thursday after a delay caused by allegations of irregularities . it resumed saturday after a break friday for the start of the muslim holy month of ramadan , kicking off for the first time at the regional counting centers of western herat , eastern jalalabad and bamiyan .
" counting has begun again everywhere - in all eight regional counting centers , " said afghan electoral commission spokesman aykut tavsel . karzai steams ahead in estimated result with just 0.7 percent of estimated total votes counted , us-backed karzai , the pre-poll favorite , was far ahead with a 72 percent lead over his rivals .

the other 13 presidential candidates all had less that 1.1 percent of the ballots .
the initial count included votes from only seven of the country 's 34 provinces . allegations of fraud die down the elections were marred by allegations of fraud and mismanagement after supposedly indelible ink used to mark voters ' fingers and prevent multiple voting was found to wash off .

the burgeoning chinese arms industry is also catching up fast . and german arms are highly sought-after .
according to michael brzoska , a weapons expert at the bonn international center for conversion , the industry has two outstandingly good sellers . " along with ships , germany 's armored vehicles are in huge demand , " he told dw-radio .
" nonetheless , the present government as well as its predecessors have been relatively restrained when it comes to exporting armored vehicles , " he explained .
" their export is only permitted to other nato and eu countries , with certain exceptions . " one of the most notable exceptions was a controversial delivery to saudi arabia of 36 german tanks equipped to detect wmd back in 1991 .
another is the planned deployment of german transport tanks in iraqi army training programs . arms report promotes transparency in 2000 , berlin began publishing an annual arms export report , which aims for public transparency by listing which countries receive military hardware from germany every year . " last year the main recipients of german arms included south korea , greece and turkey , " said michael brzoska .
" in earlier years , it was indonesia and israel . " germany has a history of supplying arms to israel , even though the ministry for defense supposedly operates a policy of limiting arms exports to conflict regions .
critics point to germany 's sale of three " dolphin " -class submarines to israel in 1999 and 2000 as a clear breach of this policy and accuse germany of ignoring its potential complicity in the middle east nuclear-weapons build-up . international customers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german navy special forces wade ashore during exercises in the baltic sea .

and another country , previously subject to a trade embargo and therefore absent from germany 's arms export report , is now set to top the list . " south africa is tipped to be germany 's biggest arms buyer because german shipyards have sold several warships to south africa which are about to be delivered , " explains michael brzoska . undiscerning arms export policies but nato and eu countries are still germany 's primary arms partners . at just 20 percent , exports to developing countries are modest in comparison , and that 's not just because of the arms export restrictions introduced by berlin four years ago . according to a us congress study , international investment in military hardware fell by 40 percent between 2000 and 2003 .
poor countries in particular are buying ever fewer weapons from abroad .
many fear that this drop in profits this has led to a less discerning arms export policy . military production as a mainstay michael brzoska stresses it 's important to look at individual cases .
" a lot has changed in turkey , for example , which has made it acceptable to reconsider possible tank exports there , " he pointed out . " i would be far more hesitant about exporting tanks to iraq , " he added .
" so far , germany has refrained from supplying weapons and munitions as armament aid , but in recent years there has been a broad willingness to approve sales to the middle east . " germany sells military hardware to a total 100 countries .
but with just 90,000 employees , its arms industry is not as extensive as might be expected .
it makes up just one percent of the country 's total exports .

" we would be willing to consider any package that recognizes the full right of iran to enjoy peaceful nuclear technology within the framework of the npt -lrb- nuclear non-proliferation treaty -rrb- , " hossein mousavian , a senior national security official involved in the nuclear negotiations , said .
" but iran is not prepared for cessation .
any package including a cessation of fuel cycle work would be rejected by iran , " he added . mousavian said iran expected the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to recognize its right under the npt to possess the full nuclear fuel cycle .
if this were the case , he said the islamic republic was ready to consider extending its suspension of uranium enrichment and discuss new initiatives that would provide long-term guarantees that the process would never be diverted to military purposes . his comments came after britain , france and germany - who have been spearheading negotiations with iran - told the united states they will in the coming days offer iran incentives to persuade it to halt uranium enrichment activities . the so-called " eu three " will offer the package of inducements as a november 25 deadline looms for iran to comply with iaea demands to suspend uranium enrichment and come clean about its nuclear ambitions or be referred to the un security council for possible sanctions . eu package comes from mistrust , says iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant was iran 's first and is central to claims of a weapons program .
diplomats say the package would give iran access to imported nuclear fuel and other perks in return for a total suspension of its own work on the nuclear fuel cycle .
" iran is definitely open to confidence-building measures , full cooperation with the iaea , full transparency and all confidence building measures that are required to assure the world that all enrichment activities would always remain peaceful and never be for military purposes , " mousavian said . " if they have a mistrust of our future enrichment activities and fear its diversion to nuclear weapons , this chapter is open to the iaea to implement a mechanism that assures it remains peaceful . "
but he repeated that " the fuel cycle is definitely a legitimate right of every member " of the iaea .
" cessation would be discrimination against an iaea member in the implementation of the npt and safeguards , " he added . diplomats say they have been trying to convince iran to strike a " libya-style deal " , whereby the country surrenders some of its sensitive nuclear capabilities - such as the fuel cycle - in return for diplomatic and trade incentives .
while the talk has been of suspending or halting fuel cycle work , the europeans and the united states would eventually like to see iran give it up altogether . libyan model will not work on iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder and libyan leader moammar gadhafi .
but mousavian said iran was not libya .
" the libyan formula would not work with iran .
iran is a country with thousands of years of history , with huge human resources .
with such a nation , you can not talk and discuss like you do with libya .
and we have the technology already .
we have the know-how already , " he asserted . " we are prepared for the continuation of confidence-building measures .
but there are two conditions : that the rights of iran are respected and the contents of the package .
is it sellable ?
are they serious in implementing the package ? " " mistrust is bilateral .
if the americans and the europeans do not trust iran , we can not trust them . " iran has no interest in nuclear weapons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's armed forces display the shahab-3 missile , capable of carrying a nuclear warhead .
the official , responsible for foreign affairs within iran 's supreme national security council , also reiterated denials that the country was even interested in nuclear weapons .
" we really believe weapons of mass destruction do not bring security for any country .
not pakistan , india or israel .
they would never be able to use these weapons , so they are just for power prestige .
hundreds of millions of dollars spent for nothing , " he said . referring to the 1980-1988 war with iraq , he said " iran was the first victim of weapons of mass destruction after world war ii .

another five people were killed in eastern kunar province when a remote-controlled bomb exploded after a crowd had gathered near a truck that had been set alight as it was delivering food to us bases , an afghan official said . afghans fear return of violence many afghans who voted in the country 's first presidential election said they hoped it would herald a new era of peace in the rugged land , wracked by decades of war and insurgency .
vote counting started in most areas on thursday after a delay caused by allegations of irregularities . it resumed saturday after a break friday for the start of the muslim holy month of ramadan , kicking off for the first time at the regional counting centers of western herat , eastern jalalabad and bamiyan .

he was trailed by former education minister yunus qanooni with 11 percent , the afghan joint electoral management body said on its website . in third place with just over nine percent was uzbek warlord abdul rashid dostam and in fourth was ethic hazara military strongman mohammed mohaqeq with 1.6 percent . afghanistan 's only female candidate masooda jalal was lying fifth with 1.4 percent of the votes .
the other 13 presidential candidates all had less that 1.1 percent of the ballots .
the initial count included votes from only seven of the country 's 34 provinces . allegations of fraud die down the elections were marred by allegations of fraud and mismanagement after supposedly indelible ink used to mark voters ' fingers and prevent multiple voting was found to wash off .
an international panel of experts was appointed at the last minute to investigate the complaints , averting a boycott called by disgruntled candidates , some of whom alleged the vote was rigged to favor karzai , and opening the way for the count to begin . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's kabul visit sparks criticism german chancellor schröder arrived in kabul on monday to , among other things , visit expected presidential election winner hamid karzai .
but opposition candidates have accused him of favoritism .
-lrb- october 11 , 2004 -rrb- germany cheers afghan vote german foreign minister joschka fischer on sunday hailed afghanistan 's first-ever presidential election as an " impressive success " that put the country firmly on the road to democracy and stability .

" we would be willing to consider any package that recognizes the full right of iran to enjoy peaceful nuclear technology within the framework of the npt -lrb- nuclear non-proliferation treaty -rrb- , " hossein mousavian , a senior national security official involved in the nuclear negotiations , said .
" but iran is not prepared for cessation .
any package including a cessation of fuel cycle work would be rejected by iran , " he added . mousavian said iran expected the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to recognize its right under the npt to possess the full nuclear fuel cycle .
if this were the case , he said the islamic republic was ready to consider extending its suspension of uranium enrichment and discuss new initiatives that would provide long-term guarantees that the process would never be diverted to military purposes . his comments came after britain , france and germany - who have been spearheading negotiations with iran - told the united states they will in the coming days offer iran incentives to persuade it to halt uranium enrichment activities . the so-called " eu three " will offer the package of inducements as a november 25 deadline looms for iran to comply with iaea demands to suspend uranium enrichment and come clean about its nuclear ambitions or be referred to the un security council for possible sanctions . eu package comes from mistrust , says iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant was iran 's first and is central to claims of a weapons program .
diplomats say the package would give iran access to imported nuclear fuel and other perks in return for a total suspension of its own work on the nuclear fuel cycle .
" iran is definitely open to confidence-building measures , full cooperation with the iaea , full transparency and all confidence building measures that are required to assure the world that all enrichment activities would always remain peaceful and never be for military purposes , " mousavian said . " if they have a mistrust of our future enrichment activities and fear its diversion to nuclear weapons , this chapter is open to the iaea to implement a mechanism that assures it remains peaceful . "
but he repeated that " the fuel cycle is definitely a legitimate right of every member " of the iaea .
" cessation would be discrimination against an iaea member in the implementation of the npt and safeguards , " he added . diplomats say they have been trying to convince iran to strike a " libya-style deal " , whereby the country surrenders some of its sensitive nuclear capabilities - such as the fuel cycle - in return for diplomatic and trade incentives .
while the talk has been of suspending or halting fuel cycle work , the europeans and the united states would eventually like to see iran give it up altogether . libyan model will not work on iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder and libyan leader moammar gadhafi .
but mousavian said iran was not libya .
" the libyan formula would not work with iran .
iran is a country with thousands of years of history , with huge human resources .
with such a nation , you can not talk and discuss like you do with libya .
and we have the technology already .
we have the know-how already , " he asserted . " we are prepared for the continuation of confidence-building measures .
but there are two conditions : that the rights of iran are respected and the contents of the package .

they would never be able to use these weapons , so they are just for power prestige .
hundreds of millions of dollars spent for nothing , " he said . referring to the 1980-1988 war with iraq , he said " iran was the first victim of weapons of mass destruction after world war ii .

" we would be willing to consider any package that recognizes the full right of iran to enjoy peaceful nuclear technology within the framework of the npt -lrb- nuclear non-proliferation treaty -rrb- , " hossein mousavian , a senior national security official involved in the nuclear negotiations , said .
" but iran is not prepared for cessation .
any package including a cessation of fuel cycle work would be rejected by iran , " he added . mousavian said iran expected the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to recognize its right under the npt to possess the full nuclear fuel cycle .
if this were the case , he said the islamic republic was ready to consider extending its suspension of uranium enrichment and discuss new initiatives that would provide long-term guarantees that the process would never be diverted to military purposes . his comments came after britain , france and germany - who have been spearheading negotiations with iran - told the united states they will in the coming days offer iran incentives to persuade it to halt uranium enrichment activities . the so-called " eu three " will offer the package of inducements as a november 25 deadline looms for iran to comply with iaea demands to suspend uranium enrichment and come clean about its nuclear ambitions or be referred to the un security council for possible sanctions . eu package comes from mistrust , says iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant was iran 's first and is central to claims of a weapons program .
diplomats say the package would give iran access to imported nuclear fuel and other perks in return for a total suspension of its own work on the nuclear fuel cycle .
" iran is definitely open to confidence-building measures , full cooperation with the iaea , full transparency and all confidence building measures that are required to assure the world that all enrichment activities would always remain peaceful and never be for military purposes , " mousavian said . " if they have a mistrust of our future enrichment activities and fear its diversion to nuclear weapons , this chapter is open to the iaea to implement a mechanism that assures it remains peaceful . "
but he repeated that " the fuel cycle is definitely a legitimate right of every member " of the iaea .
" cessation would be discrimination against an iaea member in the implementation of the npt and safeguards , " he added . diplomats say they have been trying to convince iran to strike a " libya-style deal " , whereby the country surrenders some of its sensitive nuclear capabilities - such as the fuel cycle - in return for diplomatic and trade incentives .
while the talk has been of suspending or halting fuel cycle work , the europeans and the united states would eventually like to see iran give it up altogether . libyan model will not work on iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder and libyan leader moammar gadhafi .
but mousavian said iran was not libya .
" the libyan formula would not work with iran .
iran is a country with thousands of years of history , with huge human resources .
with such a nation , you can not talk and discuss like you do with libya .
and we have the technology already .
we have the know-how already , " he asserted . " we are prepared for the continuation of confidence-building measures .
but there are two conditions : that the rights of iran are respected and the contents of the package .
is it sellable ?
are they serious in implementing the package ? " " mistrust is bilateral .
if the americans and the europeans do not trust iran , we can not trust them . " iran has no interest in nuclear weapons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's armed forces display the shahab-3 missile , capable of carrying a nuclear warhead .
the official , responsible for foreign affairs within iran 's supreme national security council , also reiterated denials that the country was even interested in nuclear weapons .
" we really believe weapons of mass destruction do not bring security for any country .
not pakistan , india or israel .
they would never be able to use these weapons , so they are just for power prestige .
hundreds of millions of dollars spent for nothing , " he said . referring to the 1980-1988 war with iraq , he said " iran was the first victim of weapons of mass destruction after world war ii .

a last-minute promise would not be enough to avoid the security council . diplomats fear iran will miss last chance " i fear iran has moved towards a greater determination to continue its enrichment activities .
it will be difficult to get them to say we completely stop , " one senior eu diplomat told reporters after the meeting in washington .
iranian leaders insist on their legal right to carry out nuclear fuel enrichment , rather than discussing whether it is really in their national interest to do so , he said . the senior diplomat said the risk if iran were hauled before the security council was that tehran would retaliate by resuming enrichment and that each further step by the international community would prompt a move away from compliance .
" there is a risk of negative escalation , reciprocating every measure , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei .
if iran refuses to comply , the 25 eu member states would recommend the sending of the iranian case to the security council when they meet with mohammed el baradei and his international atomic energy agency board on nov .
25 .
diplomats predicted that eu leaders or foreign ministers might make a public statement to that effect in early november to build pressure . solana to offer incentives eu foreign policy chief javier solana was charged with devising a package of " carrots and sticks " to encourage iran to cooperate when he met with ministers earlier in the week .
among the " carrots " would be a commitment to resume stalled talks on an eu-iran trade and aid agreement and some more specific offer of energy cooperation , including a willingness to supply peaceful nuclear technology and fuel , the sources said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's mohsen mirdamadi with eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" the appearance of solana is a new element , " said a european diplomat in vienna .
" the eu three -lrb- germany , france and britain -rrb- has never been able to bring in the entire eu .
pulling everything together would be new . "
imprecision in an agreement struck with tehran by the three big eu powers - britain , france and germany - last october has led to a year of disputes . eu hopes for us assistance and influence eu officials acknowledge that europe alone can not offer iran big enough incentives to abandon what it insists is peaceful nuclear research , without the prospect of the united states ending its isolation of the islamic republic . the united states has so far publicly opposed offering any incentives to iran , which president george w. bush bracketed with iraq and north korea in 2002 as part of an " axis of evil . " hawks in the bush administration advocate isolating and punishing iran , and some influential u.s. neo-conservatives argue for a policy of " regime change " in tehran .
like north korea , which may already have the bomb , iran wants a guarantee that its regime is left alone , diplomats say . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran vows to continue nuclear program statements made by iranian officials on tuesday confirmed earlier reports that uranium enrichment processes had begun in iran and that un pressure would not divert tehran from pursuing its nuclear program .
-lrb- september 21 , 2004 -rrb- iran rejects un nuclear demands iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani referred to demands from the international atomic energy agency to freeze all work on uranium enrichment as " illegal " .

25 when the international atomic energy agency board meets in vienna .
a last-minute promise would not be enough to avoid the security council . diplomats fear iran will miss last chance " i fear iran has moved towards a greater determination to continue its enrichment activities .
it will be difficult to get them to say we completely stop , " one senior eu diplomat told reporters after the meeting in washington .
iranian leaders insist on their legal right to carry out nuclear fuel enrichment , rather than discussing whether it is really in their national interest to do so , he said . the senior diplomat said the risk if iran were hauled before the security council was that tehran would retaliate by resuming enrichment and that each further step by the international community would prompt a move away from compliance .
" there is a risk of negative escalation , reciprocating every measure , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei .

" we would be willing to consider any package that recognizes the full right of iran to enjoy peaceful nuclear technology within the framework of the npt -lrb- nuclear non-proliferation treaty -rrb- , " hossein mousavian , a senior national security official involved in the nuclear negotiations , said .
" but iran is not prepared for cessation .
any package including a cessation of fuel cycle work would be rejected by iran , " he added . mousavian said iran expected the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to recognize its right under the npt to possess the full nuclear fuel cycle .
if this were the case , he said the islamic republic was ready to consider extending its suspension of uranium enrichment and discuss new initiatives that would provide long-term guarantees that the process would never be diverted to military purposes . his comments came after britain , france and germany - who have been spearheading negotiations with iran - told the united states they will in the coming days offer iran incentives to persuade it to halt uranium enrichment activities . the so-called " eu three " will offer the package of inducements as a november 25 deadline looms for iran to comply with iaea demands to suspend uranium enrichment and come clean about its nuclear ambitions or be referred to the un security council for possible sanctions . eu package comes from mistrust , says iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant was iran 's first and is central to claims of a weapons program .
diplomats say the package would give iran access to imported nuclear fuel and other perks in return for a total suspension of its own work on the nuclear fuel cycle .
" iran is definitely open to confidence-building measures , full cooperation with the iaea , full transparency and all confidence building measures that are required to assure the world that all enrichment activities would always remain peaceful and never be for military purposes , " mousavian said . " if they have a mistrust of our future enrichment activities and fear its diversion to nuclear weapons , this chapter is open to the iaea to implement a mechanism that assures it remains peaceful . "
but he repeated that " the fuel cycle is definitely a legitimate right of every member " of the iaea .
" cessation would be discrimination against an iaea member in the implementation of the npt and safeguards , " he added . diplomats say they have been trying to convince iran to strike a " libya-style deal " , whereby the country surrenders some of its sensitive nuclear capabilities - such as the fuel cycle - in return for diplomatic and trade incentives .
while the talk has been of suspending or halting fuel cycle work , the europeans and the united states would eventually like to see iran give it up altogether . libyan model will not work on iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder and libyan leader moammar gadhafi .
but mousavian said iran was not libya .
" the libyan formula would not work with iran .
iran is a country with thousands of years of history , with huge human resources .
with such a nation , you can not talk and discuss like you do with libya .
and we have the technology already .
we have the know-how already , " he asserted . " we are prepared for the continuation of confidence-building measures .
but there are two conditions : that the rights of iran are respected and the contents of the package .

25 when the international atomic energy agency board meets in vienna .
a last-minute promise would not be enough to avoid the security council . diplomats fear iran will miss last chance " i fear iran has moved towards a greater determination to continue its enrichment activities .
it will be difficult to get them to say we completely stop , " one senior eu diplomat told reporters after the meeting in washington .
iranian leaders insist on their legal right to carry out nuclear fuel enrichment , rather than discussing whether it is really in their national interest to do so , he said . the senior diplomat said the risk if iran were hauled before the security council was that tehran would retaliate by resuming enrichment and that each further step by the international community would prompt a move away from compliance .
" there is a risk of negative escalation , reciprocating every measure , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei .
if iran refuses to comply , the 25 eu member states would recommend the sending of the iranian case to the security council when they meet with mohammed el baradei and his international atomic energy agency board on nov .
25 .
diplomats predicted that eu leaders or foreign ministers might make a public statement to that effect in early november to build pressure . solana to offer incentives eu foreign policy chief javier solana was charged with devising a package of " carrots and sticks " to encourage iran to cooperate when he met with ministers earlier in the week .
among the " carrots " would be a commitment to resume stalled talks on an eu-iran trade and aid agreement and some more specific offer of energy cooperation , including a willingness to supply peaceful nuclear technology and fuel , the sources said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's mohsen mirdamadi with eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" the appearance of solana is a new element , " said a european diplomat in vienna .
" the eu three -lrb- germany , france and britain -rrb- has never been able to bring in the entire eu .
pulling everything together would be new . "
imprecision in an agreement struck with tehran by the three big eu powers - britain , france and germany - last october has led to a year of disputes . eu hopes for us assistance and influence eu officials acknowledge that europe alone can not offer iran big enough incentives to abandon what it insists is peaceful nuclear research , without the prospect of the united states ending its isolation of the islamic republic . the united states has so far publicly opposed offering any incentives to iran , which president george w. bush bracketed with iraq and north korea in 2002 as part of an " axis of evil . " hawks in the bush administration advocate isolating and punishing iran , and some influential u.s. neo-conservatives argue for a policy of " regime change " in tehran .
like north korea , which may already have the bomb , iran wants a guarantee that its regime is left alone , diplomats say . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran vows to continue nuclear program statements made by iranian officials on tuesday confirmed earlier reports that uranium enrichment processes had begun in iran and that un pressure would not divert tehran from pursuing its nuclear program .
-lrb- september 21 , 2004 -rrb- iran rejects un nuclear demands iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani referred to demands from the international atomic energy agency to freeze all work on uranium enrichment as " illegal " .
-lrb- september 20 , 2004 -rrb- us , eu agree to resolution on iran on thursday , the us and key eu allies agreed on a draft resolution calling on iran to end its nuclear program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.10.2004 vote counting resumes after afghan violence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote counting continued despite a new wave of attacks the counting of votes after afghanistan 's historic but contentious first democratic election last weekend resumed on saturday after a break for the start of ramadan and new violence across the country . the vote count in afghanistan 's historic election resumed saturday with president hamid karzai far ahead of his rivals in early results , as a new surge in attacks left seven people dead , including two us soldiers . security experts had warned of a possible resurgence of violence after saturday 's election , which was largely peaceful despite threats of attack from loyalists of the hardline islamic taliban regime ousted in late 2001 . the us military said two us troops were killed thursday in a landmine blast in the south-central province of uruzgan , hotbed of a taliban-led insurgency .
another five people were killed in eastern kunar province when a remote-controlled bomb exploded after a crowd had gathered near a truck that had been set alight as it was delivering food to us bases , an afghan official said . afghans fear return of violence many afghans who voted in the country 's first presidential election said they hoped it would herald a new era of peace in the rugged land , wracked by decades of war and insurgency .
vote counting started in most areas on thursday after a delay caused by allegations of irregularities . it resumed saturday after a break friday for the start of the muslim holy month of ramadan , kicking off for the first time at the regional counting centers of western herat , eastern jalalabad and bamiyan .
" counting has begun again everywhere - in all eight regional counting centers , " said afghan electoral commission spokesman aykut tavsel . karzai steams ahead in estimated result with just 0.7 percent of estimated total votes counted , us-backed karzai , the pre-poll favorite , was far ahead with a 72 percent lead over his rivals .
he was trailed by former education minister yunus qanooni with 11 percent , the afghan joint electoral management body said on its website . in third place with just over nine percent was uzbek warlord abdul rashid dostam and in fourth was ethic hazara military strongman mohammed mohaqeq with 1.6 percent . afghanistan 's only female candidate masooda jalal was lying fifth with 1.4 percent of the votes .
the other 13 presidential candidates all had less that 1.1 percent of the ballots .
the initial count included votes from only seven of the country 's 34 provinces . allegations of fraud die down the elections were marred by allegations of fraud and mismanagement after supposedly indelible ink used to mark voters ' fingers and prevent multiple voting was found to wash off .
an international panel of experts was appointed at the last minute to investigate the complaints , averting a boycott called by disgruntled candidates , some of whom alleged the vote was rigged to favor karzai , and opening the way for the count to begin . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's kabul visit sparks criticism german chancellor schröder arrived in kabul on monday to , among other things , visit expected presidential election winner hamid karzai .
but opposition candidates have accused him of favoritism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.10.2004 iran to reject eu three 's nuclear proposal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu delegation of fischer , straw and villepin are to be rebuffed a plan put to iran by germany , france and britain in a bid to avoid the islamic state 's nuclear ambitions becoming a un security council issue will be dismissed by tehran , a senior official said on saturday . iran will reject any european proposal for a complete cessation of its work on the nuclear fuel cycle , but is willing to consider further " confidence-building " measures and extending a suspension of uranium enrichment , a top iranian official told reporters on saturday . " we would be willing to consider any package that recognizes the full right of iran to enjoy peaceful nuclear technology within the framework of the npt -lrb- nuclear non-proliferation treaty -rrb- , " hossein mousavian , a senior national security official involved in the nuclear negotiations , said .
" but iran is not prepared for cessation .
any package including a cessation of fuel cycle work would be rejected by iran , " he added . mousavian said iran expected the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to recognize its right under the npt to possess the full nuclear fuel cycle .
if this were the case , he said the islamic republic was ready to consider extending its suspension of uranium enrichment and discuss new initiatives that would provide long-term guarantees that the process would never be diverted to military purposes . his comments came after britain , france and germany - who have been spearheading negotiations with iran - told the united states they will in the coming days offer iran incentives to persuade it to halt uranium enrichment activities . the so-called " eu three " will offer the package of inducements as a november 25 deadline looms for iran to comply with iaea demands to suspend uranium enrichment and come clean about its nuclear ambitions or be referred to the un security council for possible sanctions . eu package comes from mistrust , says iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant was iran 's first and is central to claims of a weapons program .
diplomats say the package would give iran access to imported nuclear fuel and other perks in return for a total suspension of its own work on the nuclear fuel cycle .
" iran is definitely open to confidence-building measures , full cooperation with the iaea , full transparency and all confidence building measures that are required to assure the world that all enrichment activities would always remain peaceful and never be for military purposes , " mousavian said . " if they have a mistrust of our future enrichment activities and fear its diversion to nuclear weapons , this chapter is open to the iaea to implement a mechanism that assures it remains peaceful . "
but he repeated that " the fuel cycle is definitely a legitimate right of every member " of the iaea .
" cessation would be discrimination against an iaea member in the implementation of the npt and safeguards , " he added . diplomats say they have been trying to convince iran to strike a " libya-style deal " , whereby the country surrenders some of its sensitive nuclear capabilities - such as the fuel cycle - in return for diplomatic and trade incentives .
while the talk has been of suspending or halting fuel cycle work , the europeans and the united states would eventually like to see iran give it up altogether . libyan model will not work on iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder and libyan leader moammar gadhafi .
but mousavian said iran was not libya .
" the libyan formula would not work with iran .
iran is a country with thousands of years of history , with huge human resources .
with such a nation , you can not talk and discuss like you do with libya .
and we have the technology already .
we have the know-how already , " he asserted . " we are prepared for the continuation of confidence-building measures .
but there are two conditions : that the rights of iran are respected and the contents of the package .
is it sellable ?
are they serious in implementing the package ? " " mistrust is bilateral .
if the americans and the europeans do not trust iran , we can not trust them . " iran has no interest in nuclear weapons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's armed forces display the shahab-3 missile , capable of carrying a nuclear warhead .
the official , responsible for foreign affairs within iran 's supreme national security council , also reiterated denials that the country was even interested in nuclear weapons .
" we really believe weapons of mass destruction do not bring security for any country .
not pakistan , india or israel .
they would never be able to use these weapons , so they are just for power prestige .
hundreds of millions of dollars spent for nothing , " he said . referring to the 1980-1988 war with iraq , he said " iran was the first victim of weapons of mass destruction after world war ii .
but we did not retaliate with mass destruction weapons : that is confidence building .

" we would be willing to consider any package that recognizes the full right of iran to enjoy peaceful nuclear technology within the framework of the npt -lrb- nuclear non-proliferation treaty -rrb- , " hossein mousavian , a senior national security official involved in the nuclear negotiations , said .
" but iran is not prepared for cessation .
any package including a cessation of fuel cycle work would be rejected by iran , " he added . mousavian said iran expected the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to recognize its right under the npt to possess the full nuclear fuel cycle .
if this were the case , he said the islamic republic was ready to consider extending its suspension of uranium enrichment and discuss new initiatives that would provide long-term guarantees that the process would never be diverted to military purposes . his comments came after britain , france and germany - who have been spearheading negotiations with iran - told the united states they will in the coming days offer iran incentives to persuade it to halt uranium enrichment activities . the so-called " eu three " will offer the package of inducements as a november 25 deadline looms for iran to comply with iaea demands to suspend uranium enrichment and come clean about its nuclear ambitions or be referred to the un security council for possible sanctions . eu package comes from mistrust , says iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant was iran 's first and is central to claims of a weapons program .
diplomats say the package would give iran access to imported nuclear fuel and other perks in return for a total suspension of its own work on the nuclear fuel cycle .
" iran is definitely open to confidence-building measures , full cooperation with the iaea , full transparency and all confidence building measures that are required to assure the world that all enrichment activities would always remain peaceful and never be for military purposes , " mousavian said . " if they have a mistrust of our future enrichment activities and fear its diversion to nuclear weapons , this chapter is open to the iaea to implement a mechanism that assures it remains peaceful . "
but he repeated that " the fuel cycle is definitely a legitimate right of every member " of the iaea .
" cessation would be discrimination against an iaea member in the implementation of the npt and safeguards , " he added . diplomats say they have been trying to convince iran to strike a " libya-style deal " , whereby the country surrenders some of its sensitive nuclear capabilities - such as the fuel cycle - in return for diplomatic and trade incentives .
while the talk has been of suspending or halting fuel cycle work , the europeans and the united states would eventually like to see iran give it up altogether . libyan model will not work on iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder and libyan leader moammar gadhafi .
but mousavian said iran was not libya .
" the libyan formula would not work with iran .
iran is a country with thousands of years of history , with huge human resources .
with such a nation , you can not talk and discuss like you do with libya .
and we have the technology already .
we have the know-how already , " he asserted . " we are prepared for the continuation of confidence-building measures .
but there are two conditions : that the rights of iran are respected and the contents of the package .
is it sellable ?
are they serious in implementing the package ? " " mistrust is bilateral .

the official , responsible for foreign affairs within iran 's supreme national security council , also reiterated denials that the country was even interested in nuclear weapons .
" we really believe weapons of mass destruction do not bring security for any country .
not pakistan , india or israel .
they would never be able to use these weapons , so they are just for power prestige .
hundreds of millions of dollars spent for nothing , " he said . referring to the 1980-1988 war with iraq , he said " iran was the first victim of weapons of mass destruction after world war ii .

if this were the case , he said the islamic republic was ready to consider extending its suspension of uranium enrichment and discuss new initiatives that would provide long-term guarantees that the process would never be diverted to military purposes . his comments came after britain , france and germany - who have been spearheading negotiations with iran - told the united states they will in the coming days offer iran incentives to persuade it to halt uranium enrichment activities . the so-called " eu three " will offer the package of inducements as a november 25 deadline looms for iran to comply with iaea demands to suspend uranium enrichment and come clean about its nuclear ambitions or be referred to the un security council for possible sanctions . eu package comes from mistrust , says iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant was iran 's first and is central to claims of a weapons program .
diplomats say the package would give iran access to imported nuclear fuel and other perks in return for a total suspension of its own work on the nuclear fuel cycle .
" iran is definitely open to confidence-building measures , full cooperation with the iaea , full transparency and all confidence building measures that are required to assure the world that all enrichment activities would always remain peaceful and never be for military purposes , " mousavian said . " if they have a mistrust of our future enrichment activities and fear its diversion to nuclear weapons , this chapter is open to the iaea to implement a mechanism that assures it remains peaceful . "
but he repeated that " the fuel cycle is definitely a legitimate right of every member " of the iaea .
" cessation would be discrimination against an iaea member in the implementation of the npt and safeguards , " he added . diplomats say they have been trying to convince iran to strike a " libya-style deal " , whereby the country surrenders some of its sensitive nuclear capabilities - such as the fuel cycle - in return for diplomatic and trade incentives .
while the talk has been of suspending or halting fuel cycle work , the europeans and the united states would eventually like to see iran give it up altogether . libyan model will not work on iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder and libyan leader moammar gadhafi .
but mousavian said iran was not libya .
" the libyan formula would not work with iran .
iran is a country with thousands of years of history , with huge human resources .
with such a nation , you can not talk and discuss like you do with libya .
and we have the technology already .
we have the know-how already , " he asserted . " we are prepared for the continuation of confidence-building measures .
but there are two conditions : that the rights of iran are respected and the contents of the package .
is it sellable ?
are they serious in implementing the package ? " " mistrust is bilateral .
if the americans and the europeans do not trust iran , we can not trust them . " iran has no interest in nuclear weapons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's armed forces display the shahab-3 missile , capable of carrying a nuclear warhead .
the official , responsible for foreign affairs within iran 's supreme national security council , also reiterated denials that the country was even interested in nuclear weapons .
" we really believe weapons of mass destruction do not bring security for any country .
not pakistan , india or israel .
they would never be able to use these weapons , so they are just for power prestige .
hundreds of millions of dollars spent for nothing , " he said . referring to the 1980-1988 war with iraq , he said " iran was the first victim of weapons of mass destruction after world war ii .
but we did not retaliate with mass destruction weapons : that is confidence building .

another five people were killed in eastern kunar province when a remote-controlled bomb exploded after a crowd had gathered near a truck that had been set alight as it was delivering food to us bases , an afghan official said . afghans fear return of violence many afghans who voted in the country 's first presidential election said they hoped it would herald a new era of peace in the rugged land , wracked by decades of war and insurgency .
vote counting started in most areas on thursday after a delay caused by allegations of irregularities . it resumed saturday after a break friday for the start of the muslim holy month of ramadan , kicking off for the first time at the regional counting centers of western herat , eastern jalalabad and bamiyan .

the other 13 presidential candidates all had less that 1.1 percent of the ballots .
the initial count included votes from only seven of the country 's 34 provinces . allegations of fraud die down the elections were marred by allegations of fraud and mismanagement after supposedly indelible ink used to mark voters ' fingers and prevent multiple voting was found to wash off .
an international panel of experts was appointed at the last minute to investigate the complaints , averting a boycott called by disgruntled candidates , some of whom alleged the vote was rigged to favor karzai , and opening the way for the count to begin . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's kabul visit sparks criticism german chancellor schröder arrived in kabul on monday to , among other things , visit expected presidential election winner hamid karzai .

25 when the international atomic energy agency board meets in vienna .
a last-minute promise would not be enough to avoid the security council . diplomats fear iran will miss last chance " i fear iran has moved towards a greater determination to continue its enrichment activities .
it will be difficult to get them to say we completely stop , " one senior eu diplomat told reporters after the meeting in washington .
iranian leaders insist on their legal right to carry out nuclear fuel enrichment , rather than discussing whether it is really in their national interest to do so , he said . the senior diplomat said the risk if iran were hauled before the security council was that tehran would retaliate by resuming enrichment and that each further step by the international community would prompt a move away from compliance .
" there is a risk of negative escalation , reciprocating every measure , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei .
if iran refuses to comply , the 25 eu member states would recommend the sending of the iranian case to the security council when they meet with mohammed el baradei and his international atomic energy agency board on nov .
25 .
diplomats predicted that eu leaders or foreign ministers might make a public statement to that effect in early november to build pressure . solana to offer incentives eu foreign policy chief javier solana was charged with devising a package of " carrots and sticks " to encourage iran to cooperate when he met with ministers earlier in the week .
among the " carrots " would be a commitment to resume stalled talks on an eu-iran trade and aid agreement and some more specific offer of energy cooperation , including a willingness to supply peaceful nuclear technology and fuel , the sources said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's mohsen mirdamadi with eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
" the appearance of solana is a new element , " said a european diplomat in vienna .
" the eu three -lrb- germany , france and britain -rrb- has never been able to bring in the entire eu .
pulling everything together would be new . "
imprecision in an agreement struck with tehran by the three big eu powers - britain , france and germany - last october has led to a year of disputes . eu hopes for us assistance and influence eu officials acknowledge that europe alone can not offer iran big enough incentives to abandon what it insists is peaceful nuclear research , without the prospect of the united states ending its isolation of the islamic republic . the united states has so far publicly opposed offering any incentives to iran , which president george w. bush bracketed with iraq and north korea in 2002 as part of an " axis of evil . " hawks in the bush administration advocate isolating and punishing iran , and some influential u.s. neo-conservatives argue for a policy of " regime change " in tehran .

iranian leaders insist on their legal right to carry out nuclear fuel enrichment , rather than discussing whether it is really in their national interest to do so , he said . the senior diplomat said the risk if iran were hauled before the security council was that tehran would retaliate by resuming enrichment and that each further step by the international community would prompt a move away from compliance .

" we would be willing to consider any package that recognizes the full right of iran to enjoy peaceful nuclear technology within the framework of the npt -lrb- nuclear non-proliferation treaty -rrb- , " hossein mousavian , a senior national security official involved in the nuclear negotiations , said .

any package including a cessation of fuel cycle work would be rejected by iran , " he added . mousavian said iran expected the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to recognize its right under the npt to possess the full nuclear fuel cycle .
if this were the case , he said the islamic republic was ready to consider extending its suspension of uranium enrichment and discuss new initiatives that would provide long-term guarantees that the process would never be diverted to military purposes . his comments came after britain , france and germany - who have been spearheading negotiations with iran - told the united states they will in the coming days offer iran incentives to persuade it to halt uranium enrichment activities . the so-called " eu three " will offer the package of inducements as a november 25 deadline looms for iran to comply with iaea demands to suspend uranium enrichment and come clean about its nuclear ambitions or be referred to the un security council for possible sanctions . eu package comes from mistrust , says iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant was iran 's first and is central to claims of a weapons program .

" if they have a mistrust of our future enrichment activities and fear its diversion to nuclear weapons , this chapter is open to the iaea to implement a mechanism that assures it remains peaceful . "
but he repeated that " the fuel cycle is definitely a legitimate right of every member " of the iaea .
" cessation would be discrimination against an iaea member in the implementation of the npt and safeguards , " he added . diplomats say they have been trying to convince iran to strike a " libya-style deal " , whereby the country surrenders some of its sensitive nuclear capabilities - such as the fuel cycle - in return for diplomatic and trade incentives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.10.2004 german military hardware in international demand großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fuchs tanks are sought-after military hardware germany might not quite rival the us and russia when it comes to weapons exports , but it still accounts for up to six percent of the global arms market . although the german foreign office insists that its " traditionally restrictive arms export policy dovetails with the country 's foreign and security policy , aimed at preserving peace , " germany is among the world 's top ten arms manufacturers , along with france and britain .
the burgeoning chinese arms industry is also catching up fast . and german arms are highly sought-after .
according to michael brzoska , a weapons expert at the bonn international center for conversion , the industry has two outstandingly good sellers . " along with ships , germany 's armored vehicles are in huge demand , " he told dw-radio .
" nonetheless , the present government as well as its predecessors have been relatively restrained when it comes to exporting armored vehicles , " he explained .
" their export is only permitted to other nato and eu countries , with certain exceptions . " one of the most notable exceptions was a controversial delivery to saudi arabia of 36 german tanks equipped to detect wmd back in 1991 .
another is the planned deployment of german transport tanks in iraqi army training programs . arms report promotes transparency in 2000 , berlin began publishing an annual arms export report , which aims for public transparency by listing which countries receive military hardware from germany every year . " last year the main recipients of german arms included south korea , greece and turkey , " said michael brzoska .
" in earlier years , it was indonesia and israel . " germany has a history of supplying arms to israel , even though the ministry for defense supposedly operates a policy of limiting arms exports to conflict regions .
critics point to germany 's sale of three " dolphin " -class submarines to israel in 1999 and 2000 as a clear breach of this policy and accuse germany of ignoring its potential complicity in the middle east nuclear-weapons build-up . international customers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german navy special forces wade ashore during exercises in the baltic sea .
israel is n't the only country with an interest in germany 's maritime military know-how .
india is another keen customer .
and another country , previously subject to a trade embargo and therefore absent from germany 's arms export report , is now set to top the list . " south africa is tipped to be germany 's biggest arms buyer because german shipyards have sold several warships to south africa which are about to be delivered , " explains michael brzoska . undiscerning arms export policies but nato and eu countries are still germany 's primary arms partners . at just 20 percent , exports to developing countries are modest in comparison , and that 's not just because of the arms export restrictions introduced by berlin four years ago . according to a us congress study , international investment in military hardware fell by 40 percent between 2000 and 2003 .
poor countries in particular are buying ever fewer weapons from abroad .
many fear that this drop in profits this has led to a less discerning arms export policy . military production as a mainstay michael brzoska stresses it 's important to look at individual cases .
" a lot has changed in turkey , for example , which has made it acceptable to reconsider possible tank exports there , " he pointed out . " i would be far more hesitant about exporting tanks to iraq , " he added .
" so far , germany has refrained from supplying weapons and munitions as armament aid , but in recent years there has been a broad willingness to approve sales to the middle east . " germany sells military hardware to a total 100 countries .
but with just 90,000 employees , its arms industry is not as extensive as might be expected .
it makes up just one percent of the country 's total exports .
nonetheless , areas such as ship building depend on military production for survival . andreas noll -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany mulls tanks sale to turkey barely a week after the european commission recommended initiating membership talks with turkey , the german government is reportedly considering to deliver tanks to that country . -lrb- october 12 , 2004 -rrb- no german aid for israel sub purchase on his first official visit to israel , german defense minister peter struck said berlin supported strengthening israeli security defenses but it would not subsidize the purchase of german submarines .

" south africa is tipped to be germany 's biggest arms buyer because german shipyards have sold several warships to south africa which are about to be delivered , " explains michael brzoska . undiscerning arms export policies but nato and eu countries are still germany 's primary arms partners . at just 20 percent , exports to developing countries are modest in comparison , and that 's not just because of the arms export restrictions introduced by berlin four years ago . according to a us congress study , international investment in military hardware fell by 40 percent between 2000 and 2003 .
poor countries in particular are buying ever fewer weapons from abroad .
many fear that this drop in profits this has led to a less discerning arms export policy . military production as a mainstay michael brzoska stresses it 's important to look at individual cases .
" a lot has changed in turkey , for example , which has made it acceptable to reconsider possible tank exports there , " he pointed out . " i would be far more hesitant about exporting tanks to iraq , " he added .
" so far , germany has refrained from supplying weapons and munitions as armament aid , but in recent years there has been a broad willingness to approve sales to the middle east . " germany sells military hardware to a total 100 countries .
but with just 90,000 employees , its arms industry is not as extensive as might be expected .
it makes up just one percent of the country 's total exports .
nonetheless , areas such as ship building depend on military production for survival . andreas noll -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany mulls tanks sale to turkey barely a week after the european commission recommended initiating membership talks with turkey , the german government is reportedly considering to deliver tanks to that country . -lrb- october 12 , 2004 -rrb- no german aid for israel sub purchase on his first official visit to israel , german defense minister peter struck said berlin supported strengthening israeli security defenses but it would not subsidize the purchase of german submarines .

it will be difficult to get them to say we completely stop , " one senior eu diplomat told reporters after the meeting in washington .
iranian leaders insist on their legal right to carry out nuclear fuel enrichment , rather than discussing whether it is really in their national interest to do so , he said . the senior diplomat said the risk if iran were hauled before the security council was that tehran would retaliate by resuming enrichment and that each further step by the international community would prompt a move away from compliance .

diplomats predicted that eu leaders or foreign ministers might make a public statement to that effect in early november to build pressure . solana to offer incentives eu foreign policy chief javier solana was charged with devising a package of " carrots and sticks " to encourage iran to cooperate when he met with ministers earlier in the week .
among the " carrots " would be a commitment to resume stalled talks on an eu-iran trade and aid agreement and some more specific offer of energy cooperation , including a willingness to supply peaceful nuclear technology and fuel , the sources said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's mohsen mirdamadi with eu foreign policy chief javier solana .

imprecision in an agreement struck with tehran by the three big eu powers - britain , france and germany - last october has led to a year of disputes . eu hopes for us assistance and influence eu officials acknowledge that europe alone can not offer iran big enough incentives to abandon what it insists is peaceful nuclear research , without the prospect of the united states ending its isolation of the islamic republic . the united states has so far publicly opposed offering any incentives to iran , which president george w. bush bracketed with iraq and north korea in 2002 as part of an " axis of evil .

another five people were killed in eastern kunar province when a remote-controlled bomb exploded after a crowd had gathered near a truck that had been set alight as it was delivering food to us bases , an afghan official said . afghans fear return of violence many afghans who voted in the country 's first presidential election said they hoped it would herald a new era of peace in the rugged land , wracked by decades of war and insurgency .
vote counting started in most areas on thursday after a delay caused by allegations of irregularities . it resumed saturday after a break friday for the start of the muslim holy month of ramadan , kicking off for the first time at the regional counting centers of western herat , eastern jalalabad and bamiyan .

the other 13 presidential candidates all had less that 1.1 percent of the ballots .
the initial count included votes from only seven of the country 's 34 provinces . allegations of fraud die down the elections were marred by allegations of fraud and mismanagement after supposedly indelible ink used to mark voters ' fingers and prevent multiple voting was found to wash off .
an international panel of experts was appointed at the last minute to investigate the complaints , averting a boycott called by disgruntled candidates , some of whom alleged the vote was rigged to favor karzai , and opening the way for the count to begin . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's kabul visit sparks criticism german chancellor schröder arrived in kabul on monday to , among other things , visit expected presidential election winner hamid karzai .

" we would be willing to consider any package that recognizes the full right of iran to enjoy peaceful nuclear technology within the framework of the npt -lrb- nuclear non-proliferation treaty -rrb- , " hossein mousavian , a senior national security official involved in the nuclear negotiations , said .
" but iran is not prepared for cessation .
any package including a cessation of fuel cycle work would be rejected by iran , " he added . mousavian said iran expected the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to recognize its right under the npt to possess the full nuclear fuel cycle .
if this were the case , he said the islamic republic was ready to consider extending its suspension of uranium enrichment and discuss new initiatives that would provide long-term guarantees that the process would never be diverted to military purposes . his comments came after britain , france and germany - who have been spearheading negotiations with iran - told the united states they will in the coming days offer iran incentives to persuade it to halt uranium enrichment activities . the so-called " eu three " will offer the package of inducements as a november 25 deadline looms for iran to comply with iaea demands to suspend uranium enrichment and come clean about its nuclear ambitions or be referred to the un security council for possible sanctions . eu package comes from mistrust , says iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant was iran 's first and is central to claims of a weapons program .
diplomats say the package would give iran access to imported nuclear fuel and other perks in return for a total suspension of its own work on the nuclear fuel cycle .
" iran is definitely open to confidence-building measures , full cooperation with the iaea , full transparency and all confidence building measures that are required to assure the world that all enrichment activities would always remain peaceful and never be for military purposes , " mousavian said . " if they have a mistrust of our future enrichment activities and fear its diversion to nuclear weapons , this chapter is open to the iaea to implement a mechanism that assures it remains peaceful . "
but he repeated that " the fuel cycle is definitely a legitimate right of every member " of the iaea .
" cessation would be discrimination against an iaea member in the implementation of the npt and safeguards , " he added . diplomats say they have been trying to convince iran to strike a " libya-style deal " , whereby the country surrenders some of its sensitive nuclear capabilities - such as the fuel cycle - in return for diplomatic and trade incentives .
while the talk has been of suspending or halting fuel cycle work , the europeans and the united states would eventually like to see iran give it up altogether . libyan model will not work on iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder and libyan leader moammar gadhafi .
but mousavian said iran was not libya .
" the libyan formula would not work with iran .
iran is a country with thousands of years of history , with huge human resources .
with such a nation , you can not talk and discuss like you do with libya .
and we have the technology already .
we have the know-how already , " he asserted . " we are prepared for the continuation of confidence-building measures .

" we really believe weapons of mass destruction do not bring security for any country .

they would never be able to use these weapons , so they are just for power prestige .
hundreds of millions of dollars spent for nothing , " he said . referring to the 1980-1988 war with iraq , he said " iran was the first victim of weapons of mass destruction after world war ii .

" we would be willing to consider any package that recognizes the full right of iran to enjoy peaceful nuclear technology within the framework of the npt -lrb- nuclear non-proliferation treaty -rrb- , " hossein mousavian , a senior national security official involved in the nuclear negotiations , said .
" but iran is not prepared for cessation .
any package including a cessation of fuel cycle work would be rejected by iran , " he added . mousavian said iran expected the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to recognize its right under the npt to possess the full nuclear fuel cycle .
if this were the case , he said the islamic republic was ready to consider extending its suspension of uranium enrichment and discuss new initiatives that would provide long-term guarantees that the process would never be diverted to military purposes . his comments came after britain , france and germany - who have been spearheading negotiations with iran - told the united states they will in the coming days offer iran incentives to persuade it to halt uranium enrichment activities . the so-called " eu three " will offer the package of inducements as a november 25 deadline looms for iran to comply with iaea demands to suspend uranium enrichment and come clean about its nuclear ambitions or be referred to the un security council for possible sanctions . eu package comes from mistrust , says iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant was iran 's first and is central to claims of a weapons program .
diplomats say the package would give iran access to imported nuclear fuel and other perks in return for a total suspension of its own work on the nuclear fuel cycle .
" iran is definitely open to confidence-building measures , full cooperation with the iaea , full transparency and all confidence building measures that are required to assure the world that all enrichment activities would always remain peaceful and never be for military purposes , " mousavian said . " if they have a mistrust of our future enrichment activities and fear its diversion to nuclear weapons , this chapter is open to the iaea to implement a mechanism that assures it remains peaceful . "
but he repeated that " the fuel cycle is definitely a legitimate right of every member " of the iaea .
" cessation would be discrimination against an iaea member in the implementation of the npt and safeguards , " he added . diplomats say they have been trying to convince iran to strike a " libya-style deal " , whereby the country surrenders some of its sensitive nuclear capabilities - such as the fuel cycle - in return for diplomatic and trade incentives .
while the talk has been of suspending or halting fuel cycle work , the europeans and the united states would eventually like to see iran give it up altogether . libyan model will not work on iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder and libyan leader moammar gadhafi .

" the libyan formula would not work with iran .
iran is a country with thousands of years of history , with huge human resources .
with such a nation , you can not talk and discuss like you do with libya .

an editorial said the city was wallowing in " disproportionate " grief for mr bigley , who was killed in iraq .
" we certainly intended no insult to the people of liverpool and as far as any offence was taken , i am very , very sorry , " mr johnson said .
liverpudlians and party leader michael howard were furious at the article .
mr howard gave mr johnson , conservative mp for henley in oxfordshire , a " kick in the pants " . "
we were trying to make a point about sentimentality " boris johnson mr johnson said : " the article was too trenchantly expressed but we were trying to make a point about sentimentality and risk , and people 's evaluation of risk these days . "
mr howard said : " i totally disagree with the comment in the spectator about liverpool .
i have nothing but the greatest admiration and affection for liverpool and its people .
" what was said in the spectator was nonsense from beginning to end . "
despite the controversy , a tory spokesman said mr johnson 's job as shadow minister for culture , media and sport was not under threat .
the article , in the issue dated 16 october , says people in liverpool " can not accept that they might have made any contribution to their misfortunes , but seek rather to blame someone else for it , thereby deepening their sense of shared tribal grievance about the rest of society " .
it says liverpudlians " wallow " in their " victim status " , adding it is part of the " deeply unattractive psyche " of many in the city .
the article goes on to say ken bigley 's brother paul was wrong to say the prime minister has " blood on his hands " .
' tory propaganda ' it goes on to say mr bigley took a risk by working in iraq against the advice of the foreign office , and " his motives and misjudgements ... should , without lessening sympathy for him and his family , temper the outpouring of sentimentality in which many have engaged for him " . "
we 're a friendly city and we stand by each other " phil hammond , hillsborough family support group it also says the city made a scapegoat of police in the wake of the hillsborough disaster , refusing to acknowledge the part played " by drunken fans at the back of the crowd who mindlessly tried to fight their way into the ground " .
the incident claimed the lives of 96 liverpool football supporters . "
he was very unwise to direct his article specifically to liverpudlians in this case " nathan james , liverpool the hillsborough family support group described the article as " typical tory propaganda " .
phil hammond , vice chairman of the group said : " boris johnson , he knows nothing about this .
" he does n't even know how many people died at hillsborough .
they wrote that it was ' more than 50 ' .
" i doubt whether he has ever been to liverpool .
" we do n't see ourselves as victims .
we 're a friendly city and we stand by each other when one of us gets hurt or killed . "

q : what does the referendum ask ?
do you allow the first president of the republic of belarus , alexander lukashenko , to stand in the presidential elections ?
q : how is it justified ?
announcing the move , mr lukashenko said : " for years i have been carrying this crystal vase called belarus with the greatest care ...
i am afraid to drop it , for it is too fragile and vulnerable ...
i would not like irresponsible politicians to get their hands on the beauty we have created " .
q : has he held a referendum before ?
in 1996 mr lukashenko used one to dissolve a dissenting parliament and to amend the constitution .
this restricted parliament 's powers and allowed him to extend his first term .
q : what 's the procedure ?
a majority of all registered voters is required to change the constitution , so mr lukashenko needs more than 3.5 million people to vote yes in the referendum .
a simple majority and a minimum turnout of 50 % plus one vote are needed for candidates to be elected to parliament .
facts & figures 7m eligible to vote referendum to cost $ 186,000 110 mps to be elected 406 candidates registered 692 candidates applied polling stations are open for six hours daily from 12-16 october for anyone wishing to vote early .
the practice , used previously by mr lukashenko , is seen by observers as a way of manipulating the vote .
q : what are the logistics ?
there are about seven million eligible voters .
a total of 167 local election commissions will oversee voting at 6,659 polling stations .
the central electoral commission says the referendum will cost 400m rubles -lrb- $ 186,000 -rrb- .
q : what does the opposition think ?
the opposition have condemned what they call a bid to enshrine a " presidency for life " and turn belarus into an " absolute monarchy " .
opposition parties launched a " say no to lukashenko " campaign and staged protests .
and there have been calls for a boycott .
q : what does the west think ?
the us state department and eu foreign ministers have warned that a flawed referendum will damage ties and further isolate belarus .
mr lukashenko responded by accusing the west of interference and plotting to oust him .
q : what does russia think ?
russian foreign ministry spokesman aleksandr yakovenko has said it is " up to the belarusian people " to decide .
q : what do opinion polls say ?
state media report almost universal support for mr lukashenko .
but a survey by belarusian independent pollster novak and lithuania 's gallup organisation says 53 % oppose lifting the two-term limit .
just 26.2 % said they would vote for mr lukashenko in a presidential election .
q : how does the general election fit in ?
the parliamentary poll is expected to tighten mr lukashenko 's grip .
while the opposition has managed to unite , its chances of challenging the pro-presidential parties are deemed slim .
the first-past-the-post system , a central election authority loyal to the president and recent clampdowns on the independent press all favour the president .
q : how does parliament work ?
the lower house has the power to throw out bills and even impeach the president .
in practice the president can count on a chamber of staunch supporters .
mr lukashenko regards mps more as civil servants than elected representatives .
he lectures them on their duties and harangues them if they dissent .
the president can disband the lower house if it votes no-confidence in the government or rejects a prime minister-designate twice .
q : how does voting work ?
the lower house has 110 members elected for a four-year term .
the system is first-past-the-post , with no proportional representation .
the seven-million electorate is divided into 110 constituencies .
to win , candidates must poll more than 50 % of votes on a turnout of 50 % plus one .
runoffs , if needed , are held within two weeks between the two frontrunners .
q : who is standing ?
the central electoral commission says 406 candidates were registered out of 692 applicants .
lukashenko is accused of stifling dissent just 186 of these are members of political parties .
the opposition has accused the authorities of using technicalities to filter out rivals .
among the party candidates , 38 represent the pro-lukashenko liberal democratic party and five the pro-lukashenko communist party of belarus .
the opposition lines up as follows : the united civic party - 37 candidates , the belarusian social democratic party -lrb- people 's hramada -rrb- - 28 , the bpf-revival party - 30 , the party of communists of belarus - 30 , and the belarusian social democratic hramada - 11 .
two minor parties secured registration for three and four candidates respectively .
in addition , some opposition candidates have set up three " election blocs " .
q : what of the campaign ?
candidates were entitled to five minutes of free time on state radio and tv .
and they could publish manifestos free of charge in national papers .
but the opposition was up against pro-presidential broadcasts and a barrage of anti-opposition propaganda .
q : what of opinion polls ?
an independent survey in june / july revealed that only 36.7 % were ready to vote for lukashenko-backed candidates , while 45.8 % said they would vote against them .
but most polls suggest support for the opposition still falls far short of a majority .
q : will there be observers ?
the commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- and the organisation for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- have said they are sending about 400 observers .
bbc monitoring , based in caversham in southern england , selects and translates information from radio , television , press , news agencies and the internet from 150 countries in more than 70 languages .

russian foreign ministry spokesman aleksandr yakovenko has said it is " up to the belarusian people " to decide .
q : what do opinion polls say ?
state media report almost universal support for mr lukashenko .
but a survey by belarusian independent pollster novak and lithuania 's gallup organisation says 53 % oppose lifting the two-term limit .
just 26.2 % said they would vote for mr lukashenko in a presidential election .
q : how does the general election fit in ?
the parliamentary poll is expected to tighten mr lukashenko 's grip .
while the opposition has managed to unite , its chances of challenging the pro-presidential parties are deemed slim .
the first-past-the-post system , a central election authority loyal to the president and recent clampdowns on the independent press all favour the president .
q : how does parliament work ?
the lower house has the power to throw out bills and even impeach the president .
in practice the president can count on a chamber of staunch supporters .
mr lukashenko regards mps more as civil servants than elected representatives .
he lectures them on their duties and harangues them if they dissent .
the president can disband the lower house if it votes no-confidence in the government or rejects a prime minister-designate twice .
q : how does voting work ?
the lower house has 110 members elected for a four-year term .
the system is first-past-the-post , with no proportional representation .
the seven-million electorate is divided into 110 constituencies .
to win , candidates must poll more than 50 % of votes on a turnout of 50 % plus one .
runoffs , if needed , are held within two weeks between the two frontrunners .
q : who is standing ?
the central electoral commission says 406 candidates were registered out of 692 applicants .
lukashenko is accused of stifling dissent just 186 of these are members of political parties .
the opposition has accused the authorities of using technicalities to filter out rivals .
among the party candidates , 38 represent the pro-lukashenko liberal democratic party and five the pro-lukashenko communist party of belarus .
the opposition lines up as follows : the united civic party - 37 candidates , the belarusian social democratic party -lrb- people 's hramada -rrb- - 28 , the bpf-revival party - 30 , the party of communists of belarus - 30 , and the belarusian social democratic hramada - 11 .
two minor parties secured registration for three and four candidates respectively .
in addition , some opposition candidates have set up three " election blocs " .
q : what of the campaign ?
candidates were entitled to five minutes of free time on state radio and tv .
and they could publish manifestos free of charge in national papers .
but the opposition was up against pro-presidential broadcasts and a barrage of anti-opposition propaganda .
q : what of opinion polls ?
an independent survey in june / july revealed that only 36.7 % were ready to vote for lukashenko-backed candidates , while 45.8 % said they would vote against them .
but most polls suggest support for the opposition still falls far short of a majority .
q : will there be observers ?
the commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- and the organisation for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- have said they are sending about 400 observers .

bbc news -pipe- europe -pipe- q & a : belarus votes bbc news / europe graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- saturday , 16 october , 2004 , 08:47 gmt 09:47 uk q & a : belarus votes belarus goes to the polls on sunday to elect a new parliament and to decide in a referendum whether president alexander lukashenko , dubbed " europe 's last dictator " by the us state department , can stand for a third term in 2006 .
q : what does the referendum ask ?
do you allow the first president of the republic of belarus , alexander lukashenko , to stand in the presidential elections ?
q : how is it justified ?
announcing the move , mr lukashenko said : " for years i have been carrying this crystal vase called belarus with the greatest care ...
i am afraid to drop it , for it is too fragile and vulnerable ...
i would not like irresponsible politicians to get their hands on the beauty we have created " .
q : has he held a referendum before ?
in 1996 mr lukashenko used one to dissolve a dissenting parliament and to amend the constitution .
this restricted parliament 's powers and allowed him to extend his first term .
q : what 's the procedure ?
a majority of all registered voters is required to change the constitution , so mr lukashenko needs more than 3.5 million people to vote yes in the referendum .
a simple majority and a minimum turnout of 50 % plus one vote are needed for candidates to be elected to parliament .
facts & figures 7m eligible to vote referendum to cost $ 186,000 110 mps to be elected 406 candidates registered 692 candidates applied polling stations are open for six hours daily from 12-16 october for anyone wishing to vote early .
the practice , used previously by mr lukashenko , is seen by observers as a way of manipulating the vote .
q : what are the logistics ?
there are about seven million eligible voters .
a total of 167 local election commissions will oversee voting at 6,659 polling stations .
the central electoral commission says the referendum will cost 400m rubles -lrb- $ 186,000 -rrb- .
q : what does the opposition think ?
the opposition have condemned what they call a bid to enshrine a " presidency for life " and turn belarus into an " absolute monarchy " .
opposition parties launched a " say no to lukashenko " campaign and staged protests .
and there have been calls for a boycott .
q : what does the west think ?
the us state department and eu foreign ministers have warned that a flawed referendum will damage ties and further isolate belarus .
mr lukashenko responded by accusing the west of interference and plotting to oust him .
q : what does russia think ?
russian foreign ministry spokesman aleksandr yakovenko has said it is " up to the belarusian people " to decide .
q : what do opinion polls say ?
state media report almost universal support for mr lukashenko .
but a survey by belarusian independent pollster novak and lithuania 's gallup organisation says 53 % oppose lifting the two-term limit .
just 26.2 % said they would vote for mr lukashenko in a presidential election .
q : how does the general election fit in ?
the parliamentary poll is expected to tighten mr lukashenko 's grip .
while the opposition has managed to unite , its chances of challenging the pro-presidential parties are deemed slim .
the first-past-the-post system , a central election authority loyal to the president and recent clampdowns on the independent press all favour the president .
q : how does parliament work ?
the lower house has the power to throw out bills and even impeach the president .
in practice the president can count on a chamber of staunch supporters .
mr lukashenko regards mps more as civil servants than elected representatives .
he lectures them on their duties and harangues them if they dissent .
the president can disband the lower house if it votes no-confidence in the government or rejects a prime minister-designate twice .
q : how does voting work ?
the lower house has 110 members elected for a four-year term .
the system is first-past-the-post , with no proportional representation .
the seven-million electorate is divided into 110 constituencies .
to win , candidates must poll more than 50 % of votes on a turnout of 50 % plus one .
runoffs , if needed , are held within two weeks between the two frontrunners .
q : who is standing ?
the central electoral commission says 406 candidates were registered out of 692 applicants .
just 186 of these are members of political parties .
the opposition has accused the authorities of using technicalities to filter out rivals .
