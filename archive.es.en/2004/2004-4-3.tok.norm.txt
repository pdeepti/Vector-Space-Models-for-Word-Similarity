european commission candidates from the accession states are currently shadowing officials in brussels , learning the ropes .
but they must still face a confirmation process that could uncover skeletons in the closet . under the accession deal struck last year , each new european union member has the right to send one commissioner to the union 's top administrative body , the european commission , when the number of commissioners swells to 30 on may 1 .
in the past , the current 15 member states sent a total of 20 commissioners to brussels .
the five largest members - france , spain , italy , great britain and germany - were permitted to appoint two commissioners each .
that 's all about to change .
the new eu commissioners , almost all of whom have experience at the ministerial level in their home countries , will begin their work on may 1 .
they will have the same voting rights as the " old " commissioners , but during the first few months they will not be appointed to specific policy areas , known as directorate generals . initially , each will be appointed to an existing commissioner , who they will then shadow to learn more about the way things work in brussels .
each will be provided with a small staff of consultants and secretaries , but they will have have to rent their own office space . the running joke in brussels diplomatic circles is that they 'll be participating in " super internships . "
some are taking the temporary two-tiered system with a healthy dose of humor .
" we 'll have the most experience in november when the next batch of new people comes , " said danuta hübner , poland 's incoming commissioner .
a new commission bildunterschrift : on nov .
1 , the normal term of the current european commission expires , after five years under romano prodi 's stewardship .
the heads of state and government of the eu member states will select a new commission president at a summit planned for the end of june .
the president will then have until november to create a new commission that would likely include the 10 commissioners from the new member states who have already been selected .
however , elections are still on the agenda in a handful of accession states between now and november , and a change of government could also mean a change in the lineup of new commissioners .
the next commission will be smaller than the current one - shrinking from 30 members down to 25 , or one for each member country .
the larger countries are foregoing one commissioner as stipulated under the 2000 treaty of nice .
under the treaty , the commission president will also determine the area of competency for each new commissioner .
eu diplomats in brussels already say top brass are working feverishly to determine new departments in order to give each commissioner a sensible job .
the new eu commission president will first be chosen after elections in the european parliament this june .
the largest group in the parliament , the conservative european people 's party , is seeking to place one of its members at the commission 's helm .
the hottest names being bandied about at the moment are austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel and luxembourgian prime minister jean-claude juncker .
but it 's still too soon to rule out any surprises .
trouble expected for ex-communists the incoming commissioners from the accession states must still be confirmed by the council of ministers by a qualified majority and will then have to appear before a hearing of the european parliament at the end of april .
parliament will first hold a vote on the entire 30-head commission during the first weeks of may .
during this process , the candidates ' backgrounds will be put under the loop .
conservative politicians have already said they would seek to derail the appointment of any former communists from eastern europe .
however , 15 years after the fall of the berlin wall , social democrats have refused to go along with them .
the most suspicion on the part of politicians has been cast on siim kallas , the commissioner from estonia .
before the iron curtain went down , he was the head of the estonian state bank and a communist party member .
poland 's hübner was also a member of the communist party , but she resigned from the party before the fall of communism , which could help her case .
the european commission is a full-encompassing agency with close to 20,000 civil servants who are responsible for making sure member states adhere to the treaties and practices of the european union as well as overseeing its € 100 billion annual budget .
additionally , the commission is the only eu body with the legal right to introduce legislative initiatives in the eu - a status that makes it particularly influential .
the council of ministers and european parliament are only permitted to vote on directives that have been developed by the commission .

european commission candidates from the accession states are currently shadowing officials in brussels , learning the ropes .
but they must still face a confirmation process that could uncover skeletons in the closet . under the accession deal struck last year , each new european union member has the right to send one commissioner to the union 's top administrative body , the european commission , when the number of commissioners swells to 30 on may 1 .
in the past , the current 15 member states sent a total of 20 commissioners to brussels .
the five largest members - france , spain , italy , great britain and germany - were permitted to appoint two commissioners each .
that 's all about to change .
the new eu commissioners , almost all of whom have experience at the ministerial level in their home countries , will begin their work on may 1 .
they will have the same voting rights as the " old " commissioners , but during the first few months they will not be appointed to specific policy areas , known as directorate generals . initially , each will be appointed to an existing commissioner , who they will then shadow to learn more about the way things work in brussels .
each will be provided with a small staff of consultants and secretaries , but they will have have to rent their own office space . the running joke in brussels diplomatic circles is that they 'll be participating in " super internships . "
some are taking the temporary two-tiered system with a healthy dose of humor .
" we 'll have the most experience in november when the next batch of new people comes , " said danuta hübner , poland 's incoming commissioner .
a new commission bildunterschrift : on nov .
1 , the normal term of the current european commission expires , after five years under romano prodi 's stewardship .
the heads of state and government of the eu member states will select a new commission president at a summit planned for the end of june .
the president will then have until november to create a new commission that would likely include the 10 commissioners from the new member states who have already been selected .
however , elections are still on the agenda in a handful of accession states between now and november , and a change of government could also mean a change in the lineup of new commissioners .
the next commission will be smaller than the current one - shrinking from 30 members down to 25 , or one for each member country .
the larger countries are foregoing one commissioner as stipulated under the 2000 treaty of nice .
under the treaty , the commission president will also determine the area of competency for each new commissioner .
eu diplomats in brussels already say top brass are working feverishly to determine new departments in order to give each commissioner a sensible job .
the new eu commission president will first be chosen after elections in the european parliament this june .
the largest group in the parliament , the conservative european people 's party , is seeking to place one of its members at the commission 's helm .
the hottest names being bandied about at the moment are austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel and luxembourgian prime minister jean-claude juncker .
but it 's still too soon to rule out any surprises .
trouble expected for ex-communists the incoming commissioners from the accession states must still be confirmed by the council of ministers by a qualified majority and will then have to appear before a hearing of the european parliament at the end of april .

but they must still face a confirmation process that could uncover skeletons in the closet . under the accession deal struck last year , each new european union member has the right to send one commissioner to the union 's top administrative body , the european commission , when the number of commissioners swells to 30 on may 1 .
in the past , the current 15 member states sent a total of 20 commissioners to brussels .
the five largest members - france , spain , italy , great britain and germany - were permitted to appoint two commissioners each .
that 's all about to change .
the new eu commissioners , almost all of whom have experience at the ministerial level in their home countries , will begin their work on may 1 .
they will have the same voting rights as the " old " commissioners , but during the first few months they will not be appointed to specific policy areas , known as directorate generals . initially , each will be appointed to an existing commissioner , who they will then shadow to learn more about the way things work in brussels .
each will be provided with a small staff of consultants and secretaries , but they will have have to rent their own office space . the running joke in brussels diplomatic circles is that they 'll be participating in " super internships . "
some are taking the temporary two-tiered system with a healthy dose of humor .
" we 'll have the most experience in november when the next batch of new people comes , " said danuta hübner , poland 's incoming commissioner .
a new commission bildunterschrift : on nov .
1 , the normal term of the current european commission expires , after five years under romano prodi 's stewardship .
the heads of state and government of the eu member states will select a new commission president at a summit planned for the end of june .
the president will then have until november to create a new commission that would likely include the 10 commissioners from the new member states who have already been selected .
however , elections are still on the agenda in a handful of accession states between now and november , and a change of government could also mean a change in the lineup of new commissioners .
the next commission will be smaller than the current one - shrinking from 30 members down to 25 , or one for each member country .
the larger countries are foregoing one commissioner as stipulated under the 2000 treaty of nice .
under the treaty , the commission president will also determine the area of competency for each new commissioner .
eu diplomats in brussels already say top brass are working feverishly to determine new departments in order to give each commissioner a sensible job .
the new eu commission president will first be chosen after elections in the european parliament this june .
the largest group in the parliament , the conservative european people 's party , is seeking to place one of its members at the commission 's helm .
the hottest names being bandied about at the moment are austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel and luxembourgian prime minister jean-claude juncker .
but it 's still too soon to rule out any surprises .
trouble expected for ex-communists the incoming commissioners from the accession states must still be confirmed by the council of ministers by a qualified majority and will then have to appear before a hearing of the european parliament at the end of april .
parliament will first hold a vote on the entire 30-head commission during the first weeks of may .
during this process , the candidates ' backgrounds will be put under the loop .
conservative politicians have already said they would seek to derail the appointment of any former communists from eastern europe .
however , 15 years after the fall of the berlin wall , social democrats have refused to go along with them .
the most suspicion on the part of politicians has been cast on siim kallas , the commissioner from estonia .
before the iron curtain went down , he was the head of the estonian state bank and a communist party member .
poland 's hübner was also a member of the communist party , but she resigned from the party before the fall of communism , which could help her case .
the european commission is a full-encompassing agency with close to 20,000 civil servants who are responsible for making sure member states adhere to the treaties and practices of the european union as well as overseeing its € 100 billion annual budget .
additionally , the commission is the only eu body with the legal right to introduce legislative initiatives in the eu - a status that makes it particularly influential .
the council of ministers and european parliament are only permitted to vote on directives that have been developed by the commission .

european commission candidates from the accession states are currently shadowing officials in brussels , learning the ropes .
but they must still face a confirmation process that could uncover skeletons in the closet . under the accession deal struck last year , each new european union member has the right to send one commissioner to the union 's top administrative body , the european commission , when the number of commissioners swells to 30 on may 1 .
in the past , the current 15 member states sent a total of 20 commissioners to brussels .
the five largest members - france , spain , italy , great britain and germany - were permitted to appoint two commissioners each .
that 's all about to change .
the new eu commissioners , almost all of whom have experience at the ministerial level in their home countries , will begin their work on may 1 .
they will have the same voting rights as the " old " commissioners , but during the first few months they will not be appointed to specific policy areas , known as directorate generals . initially , each will be appointed to an existing commissioner , who they will then shadow to learn more about the way things work in brussels .
each will be provided with a small staff of consultants and secretaries , but they will have have to rent their own office space . the running joke in brussels diplomatic circles is that they 'll be participating in " super internships . "
some are taking the temporary two-tiered system with a healthy dose of humor .
" we 'll have the most experience in november when the next batch of new people comes , " said danuta hübner , poland 's incoming commissioner .
a new commission bildunterschrift : on nov .
1 , the normal term of the current european commission expires , after five years under romano prodi 's stewardship .
the heads of state and government of the eu member states will select a new commission president at a summit planned for the end of june .
the president will then have until november to create a new commission that would likely include the 10 commissioners from the new member states who have already been selected .
however , elections are still on the agenda in a handful of accession states between now and november , and a change of government could also mean a change in the lineup of new commissioners .
the next commission will be smaller than the current one - shrinking from 30 members down to 25 , or one for each member country .
the larger countries are foregoing one commissioner as stipulated under the 2000 treaty of nice .
under the treaty , the commission president will also determine the area of competency for each new commissioner .
eu diplomats in brussels already say top brass are working feverishly to determine new departments in order to give each commissioner a sensible job .
the new eu commission president will first be chosen after elections in the european parliament this june .
the largest group in the parliament , the conservative european people 's party , is seeking to place one of its members at the commission 's helm .
the hottest names being bandied about at the moment are austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel and luxembourgian prime minister jean-claude juncker .
but it 's still too soon to rule out any surprises .
trouble expected for ex-communists the incoming commissioners from the accession states must still be confirmed by the council of ministers by a qualified majority and will then have to appear before a hearing of the european parliament at the end of april .
parliament will first hold a vote on the entire 30-head commission during the first weeks of may .
during this process , the candidates ' backgrounds will be put under the loop .
conservative politicians have already said they would seek to derail the appointment of any former communists from eastern europe .
however , 15 years after the fall of the berlin wall , social democrats have refused to go along with them .
the most suspicion on the part of politicians has been cast on siim kallas , the commissioner from estonia .
before the iron curtain went down , he was the head of the estonian state bank and a communist party member .
poland 's hübner was also a member of the communist party , but she resigned from the party before the fall of communism , which could help her case .
the european commission is a full-encompassing agency with close to 20,000 civil servants who are responsible for making sure member states adhere to the treaties and practices of the european union as well as overseeing its € 100 billion annual budget .
additionally , the commission is the only eu body with the legal right to introduce legislative initiatives in the eu - a status that makes it particularly influential .
the council of ministers and european parliament are only permitted to vote on directives that have been developed by the commission .

european commission candidates from the accession states are currently shadowing officials in brussels , learning the ropes .
but they must still face a confirmation process that could uncover skeletons in the closet . under the accession deal struck last year , each new european union member has the right to send one commissioner to the union 's top administrative body , the european commission , when the number of commissioners swells to 30 on may 1 .
in the past , the current 15 member states sent a total of 20 commissioners to brussels .
the five largest members - france , spain , italy , great britain and germany - were permitted to appoint two commissioners each .
that 's all about to change .
the new eu commissioners , almost all of whom have experience at the ministerial level in their home countries , will begin their work on may 1 .
they will have the same voting rights as the " old " commissioners , but during the first few months they will not be appointed to specific policy areas , known as directorate generals . initially , each will be appointed to an existing commissioner , who they will then shadow to learn more about the way things work in brussels .
each will be provided with a small staff of consultants and secretaries , but they will have have to rent their own office space . the running joke in brussels diplomatic circles is that they 'll be participating in " super internships . "
some are taking the temporary two-tiered system with a healthy dose of humor .
" we 'll have the most experience in november when the next batch of new people comes , " said danuta hübner , poland 's incoming commissioner .
a new commission bildunterschrift : on nov .
1 , the normal term of the current european commission expires , after five years under romano prodi 's stewardship .
the heads of state and government of the eu member states will select a new commission president at a summit planned for the end of june .
the president will then have until november to create a new commission that would likely include the 10 commissioners from the new member states who have already been selected .
however , elections are still on the agenda in a handful of accession states between now and november , and a change of government could also mean a change in the lineup of new commissioners .
the next commission will be smaller than the current one - shrinking from 30 members down to 25 , or one for each member country .
the larger countries are foregoing one commissioner as stipulated under the 2000 treaty of nice .
under the treaty , the commission president will also determine the area of competency for each new commissioner .
eu diplomats in brussels already say top brass are working feverishly to determine new departments in order to give each commissioner a sensible job .
the new eu commission president will first be chosen after elections in the european parliament this june .
the largest group in the parliament , the conservative european people 's party , is seeking to place one of its members at the commission 's helm .
the hottest names being bandied about at the moment are austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel and luxembourgian prime minister jean-claude juncker .
but it 's still too soon to rule out any surprises .
trouble expected for ex-communists the incoming commissioners from the accession states must still be confirmed by the council of ministers by a qualified majority and will then have to appear before a hearing of the european parliament at the end of april .
parliament will first hold a vote on the entire 30-head commission during the first weeks of may .
during this process , the candidates ' backgrounds will be put under the loop .
conservative politicians have already said they would seek to derail the appointment of any former communists from eastern europe .
however , 15 years after the fall of the berlin wall , social democrats have refused to go along with them .
the most suspicion on the part of politicians has been cast on siim kallas , the commissioner from estonia .
before the iron curtain went down , he was the head of the estonian state bank and a communist party member .
poland 's hübner was also a member of the communist party , but she resigned from the party before the fall of communism , which could help her case .
the european commission is a full-encompassing agency with close to 20,000 civil servants who are responsible for making sure member states adhere to the treaties and practices of the european union as well as overseeing its € 100 billion annual budget .
additionally , the commission is the only eu body with the legal right to introduce legislative initiatives in the eu - a status that makes it particularly influential .

european commission candidates from the accession states are currently shadowing officials in brussels , learning the ropes .
but they must still face a confirmation process that could uncover skeletons in the closet . under the accession deal struck last year , each new european union member has the right to send one commissioner to the union 's top administrative body , the european commission , when the number of commissioners swells to 30 on may 1 .
in the past , the current 15 member states sent a total of 20 commissioners to brussels .
the five largest members - france , spain , italy , great britain and germany - were permitted to appoint two commissioners each .
that 's all about to change .
the new eu commissioners , almost all of whom have experience at the ministerial level in their home countries , will begin their work on may 1 .
they will have the same voting rights as the " old " commissioners , but during the first few months they will not be appointed to specific policy areas , known as directorate generals . initially , each will be appointed to an existing commissioner , who they will then shadow to learn more about the way things work in brussels .
each will be provided with a small staff of consultants and secretaries , but they will have have to rent their own office space . the running joke in brussels diplomatic circles is that they 'll be participating in " super internships . "

european commission candidates from the accession states are currently shadowing officials in brussels , learning the ropes .
but they must still face a confirmation process that could uncover skeletons in the closet . under the accession deal struck last year , each new european union member has the right to send one commissioner to the union 's top administrative body , the european commission , when the number of commissioners swells to 30 on may 1 .
in the past , the current 15 member states sent a total of 20 commissioners to brussels .
the five largest members - france , spain , italy , great britain and germany - were permitted to appoint two commissioners each .
that 's all about to change .
the new eu commissioners , almost all of whom have experience at the ministerial level in their home countries , will begin their work on may 1 .
they will have the same voting rights as the " old " commissioners , but during the first few months they will not be appointed to specific policy areas , known as directorate generals . initially , each will be appointed to an existing commissioner , who they will then shadow to learn more about the way things work in brussels .
each will be provided with a small staff of consultants and secretaries , but they will have have to rent their own office space . the running joke in brussels diplomatic circles is that they 'll be participating in " super internships . "
some are taking the temporary two-tiered system with a healthy dose of humor .
" we 'll have the most experience in november when the next batch of new people comes , " said danuta hübner , poland 's incoming commissioner .
a new commission bildunterschrift : on nov .
1 , the normal term of the current european commission expires , after five years under romano prodi 's stewardship .
the heads of state and government of the eu member states will select a new commission president at a summit planned for the end of june .
the president will then have until november to create a new commission that would likely include the 10 commissioners from the new member states who have already been selected .
however , elections are still on the agenda in a handful of accession states between now and november , and a change of government could also mean a change in the lineup of new commissioners .
the next commission will be smaller than the current one - shrinking from 30 members down to 25 , or one for each member country .
the larger countries are foregoing one commissioner as stipulated under the 2000 treaty of nice .
under the treaty , the commission president will also determine the area of competency for each new commissioner .
eu diplomats in brussels already say top brass are working feverishly to determine new departments in order to give each commissioner a sensible job .
the new eu commission president will first be chosen after elections in the european parliament this june .
the largest group in the parliament , the conservative european people 's party , is seeking to place one of its members at the commission 's helm .
the hottest names being bandied about at the moment are austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel and luxembourgian prime minister jean-claude juncker .
but it 's still too soon to rule out any surprises .
trouble expected for ex-communists the incoming commissioners from the accession states must still be confirmed by the council of ministers by a qualified majority and will then have to appear before a hearing of the european parliament at the end of april .
parliament will first hold a vote on the entire 30-head commission during the first weeks of may .
during this process , the candidates ' backgrounds will be put under the loop .
conservative politicians have already said they would seek to derail the appointment of any former communists from eastern europe .
however , 15 years after the fall of the berlin wall , social democrats have refused to go along with them .
the most suspicion on the part of politicians has been cast on siim kallas , the commissioner from estonia .
before the iron curtain went down , he was the head of the estonian state bank and a communist party member .
poland 's hübner was also a member of the communist party , but she resigned from the party before the fall of communism , which could help her case .
the european commission is a full-encompassing agency with close to 20,000 civil servants who are responsible for making sure member states adhere to the treaties and practices of the european union as well as overseeing its € 100 billion annual budget .
additionally , the commission is the only eu body with the legal right to introduce legislative initiatives in the eu - a status that makes it particularly influential .
the council of ministers and european parliament are only permitted to vote on directives that have been developed by the commission .

the most suspicion on the part of politicians has been cast on siim kallas , the commissioner from estonia .
before the iron curtain went down , he was the head of the estonian state bank and a communist party member .
poland 's hübner was also a member of the communist party , but she resigned from the party before the fall of communism , which could help her case .
the european commission is a full-encompassing agency with close to 20,000 civil servants who are responsible for making sure member states adhere to the treaties and practices of the european union as well as overseeing its € 100 billion annual budget .
additionally , the commission is the only eu body with the legal right to introduce legislative initiatives in the eu - a status that makes it particularly influential .
the council of ministers and european parliament are only permitted to vote on directives that have been developed by the commission .

european commission candidates from the accession states are currently shadowing officials in brussels , learning the ropes .
but they must still face a confirmation process that could uncover skeletons in the closet . under the accession deal struck last year , each new european union member has the right to send one commissioner to the union 's top administrative body , the european commission , when the number of commissioners swells to 30 on may 1 .
in the past , the current 15 member states sent a total of 20 commissioners to brussels .
the five largest members - france , spain , italy , great britain and germany - were permitted to appoint two commissioners each .
that 's all about to change .
the new eu commissioners , almost all of whom have experience at the ministerial level in their home countries , will begin their work on may 1 .
they will have the same voting rights as the " old " commissioners , but during the first few months they will not be appointed to specific policy areas , known as directorate generals . initially , each will be appointed to an existing commissioner , who they will then shadow to learn more about the way things work in brussels .
each will be provided with a small staff of consultants and secretaries , but they will have have to rent their own office space . the running joke in brussels diplomatic circles is that they 'll be participating in " super internships . "
some are taking the temporary two-tiered system with a healthy dose of humor .
" we 'll have the most experience in november when the next batch of new people comes , " said danuta hübner , poland 's incoming commissioner .
a new commission bildunterschrift : on nov .
1 , the normal term of the current european commission expires , after five years under romano prodi 's stewardship .
the heads of state and government of the eu member states will select a new commission president at a summit planned for the end of june .
the president will then have until november to create a new commission that would likely include the 10 commissioners from the new member states who have already been selected .
however , elections are still on the agenda in a handful of accession states between now and november , and a change of government could also mean a change in the lineup of new commissioners .
the next commission will be smaller than the current one - shrinking from 30 members down to 25 , or one for each member country .
the larger countries are foregoing one commissioner as stipulated under the 2000 treaty of nice .
under the treaty , the commission president will also determine the area of competency for each new commissioner .
eu diplomats in brussels already say top brass are working feverishly to determine new departments in order to give each commissioner a sensible job .
the new eu commission president will first be chosen after elections in the european parliament this june .
the largest group in the parliament , the conservative european people 's party , is seeking to place one of its members at the commission 's helm .
the hottest names being bandied about at the moment are austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel and luxembourgian prime minister jean-claude juncker .
but it 's still too soon to rule out any surprises .
trouble expected for ex-communists the incoming commissioners from the accession states must still be confirmed by the council of ministers by a qualified majority and will then have to appear before a hearing of the european parliament at the end of april .
parliament will first hold a vote on the entire 30-head commission during the first weeks of may .
during this process , the candidates ' backgrounds will be put under the loop .

they will have the same voting rights as the " old " commissioners , but during the first few months they will not be appointed to specific policy areas , known as directorate generals . initially , each will be appointed to an existing commissioner , who they will then shadow to learn more about the way things work in brussels .
each will be provided with a small staff of consultants and secretaries , but they will have have to rent their own office space . the running joke in brussels diplomatic circles is that they 'll be participating in " super internships . "
some are taking the temporary two-tiered system with a healthy dose of humor .
" we 'll have the most experience in november when the next batch of new people comes , " said danuta hübner , poland 's incoming commissioner .
a new commission bildunterschrift : on nov .
1 , the normal term of the current european commission expires , after five years under romano prodi 's stewardship .
the heads of state and government of the eu member states will select a new commission president at a summit planned for the end of june .
the president will then have until november to create a new commission that would likely include the 10 commissioners from the new member states who have already been selected .
however , elections are still on the agenda in a handful of accession states between now and november , and a change of government could also mean a change in the lineup of new commissioners .
the next commission will be smaller than the current one - shrinking from 30 members down to 25 , or one for each member country .
the larger countries are foregoing one commissioner as stipulated under the 2000 treaty of nice .
under the treaty , the commission president will also determine the area of competency for each new commissioner .
eu diplomats in brussels already say top brass are working feverishly to determine new departments in order to give each commissioner a sensible job .
the new eu commission president will first be chosen after elections in the european parliament this june .
the largest group in the parliament , the conservative european people 's party , is seeking to place one of its members at the commission 's helm .
the hottest names being bandied about at the moment are austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel and luxembourgian prime minister jean-claude juncker .
but it 's still too soon to rule out any surprises .
trouble expected for ex-communists the incoming commissioners from the accession states must still be confirmed by the council of ministers by a qualified majority and will then have to appear before a hearing of the european parliament at the end of april .
parliament will first hold a vote on the entire 30-head commission during the first weeks of may .
during this process , the candidates ' backgrounds will be put under the loop .
conservative politicians have already said they would seek to derail the appointment of any former communists from eastern europe .
however , 15 years after the fall of the berlin wall , social democrats have refused to go along with them .
the most suspicion on the part of politicians has been cast on siim kallas , the commissioner from estonia .
before the iron curtain went down , he was the head of the estonian state bank and a communist party member .
poland 's hübner was also a member of the communist party , but she resigned from the party before the fall of communism , which could help her case .
the european commission is a full-encompassing agency with close to 20,000 civil servants who are responsible for making sure member states adhere to the treaties and practices of the european union as well as overseeing its € 100 billion annual budget .
additionally , the commission is the only eu body with the legal right to introduce legislative initiatives in the eu - a status that makes it particularly influential .
the council of ministers and european parliament are only permitted to vote on directives that have been developed by the commission .

european commission candidates from the accession states are currently shadowing officials in brussels , learning the ropes .
but they must still face a confirmation process that could uncover skeletons in the closet . under the accession deal struck last year , each new european union member has the right to send one commissioner to the union 's top administrative body , the european commission , when the number of commissioners swells to 30 on may 1 .
in the past , the current 15 member states sent a total of 20 commissioners to brussels .
the five largest members - france , spain , italy , great britain and germany - were permitted to appoint two commissioners each .
that 's all about to change .
the new eu commissioners , almost all of whom have experience at the ministerial level in their home countries , will begin their work on may 1 .
they will have the same voting rights as the " old " commissioners , but during the first few months they will not be appointed to specific policy areas , known as directorate generals . initially , each will be appointed to an existing commissioner , who they will then shadow to learn more about the way things work in brussels .
each will be provided with a small staff of consultants and secretaries , but they will have have to rent their own office space . the running joke in brussels diplomatic circles is that they 'll be participating in " super internships . "
some are taking the temporary two-tiered system with a healthy dose of humor .
" we 'll have the most experience in november when the next batch of new people comes , " said danuta hübner , poland 's incoming commissioner .
a new commission bildunterschrift : on nov .
1 , the normal term of the current european commission expires , after five years under romano prodi 's stewardship .
the heads of state and government of the eu member states will select a new commission president at a summit planned for the end of june .
the president will then have until november to create a new commission that would likely include the 10 commissioners from the new member states who have already been selected .
however , elections are still on the agenda in a handful of accession states between now and november , and a change of government could also mean a change in the lineup of new commissioners .
the next commission will be smaller than the current one - shrinking from 30 members down to 25 , or one for each member country .
the larger countries are foregoing one commissioner as stipulated under the 2000 treaty of nice .
under the treaty , the commission president will also determine the area of competency for each new commissioner .
eu diplomats in brussels already say top brass are working feverishly to determine new departments in order to give each commissioner a sensible job .
the new eu commission president will first be chosen after elections in the european parliament this june .
the largest group in the parliament , the conservative european people 's party , is seeking to place one of its members at the commission 's helm .
the hottest names being bandied about at the moment are austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel and luxembourgian prime minister jean-claude juncker .
but it 's still too soon to rule out any surprises .
trouble expected for ex-communists the incoming commissioners from the accession states must still be confirmed by the council of ministers by a qualified majority and will then have to appear before a hearing of the european parliament at the end of april .
parliament will first hold a vote on the entire 30-head commission during the first weeks of may .
during this process , the candidates ' backgrounds will be put under the loop .
conservative politicians have already said they would seek to derail the appointment of any former communists from eastern europe .
however , 15 years after the fall of the berlin wall , social democrats have refused to go along with them .
the most suspicion on the part of politicians has been cast on siim kallas , the commissioner from estonia .
before the iron curtain went down , he was the head of the estonian state bank and a communist party member .
poland 's hübner was also a member of the communist party , but she resigned from the party before the fall of communism , which could help her case .
the european commission is a full-encompassing agency with close to 20,000 civil servants who are responsible for making sure member states adhere to the treaties and practices of the european union as well as overseeing its € 100 billion annual budget .
additionally , the commission is the only eu body with the legal right to introduce legislative initiatives in the eu - a status that makes it particularly influential .
the council of ministers and european parliament are only permitted to vote on directives that have been developed by the commission .

mayor ken livingstone wants to extend the £ 5 road toll westwards , which would also cover more parts of westminster .
but residents say it would damage their quality of life despite a transport for london -lrb- tfl -rrb- survey suggesting 53 % of them wanted the charge .
the march at 1100 bst begins at the cricket field in holland park .
the extended boundary would stop just short of shepherd 's bush to the west , run as far north as kensal green cemetery and down to chelsea embankment in the south , and it could be in place as early as 2006 .
bigger residential area congestion charging was introduced in february 2003 for people driving throughout an eight-square-mile zone of central london .
it has reduced traffic and journey times but some businesses claim in has damaged trade .
about 3.3m households , 250,000 businesses and 1,400 other bodies have received a leaflet outlining tfl plans for the extension .
the expansion would cover a much more residential area ; about 230,000 residents compared to the 150,000 people living in the current zone .
a tfl survey last year suggested over half of residents in kensington and chelsea wanted the charge .
but this is disputed by the council , which says the plans split the borough , leaving 20,000 residents outside the zone .
its survey found 61 % of the 1,800 people surveyed gave a " flat no " to any kind of extension and only 2.5 % supported the current extension scheme .
any expansion would only take place after tfl has assessed two years of the current scheme 's performance and if mr livingstone wins this year 's mayoral elections on 10 june .
financial case the mayor is also awaiting the outcome of the government spending review before he can work out how much he has to spend on his transport policies .
he has said there is no " financial case " for an extension to the zone .
it is expected to bring in £ 10m a year but would cost about £ 100m to set up .
but he said the remaining part of westminster and the affected part of kensington and chelsea were " pressing cases " for the charge 's economic and financial benefits .

welsh education minister jane davidson has supported carmarthenshire council 's plans to shut llanddowror school , near st clears .
council leaders said it was " great news " because it would allow pupils to have a more modern education .
the school building will become a community centre .
the education authority said the closure was part of its plans to raise education standards across the county .
we have always maintained we are trying to create the best environment for youngsters to get a good education mary thomas , carmarthenshire council the closure of small schools in many areas of rural wales has been controversial , because pupils would have to travel further from their home areas .
but supporters claim small schools are often too old or too costly to run .
it was approved by the council last year , and lifelong learning executive member mary thomas said : " this is great news because we have always maintained we are trying to create the best environment for youngsters to get a good education .
" we believe the plans we have outlined will give pupils the best and most modern facilities and the best chance to achieve their potential . "
pupils from llanddowror will go to ysgol gryffudd jones in st clears , or other nearby church in wales schools from september .
local authorities say the cost per pupil in small schools is greater than in larger ones .

mohammed momin khawaja has been charged with helping a " terrorist group " in canada and the uk since last november .
in london , nine men are still being held by anti-terrorism police in connection with a suspected bomb plot .
the royal canadian mounted police said they were confirming the link because of speculation in the media .
" recent developments in the case permit us to confirm that the actions taken in the arrest and charge of mr khawaja of ottawa are related to the arrests in the united kingdom , " said a police statement .
mr khawaja , a 24-year-old canadian software developer of pakistani descent , was arrested at work on monday .
he appeared in court in ottawa via video-link from a detention centre on friday , and faces a bail hearing on wednesday .
the bbc 's lee carter in toronto reports that mr khawaja 's lawyer says even his client has not been told about the evidence against him , although he has been shown some of it by the prosecution .

qasim khawaja added that he had reason to believe that their father mahboob had been arrested in saudi arabia .
mahboob khawaja , a university professor born in pakistan and based in saudi arabia , has published several works on conflict resolution in which he calls for better understanding of islamic fundamentalism .
canada 's department of foreign affairs said it has no information on mahboob khawaja 's whereabouts .
mohammed khawaja is the first person to be charged under canada 's anti-terrorism act , which came into effect in december 2001 .

until now , these unoccupied residences have enjoyed a 50 % reduction on the tax , but from now on local authorities will be able to charge up to 90 % of the standard rate .
we asked for your comments .
this is what you had to say : a large number of second homes are used by people who work away from their main home because their jobs have moved .
most of them do not own the home , they are renting small flats .
but they are classed as second home owners .
the home is only used for four or five nights a week - usually by a single person - but they now pay more council tax than a single person who is a seven day a week resident .
if you can afford a second property for holidays then you can afford to pay the council tax on it max the away-from-home workers usually have very tight budgets because of the need to run two homes on the salary that most people use to run one .
i think the intention of the legislation was probably quite reasonable , but as is so often the case , the government did not look closely enough at the detail , and has inadvertently created a lot of financial hardship amongst a group of not very well-off people .
my home is in west wales , and literally hundreds of people now have to work away because there are very few jobs .
martin if you can afford a second property for holidays then you can afford to pay the council tax on it .
and if you can not afford to pay the council tax on a second property then sell it .
but do not expect the rest of us to pick up the tab for you .
max there are arguments for and against , but what is intolerable is that only a few local authorities are going to use their extra income to reduce the overall council tax .
roy bradley i have no problem with second homeowners having to pay more council tax .
often in the more rural parts of the country the impact of so many second homes is very negative .
this simply discourages flexibility and freedom in the employment marketplace roger crossley but this move has also caught those - like myself - who have a small flat in a second town in order to maintain a job .
in my case , the company i work for relocated .
i wanted to keep working for the company but did not want to move house .
my wife has a good job and we did not want her to give that up .
so i spend three or four nights in saffron walden in a small rented single flat .
until this month the council tax rebate we received was 50 % .
now it has dropped to 10 % , even less than the 25 % i would get if i lived alone in the flat .
i believe this simply discourages flexibility and freedom in the employment marketplace .
roger crossley here in cornwall there are so many second home owners that young couples can not find or afford any type of property .
second home owners are able to pay prices beyond the reach of those receiving the low wages of this region .
and second home owners do not put as much into the local economy as a unit as a family in occupancy all year .
gavin a. macdonald i am somewhat confused .
council tax pays for local services .
by definition , a second home owner uses far less of these services .
why should i pay any less than someone who lives in that community all the time ?
jane mace i have a second home in the docklands .
i pay a service charge for security , lighting , refuse collection and so on , in what is a secure site .
as it is a second home i am not registered to vote there , and i am never going to use schools , or local doctors , so why should i subsidise the services provided to others ?
peter gibbinson it came as a complete surprise to me that as the owner of two places i should pay less council tax on the one that i - or members of my family - only stay in part of the time .
of course i should pay full rate .
put in crude terms , my absence from the second home for most of the time deprives the local economy of the spending i could be doing in that area .
yet the local services continue to be provided to me as if i was an active member of the community there .
why should i pay any less than someone who lives in that community all the time ?
jane mace i believe this change should go further , although a reduction in the discount of up to 40 % may have been too much to have applied in one go .
after a few years to allow for adjustment , councils should be permitted to raise tax on second homes to above 100 % of the normal rate , but the increase should be limited to , say , 10 % .
police are still needed to keep an eye on the neighbourhood , refuse collectors still check the dustbins , street lighting is still used dave cheetham at the lower end of the market , second homes directly and significantly increase the housing costs of key workers and of the children of local residents .
at the upper end , they tend to raise the level of all house prices in the area .
most of those who can afford a second home - even for commuting purposes - can afford to pay a premium council tax .
those who can not should sell up and thereby help local key workers and young people .
i am not directly affected , but everyone in the uk is indirectly impacted by the problems of rural and coastal communities .
john symons people with second homes should be charged the full rate .
even if the home is unoccupied for periods of time , the same services have to be provided .
police are still needed to keep an eye on the neighbourhood , refuse collectors still check the dustbins , street lighting is still used .
why should they have any discount at all ?
if they can afford a second home , they should pay more because of the damage they do to the local economy by not supporting such things as the local shop ; and depriving a local person of affordable housing .
dave cheetham i can not see a problem with people paying more council tax if they have second homes .
there are so many homeless people in britain , that people having more than one home seems selfish .
it drives house prices up , as it does the cost of providing welfare for homeless people .
i can not live in my property for six months of every year .
mark could the government also look at charging homes with multiple occupants more than similar homes with two occupants ?
also why can single people not get a 50 % discount now , instead of a 25 % discount ?
jonathan wright i own a second property by the river thames , and have just been informed that the percentage of my rates due has risen from 50 to 90 % .
my property either floods , or is under flood threat between october and april because it is built only a few feet above the summer river level .
i therefore can not live in my property for six months of every year .
why should i pay 90 % of the rates of someone who can live in their second home all year around if they so chose ?

but do not expect the rest of us to pick up the tab for you .
max there are arguments for and against , but what is intolerable is that only a few local authorities are going to use their extra income to reduce the overall council tax .
roy bradley i have no problem with second homeowners having to pay more council tax .
often in the more rural parts of the country the impact of so many second homes is very negative .
this simply discourages flexibility and freedom in the employment marketplace roger crossley but this move has also caught those - like myself - who have a small flat in a second town in order to maintain a job .
in my case , the company i work for relocated .
i wanted to keep working for the company but did not want to move house .
my wife has a good job and we did not want her to give that up .
so i spend three or four nights in saffron walden in a small rented single flat .
until this month the council tax rebate we received was 50 % .
now it has dropped to 10 % , even less than the 25 % i would get if i lived alone in the flat .
i believe this simply discourages flexibility and freedom in the employment marketplace .
roger crossley here in cornwall there are so many second home owners that young couples can not find or afford any type of property .
second home owners are able to pay prices beyond the reach of those receiving the low wages of this region .
and second home owners do not put as much into the local economy as a unit as a family in occupancy all year .
gavin a. macdonald i am somewhat confused .
council tax pays for local services .
by definition , a second home owner uses far less of these services .
why should i pay any less than someone who lives in that community all the time ?
jane mace i have a second home in the docklands .
i pay a service charge for security , lighting , refuse collection and so on , in what is a secure site .
as it is a second home i am not registered to vote there , and i am never going to use schools , or local doctors , so why should i subsidise the services provided to others ?
peter gibbinson it came as a complete surprise to me that as the owner of two places i should pay less council tax on the one that i - or members of my family - only stay in part of the time .
of course i should pay full rate .
put in crude terms , my absence from the second home for most of the time deprives the local economy of the spending i could be doing in that area .
yet the local services continue to be provided to me as if i was an active member of the community there .
why should i pay any less than someone who lives in that community all the time ?
jane mace i believe this change should go further , although a reduction in the discount of up to 40 % may have been too much to have applied in one go .
after a few years to allow for adjustment , councils should be permitted to raise tax on second homes to above 100 % of the normal rate , but the increase should be limited to , say , 10 % .
police are still needed to keep an eye on the neighbourhood , refuse collectors still check the dustbins , street lighting is still used dave cheetham at the lower end of the market , second homes directly and significantly increase the housing costs of key workers and of the children of local residents .
at the upper end , they tend to raise the level of all house prices in the area .
most of those who can afford a second home - even for commuting purposes - can afford to pay a premium council tax .
those who can not should sell up and thereby help local key workers and young people .
i am not directly affected , but everyone in the uk is indirectly impacted by the problems of rural and coastal communities .
john symons people with second homes should be charged the full rate .
even if the home is unoccupied for periods of time , the same services have to be provided .
police are still needed to keep an eye on the neighbourhood , refuse collectors still check the dustbins , street lighting is still used .
why should they have any discount at all ?
if they can afford a second home , they should pay more because of the damage they do to the local economy by not supporting such things as the local shop ; and depriving a local person of affordable housing .
dave cheetham i can not see a problem with people paying more council tax if they have second homes .
there are so many homeless people in britain , that people having more than one home seems selfish .
it drives house prices up , as it does the cost of providing welfare for homeless people .
i can not live in my property for six months of every year .
mark could the government also look at charging homes with multiple occupants more than similar homes with two occupants ?
also why can single people not get a 50 % discount now , instead of a 25 % discount ?
jonathan wright i own a second property by the river thames , and have just been informed that the percentage of my rates due has risen from 50 to 90 % .
my property either floods , or is under flood threat between october and april because it is built only a few feet above the summer river level .
i therefore can not live in my property for six months of every year .
why should i pay 90 % of the rates of someone who can live in their second home all year around if they so chose ?

the appointment of michael grade as the bbc 's new chairman - to pick up the pieces after the hutton affair - has been almost universally welcomed , by the industry , by politicians and the press .
even the daily mail - the harshest of his critics and the paper that labelled him the pornographer in chief during his tenure at channel 4 - has decided to bury the hatchet .
if anyone can save the bbc , it is michael grade the daily mirror in a leader headed " a huge challenge " , it writes : " the deed is done .
mr grade now takes the chair .
and since this is a moment to look forwards rather than back , we unstintingly wish him the best of luck .
he will need it . "
others have been much warmer .
the daily mirror says : " if you had to draw an identikit picture of the bbc chairman , it would have michael grade 's qualities .
and we do n't just say that because he hones his popular touch when he worked on the daily mirror .
if anyone can save the bbc , it is michael grade . "
the tories ' media spokeswoman , julie kirkbride , heaped praise on him , saying his wealth of experience made him an ideal candidate and the bbc would relish his " colourful and occasionally controversial " character .
yet right till the last minute there were real doubts that he would get the job .
on thursday , when the financial times revealed the announcement was to come this week , a fortnight earlier than expected , it said ministers had gone for a safe pair of hands .
that seemed to put grade out of the reckoning .
feud there was a widespread feeling that downing street would never approve his appointment because of his longstanding feud with john birt , the former director-general who now works in number 10 as an adviser .
the fact that the culture secretary tessa jowell nonetheless recommended his appointment , and downing street approved it , shows ministers really do want to put the hutton affair behind them .
now comes the hard part the long and acrimonious battle between the bbc and the government has been hugely damaging to both sides .
the hutton report , universally recognised as one-sided , made matters worse .
grade now faces tough challenges .
the mere fact of his appointment helps , sending the right signals to bbc staff and those outside that the bbc is in the hands of a man who believes in the licence fee , its independence from government and the right of future generations to gain - as their parents and grandparents have - from an institution that has brought huge benefits to the nation .
but now comes the hard part .
the in-tray first he - with the board of governors - must appoint a director-general to take the bbc forward after the disruption and damage caused by the kelly affair .
second , he must address the dual role of the governors - as both champions and regulators of the bbc - which he says needs , at the very least , clarification but almost certainly repair and real change .
and thirdly he must lead the bbc 's response to the government 's charter review process , faced with attacks from commercial rivals and others who say the bbc has become too big and powerful and should be cut down to size .
for months , ms jowell has been saying that the one certain outcome of the charter review process would be a strong bbc , independent of government .
grade 's appointment shows she means it and makes that outcome more likely than once seemed possible .

figures from the royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- said the north is the top area in england for nesting seabirds .
all of england 's gannets and black guillemots are found there , along with virtually all the puffins , arctic terns , roseate terns and kittiwakes .
the seabird 2000 census ends a four-year study into the uk 's seabirds .
it shows that the coastline of the north east , cumbria and yorkshire supports more than 80 % of the english total of many seabird species .
the rspb 's reserve at coquet island , off the northumberland coast , is now the uk 's stronghold for roseate terns and the breeding population on the island has more than doubled in the last five years .
' living barometers ' it is believed that virtually the entire english population nested there last year .

roseate terns are flourishing in northumberland rspb regional director andy bunten said : " a visit to one of the north of england 's superb seabird colonies in summer is an unforgettable experience , and these seabird cities provide some of the most exciting wildlife spectacles these islands can offer .
" the presence of tens of thousands of seabirds around our shores provides living proof of the richness of the seas around our coast , but these birds are also sensitive living barometers and the declines of some species are worrying . "
the results of the seabird 2000 census represents the work of more than 1,000 surveyors , counting 3,200 colonies along 40,000km of coastline , and at 900 inland sites .

figures from the royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- said the north is the top area in england for nesting seabirds .
all of england 's gannets and black guillemots are found there , along with virtually all the puffins , arctic terns , roseate terns and kittiwakes .

it shows that the coastline of the north east , cumbria and yorkshire supports more than 80 % of the english total of many seabird species .
the rspb 's reserve at coquet island , off the northumberland coast , is now the uk 's stronghold for roseate terns and the breeding population on the island has more than doubled in the last five years .
' living barometers ' it is believed that virtually the entire english population nested there last year .
but while the number of breeding seabirds has risen steadily over the last 30 years to about eight million , the survey also reveals some species , particularly several species of tern , are suffering population declines .
roseate terns are flourishing in northumberland rspb regional director andy bunten said : " a visit to one of the north of england 's superb seabird colonies in summer is an unforgettable experience , and these seabird cities provide some of the most exciting wildlife spectacles these islands can offer .

the results of the seabird 2000 census represents the work of more than 1,000 surveyors , counting 3,200 colonies along 40,000km of coastline , and at 900 inland sites .

several point the finger of blame at islamist militants .
some papers see political lessons for the incoming government of prime minister-elect rodriguez zapatero .
el pais says the fact the same kind of explosives and a similar detonator was found in friday 's bomb to those used in the madrid attacks on 11th march " suggests that in both cases it is the same terrorist organisation , supposedly the moroccan islamic combatant group " .
the paper says that if the same group that carried out the madrid bombings was responsible for planting the device on friday , it poses a " very serious security problem " .
" it indicates ... we are not talking about a passing terrorism ... but a stable presence prepared for any barbarity , " it says in an editorial .
we are not an accidental victim of al-qaeda , but another front in its terrorist war against the free world abc under the headline " living under the threat " , la razon expresses shock at the possible consequences if the bomb had not been found in time .
" our enemies know us well and know how to do us most harm , " the paper writes .
" this threat exists , it is now among us and we must prepare ourselves for a long battle which can only have one ending : that of the victory of freedom , democracy and the rule of law in the face of the dark forces of freedom-destroying islamic fundamentalism . "
firing line abc has some advice for the incoming administration of prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero .
" to blackmail his next government is to blackmail all spain and all the groups concerned with the national interest .
now , more than ever , this demands dignity , firmness and determination , " it says .
spain is in the firing line of islamic terrorism el mundo " it is not possible to bargain with international terrorism , because neither must a state offer to do so , nor is it what the terrorists are looking for .
rather they are looking for a total backdown .
as a result , from now on , rodriguez zapatero must take care with every word and move . "
" we are not an accidental victim of al-qaeda , but another front in its terrorist war against the free world , " the paper believes .
el mundo suggests that , but for the effective action of security officials , the ' friday of sorrows ' , as the friday before good friday is known , could have become literally true and " we would be lamenting the savage murder of another few hundred people " .
" together with the letter sent to our embassy in cairo , in which a terrorist group from egypt threatened attacks against spanish interests if spain does not withdraw its troops from iraq and afghanistan within four weeks , this allows us to arrive at the alarming conclusion that spain is in the firing line of islamic terrorism , " the paper writes .
it warns that if mr zapatero were to shorten his timescale on withdrawing spanish troops from iraq if the un does not play a bigger role there , this would be the " same as giving in to terror " .
the paper argues that the bomb find proves wrong those who accuse mr rodriguez zapatero of appeasing terrorists with his withdrawal pledge .
" another bomb does not give the impression of appeased individuals , " it says .
