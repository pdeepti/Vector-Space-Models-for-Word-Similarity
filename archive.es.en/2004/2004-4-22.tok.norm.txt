hitlist harry sings a takeoff of a german pop song and susi smart thanks her benefactor in english , french and japanese . the three faceless , orange characters are solar-powered , multilingual rubbish bins .
the berlin city sanitation department introduced the five trashcan characters on wednesday in an effort to show that cleanliness is " cool " and to help polish the capital 's image .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.04.2004 german foreign minister pushes for reform in armenia , georgia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armenian president robert kocharian is under pressure to resign .
joschka fischer will wrap up his trip to the caucasus region on thursday with stops in armenia and georgia .
his visit in armenia comes during considerable political instability in the country . following visits to afghanistan and azerbaijan , germany 's fischer continued his week-long trip abroad by arriving in the armenian capital yerevan on thursday morning .
as he did in azerbaijan , he is expected to encourage both southern caucasus nations to continue to improve their democratic and human rights credentials by holding out the prospect of closer ties to the european union . fischer will need plenty of diplomatic tact in yerevan , since armenian president robert kocharian is under increasing pressure to step down .
on wednesday , opposition groups held a protest rally that attracted an estimated 10,000 people , according to the associated press .
opposition groups allege kocharian won reelection last year only through widespread election fraud , a charge which the president denies . tensions in the country rose on april 13 , when police used force to break up a protest rally .
around 100 people were reportedly detained and several protestors were injured .
" any administration relying on violence is doomed .
kocharian must go , " said stepan demirchyan , leader of the opposition justice party and runner-up in last year 's presidential election , according to the reuters news agency . kocharian 's opponents hope to oust him though continued popular unrest , similar to how neighboring georgia toppled the government of former president eduard shevardnadze late last year .
but some experts are skeptical kocharian will be removed from power . " the armenian authorities are better consolidated and will defend their position more strongly .
moreover , there 's no clear leader of the opposition like there was in georgia , " andranik migranyan told dw-radio . conflict with azerbaijan while in yerevan , fischer will also address the dispute over the nagorno-karabakh region , which though part of azerbaijan has been separated from the country since the mid-1990s after a war with ethnic armenians .
a cease-fire in the conflict was signed in 1994 , but the final status of nagorno-karabakh has not been resolved .
in the azerbaijani capital baku on wednesday , fischer already said germany and the eu were prepared to help find a solution to the conflict . fischer 's visit to armenia will also include a memorial for armenians killed by turks in 1915 .
the armenians claim ottoman turkish forces committed genocide at the time , slaughtering some 1.5 million people between 1915 and 1923 .
turkey rejects the charges , saying the armenians were killed in a partisan war as the ottoman empire collapsed . heading to tbilisi later in the day , fischer will meet with georgian president mikhail saakashvili to show support for his western oriented reform course .
saakashvili came to power in a bloodless coup that ousted shevardnadze in november , but he has run into trouble recently , as military commanders in the rebellious black sea province of adzhara refuse to follow the orders of the central government . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rebuilding afghanistan and setting an example for iraq during his visit to afghanistan on tuesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer praised the work of german troops and said the reconstruction effort there should serve as a role model to iraq .

lithuania and latvia , for example , will need decades to reach our economic level .
how can you ensure that economically a europe of two speeds does n't develop ? you could also ask why greece , an eu member for 30 years , has n't been able to reduce the distance to the rest of the eu - but still no one talks about a europe of two economic speeds .
what we see is a higher speed of growth in the new countries , and that 's good . people talk about 50 to 60 years for some of the new member countries . … but where 's the problem ?
it took a long time with ireland too .
for greece the distance from the average is still the same but in the meantime at a much higher level .
the most important thing is that the new member countries grow , and their growth potential is large .
incidentally , individual citizens ' or businesses ' rights to eu funds do n't arise from eu membership .
it 's not like it was with german unification .
unification has cost € 1.25 trillion so far .
in contrast , expansion can not put us in danger in terms of costs because the eu budget is club funds by nature .
the club ca n't spend one euro more than the members voluntarily put into the club funds . in negotiations with countries such as poland , people had the impression that they want to get the maximum out of europe and only contribute a little .
did that annoy you ? certainly not .
poland negotiated well but no tougher than others ; they are n't getting more either .
even in 2013 , the union 's per capita benefits for poland will be distinctly lower than the per capita benefits for spain .
poland is a large country , a very proud nation , that needs a certain amount of time to find its place and role in the european union .
people should show a little patience and not pillory a country that is encumbered by a formidable historic burden . still , the new members apparently have n't completed the homework that is a condition for receiving eu funds .
for example , corruption in the new member states , such as slovakia or the czech republic , is high .
how will you get that under control ? i ca n't dispute that a certain kind of corruption remains quite strong in these countries - in connection with large-scale privatization , for example .
-lrb- german interior minister -rrb- otto schily once said he thought that around 10 percent of the funds that went to eastern germany in the context of economic reconstruction were illegal .
i would n't estimate the magnitude to be so high for poland and the czech republic .
but it is a typical phenomenon . regarding homework , i would n't agree with your thesis .
on may 1 we will see that the new member countries will assume -lrb- eu -rrb- community law to 100 percent .
while in the old countries more than 2,000 legal actions are underway due to contract breaches , that is , due to the incomplete or completely inadequate application of community law . do you mean to say that the new acceding states are better prepared than earlier acceding states ? it 's safe to say that .
although we have much more extensive and complicated community legislation today .
now there 's much , much more to negotiate .
during earlier expansions , the commission was n't worried about whether the greeks , spanish or portuguese were also capable of applying community law .
this is an entirely new method that we first developed for this expansion . the balkan countries want to join the eu ; the accession of turkey , romania and bulgaria 's is planned for 2007 .
where do you think europe stops ? romania and bulgaria are part of the current round .
and then everything 's open .
the balkan countries do indeed have the prospect of joining , though there 's no schedule for them .
they are still too far away from national or regional stability or also from economic integration - with the exception of croatia , whose accession application has been submitted .
turkey is a special case .
it has had the prospect of joining since 1963 .
at the end of the year it will be decided whether turkey has in the meantime gotten far enough to start negotiations . for the eastern european countries , such as russia , ukraine , but also the caucasus countries or the southern mediterranean countries , membership is not on the agenda .
however , we offer these countries very far-ranging neighborhood policies . your time as expansion commissioner comes to an end on may 1 … correct , i have made myself redundant .
but do n't forget bulgaria , romania and turkey . what will you do afterwards ? i will remain a member of the -lrb- european -rrb- commission until november 1 .
beyond that nothing has been decided .

for greece the distance from the average is still the same but in the meantime at a much higher level .
the most important thing is that the new member countries grow , and their growth potential is large .
incidentally , individual citizens ' or businesses ' rights to eu funds do n't arise from eu membership .
it 's not like it was with german unification .
unification has cost € 1.25 trillion so far .
in contrast , expansion can not put us in danger in terms of costs because the eu budget is club funds by nature .
the club ca n't spend one euro more than the members voluntarily put into the club funds . in negotiations with countries such as poland , people had the impression that they want to get the maximum out of europe and only contribute a little .
did that annoy you ? certainly not .
poland negotiated well but no tougher than others ; they are n't getting more either .
even in 2013 , the union 's per capita benefits for poland will be distinctly lower than the per capita benefits for spain .
poland is a large country , a very proud nation , that needs a certain amount of time to find its place and role in the european union .
people should show a little patience and not pillory a country that is encumbered by a formidable historic burden . still , the new members apparently have n't completed the homework that is a condition for receiving eu funds .
for example , corruption in the new member states , such as slovakia or the czech republic , is high .
how will you get that under control ? i ca n't dispute that a certain kind of corruption remains quite strong in these countries - in connection with large-scale privatization , for example .
-lrb- german interior minister -rrb- otto schily once said he thought that around 10 percent of the funds that went to eastern germany in the context of economic reconstruction were illegal .
i would n't estimate the magnitude to be so high for poland and the czech republic .
but it is a typical phenomenon . regarding homework , i would n't agree with your thesis .
on may 1 we will see that the new member countries will assume -lrb- eu -rrb- community law to 100 percent .
while in the old countries more than 2,000 legal actions are underway due to contract breaches , that is , due to the incomplete or completely inadequate application of community law . do you mean to say that the new acceding states are better prepared than earlier acceding states ? it 's safe to say that .
although we have much more extensive and complicated community legislation today .
now there 's much , much more to negotiate .
during earlier expansions , the commission was n't worried about whether the greeks , spanish or portuguese were also capable of applying community law .
this is an entirely new method that we first developed for this expansion . the balkan countries want to join the eu ; the accession of turkey , romania and bulgaria 's is planned for 2007 .
where do you think europe stops ? romania and bulgaria are part of the current round .
and then everything 's open .
the balkan countries do indeed have the prospect of joining , though there 's no schedule for them .
they are still too far away from national or regional stability or also from economic integration - with the exception of croatia , whose accession application has been submitted .
turkey is a special case .
it has had the prospect of joining since 1963 .
at the end of the year it will be decided whether turkey has in the meantime gotten far enough to start negotiations . for the eastern european countries , such as russia , ukraine , but also the caucasus countries or the southern mediterranean countries , membership is not on the agenda .
however , we offer these countries very far-ranging neighborhood policies . your time as expansion commissioner comes to an end on may 1 … correct , i have made myself redundant .

joschka fischer will wrap up his trip to the caucasus region on thursday with stops in armenia and georgia .
his visit in armenia comes during considerable political instability in the country . following visits to afghanistan and azerbaijan , germany 's fischer continued his week-long trip abroad by arriving in the armenian capital yerevan on thursday morning .
as he did in azerbaijan , he is expected to encourage both southern caucasus nations to continue to improve their democratic and human rights credentials by holding out the prospect of closer ties to the european union . fischer will need plenty of diplomatic tact in yerevan , since armenian president robert kocharian is under increasing pressure to step down .
on wednesday , opposition groups held a protest rally that attracted an estimated 10,000 people , according to the associated press .
opposition groups allege kocharian won reelection last year only through widespread election fraud , a charge which the president denies . tensions in the country rose on april 13 , when police used force to break up a protest rally .
around 100 people were reportedly detained and several protestors were injured .

a cease-fire in the conflict was signed in 1994 , but the final status of nagorno-karabakh has not been resolved .
in the azerbaijani capital baku on wednesday , fischer already said germany and the eu were prepared to help find a solution to the conflict . fischer 's visit to armenia will also include a memorial for armenians killed by turks in 1915 .
the armenians claim ottoman turkish forces committed genocide at the time , slaughtering some 1.5 million people between 1915 and 1923 .
turkey rejects the charges , saying the armenians were killed in a partisan war as the ottoman empire collapsed . heading to tbilisi later in the day , fischer will meet with georgian president mikhail saakashvili to show support for his western oriented reform course .

joschka fischer will wrap up his trip to the caucasus region on thursday with stops in armenia and georgia .
his visit in armenia comes during considerable political instability in the country . following visits to afghanistan and azerbaijan , germany 's fischer continued his week-long trip abroad by arriving in the armenian capital yerevan on thursday morning .
as he did in azerbaijan , he is expected to encourage both southern caucasus nations to continue to improve their democratic and human rights credentials by holding out the prospect of closer ties to the european union . fischer will need plenty of diplomatic tact in yerevan , since armenian president robert kocharian is under increasing pressure to step down .
on wednesday , opposition groups held a protest rally that attracted an estimated 10,000 people , according to the associated press .
opposition groups allege kocharian won reelection last year only through widespread election fraud , a charge which the president denies . tensions in the country rose on april 13 , when police used force to break up a protest rally .
around 100 people were reportedly detained and several protestors were injured .
" any administration relying on violence is doomed .
kocharian must go , " said stepan demirchyan , leader of the opposition justice party and runner-up in last year 's presidential election , according to the reuters news agency . kocharian 's opponents hope to oust him though continued popular unrest , similar to how neighboring georgia toppled the government of former president eduard shevardnadze late last year .

"
turkish films are securing a place in german cinemas now that producers have discovered a new target audience of german-turks .
far from being on the fringe , the films are making it into the nation 's biggest theaters . turkish films shown in germany have long conveyed a rather bleak view of the bosporus state .
they typically dealt with issues such as the kurdish conflict , the problems facing women , illiteracy , military dominance , and censorship .
but in recent years , that 's started to change .
following the success of yavuz turgul 's drama " eskiya , the bandit , " more and more popular turkish films have made it onto german movie screens , including those in the big multi-plex cinemas . whereas in the past , turks in germany had to wait months for a film showing in turkey to be released here , now it 's often only a matter of days separating release dates , making it easier for the turkish community to stay in touch with the zeitgeist in the bosporus . distributors making the trend two companies are leading the way in distribution .
warner attracted turkish and german audiences alike with films such as " propaganda , " " güle güle , " and " commissar shekspir . "
and then there 's maxximum film distribution , started by anil sahin , a former executive with the hamburg-based cinemaxx cinema group .
when he saw the potential of the turkish market , he immediately founded his own company . sahin 's first venture , " balalaika " in october 2001 proved to be a flop in german cinemas , so the businessman set about refining his marketing strategy .
turkish movie-goers proved to be loyal customers with a high level of attachment to the product .
the particular film being shown matters less to them than the movie-going experience . though warner had high box office numbers , it did n't make a huge profit , since it had falsely calculated the advertising budget .
maxximum , on the other hand , began collecting german " bogeys " - prizes for the highest number of screenings . " deli yürek " played in 150 cinemas in over 70 cities .
the final episode of the turkish cult soap " asmali konak " was the most successful title with 35 copies and over 220,000 viewers . maxximum productions run in other countries as well , for example austria , bulgaria and switzerland .
a few weeks ago , one of its films took third place in the dutch box office charts . here , the films are shown with german subtitles .
that does n't just help the handful of non-turkish audience members , it also helps to fill the gaps in the sometimes scanty knowledge of turkish among german-turks .
and surprisingly , any scenes containing swear words or naked skin have to be cut out of all the films shown in germany , as the target audience here is much more conservative than in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actor moritz bleibtreu .
the increasing level of german involvement in the turkish film industry could soon see the tables being turned , with german-turkish productions being exported back to the bosporus .
maxximum , for example , is planning to produce a vehicle for popular german actor moritz bleibtreu -lrb- photo -rrb- .
and in hamburg , a film called " süperseks " is in the works .
the comedy by a german director about a turkish sex hotline is being produced with german money - and it has a good chance of being successful in turkey . rambo and big happy families just how well these films reflect the realities of everyday turkish life can be left for viewers to decide .
" propaganda " and " vizontele , " for example , are filled with the kind of antics and buffoonery that are guaranteed to have even german audiences splitting their sides .
but while they portray turkey as a conflict-free , multi-ethnic society full of big happy families , the film " deli yürek " shows quite a different side .
the action flick takes its inspiration from the conflict in kurdistan , and presents it as a conspiracy between the cia and hizbollah that can only be resolved by a turkish version of rambo . possible superficialities aside , anil sahin deems the trend toward popular turkish cinema a positive one .

"
turkish films are securing a place in german cinemas now that producers have discovered a new target audience of german-turks .
far from being on the fringe , the films are making it into the nation 's biggest theaters . turkish films shown in germany have long conveyed a rather bleak view of the bosporus state .
they typically dealt with issues such as the kurdish conflict , the problems facing women , illiteracy , military dominance , and censorship .
but in recent years , that 's started to change .
following the success of yavuz turgul 's drama " eskiya , the bandit , " more and more popular turkish films have made it onto german movie screens , including those in the big multi-plex cinemas . whereas in the past , turks in germany had to wait months for a film showing in turkey to be released here , now it 's often only a matter of days separating release dates , making it easier for the turkish community to stay in touch with the zeitgeist in the bosporus . distributors making the trend two companies are leading the way in distribution .
warner attracted turkish and german audiences alike with films such as " propaganda , " " güle güle , " and " commissar shekspir . "
and then there 's maxximum film distribution , started by anil sahin , a former executive with the hamburg-based cinemaxx cinema group .
when he saw the potential of the turkish market , he immediately founded his own company . sahin 's first venture , " balalaika " in october 2001 proved to be a flop in german cinemas , so the businessman set about refining his marketing strategy .
turkish movie-goers proved to be loyal customers with a high level of attachment to the product .
the particular film being shown matters less to them than the movie-going experience . though warner had high box office numbers , it did n't make a huge profit , since it had falsely calculated the advertising budget .
maxximum , on the other hand , began collecting german " bogeys " - prizes for the highest number of screenings . " deli yürek " played in 150 cinemas in over 70 cities .
the final episode of the turkish cult soap " asmali konak " was the most successful title with 35 copies and over 220,000 viewers . maxximum productions run in other countries as well , for example austria , bulgaria and switzerland .
a few weeks ago , one of its films took third place in the dutch box office charts . here , the films are shown with german subtitles .
that does n't just help the handful of non-turkish audience members , it also helps to fill the gaps in the sometimes scanty knowledge of turkish among german-turks .
and surprisingly , any scenes containing swear words or naked skin have to be cut out of all the films shown in germany , as the target audience here is much more conservative than in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actor moritz bleibtreu .
the increasing level of german involvement in the turkish film industry could soon see the tables being turned , with german-turkish productions being exported back to the bosporus .

the comedy by a german director about a turkish sex hotline is being produced with german money - and it has a good chance of being successful in turkey . rambo and big happy families just how well these films reflect the realities of everyday turkish life can be left for viewers to decide .
" propaganda " and " vizontele , " for example , are filled with the kind of antics and buffoonery that are guaranteed to have even german audiences splitting their sides .
but while they portray turkey as a conflict-free , multi-ethnic society full of big happy families , the film " deli yürek " shows quite a different side .
the action flick takes its inspiration from the conflict in kurdistan , and presents it as a conspiracy between the cia and hizbollah that can only be resolved by a turkish version of rambo . possible superficialities aside , anil sahin deems the trend toward popular turkish cinema a positive one .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.04.2004 novartis to join merger talks with aventis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deal with novartis would make the world 's second-largest drug company .
swiss pharmaceutical giant novartis said on thursday it would enter merger talks with france 's aventis , possibly preventing a bid by rival sanofi-synthelabo which is backed by the french government . basel-based novartis said it would begin negotiations with aventis despite previous reservations about interference by government officials in paris , who have made clear they would prefer an all-french linkup with sanofi-synthelabo .
if successful , the merged novartis-aventis would create the world 's second-largest pharmaceutical firm after the u.s.-based pfizer . a spokesman for aventis , which itself was created from a merger of france 's rhone-poulenc and germany 's hoechst in 2000 , said the company was pleased by novartis ' willingness to negotiate , but remained cautious about the final outcome of the talks . " we welcome this decision , -lsb- but -rsb- no assurances can be given that an agreement can be reached , " spokesman tony rodham told the associated press .
aventis 's board invited novartis to enter talks three weeks ago . the announcement strengthens aventis ' hand in its attempt to fend off a hostile bid from much smaller french rival sanofi-synthelabo , which has offered to pay € 45 billion -lrb- $ 53.2 billion -rrb- for the company .
that encouraged novartis to get involved , but the swiss were then put off by comments from french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , who said he would prefer a french-only merger in order to help protect the country 's national interests . " we 're not at the endgame here yet , " richard jarvis , a pharmaceutical analyst at pictet & cie in london , told bloomberg news .
" the french government has n't changed their position and novartis is keen to try and persuade them .
it 's not completely in their hands and it is n't just in the hands of aventis shareholders at present . " aventis sees risks with sanofi however , since aventis has shown no interest in merging with sanofi-synthelabo and the french government would have to justify blocking any deal to the european union , novartis now appears ready to risk rankling paris . " a combination with aventis has a very convincing industrial logic .
it creates value and it addresses the legitimate concerns of the french government , " novartis chief financial officer raymond breu told reporters on thursday . strasbourg-based aventis has said novartis would be a much stronger partner than sanofi , which faces possible patent challenges to some of its more important drugs such as its plavix blood-thinner . although half the size of it 's competitor , sanofi is asking for a 100 percent takeover of aventis and demanding 50 percent of aventis shares and voting rights - a bold move that sanofi is able to make because of aventis ' currently weaker financial position . unions opposed novartis would protect aventis from sanofi , but the firm 's unions are opposed to a merger with the swiss and on thursday showed they would not shy away from using concerns about france 's national interest to try and hinder a deal . bloomberg reported that the unions sent a letter to french finance minister nicolas sarkozy , saying an aventis novartis merger would mean " france would have to give up its independence on products as crucial as vaccines and antibiotics , not to speak of the industrial and research sacrifice . " novartis shares were down 2.4 percent to 57.35 swiss francs -lrb- us $ 43.64 -rrb- in early trading on the zurich exchange following the announcement , and aventis shares rose 2.7 percent to € 64.45 -lrb- us $ 76.53 -rrb- in early paris trading . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis posts profits to ward off hostile takeover bid the french-german pharmaceutical company aventis announced growing profits for 2003 in an effort to ward off a hostile takeover bid from a smaller french drug firm .

on may 1 , the eu will grow to a 25 member bloc of states .
dw-world content partner tagesschau.de spoke to günter verheugen , who has been responsible for designing the current round of eu expansion . günter verheugen is the eu executive 's commissioner for expansion .
german public broadcaster tagesschau.de spoke to verheugen about the fears , expectations and future of european union expansion . tagesschau.de : you are the architect of this eu expansion ; for years you 've been working toward may 1 , 2004 .
what does this day mean to you personally ? günter verheugen : gratification , relief - but also a very muted feeling of concern or trepidation .
it can be best compared with the feelings of a soccer trainer , who for the first time sees his team go play a match and asks himself whether they will all show what they have learned .
of course , i ask myself whether everything will work , if we really did do everything right , if we perhaps overlooked problems .
but my basic feeling is satisfaction for having created this large and meaningful peace project . many germans see it differently .
according to surveys every third german opposes eu expansion .
how do you explain this skepticism ? that 's very easy to explain .
as always when people are confronted by something that they do n't know well , they react with fear .
the problem is that there has n't been any sizable and broad political debate on this topic .
and that 's why expansion has n't really registered with people .
now that it 's directly imminent it has an enormous media presence : something 's coming , but what is it ?
the problems that citizens pinpoint in the context of the expansion - from cross-border criminality to competition problems - are very real .
it 's just that they have nothing to do with the impending expansion .
instead , they are the consequences of the collapse of the communist world of states , the fall of the iron curtain .
that 's why european integration is neither a part nor the origin of the problem , rather the reasonable , perhaps also the only , possible solution to the problem . even so , many people are afraid that businesses will export jobs to the low-wage countries in the eu 's new east ... they have already been doing that for a long time .
that will also continue , but it does n't have anything to do with the expansion either .
for , the result of the expansion is that these countries will not remain low-wage countries .
through their eu membership , the competitive situation in the old member states will improve .
from -lrb- the moment of -rrb- entry , the new members must assume our social standards , our environmental standards and our professional standards ; they must observe our competition and subsidy regulations .
that means that the cost advantages that they now have will decrease gradually .
the outsourcing or migration of production components is a process that we have been observing for 40 years .
it is not a result of european integration but rather a result of economic globalization . what does the expansion offer germans ? in the first place , it 's a peace project .
it creates peace , stability , and safety in the region of europe that immediately borders germany .
people there have known for years what political , economic and financial results instability leads to .
german soldiers are in kosovo , german soldiers are in bosnia … in kosovo alone , for one million people , europe raised € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- to maintain the ceasefire .
peace pays off , after all .
as luxemburg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , said : a year of peace costs less than a day of war ! the second is an enormous economic profit - especially for germany .
it arises from -lrb- the fact -rrb- that this economic area will be populated after all by 110 million people , if we include romania and bulgaria , and everywhere here there is an immense unsatisfied demand .
we have very stabile , very robust growth rates in these countries , that are noticeably above the growth rates in the remainder of the eu .
the export-oriented german economy profits particularly from this quickly growing market . but initially the germans will have to dig deeper into their pockets for the expansion .
the european commission has demanded more money for it , more than € 37 billion will be pumped into the new countries in the coming years .
how can you make that appealing to the taxpayer ? the financing for this expansion round was already decided in berlin in 1999 .
we are spending around € 15 billion less than was then calculated and will get by with a total of € 40 billion until 2006 .
the new countries will pay € 15 billion of that themselves .
all in all , the expansion will cost germany a net total of € 2.5 billion in the first three years .
on the other hand , germany will have an enormous trade balance surplus .
that 's why viewed economically it 's a win-win situation .
it makes no sense to say that the expansion will lead to an additional burden for the germans . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de croatia inches closer to eu membership the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .

on may 1 , the eu will grow to a 25 member bloc of states .
dw-world content partner tagesschau.de spoke to günter verheugen , who has been responsible for designing the current round of eu expansion . günter verheugen is the eu executive 's commissioner for expansion .
german public broadcaster tagesschau.de spoke to verheugen about the fears , expectations and future of european union expansion . tagesschau.de : you are the architect of this eu expansion ; for years you 've been working toward may 1 , 2004 .
what does this day mean to you personally ? günter verheugen : gratification , relief - but also a very muted feeling of concern or trepidation .
it can be best compared with the feelings of a soccer trainer , who for the first time sees his team go play a match and asks himself whether they will all show what they have learned .
of course , i ask myself whether everything will work , if we really did do everything right , if we perhaps overlooked problems .
but my basic feeling is satisfaction for having created this large and meaningful peace project . many germans see it differently .
according to surveys every third german opposes eu expansion .
how do you explain this skepticism ? that 's very easy to explain .
as always when people are confronted by something that they do n't know well , they react with fear .
the problem is that there has n't been any sizable and broad political debate on this topic .
and that 's why expansion has n't really registered with people .
now that it 's directly imminent it has an enormous media presence : something 's coming , but what is it ?
the problems that citizens pinpoint in the context of the expansion - from cross-border criminality to competition problems - are very real .
it 's just that they have nothing to do with the impending expansion .
instead , they are the consequences of the collapse of the communist world of states , the fall of the iron curtain .
that 's why european integration is neither a part nor the origin of the problem , rather the reasonable , perhaps also the only , possible solution to the problem . even so , many people are afraid that businesses will export jobs to the low-wage countries in the eu 's new east ... they have already been doing that for a long time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.04.2004 what german prostitutes want großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much has changed for prostitutes in germany .
the german government legalized prostitution two years ago , but many sex workers remain reluctant to register with authorities as they continue to experience discrimination , a new study has revealed . sex is big business in germany .
with some 400,000 prostitutes and an annual 1.2 million men who use their services , the yearly turnover has hit a massive € 14 billion -lrb- $ 16.5 billion -rrb- .
but paid sex can be a nasty business .
two years ago the german government introduced a new prostitution law in what was an earnest attempt to protect prostitutes ' working conditions and even offer them some protection against violence and exploitation .
there is even scope for girls on the game to join a union , but that has proved to be something that few have taken advantage of .
at a loss to understand the reluctance among the country 's sex work force to become unionized , the services trade union verdi commissioned hamburg-based social scientist emilija mitrovic to find out why .
mitrovic , who is due to publish the results of her study at the end of the month , has spent a lot of time travelling across germany , talking with prostitutes , brothel owners , police officers and social workers in a bid to find out what difference the new law has made to prostitutes . " the desired effect of the law was to create a better social situation for prostitutes , to do away with the immoral stigma attached to their work , to give them the right to sue for unpaid fees , and make health insurance and social security payments , " mitrovic told deutsche welle . continued discrimination her study , which examined the varying consequences of the law in different cities and states across germany , revealed that the majority of prostitutes in germany still prefer to do the job secretly , because although prostitution is officially legal , sex workers still experience discrimination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a prostitute in frankfurt mitrovic also discovered that women are often put in unnecessarily dangerous situations as a result of arbitrary rules that dictate exactly where they are allowed to tout for business .
these are often dark and dead industrial areas , where the women are far more vulnerable to violence . on top of this , the study showed discrimination from most of germany 's federal job agencies , who will neither broker jobs in the sex industry nor offer retraining .
and even health insurance companies do n't offer any kind of special health provisions for prostitutes . verdi is prepared to fight the exploitation of sex workers , but so far , the union has failed to come up with any concrete solutions .
however , at a conference on the subject of prostitution at the end of april , they will present a sample contract for sex workers . mitrovic believes this is a step forward .
" the contract would regulate holiday pay , sick pay and something very special , namely medical examinations during work time , " she said .
" the contract would also ensure women a fixed income which could be transferred to their bank accounts . " it 's all well and good in theory , but just how likely are the brothel owners and managers to go along with it ?
mitrovic is optimistic and has already found one brothel manager who wants to try out the contract , and who also wants to employ immigrants , and who is looking for legal ways to do this . law does n't apply to all one of the problems with the new prostitution law is that it does nothing to help foreign prostitutes , who constitute almost half of germany sex workers , who do n't have a legal work permit .
without it , they ca n't report ill treatment or exploitation to the police unless they want to run the high risk of subsequent deportation . the sad reality of prostitution in germany is that despite the new law , most prostitutes still work under very poor conditions .
the majority of the money they earn is taken away from them by pimps and landlords and , for those who are trying to work by the book , from the tax office as well . perhaps the biggest problem for prostitutes here is still the way they are treated socially .
on the one hand paid sex is considered a part of 21st century life , but very few women are actually prepared to come out and admit that is what they do . as far as mitrovic is concerned , prostitution wo n't shed its criminal stigma until the pimps put up their hands and confess that they are making money from selling sex , and that it is a socially acceptable thing to do . udo taubitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stolen youth : child prostitution plagues german-czech border the united nations children 's agency says child prostitution is rising across the german border in the czech republic .

swiss pharmaceutical giant novartis said on thursday it would enter merger talks with france 's aventis , possibly preventing a bid by rival sanofi-synthelabo which is backed by the french government . basel-based novartis said it would begin negotiations with aventis despite previous reservations about interference by government officials in paris , who have made clear they would prefer an all-french linkup with sanofi-synthelabo .
if successful , the merged novartis-aventis would create the world 's second-largest pharmaceutical firm after the u.s.-based pfizer . a spokesman for aventis , which itself was created from a merger of france 's rhone-poulenc and germany 's hoechst in 2000 , said the company was pleased by novartis ' willingness to negotiate , but remained cautious about the final outcome of the talks . " we welcome this decision , -lsb- but -rsb- no assurances can be given that an agreement can be reached , " spokesman tony rodham told the associated press .
aventis 's board invited novartis to enter talks three weeks ago . the announcement strengthens aventis ' hand in its attempt to fend off a hostile bid from much smaller french rival sanofi-synthelabo , which has offered to pay € 45 billion -lrb- $ 53.2 billion -rrb- for the company .
that encouraged novartis to get involved , but the swiss were then put off by comments from french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , who said he would prefer a french-only merger in order to help protect the country 's national interests . " we 're not at the endgame here yet , " richard jarvis , a pharmaceutical analyst at pictet & cie in london , told bloomberg news .

" aventis sees risks with sanofi however , since aventis has shown no interest in merging with sanofi-synthelabo and the french government would have to justify blocking any deal to the european union , novartis now appears ready to risk rankling paris . " a combination with aventis has a very convincing industrial logic .
it creates value and it addresses the legitimate concerns of the french government , " novartis chief financial officer raymond breu told reporters on thursday . strasbourg-based aventis has said novartis would be a much stronger partner than sanofi , which faces possible patent challenges to some of its more important drugs such as its plavix blood-thinner . although half the size of it 's competitor , sanofi is asking for a 100 percent takeover of aventis and demanding 50 percent of aventis shares and voting rights - a bold move that sanofi is able to make because of aventis ' currently weaker financial position . unions opposed novartis would protect aventis from sanofi , but the firm 's unions are opposed to a merger with the swiss and on thursday showed they would not shy away from using concerns about france 's national interest to try and hinder a deal . bloomberg reported that the unions sent a letter to french finance minister nicolas sarkozy , saying an aventis novartis merger would mean " france would have to give up its independence on products as crucial as vaccines and antibiotics , not to speak of the industrial and research sacrifice .

swiss pharmaceutical giant novartis said on thursday it would enter merger talks with france 's aventis , possibly preventing a bid by rival sanofi-synthelabo which is backed by the french government . basel-based novartis said it would begin negotiations with aventis despite previous reservations about interference by government officials in paris , who have made clear they would prefer an all-french linkup with sanofi-synthelabo .
if successful , the merged novartis-aventis would create the world 's second-largest pharmaceutical firm after the u.s.-based pfizer . a spokesman for aventis , which itself was created from a merger of france 's rhone-poulenc and germany 's hoechst in 2000 , said the company was pleased by novartis ' willingness to negotiate , but remained cautious about the final outcome of the talks . " we welcome this decision , -lsb- but -rsb- no assurances can be given that an agreement can be reached , " spokesman tony rodham told the associated press .
aventis 's board invited novartis to enter talks three weeks ago . the announcement strengthens aventis ' hand in its attempt to fend off a hostile bid from much smaller french rival sanofi-synthelabo , which has offered to pay € 45 billion -lrb- $ 53.2 billion -rrb- for the company .
that encouraged novartis to get involved , but the swiss were then put off by comments from french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , who said he would prefer a french-only merger in order to help protect the country 's national interests .

the german government legalized prostitution two years ago , but many sex workers remain reluctant to register with authorities as they continue to experience discrimination , a new study has revealed . sex is big business in germany .
with some 400,000 prostitutes and an annual 1.2 million men who use their services , the yearly turnover has hit a massive € 14 billion -lrb- $ 16.5 billion -rrb- .
but paid sex can be a nasty business .
two years ago the german government introduced a new prostitution law in what was an earnest attempt to protect prostitutes ' working conditions and even offer them some protection against violence and exploitation .
there is even scope for girls on the game to join a union , but that has proved to be something that few have taken advantage of .
at a loss to understand the reluctance among the country 's sex work force to become unionized , the services trade union verdi commissioned hamburg-based social scientist emilija mitrovic to find out why .
mitrovic , who is due to publish the results of her study at the end of the month , has spent a lot of time travelling across germany , talking with prostitutes , brothel owners , police officers and social workers in a bid to find out what difference the new law has made to prostitutes . " the desired effect of the law was to create a better social situation for prostitutes , to do away with the immoral stigma attached to their work , to give them the right to sue for unpaid fees , and make health insurance and social security payments , " mitrovic told deutsche welle . continued discrimination her study , which examined the varying consequences of the law in different cities and states across germany , revealed that the majority of prostitutes in germany still prefer to do the job secretly , because although prostitution is officially legal , sex workers still experience discrimination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a prostitute in frankfurt mitrovic also discovered that women are often put in unnecessarily dangerous situations as a result of arbitrary rules that dictate exactly where they are allowed to tout for business .
these are often dark and dead industrial areas , where the women are far more vulnerable to violence . on top of this , the study showed discrimination from most of germany 's federal job agencies , who will neither broker jobs in the sex industry nor offer retraining .
and even health insurance companies do n't offer any kind of special health provisions for prostitutes . verdi is prepared to fight the exploitation of sex workers , but so far , the union has failed to come up with any concrete solutions .
however , at a conference on the subject of prostitution at the end of april , they will present a sample contract for sex workers . mitrovic believes this is a step forward .
" the contract would regulate holiday pay , sick pay and something very special , namely medical examinations during work time , " she said .
" the contract would also ensure women a fixed income which could be transferred to their bank accounts . " it 's all well and good in theory , but just how likely are the brothel owners and managers to go along with it ?
mitrovic is optimistic and has already found one brothel manager who wants to try out the contract , and who also wants to employ immigrants , and who is looking for legal ways to do this . law does n't apply to all one of the problems with the new prostitution law is that it does nothing to help foreign prostitutes , who constitute almost half of germany sex workers , who do n't have a legal work permit .
without it , they ca n't report ill treatment or exploitation to the police unless they want to run the high risk of subsequent deportation . the sad reality of prostitution in germany is that despite the new law , most prostitutes still work under very poor conditions .
the majority of the money they earn is taken away from them by pimps and landlords and , for those who are trying to work by the book , from the tax office as well . perhaps the biggest problem for prostitutes here is still the way they are treated socially .
on the one hand paid sex is considered a part of 21st century life , but very few women are actually prepared to come out and admit that is what they do . as far as mitrovic is concerned , prostitution wo n't shed its criminal stigma until the pimps put up their hands and confess that they are making money from selling sex , and that it is a socially acceptable thing to do . udo taubitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stolen youth : child prostitution plagues german-czech border the united nations children 's agency says child prostitution is rising across the german border in the czech republic .

the german government legalized prostitution two years ago , but many sex workers remain reluctant to register with authorities as they continue to experience discrimination , a new study has revealed . sex is big business in germany .
with some 400,000 prostitutes and an annual 1.2 million men who use their services , the yearly turnover has hit a massive € 14 billion -lrb- $ 16.5 billion -rrb- .
but paid sex can be a nasty business .
two years ago the german government introduced a new prostitution law in what was an earnest attempt to protect prostitutes ' working conditions and even offer them some protection against violence and exploitation .
there is even scope for girls on the game to join a union , but that has proved to be something that few have taken advantage of .
at a loss to understand the reluctance among the country 's sex work force to become unionized , the services trade union verdi commissioned hamburg-based social scientist emilija mitrovic to find out why .
mitrovic , who is due to publish the results of her study at the end of the month , has spent a lot of time travelling across germany , talking with prostitutes , brothel owners , police officers and social workers in a bid to find out what difference the new law has made to prostitutes . " the desired effect of the law was to create a better social situation for prostitutes , to do away with the immoral stigma attached to their work , to give them the right to sue for unpaid fees , and make health insurance and social security payments , " mitrovic told deutsche welle . continued discrimination her study , which examined the varying consequences of the law in different cities and states across germany , revealed that the majority of prostitutes in germany still prefer to do the job secretly , because although prostitution is officially legal , sex workers still experience discrimination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a prostitute in frankfurt mitrovic also discovered that women are often put in unnecessarily dangerous situations as a result of arbitrary rules that dictate exactly where they are allowed to tout for business .
these are often dark and dead industrial areas , where the women are far more vulnerable to violence . on top of this , the study showed discrimination from most of germany 's federal job agencies , who will neither broker jobs in the sex industry nor offer retraining .
and even health insurance companies do n't offer any kind of special health provisions for prostitutes . verdi is prepared to fight the exploitation of sex workers , but so far , the union has failed to come up with any concrete solutions .
however , at a conference on the subject of prostitution at the end of april , they will present a sample contract for sex workers . mitrovic believes this is a step forward .
" the contract would regulate holiday pay , sick pay and something very special , namely medical examinations during work time , " she said .
" the contract would also ensure women a fixed income which could be transferred to their bank accounts . " it 's all well and good in theory , but just how likely are the brothel owners and managers to go along with it ?
mitrovic is optimistic and has already found one brothel manager who wants to try out the contract , and who also wants to employ immigrants , and who is looking for legal ways to do this . law does n't apply to all one of the problems with the new prostitution law is that it does nothing to help foreign prostitutes , who constitute almost half of germany sex workers , who do n't have a legal work permit .
without it , they ca n't report ill treatment or exploitation to the police unless they want to run the high risk of subsequent deportation . the sad reality of prostitution in germany is that despite the new law , most prostitutes still work under very poor conditions .

on the one hand paid sex is considered a part of 21st century life , but very few women are actually prepared to come out and admit that is what they do . as far as mitrovic is concerned , prostitution wo n't shed its criminal stigma until the pimps put up their hands and confess that they are making money from selling sex , and that it is a socially acceptable thing to do . udo taubitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stolen youth : child prostitution plagues german-czech border the united nations children 's agency says child prostitution is rising across the german border in the czech republic .

on may 1 , the eu will grow to a 25 member bloc of states .
dw-world content partner tagesschau.de spoke to günter verheugen , who has been responsible for designing the current round of eu expansion . günter verheugen is the eu executive 's commissioner for expansion .
german public broadcaster tagesschau.de spoke to verheugen about the fears , expectations and future of european union expansion . tagesschau.de : you are the architect of this eu expansion ; for years you 've been working toward may 1 , 2004 .
what does this day mean to you personally ? günter verheugen : gratification , relief - but also a very muted feeling of concern or trepidation .
it can be best compared with the feelings of a soccer trainer , who for the first time sees his team go play a match and asks himself whether they will all show what they have learned .
of course , i ask myself whether everything will work , if we really did do everything right , if we perhaps overlooked problems .
but my basic feeling is satisfaction for having created this large and meaningful peace project . many germans see it differently .
according to surveys every third german opposes eu expansion .
how do you explain this skepticism ? that 's very easy to explain .
as always when people are confronted by something that they do n't know well , they react with fear .
the problem is that there has n't been any sizable and broad political debate on this topic .
and that 's why expansion has n't really registered with people .
now that it 's directly imminent it has an enormous media presence : something 's coming , but what is it ?
the problems that citizens pinpoint in the context of the expansion - from cross-border criminality to competition problems - are very real .
it 's just that they have nothing to do with the impending expansion .
instead , they are the consequences of the collapse of the communist world of states , the fall of the iron curtain .
that 's why european integration is neither a part nor the origin of the problem , rather the reasonable , perhaps also the only , possible solution to the problem . even so , many people are afraid that businesses will export jobs to the low-wage countries in the eu 's new east ... they have already been doing that for a long time .
that will also continue , but it does n't have anything to do with the expansion either .
for , the result of the expansion is that these countries will not remain low-wage countries .
through their eu membership , the competitive situation in the old member states will improve .
from -lrb- the moment of -rrb- entry , the new members must assume our social standards , our environmental standards and our professional standards ; they must observe our competition and subsidy regulations .
that means that the cost advantages that they now have will decrease gradually .
the outsourcing or migration of production components is a process that we have been observing for 40 years .
it is not a result of european integration but rather a result of economic globalization . what does the expansion offer germans ? in the first place , it 's a peace project .

german public broadcaster tagesschau.de spoke to verheugen about the fears , expectations and future of european union expansion . tagesschau.de : you are the architect of this eu expansion ; for years you 've been working toward may 1 , 2004 .
what does this day mean to you personally ? günter verheugen : gratification , relief - but also a very muted feeling of concern or trepidation .
it can be best compared with the feelings of a soccer trainer , who for the first time sees his team go play a match and asks himself whether they will all show what they have learned .
of course , i ask myself whether everything will work , if we really did do everything right , if we perhaps overlooked problems .
but my basic feeling is satisfaction for having created this large and meaningful peace project . many germans see it differently .
according to surveys every third german opposes eu expansion .
how do you explain this skepticism ? that 's very easy to explain .
as always when people are confronted by something that they do n't know well , they react with fear .
the problem is that there has n't been any sizable and broad political debate on this topic .
and that 's why expansion has n't really registered with people .
now that it 's directly imminent it has an enormous media presence : something 's coming , but what is it ?
the problems that citizens pinpoint in the context of the expansion - from cross-border criminality to competition problems - are very real .
it 's just that they have nothing to do with the impending expansion .
instead , they are the consequences of the collapse of the communist world of states , the fall of the iron curtain .
that 's why european integration is neither a part nor the origin of the problem , rather the reasonable , perhaps also the only , possible solution to the problem . even so , many people are afraid that businesses will export jobs to the low-wage countries in the eu 's new east ... they have already been doing that for a long time .
that will also continue , but it does n't have anything to do with the expansion either .
for , the result of the expansion is that these countries will not remain low-wage countries .
through their eu membership , the competitive situation in the old member states will improve .
from -lrb- the moment of -rrb- entry , the new members must assume our social standards , our environmental standards and our professional standards ; they must observe our competition and subsidy regulations .
that means that the cost advantages that they now have will decrease gradually .
the outsourcing or migration of production components is a process that we have been observing for 40 years .
it is not a result of european integration but rather a result of economic globalization . what does the expansion offer germans ? in the first place , it 's a peace project .

on may 1 , the eu will grow to a 25 member bloc of states .
dw-world content partner tagesschau.de spoke to günter verheugen , who has been responsible for designing the current round of eu expansion . günter verheugen is the eu executive 's commissioner for expansion .
german public broadcaster tagesschau.de spoke to verheugen about the fears , expectations and future of european union expansion . tagesschau.de : you are the architect of this eu expansion ; for years you 've been working toward may 1 , 2004 .
what does this day mean to you personally ? günter verheugen : gratification , relief - but also a very muted feeling of concern or trepidation .
it can be best compared with the feelings of a soccer trainer , who for the first time sees his team go play a match and asks himself whether they will all show what they have learned .
of course , i ask myself whether everything will work , if we really did do everything right , if we perhaps overlooked problems .
but my basic feeling is satisfaction for having created this large and meaningful peace project . many germans see it differently .
according to surveys every third german opposes eu expansion .
how do you explain this skepticism ? that 's very easy to explain .
as always when people are confronted by something that they do n't know well , they react with fear .
the problem is that there has n't been any sizable and broad political debate on this topic .
and that 's why expansion has n't really registered with people .
now that it 's directly imminent it has an enormous media presence : something 's coming , but what is it ?
the problems that citizens pinpoint in the context of the expansion - from cross-border criminality to competition problems - are very real .
it 's just that they have nothing to do with the impending expansion .
instead , they are the consequences of the collapse of the communist world of states , the fall of the iron curtain .
that 's why european integration is neither a part nor the origin of the problem , rather the reasonable , perhaps also the only , possible solution to the problem . even so , many people are afraid that businesses will export jobs to the low-wage countries in the eu 's new east ... they have already been doing that for a long time .
that will also continue , but it does n't have anything to do with the expansion either .
for , the result of the expansion is that these countries will not remain low-wage countries .
through their eu membership , the competitive situation in the old member states will improve .
from -lrb- the moment of -rrb- entry , the new members must assume our social standards , our environmental standards and our professional standards ; they must observe our competition and subsidy regulations .
that means that the cost advantages that they now have will decrease gradually .
the outsourcing or migration of production components is a process that we have been observing for 40 years .
it is not a result of european integration but rather a result of economic globalization . what does the expansion offer germans ? in the first place , it 's a peace project .
it creates peace , stability , and safety in the region of europe that immediately borders germany .
people there have known for years what political , economic and financial results instability leads to .
german soldiers are in kosovo , german soldiers are in bosnia … in kosovo alone , for one million people , europe raised € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- to maintain the ceasefire .
peace pays off , after all .
as luxemburg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , said : a year of peace costs less than a day of war ! the second is an enormous economic profit - especially for germany .
it arises from -lrb- the fact -rrb- that this economic area will be populated after all by 110 million people , if we include romania and bulgaria , and everywhere here there is an immense unsatisfied demand .
we have very stabile , very robust growth rates in these countries , that are noticeably above the growth rates in the remainder of the eu .
the export-oriented german economy profits particularly from this quickly growing market . but initially the germans will have to dig deeper into their pockets for the expansion .
the european commission has demanded more money for it , more than € 37 billion will be pumped into the new countries in the coming years .
how can you make that appealing to the taxpayer ? the financing for this expansion round was already decided in berlin in 1999 .
we are spending around € 15 billion less than was then calculated and will get by with a total of € 40 billion until 2006 .
the new countries will pay € 15 billion of that themselves .
all in all , the expansion will cost germany a net total of € 2.5 billion in the first three years .
on the other hand , germany will have an enormous trade balance surplus .
that 's why viewed economically it 's a win-win situation .
it makes no sense to say that the expansion will lead to an additional burden for the germans . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de croatia inches closer to eu membership the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .

on may 1 , the eu will grow to a 25 member bloc of states .
dw-world content partner tagesschau.de spoke to günter verheugen , who has been responsible for designing the current round of eu expansion . günter verheugen is the eu executive 's commissioner for expansion .
german public broadcaster tagesschau.de spoke to verheugen about the fears , expectations and future of european union expansion . tagesschau.de : you are the architect of this eu expansion ; for years you 've been working toward may 1 , 2004 .
what does this day mean to you personally ? günter verheugen : gratification , relief - but also a very muted feeling of concern or trepidation .
it can be best compared with the feelings of a soccer trainer , who for the first time sees his team go play a match and asks himself whether they will all show what they have learned .
of course , i ask myself whether everything will work , if we really did do everything right , if we perhaps overlooked problems .
but my basic feeling is satisfaction for having created this large and meaningful peace project . many germans see it differently .
according to surveys every third german opposes eu expansion .
how do you explain this skepticism ? that 's very easy to explain .
as always when people are confronted by something that they do n't know well , they react with fear .
the problem is that there has n't been any sizable and broad political debate on this topic .
and that 's why expansion has n't really registered with people .
now that it 's directly imminent it has an enormous media presence : something 's coming , but what is it ?
the problems that citizens pinpoint in the context of the expansion - from cross-border criminality to competition problems - are very real .
it 's just that they have nothing to do with the impending expansion .
instead , they are the consequences of the collapse of the communist world of states , the fall of the iron curtain .
that 's why european integration is neither a part nor the origin of the problem , rather the reasonable , perhaps also the only , possible solution to the problem . even so , many people are afraid that businesses will export jobs to the low-wage countries in the eu 's new east ... they have already been doing that for a long time .
that will also continue , but it does n't have anything to do with the expansion either .
for , the result of the expansion is that these countries will not remain low-wage countries .
through their eu membership , the competitive situation in the old member states will improve .
from -lrb- the moment of -rrb- entry , the new members must assume our social standards , our environmental standards and our professional standards ; they must observe our competition and subsidy regulations .
that means that the cost advantages that they now have will decrease gradually .
the outsourcing or migration of production components is a process that we have been observing for 40 years .
it is not a result of european integration but rather a result of economic globalization . what does the expansion offer germans ? in the first place , it 's a peace project .
it creates peace , stability , and safety in the region of europe that immediately borders germany .
people there have known for years what political , economic and financial results instability leads to .
german soldiers are in kosovo , german soldiers are in bosnia … in kosovo alone , for one million people , europe raised € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- to maintain the ceasefire .
peace pays off , after all .
as luxemburg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , said : a year of peace costs less than a day of war ! the second is an enormous economic profit - especially for germany .
it arises from -lrb- the fact -rrb- that this economic area will be populated after all by 110 million people , if we include romania and bulgaria , and everywhere here there is an immense unsatisfied demand .
we have very stabile , very robust growth rates in these countries , that are noticeably above the growth rates in the remainder of the eu .
the export-oriented german economy profits particularly from this quickly growing market . but initially the germans will have to dig deeper into their pockets for the expansion .
the european commission has demanded more money for it , more than € 37 billion will be pumped into the new countries in the coming years .
how can you make that appealing to the taxpayer ? the financing for this expansion round was already decided in berlin in 1999 .
we are spending around € 15 billion less than was then calculated and will get by with a total of € 40 billion until 2006 .
the new countries will pay € 15 billion of that themselves .
all in all , the expansion will cost germany a net total of € 2.5 billion in the first three years .
on the other hand , germany will have an enormous trade balance surplus .
that 's why viewed economically it 's a win-win situation .
it makes no sense to say that the expansion will lead to an additional burden for the germans . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de croatia inches closer to eu membership the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .

lithuania and latvia , for example , will need decades to reach our economic level .
how can you ensure that economically a europe of two speeds does n't develop ? you could also ask why greece , an eu member for 30 years , has n't been able to reduce the distance to the rest of the eu - but still no one talks about a europe of two economic speeds .
what we see is a higher speed of growth in the new countries , and that 's good . people talk about 50 to 60 years for some of the new member countries . … but where 's the problem ?
it took a long time with ireland too .
for greece the distance from the average is still the same but in the meantime at a much higher level .
the most important thing is that the new member countries grow , and their growth potential is large .
incidentally , individual citizens ' or businesses ' rights to eu funds do n't arise from eu membership .
it 's not like it was with german unification .
unification has cost € 1.25 trillion so far .
in contrast , expansion can not put us in danger in terms of costs because the eu budget is club funds by nature .
the club ca n't spend one euro more than the members voluntarily put into the club funds . in negotiations with countries such as poland , people had the impression that they want to get the maximum out of europe and only contribute a little .
did that annoy you ? certainly not .
poland negotiated well but no tougher than others ; they are n't getting more either .
even in 2013 , the union 's per capita benefits for poland will be distinctly lower than the per capita benefits for spain .
poland is a large country , a very proud nation , that needs a certain amount of time to find its place and role in the european union .
people should show a little patience and not pillory a country that is encumbered by a formidable historic burden . still , the new members apparently have n't completed the homework that is a condition for receiving eu funds .
for example , corruption in the new member states , such as slovakia or the czech republic , is high .
how will you get that under control ? i ca n't dispute that a certain kind of corruption remains quite strong in these countries - in connection with large-scale privatization , for example .
-lrb- german interior minister -rrb- otto schily once said he thought that around 10 percent of the funds that went to eastern germany in the context of economic reconstruction were illegal .
i would n't estimate the magnitude to be so high for poland and the czech republic .
but it is a typical phenomenon . regarding homework , i would n't agree with your thesis .
on may 1 we will see that the new member countries will assume -lrb- eu -rrb- community law to 100 percent .
while in the old countries more than 2,000 legal actions are underway due to contract breaches , that is , due to the incomplete or completely inadequate application of community law . do you mean to say that the new acceding states are better prepared than earlier acceding states ? it 's safe to say that .
although we have much more extensive and complicated community legislation today .
now there 's much , much more to negotiate .
during earlier expansions , the commission was n't worried about whether the greeks , spanish or portuguese were also capable of applying community law .
this is an entirely new method that we first developed for this expansion . the balkan countries want to join the eu ; the accession of turkey , romania and bulgaria 's is planned for 2007 .
where do you think europe stops ? romania and bulgaria are part of the current round .
and then everything 's open .
the balkan countries do indeed have the prospect of joining , though there 's no schedule for them .
they are still too far away from national or regional stability or also from economic integration - with the exception of croatia , whose accession application has been submitted .
turkey is a special case .
it has had the prospect of joining since 1963 .
at the end of the year it will be decided whether turkey has in the meantime gotten far enough to start negotiations . for the eastern european countries , such as russia , ukraine , but also the caucasus countries or the southern mediterranean countries , membership is not on the agenda .
however , we offer these countries very far-ranging neighborhood policies . your time as expansion commissioner comes to an end on may 1 … correct , i have made myself redundant .
but do n't forget bulgaria , romania and turkey . what will you do afterwards ? i will remain a member of the -lrb- european -rrb- commission until november 1 .
beyond that nothing has been decided .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 22.04.2004 popular cinema , turkish-style großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filmmakers are appealing to the german-turkish population , for example with " güle güle . "
turkish films are securing a place in german cinemas now that producers have discovered a new target audience of german-turks .
far from being on the fringe , the films are making it into the nation 's biggest theaters . turkish films shown in germany have long conveyed a rather bleak view of the bosporus state .
they typically dealt with issues such as the kurdish conflict , the problems facing women , illiteracy , military dominance , and censorship .
but in recent years , that 's started to change .
following the success of yavuz turgul 's drama " eskiya , the bandit , " more and more popular turkish films have made it onto german movie screens , including those in the big multi-plex cinemas . whereas in the past , turks in germany had to wait months for a film showing in turkey to be released here , now it 's often only a matter of days separating release dates , making it easier for the turkish community to stay in touch with the zeitgeist in the bosporus . distributors making the trend two companies are leading the way in distribution .
warner attracted turkish and german audiences alike with films such as " propaganda , " " güle güle , " and " commissar shekspir . "
and then there 's maxximum film distribution , started by anil sahin , a former executive with the hamburg-based cinemaxx cinema group .
when he saw the potential of the turkish market , he immediately founded his own company . sahin 's first venture , " balalaika " in october 2001 proved to be a flop in german cinemas , so the businessman set about refining his marketing strategy .
turkish movie-goers proved to be loyal customers with a high level of attachment to the product .
the particular film being shown matters less to them than the movie-going experience . though warner had high box office numbers , it did n't make a huge profit , since it had falsely calculated the advertising budget .
maxximum , on the other hand , began collecting german " bogeys " - prizes for the highest number of screenings . " deli yürek " played in 150 cinemas in over 70 cities .
the final episode of the turkish cult soap " asmali konak " was the most successful title with 35 copies and over 220,000 viewers . maxximum productions run in other countries as well , for example austria , bulgaria and switzerland .
a few weeks ago , one of its films took third place in the dutch box office charts . here , the films are shown with german subtitles .
that does n't just help the handful of non-turkish audience members , it also helps to fill the gaps in the sometimes scanty knowledge of turkish among german-turks .
and surprisingly , any scenes containing swear words or naked skin have to be cut out of all the films shown in germany , as the target audience here is much more conservative than in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actor moritz bleibtreu .
the increasing level of german involvement in the turkish film industry could soon see the tables being turned , with german-turkish productions being exported back to the bosporus .
maxximum , for example , is planning to produce a vehicle for popular german actor moritz bleibtreu -lrb- photo -rrb- .
and in hamburg , a film called " süperseks " is in the works .
the comedy by a german director about a turkish sex hotline is being produced with german money - and it has a good chance of being successful in turkey . rambo and big happy families just how well these films reflect the realities of everyday turkish life can be left for viewers to decide .
" propaganda " and " vizontele , " for example , are filled with the kind of antics and buffoonery that are guaranteed to have even german audiences splitting their sides .
but while they portray turkey as a conflict-free , multi-ethnic society full of big happy families , the film " deli yürek " shows quite a different side .
the action flick takes its inspiration from the conflict in kurdistan , and presents it as a conspiracy between the cia and hizbollah that can only be resolved by a turkish version of rambo . possible superficialities aside , anil sahin deems the trend toward popular turkish cinema a positive one .
these colorful films convey a more positive image of turkey and help create a closer affiliation to europe .
but one of the superstars of turkish cinema sees things differently .
haluk bilgener welcomes the current hype , but he 's skeptical about the dominance of these so-called " popcorn films . " " they cater to a pleasure-seeking generation that is totally apolitical , " he said . amin farzanefar -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lost in translation many english language films make it to the german screens with their original titles intact .

kalle kiez -lrb- left -rrb- tells tidy berliners berlin partygoers may come to the conclusion they had one too many to drink when rubbish bins start shouting at them on the city 's streets .
but the talking trashcans are n't a figment of inebriated imaginations . siggi sport , hitlist harry and susi smart have taken to the streets of berlin , doing their part to create an upbeat and tidy atmosphere in the city known for its , some say , crude vernacular .
siggi sport hollers " go-a-a-al " when cleanly passersby toss their trash into his welcoming receptacle .

the german government legalized prostitution two years ago , but many sex workers remain reluctant to register with authorities as they continue to experience discrimination , a new study has revealed . sex is big business in germany .
with some 400,000 prostitutes and an annual 1.2 million men who use their services , the yearly turnover has hit a massive € 14 billion -lrb- $ 16.5 billion -rrb- .
but paid sex can be a nasty business .
two years ago the german government introduced a new prostitution law in what was an earnest attempt to protect prostitutes ' working conditions and even offer them some protection against violence and exploitation .
there is even scope for girls on the game to join a union , but that has proved to be something that few have taken advantage of .
at a loss to understand the reluctance among the country 's sex work force to become unionized , the services trade union verdi commissioned hamburg-based social scientist emilija mitrovic to find out why .
mitrovic , who is due to publish the results of her study at the end of the month , has spent a lot of time travelling across germany , talking with prostitutes , brothel owners , police officers and social workers in a bid to find out what difference the new law has made to prostitutes . " the desired effect of the law was to create a better social situation for prostitutes , to do away with the immoral stigma attached to their work , to give them the right to sue for unpaid fees , and make health insurance and social security payments , " mitrovic told deutsche welle . continued discrimination her study , which examined the varying consequences of the law in different cities and states across germany , revealed that the majority of prostitutes in germany still prefer to do the job secretly , because although prostitution is officially legal , sex workers still experience discrimination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a prostitute in frankfurt mitrovic also discovered that women are often put in unnecessarily dangerous situations as a result of arbitrary rules that dictate exactly where they are allowed to tout for business .
these are often dark and dead industrial areas , where the women are far more vulnerable to violence . on top of this , the study showed discrimination from most of germany 's federal job agencies , who will neither broker jobs in the sex industry nor offer retraining .
and even health insurance companies do n't offer any kind of special health provisions for prostitutes . verdi is prepared to fight the exploitation of sex workers , but so far , the union has failed to come up with any concrete solutions .
however , at a conference on the subject of prostitution at the end of april , they will present a sample contract for sex workers . mitrovic believes this is a step forward .
" the contract would regulate holiday pay , sick pay and something very special , namely medical examinations during work time , " she said .
" the contract would also ensure women a fixed income which could be transferred to their bank accounts . " it 's all well and good in theory , but just how likely are the brothel owners and managers to go along with it ?
mitrovic is optimistic and has already found one brothel manager who wants to try out the contract , and who also wants to employ immigrants , and who is looking for legal ways to do this . law does n't apply to all one of the problems with the new prostitution law is that it does nothing to help foreign prostitutes , who constitute almost half of germany sex workers , who do n't have a legal work permit .
without it , they ca n't report ill treatment or exploitation to the police unless they want to run the high risk of subsequent deportation . the sad reality of prostitution in germany is that despite the new law , most prostitutes still work under very poor conditions .
the majority of the money they earn is taken away from them by pimps and landlords and , for those who are trying to work by the book , from the tax office as well . perhaps the biggest problem for prostitutes here is still the way they are treated socially .
on the one hand paid sex is considered a part of 21st century life , but very few women are actually prepared to come out and admit that is what they do . as far as mitrovic is concerned , prostitution wo n't shed its criminal stigma until the pimps put up their hands and confess that they are making money from selling sex , and that it is a socially acceptable thing to do . udo taubitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stolen youth : child prostitution plagues german-czech border the united nations children 's agency says child prostitution is rising across the german border in the czech republic .

on may 1 , the eu will grow to a 25 member bloc of states .
dw-world content partner tagesschau.de spoke to günter verheugen , who has been responsible for designing the current round of eu expansion . günter verheugen is the eu executive 's commissioner for expansion .
german public broadcaster tagesschau.de spoke to verheugen about the fears , expectations and future of european union expansion . tagesschau.de : you are the architect of this eu expansion ; for years you 've been working toward may 1 , 2004 .
what does this day mean to you personally ? günter verheugen : gratification , relief - but also a very muted feeling of concern or trepidation .
it can be best compared with the feelings of a soccer trainer , who for the first time sees his team go play a match and asks himself whether they will all show what they have learned .
of course , i ask myself whether everything will work , if we really did do everything right , if we perhaps overlooked problems .
but my basic feeling is satisfaction for having created this large and meaningful peace project . many germans see it differently .
according to surveys every third german opposes eu expansion .
how do you explain this skepticism ? that 's very easy to explain .
as always when people are confronted by something that they do n't know well , they react with fear .
the problem is that there has n't been any sizable and broad political debate on this topic .
and that 's why expansion has n't really registered with people .
now that it 's directly imminent it has an enormous media presence : something 's coming , but what is it ?
the problems that citizens pinpoint in the context of the expansion - from cross-border criminality to competition problems - are very real .
it 's just that they have nothing to do with the impending expansion .
instead , they are the consequences of the collapse of the communist world of states , the fall of the iron curtain .
that 's why european integration is neither a part nor the origin of the problem , rather the reasonable , perhaps also the only , possible solution to the problem . even so , many people are afraid that businesses will export jobs to the low-wage countries in the eu 's new east ... they have already been doing that for a long time .
that will also continue , but it does n't have anything to do with the expansion either .
for , the result of the expansion is that these countries will not remain low-wage countries .
through their eu membership , the competitive situation in the old member states will improve .
from -lrb- the moment of -rrb- entry , the new members must assume our social standards , our environmental standards and our professional standards ; they must observe our competition and subsidy regulations .
that means that the cost advantages that they now have will decrease gradually .
the outsourcing or migration of production components is a process that we have been observing for 40 years .
it is not a result of european integration but rather a result of economic globalization . what does the expansion offer germans ? in the first place , it 's a peace project .
it creates peace , stability , and safety in the region of europe that immediately borders germany .
people there have known for years what political , economic and financial results instability leads to .
german soldiers are in kosovo , german soldiers are in bosnia … in kosovo alone , for one million people , europe raised € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- to maintain the ceasefire .
peace pays off , after all .
as luxemburg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , said : a year of peace costs less than a day of war ! the second is an enormous economic profit - especially for germany .
it arises from -lrb- the fact -rrb- that this economic area will be populated after all by 110 million people , if we include romania and bulgaria , and everywhere here there is an immense unsatisfied demand .
we have very stabile , very robust growth rates in these countries , that are noticeably above the growth rates in the remainder of the eu .
the export-oriented german economy profits particularly from this quickly growing market . but initially the germans will have to dig deeper into their pockets for the expansion .
the european commission has demanded more money for it , more than € 37 billion will be pumped into the new countries in the coming years .
how can you make that appealing to the taxpayer ? the financing for this expansion round was already decided in berlin in 1999 .
we are spending around € 15 billion less than was then calculated and will get by with a total of € 40 billion until 2006 .
the new countries will pay € 15 billion of that themselves .
all in all , the expansion will cost germany a net total of € 2.5 billion in the first three years .
on the other hand , germany will have an enormous trade balance surplus .
that 's why viewed economically it 's a win-win situation .
it makes no sense to say that the expansion will lead to an additional burden for the germans . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de croatia inches closer to eu membership the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .

the problems that citizens pinpoint in the context of the expansion - from cross-border criminality to competition problems - are very real .
it 's just that they have nothing to do with the impending expansion .
instead , they are the consequences of the collapse of the communist world of states , the fall of the iron curtain .
that 's why european integration is neither a part nor the origin of the problem , rather the reasonable , perhaps also the only , possible solution to the problem . even so , many people are afraid that businesses will export jobs to the low-wage countries in the eu 's new east ... they have already been doing that for a long time .

dw-world content partner tagesschau.de spoke to günter verheugen , who has been responsible for designing the current round of eu expansion . günter verheugen is the eu executive 's commissioner for expansion .
german public broadcaster tagesschau.de spoke to verheugen about the fears , expectations and future of european union expansion . tagesschau.de : you are the architect of this eu expansion ; for years you 've been working toward may 1 , 2004 .
what does this day mean to you personally ? günter verheugen : gratification , relief - but also a very muted feeling of concern or trepidation .
it can be best compared with the feelings of a soccer trainer , who for the first time sees his team go play a match and asks himself whether they will all show what they have learned .
of course , i ask myself whether everything will work , if we really did do everything right , if we perhaps overlooked problems .
but my basic feeling is satisfaction for having created this large and meaningful peace project . many germans see it differently .
according to surveys every third german opposes eu expansion .
how do you explain this skepticism ? that 's very easy to explain .
as always when people are confronted by something that they do n't know well , they react with fear .
the problem is that there has n't been any sizable and broad political debate on this topic .
and that 's why expansion has n't really registered with people .
now that it 's directly imminent it has an enormous media presence : something 's coming , but what is it ?
the problems that citizens pinpoint in the context of the expansion - from cross-border criminality to competition problems - are very real .
it 's just that they have nothing to do with the impending expansion .
instead , they are the consequences of the collapse of the communist world of states , the fall of the iron curtain .
that 's why european integration is neither a part nor the origin of the problem , rather the reasonable , perhaps also the only , possible solution to the problem . even so , many people are afraid that businesses will export jobs to the low-wage countries in the eu 's new east ... they have already been doing that for a long time .
that will also continue , but it does n't have anything to do with the expansion either .
for , the result of the expansion is that these countries will not remain low-wage countries .
through their eu membership , the competitive situation in the old member states will improve .
from -lrb- the moment of -rrb- entry , the new members must assume our social standards , our environmental standards and our professional standards ; they must observe our competition and subsidy regulations .
that means that the cost advantages that they now have will decrease gradually .
the outsourcing or migration of production components is a process that we have been observing for 40 years .
it is not a result of european integration but rather a result of economic globalization . what does the expansion offer germans ? in the first place , it 's a peace project .
it creates peace , stability , and safety in the region of europe that immediately borders germany .
people there have known for years what political , economic and financial results instability leads to .
german soldiers are in kosovo , german soldiers are in bosnia … in kosovo alone , for one million people , europe raised € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- to maintain the ceasefire .
peace pays off , after all .
as luxemburg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , said : a year of peace costs less than a day of war ! the second is an enormous economic profit - especially for germany .

on may 1 , the eu will grow to a 25 member bloc of states .
dw-world content partner tagesschau.de spoke to günter verheugen , who has been responsible for designing the current round of eu expansion . günter verheugen is the eu executive 's commissioner for expansion .
german public broadcaster tagesschau.de spoke to verheugen about the fears , expectations and future of european union expansion . tagesschau.de : you are the architect of this eu expansion ; for years you 've been working toward may 1 , 2004 .
what does this day mean to you personally ? günter verheugen : gratification , relief - but also a very muted feeling of concern or trepidation .
it can be best compared with the feelings of a soccer trainer , who for the first time sees his team go play a match and asks himself whether they will all show what they have learned .
of course , i ask myself whether everything will work , if we really did do everything right , if we perhaps overlooked problems .
but my basic feeling is satisfaction for having created this large and meaningful peace project . many germans see it differently .
according to surveys every third german opposes eu expansion .
how do you explain this skepticism ? that 's very easy to explain .
as always when people are confronted by something that they do n't know well , they react with fear .
the problem is that there has n't been any sizable and broad political debate on this topic .
and that 's why expansion has n't really registered with people .
now that it 's directly imminent it has an enormous media presence : something 's coming , but what is it ?
the problems that citizens pinpoint in the context of the expansion - from cross-border criminality to competition problems - are very real .
it 's just that they have nothing to do with the impending expansion .
instead , they are the consequences of the collapse of the communist world of states , the fall of the iron curtain .
that 's why european integration is neither a part nor the origin of the problem , rather the reasonable , perhaps also the only , possible solution to the problem . even so , many people are afraid that businesses will export jobs to the low-wage countries in the eu 's new east ... they have already been doing that for a long time .
that will also continue , but it does n't have anything to do with the expansion either .
for , the result of the expansion is that these countries will not remain low-wage countries .
through their eu membership , the competitive situation in the old member states will improve .
from -lrb- the moment of -rrb- entry , the new members must assume our social standards , our environmental standards and our professional standards ; they must observe our competition and subsidy regulations .
that means that the cost advantages that they now have will decrease gradually .
the outsourcing or migration of production components is a process that we have been observing for 40 years .
it is not a result of european integration but rather a result of economic globalization . what does the expansion offer germans ? in the first place , it 's a peace project .
it creates peace , stability , and safety in the region of europe that immediately borders germany .
people there have known for years what political , economic and financial results instability leads to .
german soldiers are in kosovo , german soldiers are in bosnia … in kosovo alone , for one million people , europe raised € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- to maintain the ceasefire .
peace pays off , after all .
as luxemburg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , said : a year of peace costs less than a day of war ! the second is an enormous economic profit - especially for germany .
it arises from -lrb- the fact -rrb- that this economic area will be populated after all by 110 million people , if we include romania and bulgaria , and everywhere here there is an immense unsatisfied demand .
we have very stabile , very robust growth rates in these countries , that are noticeably above the growth rates in the remainder of the eu .
the export-oriented german economy profits particularly from this quickly growing market . but initially the germans will have to dig deeper into their pockets for the expansion .
the european commission has demanded more money for it , more than € 37 billion will be pumped into the new countries in the coming years .
how can you make that appealing to the taxpayer ? the financing for this expansion round was already decided in berlin in 1999 .
we are spending around € 15 billion less than was then calculated and will get by with a total of € 40 billion until 2006 .
the new countries will pay € 15 billion of that themselves .
all in all , the expansion will cost germany a net total of € 2.5 billion in the first three years .
on the other hand , germany will have an enormous trade balance surplus .
that 's why viewed economically it 's a win-win situation .
it makes no sense to say that the expansion will lead to an additional burden for the germans . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de croatia inches closer to eu membership the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .

lithuania and latvia , for example , will need decades to reach our economic level .
how can you ensure that economically a europe of two speeds does n't develop ? you could also ask why greece , an eu member for 30 years , has n't been able to reduce the distance to the rest of the eu - but still no one talks about a europe of two economic speeds .
what we see is a higher speed of growth in the new countries , and that 's good . people talk about 50 to 60 years for some of the new member countries . … but where 's the problem ?
it took a long time with ireland too .
for greece the distance from the average is still the same but in the meantime at a much higher level .
the most important thing is that the new member countries grow , and their growth potential is large .
incidentally , individual citizens ' or businesses ' rights to eu funds do n't arise from eu membership .
it 's not like it was with german unification .
unification has cost € 1.25 trillion so far .
in contrast , expansion can not put us in danger in terms of costs because the eu budget is club funds by nature .
the club ca n't spend one euro more than the members voluntarily put into the club funds . in negotiations with countries such as poland , people had the impression that they want to get the maximum out of europe and only contribute a little .
did that annoy you ? certainly not .
poland negotiated well but no tougher than others ; they are n't getting more either .
even in 2013 , the union 's per capita benefits for poland will be distinctly lower than the per capita benefits for spain .
poland is a large country , a very proud nation , that needs a certain amount of time to find its place and role in the european union .
people should show a little patience and not pillory a country that is encumbered by a formidable historic burden . still , the new members apparently have n't completed the homework that is a condition for receiving eu funds .
for example , corruption in the new member states , such as slovakia or the czech republic , is high .
how will you get that under control ? i ca n't dispute that a certain kind of corruption remains quite strong in these countries - in connection with large-scale privatization , for example .
-lrb- german interior minister -rrb- otto schily once said he thought that around 10 percent of the funds that went to eastern germany in the context of economic reconstruction were illegal .
i would n't estimate the magnitude to be so high for poland and the czech republic .
but it is a typical phenomenon . regarding homework , i would n't agree with your thesis .
on may 1 we will see that the new member countries will assume -lrb- eu -rrb- community law to 100 percent .
while in the old countries more than 2,000 legal actions are underway due to contract breaches , that is , due to the incomplete or completely inadequate application of community law . do you mean to say that the new acceding states are better prepared than earlier acceding states ? it 's safe to say that .
although we have much more extensive and complicated community legislation today .
now there 's much , much more to negotiate .
during earlier expansions , the commission was n't worried about whether the greeks , spanish or portuguese were also capable of applying community law .
this is an entirely new method that we first developed for this expansion . the balkan countries want to join the eu ; the accession of turkey , romania and bulgaria 's is planned for 2007 .
where do you think europe stops ? romania and bulgaria are part of the current round .
and then everything 's open .
the balkan countries do indeed have the prospect of joining , though there 's no schedule for them .
they are still too far away from national or regional stability or also from economic integration - with the exception of croatia , whose accession application has been submitted .
turkey is a special case .
it has had the prospect of joining since 1963 .
at the end of the year it will be decided whether turkey has in the meantime gotten far enough to start negotiations . for the eastern european countries , such as russia , ukraine , but also the caucasus countries or the southern mediterranean countries , membership is not on the agenda .
however , we offer these countries very far-ranging neighborhood policies . your time as expansion commissioner comes to an end on may 1 … correct , i have made myself redundant .
but do n't forget bulgaria , romania and turkey . what will you do afterwards ? i will remain a member of the -lrb- european -rrb- commission until november 1 .
beyond that nothing has been decided .
i have armed myself with great patience . gabriele feil interviewed günter verheugen for tagesschau.de -lrb- ncy -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de croatia inches closer to eu membership the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .

joschka fischer will wrap up his trip to the caucasus region on thursday with stops in armenia and georgia .
his visit in armenia comes during considerable political instability in the country . following visits to afghanistan and azerbaijan , germany 's fischer continued his week-long trip abroad by arriving in the armenian capital yerevan on thursday morning .
as he did in azerbaijan , he is expected to encourage both southern caucasus nations to continue to improve their democratic and human rights credentials by holding out the prospect of closer ties to the european union . fischer will need plenty of diplomatic tact in yerevan , since armenian president robert kocharian is under increasing pressure to step down .
on wednesday , opposition groups held a protest rally that attracted an estimated 10,000 people , according to the associated press .
opposition groups allege kocharian won reelection last year only through widespread election fraud , a charge which the president denies . tensions in the country rose on april 13 , when police used force to break up a protest rally .
around 100 people were reportedly detained and several protestors were injured .
" any administration relying on violence is doomed .
kocharian must go , " said stepan demirchyan , leader of the opposition justice party and runner-up in last year 's presidential election , according to the reuters news agency . kocharian 's opponents hope to oust him though continued popular unrest , similar to how neighboring georgia toppled the government of former president eduard shevardnadze late last year .

a cease-fire in the conflict was signed in 1994 , but the final status of nagorno-karabakh has not been resolved .
in the azerbaijani capital baku on wednesday , fischer already said germany and the eu were prepared to help find a solution to the conflict . fischer 's visit to armenia will also include a memorial for armenians killed by turks in 1915 .
the armenians claim ottoman turkish forces committed genocide at the time , slaughtering some 1.5 million people between 1915 and 1923 .
turkey rejects the charges , saying the armenians were killed in a partisan war as the ottoman empire collapsed . heading to tbilisi later in the day , fischer will meet with georgian president mikhail saakashvili to show support for his western oriented reform course .
saakashvili came to power in a bloodless coup that ousted shevardnadze in november , but he has run into trouble recently , as military commanders in the rebellious black sea province of adzhara refuse to follow the orders of the central government . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rebuilding afghanistan and setting an example for iraq during his visit to afghanistan on tuesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer praised the work of german troops and said the reconstruction effort there should serve as a role model to iraq .

joschka fischer will wrap up his trip to the caucasus region on thursday with stops in armenia and georgia .
his visit in armenia comes during considerable political instability in the country . following visits to afghanistan and azerbaijan , germany 's fischer continued his week-long trip abroad by arriving in the armenian capital yerevan on thursday morning .
as he did in azerbaijan , he is expected to encourage both southern caucasus nations to continue to improve their democratic and human rights credentials by holding out the prospect of closer ties to the european union . fischer will need plenty of diplomatic tact in yerevan , since armenian president robert kocharian is under increasing pressure to step down .
on wednesday , opposition groups held a protest rally that attracted an estimated 10,000 people , according to the associated press .
opposition groups allege kocharian won reelection last year only through widespread election fraud , a charge which the president denies . tensions in the country rose on april 13 , when police used force to break up a protest rally .
around 100 people were reportedly detained and several protestors were injured .
" any administration relying on violence is doomed .
kocharian must go , " said stepan demirchyan , leader of the opposition justice party and runner-up in last year 's presidential election , according to the reuters news agency . kocharian 's opponents hope to oust him though continued popular unrest , similar to how neighboring georgia toppled the government of former president eduard shevardnadze late last year .
but some experts are skeptical kocharian will be removed from power . " the armenian authorities are better consolidated and will defend their position more strongly .

a cease-fire in the conflict was signed in 1994 , but the final status of nagorno-karabakh has not been resolved .
in the azerbaijani capital baku on wednesday , fischer already said germany and the eu were prepared to help find a solution to the conflict . fischer 's visit to armenia will also include a memorial for armenians killed by turks in 1915 .
the armenians claim ottoman turkish forces committed genocide at the time , slaughtering some 1.5 million people between 1915 and 1923 .
turkey rejects the charges , saying the armenians were killed in a partisan war as the ottoman empire collapsed . heading to tbilisi later in the day , fischer will meet with georgian president mikhail saakashvili to show support for his western oriented reform course .
saakashvili came to power in a bloodless coup that ousted shevardnadze in november , but he has run into trouble recently , as military commanders in the rebellious black sea province of adzhara refuse to follow the orders of the central government . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rebuilding afghanistan and setting an example for iraq during his visit to afghanistan on tuesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer praised the work of german troops and said the reconstruction effort there should serve as a role model to iraq .

kalle kiez -lrb- left -rrb- tells tidy berliners berlin partygoers may come to the conclusion they had one too many to drink when rubbish bins start shouting at them on the city 's streets .
but the talking trashcans are n't a figment of inebriated imaginations . siggi sport , hitlist harry and susi smart have taken to the streets of berlin , doing their part to create an upbeat and tidy atmosphere in the city known for its , some say , crude vernacular .
siggi sport hollers " go-a-a-al " when cleanly passersby toss their trash into his welcoming receptacle .
hitlist harry sings a takeoff of a german pop song and susi smart thanks her benefactor in english , french and japanese . the three faceless , orange characters are solar-powered , multilingual rubbish bins .
the berlin city sanitation department introduced the five trashcan characters on wednesday in an effort to show that cleanliness is " cool " and to help polish the capital 's image .
on top of showing their appreciation for being " fed , " the wastebaskets will relay information on what 's going on in berlin over the summer to tidy pedestrians . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

swiss pharmaceutical giant novartis said on thursday it would enter merger talks with france 's aventis , possibly preventing a bid by rival sanofi-synthelabo which is backed by the french government . basel-based novartis said it would begin negotiations with aventis despite previous reservations about interference by government officials in paris , who have made clear they would prefer an all-french linkup with sanofi-synthelabo .
if successful , the merged novartis-aventis would create the world 's second-largest pharmaceutical firm after the u.s.-based pfizer . a spokesman for aventis , which itself was created from a merger of france 's rhone-poulenc and germany 's hoechst in 2000 , said the company was pleased by novartis ' willingness to negotiate , but remained cautious about the final outcome of the talks . " we welcome this decision , -lsb- but -rsb- no assurances can be given that an agreement can be reached , " spokesman tony rodham told the associated press .
aventis 's board invited novartis to enter talks three weeks ago . the announcement strengthens aventis ' hand in its attempt to fend off a hostile bid from much smaller french rival sanofi-synthelabo , which has offered to pay € 45 billion -lrb- $ 53.2 billion -rrb- for the company .
that encouraged novartis to get involved , but the swiss were then put off by comments from french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , who said he would prefer a french-only merger in order to help protect the country 's national interests . " we 're not at the endgame here yet , " richard jarvis , a pharmaceutical analyst at pictet & cie in london , told bloomberg news .
" the french government has n't changed their position and novartis is keen to try and persuade them .
it 's not completely in their hands and it is n't just in the hands of aventis shareholders at present . " aventis sees risks with sanofi however , since aventis has shown no interest in merging with sanofi-synthelabo and the french government would have to justify blocking any deal to the european union , novartis now appears ready to risk rankling paris . " a combination with aventis has a very convincing industrial logic .
it creates value and it addresses the legitimate concerns of the french government , " novartis chief financial officer raymond breu told reporters on thursday . strasbourg-based aventis has said novartis would be a much stronger partner than sanofi , which faces possible patent challenges to some of its more important drugs such as its plavix blood-thinner . although half the size of it 's competitor , sanofi is asking for a 100 percent takeover of aventis and demanding 50 percent of aventis shares and voting rights - a bold move that sanofi is able to make because of aventis ' currently weaker financial position . unions opposed novartis would protect aventis from sanofi , but the firm 's unions are opposed to a merger with the swiss and on thursday showed they would not shy away from using concerns about france 's national interest to try and hinder a deal . bloomberg reported that the unions sent a letter to french finance minister nicolas sarkozy , saying an aventis novartis merger would mean " france would have to give up its independence on products as crucial as vaccines and antibiotics , not to speak of the industrial and research sacrifice . " novartis shares were down 2.4 percent to 57.35 swiss francs -lrb- us $ 43.64 -rrb- in early trading on the zurich exchange following the announcement , and aventis shares rose 2.7 percent to € 64.45 -lrb- us $ 76.53 -rrb- in early paris trading . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis posts profits to ward off hostile takeover bid the french-german pharmaceutical company aventis announced growing profits for 2003 in an effort to ward off a hostile takeover bid from a smaller french drug firm .

swiss pharmaceutical giant novartis said on thursday it would enter merger talks with france 's aventis , possibly preventing a bid by rival sanofi-synthelabo which is backed by the french government . basel-based novartis said it would begin negotiations with aventis despite previous reservations about interference by government officials in paris , who have made clear they would prefer an all-french linkup with sanofi-synthelabo .
if successful , the merged novartis-aventis would create the world 's second-largest pharmaceutical firm after the u.s.-based pfizer . a spokesman for aventis , which itself was created from a merger of france 's rhone-poulenc and germany 's hoechst in 2000 , said the company was pleased by novartis ' willingness to negotiate , but remained cautious about the final outcome of the talks . " we welcome this decision , -lsb- but -rsb- no assurances can be given that an agreement can be reached , " spokesman tony rodham told the associated press .
aventis 's board invited novartis to enter talks three weeks ago . the announcement strengthens aventis ' hand in its attempt to fend off a hostile bid from much smaller french rival sanofi-synthelabo , which has offered to pay € 45 billion -lrb- $ 53.2 billion -rrb- for the company .
that encouraged novartis to get involved , but the swiss were then put off by comments from french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , who said he would prefer a french-only merger in order to help protect the country 's national interests . " we 're not at the endgame here yet , " richard jarvis , a pharmaceutical analyst at pictet & cie in london , told bloomberg news .
" the french government has n't changed their position and novartis is keen to try and persuade them .
it 's not completely in their hands and it is n't just in the hands of aventis shareholders at present . " aventis sees risks with sanofi however , since aventis has shown no interest in merging with sanofi-synthelabo and the french government would have to justify blocking any deal to the european union , novartis now appears ready to risk rankling paris . " a combination with aventis has a very convincing industrial logic .
it creates value and it addresses the legitimate concerns of the french government , " novartis chief financial officer raymond breu told reporters on thursday . strasbourg-based aventis has said novartis would be a much stronger partner than sanofi , which faces possible patent challenges to some of its more important drugs such as its plavix blood-thinner . although half the size of it 's competitor , sanofi is asking for a 100 percent takeover of aventis and demanding 50 percent of aventis shares and voting rights - a bold move that sanofi is able to make because of aventis ' currently weaker financial position . unions opposed novartis would protect aventis from sanofi , but the firm 's unions are opposed to a merger with the swiss and on thursday showed they would not shy away from using concerns about france 's national interest to try and hinder a deal . bloomberg reported that the unions sent a letter to french finance minister nicolas sarkozy , saying an aventis novartis merger would mean " france would have to give up its independence on products as crucial as vaccines and antibiotics , not to speak of the industrial and research sacrifice . " novartis shares were down 2.4 percent to 57.35 swiss francs -lrb- us $ 43.64 -rrb- in early trading on the zurich exchange following the announcement , and aventis shares rose 2.7 percent to € 64.45 -lrb- us $ 76.53 -rrb- in early paris trading . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis posts profits to ward off hostile takeover bid the french-german pharmaceutical company aventis announced growing profits for 2003 in an effort to ward off a hostile takeover bid from a smaller french drug firm .

"
turkish films are securing a place in german cinemas now that producers have discovered a new target audience of german-turks .
far from being on the fringe , the films are making it into the nation 's biggest theaters . turkish films shown in germany have long conveyed a rather bleak view of the bosporus state .
they typically dealt with issues such as the kurdish conflict , the problems facing women , illiteracy , military dominance , and censorship .
but in recent years , that 's started to change .
following the success of yavuz turgul 's drama " eskiya , the bandit , " more and more popular turkish films have made it onto german movie screens , including those in the big multi-plex cinemas . whereas in the past , turks in germany had to wait months for a film showing in turkey to be released here , now it 's often only a matter of days separating release dates , making it easier for the turkish community to stay in touch with the zeitgeist in the bosporus . distributors making the trend two companies are leading the way in distribution .
warner attracted turkish and german audiences alike with films such as " propaganda , " " güle güle , " and " commissar shekspir . "
and then there 's maxximum film distribution , started by anil sahin , a former executive with the hamburg-based cinemaxx cinema group .
when he saw the potential of the turkish market , he immediately founded his own company . sahin 's first venture , " balalaika " in october 2001 proved to be a flop in german cinemas , so the businessman set about refining his marketing strategy .
turkish movie-goers proved to be loyal customers with a high level of attachment to the product .
the particular film being shown matters less to them than the movie-going experience . though warner had high box office numbers , it did n't make a huge profit , since it had falsely calculated the advertising budget .
maxximum , on the other hand , began collecting german " bogeys " - prizes for the highest number of screenings . " deli yürek " played in 150 cinemas in over 70 cities .
the final episode of the turkish cult soap " asmali konak " was the most successful title with 35 copies and over 220,000 viewers . maxximum productions run in other countries as well , for example austria , bulgaria and switzerland .
a few weeks ago , one of its films took third place in the dutch box office charts . here , the films are shown with german subtitles .
that does n't just help the handful of non-turkish audience members , it also helps to fill the gaps in the sometimes scanty knowledge of turkish among german-turks .
and surprisingly , any scenes containing swear words or naked skin have to be cut out of all the films shown in germany , as the target audience here is much more conservative than in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actor moritz bleibtreu .
the increasing level of german involvement in the turkish film industry could soon see the tables being turned , with german-turkish productions being exported back to the bosporus .
maxximum , for example , is planning to produce a vehicle for popular german actor moritz bleibtreu -lrb- photo -rrb- .
and in hamburg , a film called " süperseks " is in the works .
the comedy by a german director about a turkish sex hotline is being produced with german money - and it has a good chance of being successful in turkey . rambo and big happy families just how well these films reflect the realities of everyday turkish life can be left for viewers to decide .
" propaganda " and " vizontele , " for example , are filled with the kind of antics and buffoonery that are guaranteed to have even german audiences splitting their sides .
but while they portray turkey as a conflict-free , multi-ethnic society full of big happy families , the film " deli yürek " shows quite a different side .
the action flick takes its inspiration from the conflict in kurdistan , and presents it as a conspiracy between the cia and hizbollah that can only be resolved by a turkish version of rambo . possible superficialities aside , anil sahin deems the trend toward popular turkish cinema a positive one .
these colorful films convey a more positive image of turkey and help create a closer affiliation to europe .
but one of the superstars of turkish cinema sees things differently .

"
turkish films are securing a place in german cinemas now that producers have discovered a new target audience of german-turks .
far from being on the fringe , the films are making it into the nation 's biggest theaters . turkish films shown in germany have long conveyed a rather bleak view of the bosporus state .
they typically dealt with issues such as the kurdish conflict , the problems facing women , illiteracy , military dominance , and censorship .
but in recent years , that 's started to change .
following the success of yavuz turgul 's drama " eskiya , the bandit , " more and more popular turkish films have made it onto german movie screens , including those in the big multi-plex cinemas . whereas in the past , turks in germany had to wait months for a film showing in turkey to be released here , now it 's often only a matter of days separating release dates , making it easier for the turkish community to stay in touch with the zeitgeist in the bosporus . distributors making the trend two companies are leading the way in distribution .
warner attracted turkish and german audiences alike with films such as " propaganda , " " güle güle , " and " commissar shekspir . "
and then there 's maxximum film distribution , started by anil sahin , a former executive with the hamburg-based cinemaxx cinema group .
when he saw the potential of the turkish market , he immediately founded his own company . sahin 's first venture , " balalaika " in october 2001 proved to be a flop in german cinemas , so the businessman set about refining his marketing strategy .

during his visit to afghanistan on tuesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer praised the work of german troops and said the reconstruction effort there should serve as a role model to iraq . fischer 's first stop in afghanistan on tuesday was the northern city of kunduz , home to a provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- of about 300 german troops .
there are about a dozen such prt 's spread out in several cities around the country to provide security and help oversee reconstruction projects .
in kunduz , the germans are responsible for training local police officers .
at each major intersection , there 's a uniformed officer trying , often in vain , to regulate traffic .
still , there 's optimism that things are starting to improve .
at the city 's bazaar , residents can get most of what they need .

swiss pharmaceutical giant novartis said on thursday it would enter merger talks with france 's aventis , possibly preventing a bid by rival sanofi-synthelabo which is backed by the french government . basel-based novartis said it would begin negotiations with aventis despite previous reservations about interference by government officials in paris , who have made clear they would prefer an all-french linkup with sanofi-synthelabo .
if successful , the merged novartis-aventis would create the world 's second-largest pharmaceutical firm after the u.s.-based pfizer . a spokesman for aventis , which itself was created from a merger of france 's rhone-poulenc and germany 's hoechst in 2000 , said the company was pleased by novartis ' willingness to negotiate , but remained cautious about the final outcome of the talks . " we welcome this decision , -lsb- but -rsb- no assurances can be given that an agreement can be reached , " spokesman tony rodham told the associated press .
aventis 's board invited novartis to enter talks three weeks ago . the announcement strengthens aventis ' hand in its attempt to fend off a hostile bid from much smaller french rival sanofi-synthelabo , which has offered to pay € 45 billion -lrb- $ 53.2 billion -rrb- for the company .
that encouraged novartis to get involved , but the swiss were then put off by comments from french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , who said he would prefer a french-only merger in order to help protect the country 's national interests . " we 're not at the endgame here yet , " richard jarvis , a pharmaceutical analyst at pictet & cie in london , told bloomberg news .
" the french government has n't changed their position and novartis is keen to try and persuade them .
it 's not completely in their hands and it is n't just in the hands of aventis shareholders at present . " aventis sees risks with sanofi however , since aventis has shown no interest in merging with sanofi-synthelabo and the french government would have to justify blocking any deal to the european union , novartis now appears ready to risk rankling paris . " a combination with aventis has a very convincing industrial logic .
it creates value and it addresses the legitimate concerns of the french government , " novartis chief financial officer raymond breu told reporters on thursday . strasbourg-based aventis has said novartis would be a much stronger partner than sanofi , which faces possible patent challenges to some of its more important drugs such as its plavix blood-thinner . although half the size of it 's competitor , sanofi is asking for a 100 percent takeover of aventis and demanding 50 percent of aventis shares and voting rights - a bold move that sanofi is able to make because of aventis ' currently weaker financial position . unions opposed novartis would protect aventis from sanofi , but the firm 's unions are opposed to a merger with the swiss and on thursday showed they would not shy away from using concerns about france 's national interest to try and hinder a deal . bloomberg reported that the unions sent a letter to french finance minister nicolas sarkozy , saying an aventis novartis merger would mean " france would have to give up its independence on products as crucial as vaccines and antibiotics , not to speak of the industrial and research sacrifice . " novartis shares were down 2.4 percent to 57.35 swiss francs -lrb- us $ 43.64 -rrb- in early trading on the zurich exchange following the announcement , and aventis shares rose 2.7 percent to € 64.45 -lrb- us $ 76.53 -rrb- in early paris trading . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis posts profits to ward off hostile takeover bid the french-german pharmaceutical company aventis announced growing profits for 2003 in an effort to ward off a hostile takeover bid from a smaller french drug firm .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.04.2004 german foreign minister pushes for reform in armenia , georgia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armenian president robert kocharian is under pressure to resign .
joschka fischer will wrap up his trip to the caucasus region on thursday with stops in armenia and georgia .
his visit in armenia comes during considerable political instability in the country . following visits to afghanistan and azerbaijan , germany 's fischer continued his week-long trip abroad by arriving in the armenian capital yerevan on thursday morning .
as he did in azerbaijan , he is expected to encourage both southern caucasus nations to continue to improve their democratic and human rights credentials by holding out the prospect of closer ties to the european union . fischer will need plenty of diplomatic tact in yerevan , since armenian president robert kocharian is under increasing pressure to step down .
on wednesday , opposition groups held a protest rally that attracted an estimated 10,000 people , according to the associated press .
opposition groups allege kocharian won reelection last year only through widespread election fraud , a charge which the president denies . tensions in the country rose on april 13 , when police used force to break up a protest rally .
around 100 people were reportedly detained and several protestors were injured .
" any administration relying on violence is doomed .
kocharian must go , " said stepan demirchyan , leader of the opposition justice party and runner-up in last year 's presidential election , according to the reuters news agency . kocharian 's opponents hope to oust him though continued popular unrest , similar to how neighboring georgia toppled the government of former president eduard shevardnadze late last year .
but some experts are skeptical kocharian will be removed from power . " the armenian authorities are better consolidated and will defend their position more strongly .
moreover , there 's no clear leader of the opposition like there was in georgia , " andranik migranyan told dw-radio . conflict with azerbaijan while in yerevan , fischer will also address the dispute over the nagorno-karabakh region , which though part of azerbaijan has been separated from the country since the mid-1990s after a war with ethnic armenians .
a cease-fire in the conflict was signed in 1994 , but the final status of nagorno-karabakh has not been resolved .
in the azerbaijani capital baku on wednesday , fischer already said germany and the eu were prepared to help find a solution to the conflict . fischer 's visit to armenia will also include a memorial for armenians killed by turks in 1915 .
the armenians claim ottoman turkish forces committed genocide at the time , slaughtering some 1.5 million people between 1915 and 1923 .
turkey rejects the charges , saying the armenians were killed in a partisan war as the ottoman empire collapsed . heading to tbilisi later in the day , fischer will meet with georgian president mikhail saakashvili to show support for his western oriented reform course .
saakashvili came to power in a bloodless coup that ousted shevardnadze in november , but he has run into trouble recently , as military commanders in the rebellious black sea province of adzhara refuse to follow the orders of the central government . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rebuilding afghanistan and setting an example for iraq during his visit to afghanistan on tuesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer praised the work of german troops and said the reconstruction effort there should serve as a role model to iraq .

it 'll perhaps be more difficult , because time is being wasted , but it 's never too late to learn , " he said , adding that it 's hardly a coincidence that the un 's former commissioner for afghanistan , lakhdar brahimi , is now the commissioner for iraq . renewed committment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister , joschka fischer , left , speaks to reporters during a press conference in kabul , afghanistan on tuesday , april 20 , 2004 .

his visit in armenia comes during considerable political instability in the country . following visits to afghanistan and azerbaijan , germany 's fischer continued his week-long trip abroad by arriving in the armenian capital yerevan on thursday morning .
as he did in azerbaijan , he is expected to encourage both southern caucasus nations to continue to improve their democratic and human rights credentials by holding out the prospect of closer ties to the european union . fischer will need plenty of diplomatic tact in yerevan , since armenian president robert kocharian is under increasing pressure to step down .
on wednesday , opposition groups held a protest rally that attracted an estimated 10,000 people , according to the associated press .

in the azerbaijani capital baku on wednesday , fischer already said germany and the eu were prepared to help find a solution to the conflict . fischer 's visit to armenia will also include a memorial for armenians killed by turks in 1915 .

turkey rejects the charges , saying the armenians were killed in a partisan war as the ottoman empire collapsed . heading to tbilisi later in the day , fischer will meet with georgian president mikhail saakashvili to show support for his western oriented reform course .

joschka fischer will wrap up his trip to the caucasus region on thursday with stops in armenia and georgia .
his visit in armenia comes during considerable political instability in the country . following visits to afghanistan and azerbaijan , germany 's fischer continued his week-long trip abroad by arriving in the armenian capital yerevan on thursday morning .
as he did in azerbaijan , he is expected to encourage both southern caucasus nations to continue to improve their democratic and human rights credentials by holding out the prospect of closer ties to the european union . fischer will need plenty of diplomatic tact in yerevan , since armenian president robert kocharian is under increasing pressure to step down .
on wednesday , opposition groups held a protest rally that attracted an estimated 10,000 people , according to the associated press .
opposition groups allege kocharian won reelection last year only through widespread election fraud , a charge which the president denies . tensions in the country rose on april 13 , when police used force to break up a protest rally .
around 100 people were reportedly detained and several protestors were injured .
" any administration relying on violence is doomed .
kocharian must go , " said stepan demirchyan , leader of the opposition justice party and runner-up in last year 's presidential election , according to the reuters news agency . kocharian 's opponents hope to oust him though continued popular unrest , similar to how neighboring georgia toppled the government of former president eduard shevardnadze late last year .
but some experts are skeptical kocharian will be removed from power . " the armenian authorities are better consolidated and will defend their position more strongly .
moreover , there 's no clear leader of the opposition like there was in georgia , " andranik migranyan told dw-radio . conflict with azerbaijan while in yerevan , fischer will also address the dispute over the nagorno-karabakh region , which though part of azerbaijan has been separated from the country since the mid-1990s after a war with ethnic armenians .
a cease-fire in the conflict was signed in 1994 , but the final status of nagorno-karabakh has not been resolved .
in the azerbaijani capital baku on wednesday , fischer already said germany and the eu were prepared to help find a solution to the conflict . fischer 's visit to armenia will also include a memorial for armenians killed by turks in 1915 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the new europe the eve of enlargement where is europe headed ? a final report card for new eu members getting the green light europe -pipe- 22.04.2004 verheugen : eu expansion brings peace and profit back to first page back 2/2 the economic differential between the countries of the old europe and many new members is huge .
lithuania and latvia , for example , will need decades to reach our economic level .
how can you ensure that economically a europe of two speeds does n't develop ? you could also ask why greece , an eu member for 30 years , has n't been able to reduce the distance to the rest of the eu - but still no one talks about a europe of two economic speeds .
what we see is a higher speed of growth in the new countries , and that 's good . people talk about 50 to 60 years for some of the new member countries . … but where 's the problem ?
it took a long time with ireland too .
for greece the distance from the average is still the same but in the meantime at a much higher level .
the most important thing is that the new member countries grow , and their growth potential is large .
incidentally , individual citizens ' or businesses ' rights to eu funds do n't arise from eu membership .
it 's not like it was with german unification .
unification has cost € 1.25 trillion so far .
in contrast , expansion can not put us in danger in terms of costs because the eu budget is club funds by nature .
the club ca n't spend one euro more than the members voluntarily put into the club funds . in negotiations with countries such as poland , people had the impression that they want to get the maximum out of europe and only contribute a little .
did that annoy you ? certainly not .
poland negotiated well but no tougher than others ; they are n't getting more either .
even in 2013 , the union 's per capita benefits for poland will be distinctly lower than the per capita benefits for spain .
poland is a large country , a very proud nation , that needs a certain amount of time to find its place and role in the european union .
people should show a little patience and not pillory a country that is encumbered by a formidable historic burden . still , the new members apparently have n't completed the homework that is a condition for receiving eu funds .
for example , corruption in the new member states , such as slovakia or the czech republic , is high .
how will you get that under control ? i ca n't dispute that a certain kind of corruption remains quite strong in these countries - in connection with large-scale privatization , for example .
-lrb- german interior minister -rrb- otto schily once said he thought that around 10 percent of the funds that went to eastern germany in the context of economic reconstruction were illegal .
i would n't estimate the magnitude to be so high for poland and the czech republic .
but it is a typical phenomenon . regarding homework , i would n't agree with your thesis .
on may 1 we will see that the new member countries will assume -lrb- eu -rrb- community law to 100 percent .
while in the old countries more than 2,000 legal actions are underway due to contract breaches , that is , due to the incomplete or completely inadequate application of community law . do you mean to say that the new acceding states are better prepared than earlier acceding states ? it 's safe to say that .
although we have much more extensive and complicated community legislation today .
now there 's much , much more to negotiate .
during earlier expansions , the commission was n't worried about whether the greeks , spanish or portuguese were also capable of applying community law .
this is an entirely new method that we first developed for this expansion . the balkan countries want to join the eu ; the accession of turkey , romania and bulgaria 's is planned for 2007 .
where do you think europe stops ? romania and bulgaria are part of the current round .
and then everything 's open .
the balkan countries do indeed have the prospect of joining , though there 's no schedule for them .
they are still too far away from national or regional stability or also from economic integration - with the exception of croatia , whose accession application has been submitted .
turkey is a special case .
it has had the prospect of joining since 1963 .
at the end of the year it will be decided whether turkey has in the meantime gotten far enough to start negotiations . for the eastern european countries , such as russia , ukraine , but also the caucasus countries or the southern mediterranean countries , membership is not on the agenda .
however , we offer these countries very far-ranging neighborhood policies . your time as expansion commissioner comes to an end on may 1 … correct , i have made myself redundant .
but do n't forget bulgaria , romania and turkey . what will you do afterwards ? i will remain a member of the -lrb- european -rrb- commission until november 1 .
beyond that nothing has been decided .
i have armed myself with great patience . gabriele feil interviewed günter verheugen for tagesschau.de -lrb- ncy -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de croatia inches closer to eu membership the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .

lithuania and latvia , for example , will need decades to reach our economic level .
how can you ensure that economically a europe of two speeds does n't develop ? you could also ask why greece , an eu member for 30 years , has n't been able to reduce the distance to the rest of the eu - but still no one talks about a europe of two economic speeds .
what we see is a higher speed of growth in the new countries , and that 's good . people talk about 50 to 60 years for some of the new member countries . … but where 's the problem ?
it took a long time with ireland too .
for greece the distance from the average is still the same but in the meantime at a much higher level .
the most important thing is that the new member countries grow , and their growth potential is large .
incidentally , individual citizens ' or businesses ' rights to eu funds do n't arise from eu membership .
it 's not like it was with german unification .
unification has cost € 1.25 trillion so far .
in contrast , expansion can not put us in danger in terms of costs because the eu budget is club funds by nature .
the club ca n't spend one euro more than the members voluntarily put into the club funds . in negotiations with countries such as poland , people had the impression that they want to get the maximum out of europe and only contribute a little .
did that annoy you ? certainly not .
poland negotiated well but no tougher than others ; they are n't getting more either .
even in 2013 , the union 's per capita benefits for poland will be distinctly lower than the per capita benefits for spain .
poland is a large country , a very proud nation , that needs a certain amount of time to find its place and role in the european union .
people should show a little patience and not pillory a country that is encumbered by a formidable historic burden . still , the new members apparently have n't completed the homework that is a condition for receiving eu funds .
for example , corruption in the new member states , such as slovakia or the czech republic , is high .
how will you get that under control ? i ca n't dispute that a certain kind of corruption remains quite strong in these countries - in connection with large-scale privatization , for example .
-lrb- german interior minister -rrb- otto schily once said he thought that around 10 percent of the funds that went to eastern germany in the context of economic reconstruction were illegal .
i would n't estimate the magnitude to be so high for poland and the czech republic .
but it is a typical phenomenon . regarding homework , i would n't agree with your thesis .
on may 1 we will see that the new member countries will assume -lrb- eu -rrb- community law to 100 percent .
while in the old countries more than 2,000 legal actions are underway due to contract breaches , that is , due to the incomplete or completely inadequate application of community law . do you mean to say that the new acceding states are better prepared than earlier acceding states ? it 's safe to say that .

"
turkish films are securing a place in german cinemas now that producers have discovered a new target audience of german-turks .
far from being on the fringe , the films are making it into the nation 's biggest theaters . turkish films shown in germany have long conveyed a rather bleak view of the bosporus state .
they typically dealt with issues such as the kurdish conflict , the problems facing women , illiteracy , military dominance , and censorship .
but in recent years , that 's started to change .
following the success of yavuz turgul 's drama " eskiya , the bandit , " more and more popular turkish films have made it onto german movie screens , including those in the big multi-plex cinemas . whereas in the past , turks in germany had to wait months for a film showing in turkey to be released here , now it 's often only a matter of days separating release dates , making it easier for the turkish community to stay in touch with the zeitgeist in the bosporus . distributors making the trend two companies are leading the way in distribution .
warner attracted turkish and german audiences alike with films such as " propaganda , " " güle güle , " and " commissar shekspir . "
and then there 's maxximum film distribution , started by anil sahin , a former executive with the hamburg-based cinemaxx cinema group .
when he saw the potential of the turkish market , he immediately founded his own company . sahin 's first venture , " balalaika " in october 2001 proved to be a flop in german cinemas , so the businessman set about refining his marketing strategy .
turkish movie-goers proved to be loyal customers with a high level of attachment to the product .
the particular film being shown matters less to them than the movie-going experience . though warner had high box office numbers , it did n't make a huge profit , since it had falsely calculated the advertising budget .
maxximum , on the other hand , began collecting german " bogeys " - prizes for the highest number of screenings . " deli yürek " played in 150 cinemas in over 70 cities .
the final episode of the turkish cult soap " asmali konak " was the most successful title with 35 copies and over 220,000 viewers . maxximum productions run in other countries as well , for example austria , bulgaria and switzerland .
a few weeks ago , one of its films took third place in the dutch box office charts . here , the films are shown with german subtitles .
that does n't just help the handful of non-turkish audience members , it also helps to fill the gaps in the sometimes scanty knowledge of turkish among german-turks .
and surprisingly , any scenes containing swear words or naked skin have to be cut out of all the films shown in germany , as the target audience here is much more conservative than in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actor moritz bleibtreu .
the increasing level of german involvement in the turkish film industry could soon see the tables being turned , with german-turkish productions being exported back to the bosporus .
maxximum , for example , is planning to produce a vehicle for popular german actor moritz bleibtreu -lrb- photo -rrb- .
and in hamburg , a film called " süperseks " is in the works .
the comedy by a german director about a turkish sex hotline is being produced with german money - and it has a good chance of being successful in turkey . rambo and big happy families just how well these films reflect the realities of everyday turkish life can be left for viewers to decide .
" propaganda " and " vizontele , " for example , are filled with the kind of antics and buffoonery that are guaranteed to have even german audiences splitting their sides .
but while they portray turkey as a conflict-free , multi-ethnic society full of big happy families , the film " deli yürek " shows quite a different side .
the action flick takes its inspiration from the conflict in kurdistan , and presents it as a conspiracy between the cia and hizbollah that can only be resolved by a turkish version of rambo . possible superficialities aside , anil sahin deems the trend toward popular turkish cinema a positive one .
these colorful films convey a more positive image of turkey and help create a closer affiliation to europe .
but one of the superstars of turkish cinema sees things differently .
haluk bilgener welcomes the current hype , but he 's skeptical about the dominance of these so-called " popcorn films .

turkish films are securing a place in german cinemas now that producers have discovered a new target audience of german-turks .
far from being on the fringe , the films are making it into the nation 's biggest theaters . turkish films shown in germany have long conveyed a rather bleak view of the bosporus state .
they typically dealt with issues such as the kurdish conflict , the problems facing women , illiteracy , military dominance , and censorship .
but in recent years , that 's started to change .
following the success of yavuz turgul 's drama " eskiya , the bandit , " more and more popular turkish films have made it onto german movie screens , including those in the big multi-plex cinemas . whereas in the past , turks in germany had to wait months for a film showing in turkey to be released here , now it 's often only a matter of days separating release dates , making it easier for the turkish community to stay in touch with the zeitgeist in the bosporus . distributors making the trend two companies are leading the way in distribution .

when he saw the potential of the turkish market , he immediately founded his own company . sahin 's first venture , " balalaika " in october 2001 proved to be a flop in german cinemas , so the businessman set about refining his marketing strategy .
turkish movie-goers proved to be loyal customers with a high level of attachment to the product .
the particular film being shown matters less to them than the movie-going experience . though warner had high box office numbers , it did n't make a huge profit , since it had falsely calculated the advertising budget .
maxximum , on the other hand , began collecting german " bogeys " - prizes for the highest number of screenings . " deli yürek " played in 150 cinemas in over 70 cities .
the final episode of the turkish cult soap " asmali konak " was the most successful title with 35 copies and over 220,000 viewers . maxximum productions run in other countries as well , for example austria , bulgaria and switzerland .
a few weeks ago , one of its films took third place in the dutch box office charts . here , the films are shown with german subtitles .
that does n't just help the handful of non-turkish audience members , it also helps to fill the gaps in the sometimes scanty knowledge of turkish among german-turks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the new europe the eve of enlargement where is europe headed ? a final report card for new eu members getting the green light europe -pipe- 22.04.2004 verheugen : eu expansion brings peace and profit back to first page back 2/2 the economic differential between the countries of the old europe and many new members is huge .
lithuania and latvia , for example , will need decades to reach our economic level .
how can you ensure that economically a europe of two speeds does n't develop ? you could also ask why greece , an eu member for 30 years , has n't been able to reduce the distance to the rest of the eu - but still no one talks about a europe of two economic speeds .
what we see is a higher speed of growth in the new countries , and that 's good . people talk about 50 to 60 years for some of the new member countries . … but where 's the problem ?
it took a long time with ireland too .
for greece the distance from the average is still the same but in the meantime at a much higher level .
the most important thing is that the new member countries grow , and their growth potential is large .
incidentally , individual citizens ' or businesses ' rights to eu funds do n't arise from eu membership .
it 's not like it was with german unification .
unification has cost € 1.25 trillion so far .
in contrast , expansion can not put us in danger in terms of costs because the eu budget is club funds by nature .
the club ca n't spend one euro more than the members voluntarily put into the club funds . in negotiations with countries such as poland , people had the impression that they want to get the maximum out of europe and only contribute a little .
did that annoy you ? certainly not .
poland negotiated well but no tougher than others ; they are n't getting more either .
even in 2013 , the union 's per capita benefits for poland will be distinctly lower than the per capita benefits for spain .
poland is a large country , a very proud nation , that needs a certain amount of time to find its place and role in the european union .
people should show a little patience and not pillory a country that is encumbered by a formidable historic burden . still , the new members apparently have n't completed the homework that is a condition for receiving eu funds .
for example , corruption in the new member states , such as slovakia or the czech republic , is high .
how will you get that under control ? i ca n't dispute that a certain kind of corruption remains quite strong in these countries - in connection with large-scale privatization , for example .
-lrb- german interior minister -rrb- otto schily once said he thought that around 10 percent of the funds that went to eastern germany in the context of economic reconstruction were illegal .
i would n't estimate the magnitude to be so high for poland and the czech republic .
but it is a typical phenomenon . regarding homework , i would n't agree with your thesis .
on may 1 we will see that the new member countries will assume -lrb- eu -rrb- community law to 100 percent .
while in the old countries more than 2,000 legal actions are underway due to contract breaches , that is , due to the incomplete or completely inadequate application of community law . do you mean to say that the new acceding states are better prepared than earlier acceding states ? it 's safe to say that .
although we have much more extensive and complicated community legislation today .
now there 's much , much more to negotiate .
during earlier expansions , the commission was n't worried about whether the greeks , spanish or portuguese were also capable of applying community law .
this is an entirely new method that we first developed for this expansion . the balkan countries want to join the eu ; the accession of turkey , romania and bulgaria 's is planned for 2007 .
where do you think europe stops ? romania and bulgaria are part of the current round .
and then everything 's open .
the balkan countries do indeed have the prospect of joining , though there 's no schedule for them .
they are still too far away from national or regional stability or also from economic integration - with the exception of croatia , whose accession application has been submitted .
turkey is a special case .
it has had the prospect of joining since 1963 .
at the end of the year it will be decided whether turkey has in the meantime gotten far enough to start negotiations . for the eastern european countries , such as russia , ukraine , but also the caucasus countries or the southern mediterranean countries , membership is not on the agenda .
however , we offer these countries very far-ranging neighborhood policies . your time as expansion commissioner comes to an end on may 1 … correct , i have made myself redundant .
but do n't forget bulgaria , romania and turkey . what will you do afterwards ? i will remain a member of the -lrb- european -rrb- commission until november 1 .
beyond that nothing has been decided .
i have armed myself with great patience . gabriele feil interviewed günter verheugen for tagesschau.de -lrb- ncy -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de croatia inches closer to eu membership the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .

on may 1 , the eu will grow to a 25 member bloc of states .
dw-world content partner tagesschau.de spoke to günter verheugen , who has been responsible for designing the current round of eu expansion . günter verheugen is the eu executive 's commissioner for expansion .
german public broadcaster tagesschau.de spoke to verheugen about the fears , expectations and future of european union expansion . tagesschau.de : you are the architect of this eu expansion ; for years you 've been working toward may 1 , 2004 .
what does this day mean to you personally ? günter verheugen : gratification , relief - but also a very muted feeling of concern or trepidation .
it can be best compared with the feelings of a soccer trainer , who for the first time sees his team go play a match and asks himself whether they will all show what they have learned .
of course , i ask myself whether everything will work , if we really did do everything right , if we perhaps overlooked problems .
but my basic feeling is satisfaction for having created this large and meaningful peace project . many germans see it differently .
according to surveys every third german opposes eu expansion .
how do you explain this skepticism ? that 's very easy to explain .
as always when people are confronted by something that they do n't know well , they react with fear .
the problem is that there has n't been any sizable and broad political debate on this topic .
and that 's why expansion has n't really registered with people .
now that it 's directly imminent it has an enormous media presence : something 's coming , but what is it ?
the problems that citizens pinpoint in the context of the expansion - from cross-border criminality to competition problems - are very real .
it 's just that they have nothing to do with the impending expansion .
instead , they are the consequences of the collapse of the communist world of states , the fall of the iron curtain .
that 's why european integration is neither a part nor the origin of the problem , rather the reasonable , perhaps also the only , possible solution to the problem . even so , many people are afraid that businesses will export jobs to the low-wage countries in the eu 's new east ... they have already been doing that for a long time .
that will also continue , but it does n't have anything to do with the expansion either .
for , the result of the expansion is that these countries will not remain low-wage countries .
through their eu membership , the competitive situation in the old member states will improve .
from -lrb- the moment of -rrb- entry , the new members must assume our social standards , our environmental standards and our professional standards ; they must observe our competition and subsidy regulations .
that means that the cost advantages that they now have will decrease gradually .
the outsourcing or migration of production components is a process that we have been observing for 40 years .

german public broadcaster tagesschau.de spoke to verheugen about the fears , expectations and future of european union expansion . tagesschau.de : you are the architect of this eu expansion ; for years you 've been working toward may 1 , 2004 .
what does this day mean to you personally ? günter verheugen : gratification , relief - but also a very muted feeling of concern or trepidation .
it can be best compared with the feelings of a soccer trainer , who for the first time sees his team go play a match and asks himself whether they will all show what they have learned .
of course , i ask myself whether everything will work , if we really did do everything right , if we perhaps overlooked problems .
but my basic feeling is satisfaction for having created this large and meaningful peace project . many germans see it differently .
according to surveys every third german opposes eu expansion .
how do you explain this skepticism ? that 's very easy to explain .
as always when people are confronted by something that they do n't know well , they react with fear .
the problem is that there has n't been any sizable and broad political debate on this topic .
and that 's why expansion has n't really registered with people .
now that it 's directly imminent it has an enormous media presence : something 's coming , but what is it ?
the problems that citizens pinpoint in the context of the expansion - from cross-border criminality to competition problems - are very real .
it 's just that they have nothing to do with the impending expansion .
instead , they are the consequences of the collapse of the communist world of states , the fall of the iron curtain .
that 's why european integration is neither a part nor the origin of the problem , rather the reasonable , perhaps also the only , possible solution to the problem . even so , many people are afraid that businesses will export jobs to the low-wage countries in the eu 's new east ... they have already been doing that for a long time .
that will also continue , but it does n't have anything to do with the expansion either .
for , the result of the expansion is that these countries will not remain low-wage countries .
through their eu membership , the competitive situation in the old member states will improve .
from -lrb- the moment of -rrb- entry , the new members must assume our social standards , our environmental standards and our professional standards ; they must observe our competition and subsidy regulations .
that means that the cost advantages that they now have will decrease gradually .

on may 1 , the eu will grow to a 25 member bloc of states .
dw-world content partner tagesschau.de spoke to günter verheugen , who has been responsible for designing the current round of eu expansion . günter verheugen is the eu executive 's commissioner for expansion .
german public broadcaster tagesschau.de spoke to verheugen about the fears , expectations and future of european union expansion . tagesschau.de : you are the architect of this eu expansion ; for years you 've been working toward may 1 , 2004 .
what does this day mean to you personally ? günter verheugen : gratification , relief - but also a very muted feeling of concern or trepidation .
it can be best compared with the feelings of a soccer trainer , who for the first time sees his team go play a match and asks himself whether they will all show what they have learned .
of course , i ask myself whether everything will work , if we really did do everything right , if we perhaps overlooked problems .
but my basic feeling is satisfaction for having created this large and meaningful peace project . many germans see it differently .
according to surveys every third german opposes eu expansion .
how do you explain this skepticism ? that 's very easy to explain .
as always when people are confronted by something that they do n't know well , they react with fear .
the problem is that there has n't been any sizable and broad political debate on this topic .
and that 's why expansion has n't really registered with people .
now that it 's directly imminent it has an enormous media presence : something 's coming , but what is it ?
the problems that citizens pinpoint in the context of the expansion - from cross-border criminality to competition problems - are very real .
it 's just that they have nothing to do with the impending expansion .
instead , they are the consequences of the collapse of the communist world of states , the fall of the iron curtain .
that 's why european integration is neither a part nor the origin of the problem , rather the reasonable , perhaps also the only , possible solution to the problem . even so , many people are afraid that businesses will export jobs to the low-wage countries in the eu 's new east ... they have already been doing that for a long time .
that will also continue , but it does n't have anything to do with the expansion either .
for , the result of the expansion is that these countries will not remain low-wage countries .
through their eu membership , the competitive situation in the old member states will improve .
from -lrb- the moment of -rrb- entry , the new members must assume our social standards , our environmental standards and our professional standards ; they must observe our competition and subsidy regulations .
that means that the cost advantages that they now have will decrease gradually .
the outsourcing or migration of production components is a process that we have been observing for 40 years .
it is not a result of european integration but rather a result of economic globalization . what does the expansion offer germans ? in the first place , it 's a peace project .
it creates peace , stability , and safety in the region of europe that immediately borders germany .
people there have known for years what political , economic and financial results instability leads to .
german soldiers are in kosovo , german soldiers are in bosnia … in kosovo alone , for one million people , europe raised € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- to maintain the ceasefire .
peace pays off , after all .
as luxemburg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , said : a year of peace costs less than a day of war ! the second is an enormous economic profit - especially for germany .
it arises from -lrb- the fact -rrb- that this economic area will be populated after all by 110 million people , if we include romania and bulgaria , and everywhere here there is an immense unsatisfied demand .
we have very stabile , very robust growth rates in these countries , that are noticeably above the growth rates in the remainder of the eu .
the export-oriented german economy profits particularly from this quickly growing market . but initially the germans will have to dig deeper into their pockets for the expansion .
the european commission has demanded more money for it , more than € 37 billion will be pumped into the new countries in the coming years .
how can you make that appealing to the taxpayer ? the financing for this expansion round was already decided in berlin in 1999 .
we are spending around € 15 billion less than was then calculated and will get by with a total of € 40 billion until 2006 .
the new countries will pay € 15 billion of that themselves .
all in all , the expansion will cost germany a net total of € 2.5 billion in the first three years .
on the other hand , germany will have an enormous trade balance surplus .
that 's why viewed economically it 's a win-win situation .

on may 1 , the eu will grow to a 25 member bloc of states .
dw-world content partner tagesschau.de spoke to günter verheugen , who has been responsible for designing the current round of eu expansion . günter verheugen is the eu executive 's commissioner for expansion .
german public broadcaster tagesschau.de spoke to verheugen about the fears , expectations and future of european union expansion . tagesschau.de : you are the architect of this eu expansion ; for years you 've been working toward may 1 , 2004 .
what does this day mean to you personally ? günter verheugen : gratification , relief - but also a very muted feeling of concern or trepidation .
it can be best compared with the feelings of a soccer trainer , who for the first time sees his team go play a match and asks himself whether they will all show what they have learned .
of course , i ask myself whether everything will work , if we really did do everything right , if we perhaps overlooked problems .
but my basic feeling is satisfaction for having created this large and meaningful peace project . many germans see it differently .
according to surveys every third german opposes eu expansion .
how do you explain this skepticism ? that 's very easy to explain .
as always when people are confronted by something that they do n't know well , they react with fear .
the problem is that there has n't been any sizable and broad political debate on this topic .
and that 's why expansion has n't really registered with people .
now that it 's directly imminent it has an enormous media presence : something 's coming , but what is it ?
the problems that citizens pinpoint in the context of the expansion - from cross-border criminality to competition problems - are very real .
it 's just that they have nothing to do with the impending expansion .
instead , they are the consequences of the collapse of the communist world of states , the fall of the iron curtain .
that 's why european integration is neither a part nor the origin of the problem , rather the reasonable , perhaps also the only , possible solution to the problem . even so , many people are afraid that businesses will export jobs to the low-wage countries in the eu 's new east ... they have already been doing that for a long time .
that will also continue , but it does n't have anything to do with the expansion either .
for , the result of the expansion is that these countries will not remain low-wage countries .
through their eu membership , the competitive situation in the old member states will improve .
from -lrb- the moment of -rrb- entry , the new members must assume our social standards , our environmental standards and our professional standards ; they must observe our competition and subsidy regulations .
that means that the cost advantages that they now have will decrease gradually .
the outsourcing or migration of production components is a process that we have been observing for 40 years .
it is not a result of european integration but rather a result of economic globalization . what does the expansion offer germans ? in the first place , it 's a peace project .
it creates peace , stability , and safety in the region of europe that immediately borders germany .
people there have known for years what political , economic and financial results instability leads to .
german soldiers are in kosovo , german soldiers are in bosnia … in kosovo alone , for one million people , europe raised € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- to maintain the ceasefire .
peace pays off , after all .
as luxemburg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , said : a year of peace costs less than a day of war ! the second is an enormous economic profit - especially for germany .
it arises from -lrb- the fact -rrb- that this economic area will be populated after all by 110 million people , if we include romania and bulgaria , and everywhere here there is an immense unsatisfied demand .
we have very stabile , very robust growth rates in these countries , that are noticeably above the growth rates in the remainder of the eu .
the export-oriented german economy profits particularly from this quickly growing market . but initially the germans will have to dig deeper into their pockets for the expansion .
the european commission has demanded more money for it , more than € 37 billion will be pumped into the new countries in the coming years .
how can you make that appealing to the taxpayer ? the financing for this expansion round was already decided in berlin in 1999 .
we are spending around € 15 billion less than was then calculated and will get by with a total of € 40 billion until 2006 .
the new countries will pay € 15 billion of that themselves .
all in all , the expansion will cost germany a net total of € 2.5 billion in the first three years .
on the other hand , germany will have an enormous trade balance surplus .
that 's why viewed economically it 's a win-win situation .
it makes no sense to say that the expansion will lead to an additional burden for the germans . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de croatia inches closer to eu membership the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .

it can be best compared with the feelings of a soccer trainer , who for the first time sees his team go play a match and asks himself whether they will all show what they have learned .
of course , i ask myself whether everything will work , if we really did do everything right , if we perhaps overlooked problems .
but my basic feeling is satisfaction for having created this large and meaningful peace project . many germans see it differently .
according to surveys every third german opposes eu expansion .
how do you explain this skepticism ? that 's very easy to explain .
as always when people are confronted by something that they do n't know well , they react with fear .
the problem is that there has n't been any sizable and broad political debate on this topic .
and that 's why expansion has n't really registered with people .
now that it 's directly imminent it has an enormous media presence : something 's coming , but what is it ?
the problems that citizens pinpoint in the context of the expansion - from cross-border criminality to competition problems - are very real .
it 's just that they have nothing to do with the impending expansion .
instead , they are the consequences of the collapse of the communist world of states , the fall of the iron curtain .
that 's why european integration is neither a part nor the origin of the problem , rather the reasonable , perhaps also the only , possible solution to the problem . even so , many people are afraid that businesses will export jobs to the low-wage countries in the eu 's new east ... they have already been doing that for a long time .
that will also continue , but it does n't have anything to do with the expansion either .
for , the result of the expansion is that these countries will not remain low-wage countries .
through their eu membership , the competitive situation in the old member states will improve .
from -lrb- the moment of -rrb- entry , the new members must assume our social standards , our environmental standards and our professional standards ; they must observe our competition and subsidy regulations .
that means that the cost advantages that they now have will decrease gradually .
the outsourcing or migration of production components is a process that we have been observing for 40 years .
it is not a result of european integration but rather a result of economic globalization . what does the expansion offer germans ? in the first place , it 's a peace project .
it creates peace , stability , and safety in the region of europe that immediately borders germany .
people there have known for years what political , economic and financial results instability leads to .
german soldiers are in kosovo , german soldiers are in bosnia … in kosovo alone , for one million people , europe raised € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- to maintain the ceasefire .
peace pays off , after all .
as luxemburg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , said : a year of peace costs less than a day of war ! the second is an enormous economic profit - especially for germany .
it arises from -lrb- the fact -rrb- that this economic area will be populated after all by 110 million people , if we include romania and bulgaria , and everywhere here there is an immense unsatisfied demand .
we have very stabile , very robust growth rates in these countries , that are noticeably above the growth rates in the remainder of the eu .
the export-oriented german economy profits particularly from this quickly growing market . but initially the germans will have to dig deeper into their pockets for the expansion .
the european commission has demanded more money for it , more than € 37 billion will be pumped into the new countries in the coming years .
how can you make that appealing to the taxpayer ? the financing for this expansion round was already decided in berlin in 1999 .
we are spending around € 15 billion less than was then calculated and will get by with a total of € 40 billion until 2006 .
the new countries will pay € 15 billion of that themselves .
all in all , the expansion will cost germany a net total of € 2.5 billion in the first three years .
on the other hand , germany will have an enormous trade balance surplus .
that 's why viewed economically it 's a win-win situation .
it makes no sense to say that the expansion will lead to an additional burden for the germans . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de croatia inches closer to eu membership the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .
although a start date for accession talks wo n't be confirmed until june , the former yugoslav republic is already en-route to home base .

the german government legalized prostitution two years ago , but many sex workers remain reluctant to register with authorities as they continue to experience discrimination , a new study has revealed . sex is big business in germany .
with some 400,000 prostitutes and an annual 1.2 million men who use their services , the yearly turnover has hit a massive € 14 billion -lrb- $ 16.5 billion -rrb- .
but paid sex can be a nasty business .
two years ago the german government introduced a new prostitution law in what was an earnest attempt to protect prostitutes ' working conditions and even offer them some protection against violence and exploitation .
there is even scope for girls on the game to join a union , but that has proved to be something that few have taken advantage of .
at a loss to understand the reluctance among the country 's sex work force to become unionized , the services trade union verdi commissioned hamburg-based social scientist emilija mitrovic to find out why .
mitrovic , who is due to publish the results of her study at the end of the month , has spent a lot of time travelling across germany , talking with prostitutes , brothel owners , police officers and social workers in a bid to find out what difference the new law has made to prostitutes . " the desired effect of the law was to create a better social situation for prostitutes , to do away with the immoral stigma attached to their work , to give them the right to sue for unpaid fees , and make health insurance and social security payments , " mitrovic told deutsche welle . continued discrimination her study , which examined the varying consequences of the law in different cities and states across germany , revealed that the majority of prostitutes in germany still prefer to do the job secretly , because although prostitution is officially legal , sex workers still experience discrimination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a prostitute in frankfurt mitrovic also discovered that women are often put in unnecessarily dangerous situations as a result of arbitrary rules that dictate exactly where they are allowed to tout for business .
these are often dark and dead industrial areas , where the women are far more vulnerable to violence . on top of this , the study showed discrimination from most of germany 's federal job agencies , who will neither broker jobs in the sex industry nor offer retraining .
and even health insurance companies do n't offer any kind of special health provisions for prostitutes . verdi is prepared to fight the exploitation of sex workers , but so far , the union has failed to come up with any concrete solutions .
however , at a conference on the subject of prostitution at the end of april , they will present a sample contract for sex workers . mitrovic believes this is a step forward .
" the contract would regulate holiday pay , sick pay and something very special , namely medical examinations during work time , " she said .
" the contract would also ensure women a fixed income which could be transferred to their bank accounts . " it 's all well and good in theory , but just how likely are the brothel owners and managers to go along with it ?
mitrovic is optimistic and has already found one brothel manager who wants to try out the contract , and who also wants to employ immigrants , and who is looking for legal ways to do this . law does n't apply to all one of the problems with the new prostitution law is that it does nothing to help foreign prostitutes , who constitute almost half of germany sex workers , who do n't have a legal work permit .
without it , they ca n't report ill treatment or exploitation to the police unless they want to run the high risk of subsequent deportation . the sad reality of prostitution in germany is that despite the new law , most prostitutes still work under very poor conditions .
the majority of the money they earn is taken away from them by pimps and landlords and , for those who are trying to work by the book , from the tax office as well . perhaps the biggest problem for prostitutes here is still the way they are treated socially .
on the one hand paid sex is considered a part of 21st century life , but very few women are actually prepared to come out and admit that is what they do . as far as mitrovic is concerned , prostitution wo n't shed its criminal stigma until the pimps put up their hands and confess that they are making money from selling sex , and that it is a socially acceptable thing to do . udo taubitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stolen youth : child prostitution plagues german-czech border the united nations children 's agency says child prostitution is rising across the german border in the czech republic .

" the desired effect of the law was to create a better social situation for prostitutes , to do away with the immoral stigma attached to their work , to give them the right to sue for unpaid fees , and make health insurance and social security payments , " mitrovic told deutsche welle . continued discrimination her study , which examined the varying consequences of the law in different cities and states across germany , revealed that the majority of prostitutes in germany still prefer to do the job secretly , because although prostitution is officially legal , sex workers still experience discrimination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a prostitute in frankfurt mitrovic also discovered that women are often put in unnecessarily dangerous situations as a result of arbitrary rules that dictate exactly where they are allowed to tout for business .
these are often dark and dead industrial areas , where the women are far more vulnerable to violence . on top of this , the study showed discrimination from most of germany 's federal job agencies , who will neither broker jobs in the sex industry nor offer retraining .
and even health insurance companies do n't offer any kind of special health provisions for prostitutes . verdi is prepared to fight the exploitation of sex workers , but so far , the union has failed to come up with any concrete solutions .
however , at a conference on the subject of prostitution at the end of april , they will present a sample contract for sex workers . mitrovic believes this is a step forward .
" the contract would regulate holiday pay , sick pay and something very special , namely medical examinations during work time , " she said .
" the contract would also ensure women a fixed income which could be transferred to their bank accounts . " it 's all well and good in theory , but just how likely are the brothel owners and managers to go along with it ?
mitrovic is optimistic and has already found one brothel manager who wants to try out the contract , and who also wants to employ immigrants , and who is looking for legal ways to do this . law does n't apply to all one of the problems with the new prostitution law is that it does nothing to help foreign prostitutes , who constitute almost half of germany sex workers , who do n't have a legal work permit .

" novartis shares were down 2.4 percent to 57.35 swiss francs -lrb- us $ 43.64 -rrb- in early trading on the zurich exchange following the announcement , and aventis shares rose 2.7 percent to € 64.45 -lrb- us $ 76.53 -rrb- in early paris trading . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis posts profits to ward off hostile takeover bid the french-german pharmaceutical company aventis announced growing profits for 2003 in an effort to ward off a hostile takeover bid from a smaller french drug firm .

joschka fischer will wrap up his trip to the caucasus region on thursday with stops in armenia and georgia .
his visit in armenia comes during considerable political instability in the country . following visits to afghanistan and azerbaijan , germany 's fischer continued his week-long trip abroad by arriving in the armenian capital yerevan on thursday morning .
as he did in azerbaijan , he is expected to encourage both southern caucasus nations to continue to improve their democratic and human rights credentials by holding out the prospect of closer ties to the european union . fischer will need plenty of diplomatic tact in yerevan , since armenian president robert kocharian is under increasing pressure to step down .
on wednesday , opposition groups held a protest rally that attracted an estimated 10,000 people , according to the associated press .
opposition groups allege kocharian won reelection last year only through widespread election fraud , a charge which the president denies . tensions in the country rose on april 13 , when police used force to break up a protest rally .
around 100 people were reportedly detained and several protestors were injured .
" any administration relying on violence is doomed .
kocharian must go , " said stepan demirchyan , leader of the opposition justice party and runner-up in last year 's presidential election , according to the reuters news agency . kocharian 's opponents hope to oust him though continued popular unrest , similar to how neighboring georgia toppled the government of former president eduard shevardnadze late last year .
but some experts are skeptical kocharian will be removed from power . " the armenian authorities are better consolidated and will defend their position more strongly .
moreover , there 's no clear leader of the opposition like there was in georgia , " andranik migranyan told dw-radio . conflict with azerbaijan while in yerevan , fischer will also address the dispute over the nagorno-karabakh region , which though part of azerbaijan has been separated from the country since the mid-1990s after a war with ethnic armenians .
a cease-fire in the conflict was signed in 1994 , but the final status of nagorno-karabakh has not been resolved .
in the azerbaijani capital baku on wednesday , fischer already said germany and the eu were prepared to help find a solution to the conflict . fischer 's visit to armenia will also include a memorial for armenians killed by turks in 1915 .
the armenians claim ottoman turkish forces committed genocide at the time , slaughtering some 1.5 million people between 1915 and 1923 .
turkey rejects the charges , saying the armenians were killed in a partisan war as the ottoman empire collapsed . heading to tbilisi later in the day , fischer will meet with georgian president mikhail saakashvili to show support for his western oriented reform course .
saakashvili came to power in a bloodless coup that ousted shevardnadze in november , but he has run into trouble recently , as military commanders in the rebellious black sea province of adzhara refuse to follow the orders of the central government . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rebuilding afghanistan and setting an example for iraq during his visit to afghanistan on tuesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer praised the work of german troops and said the reconstruction effort there should serve as a role model to iraq .

joschka fischer will wrap up his trip to the caucasus region on thursday with stops in armenia and georgia .
his visit in armenia comes during considerable political instability in the country . following visits to afghanistan and azerbaijan , germany 's fischer continued his week-long trip abroad by arriving in the armenian capital yerevan on thursday morning .
as he did in azerbaijan , he is expected to encourage both southern caucasus nations to continue to improve their democratic and human rights credentials by holding out the prospect of closer ties to the european union . fischer will need plenty of diplomatic tact in yerevan , since armenian president robert kocharian is under increasing pressure to step down .
on wednesday , opposition groups held a protest rally that attracted an estimated 10,000 people , according to the associated press .
opposition groups allege kocharian won reelection last year only through widespread election fraud , a charge which the president denies . tensions in the country rose on april 13 , when police used force to break up a protest rally .
around 100 people were reportedly detained and several protestors were injured .
" any administration relying on violence is doomed .
kocharian must go , " said stepan demirchyan , leader of the opposition justice party and runner-up in last year 's presidential election , according to the reuters news agency . kocharian 's opponents hope to oust him though continued popular unrest , similar to how neighboring georgia toppled the government of former president eduard shevardnadze late last year .
but some experts are skeptical kocharian will be removed from power . " the armenian authorities are better consolidated and will defend their position more strongly .
moreover , there 's no clear leader of the opposition like there was in georgia , " andranik migranyan told dw-radio . conflict with azerbaijan while in yerevan , fischer will also address the dispute over the nagorno-karabakh region , which though part of azerbaijan has been separated from the country since the mid-1990s after a war with ethnic armenians .
a cease-fire in the conflict was signed in 1994 , but the final status of nagorno-karabakh has not been resolved .
in the azerbaijani capital baku on wednesday , fischer already said germany and the eu were prepared to help find a solution to the conflict . fischer 's visit to armenia will also include a memorial for armenians killed by turks in 1915 .

lithuania and latvia , for example , will need decades to reach our economic level .
how can you ensure that economically a europe of two speeds does n't develop ? you could also ask why greece , an eu member for 30 years , has n't been able to reduce the distance to the rest of the eu - but still no one talks about a europe of two economic speeds .
what we see is a higher speed of growth in the new countries , and that 's good . people talk about 50 to 60 years for some of the new member countries . … but where 's the problem ?
it took a long time with ireland too .
for greece the distance from the average is still the same but in the meantime at a much higher level .
the most important thing is that the new member countries grow , and their growth potential is large .
incidentally , individual citizens ' or businesses ' rights to eu funds do n't arise from eu membership .
it 's not like it was with german unification .
unification has cost € 1.25 trillion so far .
in contrast , expansion can not put us in danger in terms of costs because the eu budget is club funds by nature .
the club ca n't spend one euro more than the members voluntarily put into the club funds . in negotiations with countries such as poland , people had the impression that they want to get the maximum out of europe and only contribute a little .
did that annoy you ? certainly not .
poland negotiated well but no tougher than others ; they are n't getting more either .
even in 2013 , the union 's per capita benefits for poland will be distinctly lower than the per capita benefits for spain .
poland is a large country , a very proud nation , that needs a certain amount of time to find its place and role in the european union .
people should show a little patience and not pillory a country that is encumbered by a formidable historic burden . still , the new members apparently have n't completed the homework that is a condition for receiving eu funds .
for example , corruption in the new member states , such as slovakia or the czech republic , is high .
how will you get that under control ? i ca n't dispute that a certain kind of corruption remains quite strong in these countries - in connection with large-scale privatization , for example .
-lrb- german interior minister -rrb- otto schily once said he thought that around 10 percent of the funds that went to eastern germany in the context of economic reconstruction were illegal .
i would n't estimate the magnitude to be so high for poland and the czech republic .
but it is a typical phenomenon . regarding homework , i would n't agree with your thesis .
on may 1 we will see that the new member countries will assume -lrb- eu -rrb- community law to 100 percent .
while in the old countries more than 2,000 legal actions are underway due to contract breaches , that is , due to the incomplete or completely inadequate application of community law . do you mean to say that the new acceding states are better prepared than earlier acceding states ? it 's safe to say that .
although we have much more extensive and complicated community legislation today .
now there 's much , much more to negotiate .
during earlier expansions , the commission was n't worried about whether the greeks , spanish or portuguese were also capable of applying community law .
this is an entirely new method that we first developed for this expansion . the balkan countries want to join the eu ; the accession of turkey , romania and bulgaria 's is planned for 2007 .
where do you think europe stops ? romania and bulgaria are part of the current round .
and then everything 's open .
the balkan countries do indeed have the prospect of joining , though there 's no schedule for them .
they are still too far away from national or regional stability or also from economic integration - with the exception of croatia , whose accession application has been submitted .
turkey is a special case .
it has had the prospect of joining since 1963 .
at the end of the year it will be decided whether turkey has in the meantime gotten far enough to start negotiations . for the eastern european countries , such as russia , ukraine , but also the caucasus countries or the southern mediterranean countries , membership is not on the agenda .
however , we offer these countries very far-ranging neighborhood policies . your time as expansion commissioner comes to an end on may 1 … correct , i have made myself redundant .
but do n't forget bulgaria , romania and turkey . what will you do afterwards ? i will remain a member of the -lrb- european -rrb- commission until november 1 .

on may 1 , the eu will grow to a 25 member bloc of states .
dw-world content partner tagesschau.de spoke to günter verheugen , who has been responsible for designing the current round of eu expansion . günter verheugen is the eu executive 's commissioner for expansion .
german public broadcaster tagesschau.de spoke to verheugen about the fears , expectations and future of european union expansion . tagesschau.de : you are the architect of this eu expansion ; for years you 've been working toward may 1 , 2004 .
what does this day mean to you personally ? günter verheugen : gratification , relief - but also a very muted feeling of concern or trepidation .
it can be best compared with the feelings of a soccer trainer , who for the first time sees his team go play a match and asks himself whether they will all show what they have learned .
of course , i ask myself whether everything will work , if we really did do everything right , if we perhaps overlooked problems .
but my basic feeling is satisfaction for having created this large and meaningful peace project . many germans see it differently .
according to surveys every third german opposes eu expansion .
how do you explain this skepticism ? that 's very easy to explain .
as always when people are confronted by something that they do n't know well , they react with fear .
the problem is that there has n't been any sizable and broad political debate on this topic .
and that 's why expansion has n't really registered with people .
now that it 's directly imminent it has an enormous media presence : something 's coming , but what is it ?
the problems that citizens pinpoint in the context of the expansion - from cross-border criminality to competition problems - are very real .
it 's just that they have nothing to do with the impending expansion .
instead , they are the consequences of the collapse of the communist world of states , the fall of the iron curtain .
that 's why european integration is neither a part nor the origin of the problem , rather the reasonable , perhaps also the only , possible solution to the problem . even so , many people are afraid that businesses will export jobs to the low-wage countries in the eu 's new east ... they have already been doing that for a long time .
that will also continue , but it does n't have anything to do with the expansion either .
for , the result of the expansion is that these countries will not remain low-wage countries .
through their eu membership , the competitive situation in the old member states will improve .
from -lrb- the moment of -rrb- entry , the new members must assume our social standards , our environmental standards and our professional standards ; they must observe our competition and subsidy regulations .
that means that the cost advantages that they now have will decrease gradually .
the outsourcing or migration of production components is a process that we have been observing for 40 years .
it is not a result of european integration but rather a result of economic globalization . what does the expansion offer germans ? in the first place , it 's a peace project .
it creates peace , stability , and safety in the region of europe that immediately borders germany .
people there have known for years what political , economic and financial results instability leads to .
german soldiers are in kosovo , german soldiers are in bosnia … in kosovo alone , for one million people , europe raised € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- to maintain the ceasefire .
peace pays off , after all .
as luxemburg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , said : a year of peace costs less than a day of war ! the second is an enormous economic profit - especially for germany .

swiss pharmaceutical giant novartis said on thursday it would enter merger talks with france 's aventis , possibly preventing a bid by rival sanofi-synthelabo which is backed by the french government . basel-based novartis said it would begin negotiations with aventis despite previous reservations about interference by government officials in paris , who have made clear they would prefer an all-french linkup with sanofi-synthelabo .
if successful , the merged novartis-aventis would create the world 's second-largest pharmaceutical firm after the u.s.-based pfizer . a spokesman for aventis , which itself was created from a merger of france 's rhone-poulenc and germany 's hoechst in 2000 , said the company was pleased by novartis ' willingness to negotiate , but remained cautious about the final outcome of the talks . " we welcome this decision , -lsb- but -rsb- no assurances can be given that an agreement can be reached , " spokesman tony rodham told the associated press .
aventis 's board invited novartis to enter talks three weeks ago . the announcement strengthens aventis ' hand in its attempt to fend off a hostile bid from much smaller french rival sanofi-synthelabo , which has offered to pay € 45 billion -lrb- $ 53.2 billion -rrb- for the company .
that encouraged novartis to get involved , but the swiss were then put off by comments from french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , who said he would prefer a french-only merger in order to help protect the country 's national interests . " we 're not at the endgame here yet , " richard jarvis , a pharmaceutical analyst at pictet & cie in london , told bloomberg news .
" the french government has n't changed their position and novartis is keen to try and persuade them .
it 's not completely in their hands and it is n't just in the hands of aventis shareholders at present . " aventis sees risks with sanofi however , since aventis has shown no interest in merging with sanofi-synthelabo and the french government would have to justify blocking any deal to the european union , novartis now appears ready to risk rankling paris . " a combination with aventis has a very convincing industrial logic .
it creates value and it addresses the legitimate concerns of the french government , " novartis chief financial officer raymond breu told reporters on thursday . strasbourg-based aventis has said novartis would be a much stronger partner than sanofi , which faces possible patent challenges to some of its more important drugs such as its plavix blood-thinner . although half the size of it 's competitor , sanofi is asking for a 100 percent takeover of aventis and demanding 50 percent of aventis shares and voting rights - a bold move that sanofi is able to make because of aventis ' currently weaker financial position . unions opposed novartis would protect aventis from sanofi , but the firm 's unions are opposed to a merger with the swiss and on thursday showed they would not shy away from using concerns about france 's national interest to try and hinder a deal . bloomberg reported that the unions sent a letter to french finance minister nicolas sarkozy , saying an aventis novartis merger would mean " france would have to give up its independence on products as crucial as vaccines and antibiotics , not to speak of the industrial and research sacrifice . " novartis shares were down 2.4 percent to 57.35 swiss francs -lrb- us $ 43.64 -rrb- in early trading on the zurich exchange following the announcement , and aventis shares rose 2.7 percent to € 64.45 -lrb- us $ 76.53 -rrb- in early paris trading . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis posts profits to ward off hostile takeover bid the french-german pharmaceutical company aventis announced growing profits for 2003 in an effort to ward off a hostile takeover bid from a smaller french drug firm .

german public broadcaster tagesschau.de spoke to verheugen about the fears , expectations and future of european union expansion . tagesschau.de : you are the architect of this eu expansion ; for years you 've been working toward may 1 , 2004 .
what does this day mean to you personally ? günter verheugen : gratification , relief - but also a very muted feeling of concern or trepidation .
it can be best compared with the feelings of a soccer trainer , who for the first time sees his team go play a match and asks himself whether they will all show what they have learned .
of course , i ask myself whether everything will work , if we really did do everything right , if we perhaps overlooked problems .
but my basic feeling is satisfaction for having created this large and meaningful peace project . many germans see it differently .
according to surveys every third german opposes eu expansion .
how do you explain this skepticism ? that 's very easy to explain .
as always when people are confronted by something that they do n't know well , they react with fear .
the problem is that there has n't been any sizable and broad political debate on this topic .
and that 's why expansion has n't really registered with people .
now that it 's directly imminent it has an enormous media presence : something 's coming , but what is it ?
the problems that citizens pinpoint in the context of the expansion - from cross-border criminality to competition problems - are very real .
it 's just that they have nothing to do with the impending expansion .
instead , they are the consequences of the collapse of the communist world of states , the fall of the iron curtain .
that 's why european integration is neither a part nor the origin of the problem , rather the reasonable , perhaps also the only , possible solution to the problem . even so , many people are afraid that businesses will export jobs to the low-wage countries in the eu 's new east ... they have already been doing that for a long time .
that will also continue , but it does n't have anything to do with the expansion either .
for , the result of the expansion is that these countries will not remain low-wage countries .
through their eu membership , the competitive situation in the old member states will improve .
from -lrb- the moment of -rrb- entry , the new members must assume our social standards , our environmental standards and our professional standards ; they must observe our competition and subsidy regulations .
that means that the cost advantages that they now have will decrease gradually .
the outsourcing or migration of production components is a process that we have been observing for 40 years .
it is not a result of european integration but rather a result of economic globalization . what does the expansion offer germans ? in the first place , it 's a peace project .
it creates peace , stability , and safety in the region of europe that immediately borders germany .
people there have known for years what political , economic and financial results instability leads to .
german soldiers are in kosovo , german soldiers are in bosnia … in kosovo alone , for one million people , europe raised € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- to maintain the ceasefire .
peace pays off , after all .
as luxemburg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , said : a year of peace costs less than a day of war ! the second is an enormous economic profit - especially for germany .
it arises from -lrb- the fact -rrb- that this economic area will be populated after all by 110 million people , if we include romania and bulgaria , and everywhere here there is an immense unsatisfied demand .
we have very stabile , very robust growth rates in these countries , that are noticeably above the growth rates in the remainder of the eu .
the export-oriented german economy profits particularly from this quickly growing market . but initially the germans will have to dig deeper into their pockets for the expansion .
the european commission has demanded more money for it , more than € 37 billion will be pumped into the new countries in the coming years .
how can you make that appealing to the taxpayer ? the financing for this expansion round was already decided in berlin in 1999 .
we are spending around € 15 billion less than was then calculated and will get by with a total of € 40 billion until 2006 .
the new countries will pay € 15 billion of that themselves .
all in all , the expansion will cost germany a net total of € 2.5 billion in the first three years .
on the other hand , germany will have an enormous trade balance surplus .
that 's why viewed economically it 's a win-win situation .

on may 1 , the eu will grow to a 25 member bloc of states .
dw-world content partner tagesschau.de spoke to günter verheugen , who has been responsible for designing the current round of eu expansion . günter verheugen is the eu executive 's commissioner for expansion .
german public broadcaster tagesschau.de spoke to verheugen about the fears , expectations and future of european union expansion . tagesschau.de : you are the architect of this eu expansion ; for years you 've been working toward may 1 , 2004 .
what does this day mean to you personally ? günter verheugen : gratification , relief - but also a very muted feeling of concern or trepidation .
it can be best compared with the feelings of a soccer trainer , who for the first time sees his team go play a match and asks himself whether they will all show what they have learned .
of course , i ask myself whether everything will work , if we really did do everything right , if we perhaps overlooked problems .
but my basic feeling is satisfaction for having created this large and meaningful peace project . many germans see it differently .
according to surveys every third german opposes eu expansion .
how do you explain this skepticism ? that 's very easy to explain .
as always when people are confronted by something that they do n't know well , they react with fear .
the problem is that there has n't been any sizable and broad political debate on this topic .
and that 's why expansion has n't really registered with people .
now that it 's directly imminent it has an enormous media presence : something 's coming , but what is it ?
the problems that citizens pinpoint in the context of the expansion - from cross-border criminality to competition problems - are very real .
it 's just that they have nothing to do with the impending expansion .
instead , they are the consequences of the collapse of the communist world of states , the fall of the iron curtain .
that 's why european integration is neither a part nor the origin of the problem , rather the reasonable , perhaps also the only , possible solution to the problem . even so , many people are afraid that businesses will export jobs to the low-wage countries in the eu 's new east ... they have already been doing that for a long time .
that will also continue , but it does n't have anything to do with the expansion either .
for , the result of the expansion is that these countries will not remain low-wage countries .
through their eu membership , the competitive situation in the old member states will improve .
from -lrb- the moment of -rrb- entry , the new members must assume our social standards , our environmental standards and our professional standards ; they must observe our competition and subsidy regulations .
that means that the cost advantages that they now have will decrease gradually .
the outsourcing or migration of production components is a process that we have been observing for 40 years .
it is not a result of european integration but rather a result of economic globalization . what does the expansion offer germans ? in the first place , it 's a peace project .

swiss pharmaceutical giant novartis said on thursday it would enter merger talks with france 's aventis , possibly preventing a bid by rival sanofi-synthelabo which is backed by the french government . basel-based novartis said it would begin negotiations with aventis despite previous reservations about interference by government officials in paris , who have made clear they would prefer an all-french linkup with sanofi-synthelabo .
if successful , the merged novartis-aventis would create the world 's second-largest pharmaceutical firm after the u.s.-based pfizer . a spokesman for aventis , which itself was created from a merger of france 's rhone-poulenc and germany 's hoechst in 2000 , said the company was pleased by novartis ' willingness to negotiate , but remained cautious about the final outcome of the talks . " we welcome this decision , -lsb- but -rsb- no assurances can be given that an agreement can be reached , " spokesman tony rodham told the associated press .
aventis 's board invited novartis to enter talks three weeks ago . the announcement strengthens aventis ' hand in its attempt to fend off a hostile bid from much smaller french rival sanofi-synthelabo , which has offered to pay € 45 billion -lrb- $ 53.2 billion -rrb- for the company .
that encouraged novartis to get involved , but the swiss were then put off by comments from french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , who said he would prefer a french-only merger in order to help protect the country 's national interests . " we 're not at the endgame here yet , " richard jarvis , a pharmaceutical analyst at pictet & cie in london , told bloomberg news .
" the french government has n't changed their position and novartis is keen to try and persuade them .
it 's not completely in their hands and it is n't just in the hands of aventis shareholders at present . " aventis sees risks with sanofi however , since aventis has shown no interest in merging with sanofi-synthelabo and the french government would have to justify blocking any deal to the european union , novartis now appears ready to risk rankling paris . " a combination with aventis has a very convincing industrial logic .
it creates value and it addresses the legitimate concerns of the french government , " novartis chief financial officer raymond breu told reporters on thursday . strasbourg-based aventis has said novartis would be a much stronger partner than sanofi , which faces possible patent challenges to some of its more important drugs such as its plavix blood-thinner . although half the size of it 's competitor , sanofi is asking for a 100 percent takeover of aventis and demanding 50 percent of aventis shares and voting rights - a bold move that sanofi is able to make because of aventis ' currently weaker financial position . unions opposed novartis would protect aventis from sanofi , but the firm 's unions are opposed to a merger with the swiss and on thursday showed they would not shy away from using concerns about france 's national interest to try and hinder a deal . bloomberg reported that the unions sent a letter to french finance minister nicolas sarkozy , saying an aventis novartis merger would mean " france would have to give up its independence on products as crucial as vaccines and antibiotics , not to speak of the industrial and research sacrifice . " novartis shares were down 2.4 percent to 57.35 swiss francs -lrb- us $ 43.64 -rrb- in early trading on the zurich exchange following the announcement , and aventis shares rose 2.7 percent to € 64.45 -lrb- us $ 76.53 -rrb- in early paris trading . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis posts profits to ward off hostile takeover bid the french-german pharmaceutical company aventis announced growing profits for 2003 in an effort to ward off a hostile takeover bid from a smaller french drug firm .

" we welcome this decision , -lsb- but -rsb- no assurances can be given that an agreement can be reached , " spokesman tony rodham told the associated press .
aventis 's board invited novartis to enter talks three weeks ago . the announcement strengthens aventis ' hand in its attempt to fend off a hostile bid from much smaller french rival sanofi-synthelabo , which has offered to pay € 45 billion -lrb- $ 53.2 billion -rrb- for the company .
that encouraged novartis to get involved , but the swiss were then put off by comments from french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , who said he would prefer a french-only merger in order to help protect the country 's national interests . " we 're not at the endgame here yet , " richard jarvis , a pharmaceutical analyst at pictet & cie in london , told bloomberg news .
" the french government has n't changed their position and novartis is keen to try and persuade them .
it 's not completely in their hands and it is n't just in the hands of aventis shareholders at present . " aventis sees risks with sanofi however , since aventis has shown no interest in merging with sanofi-synthelabo and the french government would have to justify blocking any deal to the european union , novartis now appears ready to risk rankling paris . " a combination with aventis has a very convincing industrial logic .
it creates value and it addresses the legitimate concerns of the french government , " novartis chief financial officer raymond breu told reporters on thursday . strasbourg-based aventis has said novartis would be a much stronger partner than sanofi , which faces possible patent challenges to some of its more important drugs such as its plavix blood-thinner . although half the size of it 's competitor , sanofi is asking for a 100 percent takeover of aventis and demanding 50 percent of aventis shares and voting rights - a bold move that sanofi is able to make because of aventis ' currently weaker financial position . unions opposed novartis would protect aventis from sanofi , but the firm 's unions are opposed to a merger with the swiss and on thursday showed they would not shy away from using concerns about france 's national interest to try and hinder a deal . bloomberg reported that the unions sent a letter to french finance minister nicolas sarkozy , saying an aventis novartis merger would mean " france would have to give up its independence on products as crucial as vaccines and antibiotics , not to speak of the industrial and research sacrifice . " novartis shares were down 2.4 percent to 57.35 swiss francs -lrb- us $ 43.64 -rrb- in early trading on the zurich exchange following the announcement , and aventis shares rose 2.7 percent to € 64.45 -lrb- us $ 76.53 -rrb- in early paris trading . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis posts profits to ward off hostile takeover bid the french-german pharmaceutical company aventis announced growing profits for 2003 in an effort to ward off a hostile takeover bid from a smaller french drug firm .

the german government legalized prostitution two years ago , but many sex workers remain reluctant to register with authorities as they continue to experience discrimination , a new study has revealed . sex is big business in germany .
with some 400,000 prostitutes and an annual 1.2 million men who use their services , the yearly turnover has hit a massive € 14 billion -lrb- $ 16.5 billion -rrb- .
but paid sex can be a nasty business .
two years ago the german government introduced a new prostitution law in what was an earnest attempt to protect prostitutes ' working conditions and even offer them some protection against violence and exploitation .
there is even scope for girls on the game to join a union , but that has proved to be something that few have taken advantage of .
at a loss to understand the reluctance among the country 's sex work force to become unionized , the services trade union verdi commissioned hamburg-based social scientist emilija mitrovic to find out why .
mitrovic , who is due to publish the results of her study at the end of the month , has spent a lot of time travelling across germany , talking with prostitutes , brothel owners , police officers and social workers in a bid to find out what difference the new law has made to prostitutes . " the desired effect of the law was to create a better social situation for prostitutes , to do away with the immoral stigma attached to their work , to give them the right to sue for unpaid fees , and make health insurance and social security payments , " mitrovic told deutsche welle . continued discrimination her study , which examined the varying consequences of the law in different cities and states across germany , revealed that the majority of prostitutes in germany still prefer to do the job secretly , because although prostitution is officially legal , sex workers still experience discrimination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a prostitute in frankfurt mitrovic also discovered that women are often put in unnecessarily dangerous situations as a result of arbitrary rules that dictate exactly where they are allowed to tout for business .
these are often dark and dead industrial areas , where the women are far more vulnerable to violence . on top of this , the study showed discrimination from most of germany 's federal job agencies , who will neither broker jobs in the sex industry nor offer retraining .
and even health insurance companies do n't offer any kind of special health provisions for prostitutes . verdi is prepared to fight the exploitation of sex workers , but so far , the union has failed to come up with any concrete solutions .
however , at a conference on the subject of prostitution at the end of april , they will present a sample contract for sex workers . mitrovic believes this is a step forward .
" the contract would regulate holiday pay , sick pay and something very special , namely medical examinations during work time , " she said .
" the contract would also ensure women a fixed income which could be transferred to their bank accounts . " it 's all well and good in theory , but just how likely are the brothel owners and managers to go along with it ?
mitrovic is optimistic and has already found one brothel manager who wants to try out the contract , and who also wants to employ immigrants , and who is looking for legal ways to do this . law does n't apply to all one of the problems with the new prostitution law is that it does nothing to help foreign prostitutes , who constitute almost half of germany sex workers , who do n't have a legal work permit .
without it , they ca n't report ill treatment or exploitation to the police unless they want to run the high risk of subsequent deportation . the sad reality of prostitution in germany is that despite the new law , most prostitutes still work under very poor conditions .

the german government legalized prostitution two years ago , but many sex workers remain reluctant to register with authorities as they continue to experience discrimination , a new study has revealed . sex is big business in germany .
with some 400,000 prostitutes and an annual 1.2 million men who use their services , the yearly turnover has hit a massive € 14 billion -lrb- $ 16.5 billion -rrb- .
but paid sex can be a nasty business .
two years ago the german government introduced a new prostitution law in what was an earnest attempt to protect prostitutes ' working conditions and even offer them some protection against violence and exploitation .
there is even scope for girls on the game to join a union , but that has proved to be something that few have taken advantage of .
at a loss to understand the reluctance among the country 's sex work force to become unionized , the services trade union verdi commissioned hamburg-based social scientist emilija mitrovic to find out why .
mitrovic , who is due to publish the results of her study at the end of the month , has spent a lot of time travelling across germany , talking with prostitutes , brothel owners , police officers and social workers in a bid to find out what difference the new law has made to prostitutes . " the desired effect of the law was to create a better social situation for prostitutes , to do away with the immoral stigma attached to their work , to give them the right to sue for unpaid fees , and make health insurance and social security payments , " mitrovic told deutsche welle . continued discrimination her study , which examined the varying consequences of the law in different cities and states across germany , revealed that the majority of prostitutes in germany still prefer to do the job secretly , because although prostitution is officially legal , sex workers still experience discrimination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a prostitute in frankfurt mitrovic also discovered that women are often put in unnecessarily dangerous situations as a result of arbitrary rules that dictate exactly where they are allowed to tout for business .
these are often dark and dead industrial areas , where the women are far more vulnerable to violence . on top of this , the study showed discrimination from most of germany 's federal job agencies , who will neither broker jobs in the sex industry nor offer retraining .
and even health insurance companies do n't offer any kind of special health provisions for prostitutes . verdi is prepared to fight the exploitation of sex workers , but so far , the union has failed to come up with any concrete solutions .
however , at a conference on the subject of prostitution at the end of april , they will present a sample contract for sex workers . mitrovic believes this is a step forward .
" the contract would regulate holiday pay , sick pay and something very special , namely medical examinations during work time , " she said .
" the contract would also ensure women a fixed income which could be transferred to their bank accounts . " it 's all well and good in theory , but just how likely are the brothel owners and managers to go along with it ?
mitrovic is optimistic and has already found one brothel manager who wants to try out the contract , and who also wants to employ immigrants , and who is looking for legal ways to do this . law does n't apply to all one of the problems with the new prostitution law is that it does nothing to help foreign prostitutes , who constitute almost half of germany sex workers , who do n't have a legal work permit .
without it , they ca n't report ill treatment or exploitation to the police unless they want to run the high risk of subsequent deportation . the sad reality of prostitution in germany is that despite the new law , most prostitutes still work under very poor conditions .
the majority of the money they earn is taken away from them by pimps and landlords and , for those who are trying to work by the book , from the tax office as well . perhaps the biggest problem for prostitutes here is still the way they are treated socially .
on the one hand paid sex is considered a part of 21st century life , but very few women are actually prepared to come out and admit that is what they do . as far as mitrovic is concerned , prostitution wo n't shed its criminal stigma until the pimps put up their hands and confess that they are making money from selling sex , and that it is a socially acceptable thing to do . udo taubitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stolen youth : child prostitution plagues german-czech border the united nations children 's agency says child prostitution is rising across the german border in the czech republic .

"
turkish films are securing a place in german cinemas now that producers have discovered a new target audience of german-turks .
far from being on the fringe , the films are making it into the nation 's biggest theaters . turkish films shown in germany have long conveyed a rather bleak view of the bosporus state .
they typically dealt with issues such as the kurdish conflict , the problems facing women , illiteracy , military dominance , and censorship .
but in recent years , that 's started to change .
following the success of yavuz turgul 's drama " eskiya , the bandit , " more and more popular turkish films have made it onto german movie screens , including those in the big multi-plex cinemas . whereas in the past , turks in germany had to wait months for a film showing in turkey to be released here , now it 's often only a matter of days separating release dates , making it easier for the turkish community to stay in touch with the zeitgeist in the bosporus . distributors making the trend two companies are leading the way in distribution .
warner attracted turkish and german audiences alike with films such as " propaganda , " " güle güle , " and " commissar shekspir . "
and then there 's maxximum film distribution , started by anil sahin , a former executive with the hamburg-based cinemaxx cinema group .
when he saw the potential of the turkish market , he immediately founded his own company . sahin 's first venture , " balalaika " in october 2001 proved to be a flop in german cinemas , so the businessman set about refining his marketing strategy .
turkish movie-goers proved to be loyal customers with a high level of attachment to the product .
the particular film being shown matters less to them than the movie-going experience . though warner had high box office numbers , it did n't make a huge profit , since it had falsely calculated the advertising budget .
maxximum , on the other hand , began collecting german " bogeys " - prizes for the highest number of screenings . " deli yürek " played in 150 cinemas in over 70 cities .
the final episode of the turkish cult soap " asmali konak " was the most successful title with 35 copies and over 220,000 viewers . maxximum productions run in other countries as well , for example austria , bulgaria and switzerland .
a few weeks ago , one of its films took third place in the dutch box office charts . here , the films are shown with german subtitles .
that does n't just help the handful of non-turkish audience members , it also helps to fill the gaps in the sometimes scanty knowledge of turkish among german-turks .
and surprisingly , any scenes containing swear words or naked skin have to be cut out of all the films shown in germany , as the target audience here is much more conservative than in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actor moritz bleibtreu .
the increasing level of german involvement in the turkish film industry could soon see the tables being turned , with german-turkish productions being exported back to the bosporus .
maxximum , for example , is planning to produce a vehicle for popular german actor moritz bleibtreu -lrb- photo -rrb- .
and in hamburg , a film called " süperseks " is in the works .
the comedy by a german director about a turkish sex hotline is being produced with german money - and it has a good chance of being successful in turkey . rambo and big happy families just how well these films reflect the realities of everyday turkish life can be left for viewers to decide .
" propaganda " and " vizontele , " for example , are filled with the kind of antics and buffoonery that are guaranteed to have even german audiences splitting their sides .
but while they portray turkey as a conflict-free , multi-ethnic society full of big happy families , the film " deli yürek " shows quite a different side .
the action flick takes its inspiration from the conflict in kurdistan , and presents it as a conspiracy between the cia and hizbollah that can only be resolved by a turkish version of rambo . possible superficialities aside , anil sahin deems the trend toward popular turkish cinema a positive one .
these colorful films convey a more positive image of turkey and help create a closer affiliation to europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the new europe the eve of enlargement where is europe headed ? a final report card for new eu members getting the green light europe -pipe- 22.04.2004 verheugen : eu expansion brings peace and profit back to first page back 2/2 the economic differential between the countries of the old europe and many new members is huge .
lithuania and latvia , for example , will need decades to reach our economic level .
how can you ensure that economically a europe of two speeds does n't develop ? you could also ask why greece , an eu member for 30 years , has n't been able to reduce the distance to the rest of the eu - but still no one talks about a europe of two economic speeds .
what we see is a higher speed of growth in the new countries , and that 's good . people talk about 50 to 60 years for some of the new member countries . … but where 's the problem ?
it took a long time with ireland too .
for greece the distance from the average is still the same but in the meantime at a much higher level .
the most important thing is that the new member countries grow , and their growth potential is large .
incidentally , individual citizens ' or businesses ' rights to eu funds do n't arise from eu membership .
it 's not like it was with german unification .
unification has cost € 1.25 trillion so far .
in contrast , expansion can not put us in danger in terms of costs because the eu budget is club funds by nature .
the club ca n't spend one euro more than the members voluntarily put into the club funds . in negotiations with countries such as poland , people had the impression that they want to get the maximum out of europe and only contribute a little .
did that annoy you ? certainly not .
poland negotiated well but no tougher than others ; they are n't getting more either .
even in 2013 , the union 's per capita benefits for poland will be distinctly lower than the per capita benefits for spain .
poland is a large country , a very proud nation , that needs a certain amount of time to find its place and role in the european union .
people should show a little patience and not pillory a country that is encumbered by a formidable historic burden . still , the new members apparently have n't completed the homework that is a condition for receiving eu funds .
for example , corruption in the new member states , such as slovakia or the czech republic , is high .
how will you get that under control ? i ca n't dispute that a certain kind of corruption remains quite strong in these countries - in connection with large-scale privatization , for example .
-lrb- german interior minister -rrb- otto schily once said he thought that around 10 percent of the funds that went to eastern germany in the context of economic reconstruction were illegal .
i would n't estimate the magnitude to be so high for poland and the czech republic .
but it is a typical phenomenon . regarding homework , i would n't agree with your thesis .
on may 1 we will see that the new member countries will assume -lrb- eu -rrb- community law to 100 percent .
while in the old countries more than 2,000 legal actions are underway due to contract breaches , that is , due to the incomplete or completely inadequate application of community law . do you mean to say that the new acceding states are better prepared than earlier acceding states ? it 's safe to say that .
although we have much more extensive and complicated community legislation today .
now there 's much , much more to negotiate .
during earlier expansions , the commission was n't worried about whether the greeks , spanish or portuguese were also capable of applying community law .
this is an entirely new method that we first developed for this expansion . the balkan countries want to join the eu ; the accession of turkey , romania and bulgaria 's is planned for 2007 .
where do you think europe stops ? romania and bulgaria are part of the current round .
and then everything 's open .
the balkan countries do indeed have the prospect of joining , though there 's no schedule for them .
they are still too far away from national or regional stability or also from economic integration - with the exception of croatia , whose accession application has been submitted .
turkey is a special case .
it has had the prospect of joining since 1963 .
at the end of the year it will be decided whether turkey has in the meantime gotten far enough to start negotiations . for the eastern european countries , such as russia , ukraine , but also the caucasus countries or the southern mediterranean countries , membership is not on the agenda .
however , we offer these countries very far-ranging neighborhood policies . your time as expansion commissioner comes to an end on may 1 … correct , i have made myself redundant .
but do n't forget bulgaria , romania and turkey . what will you do afterwards ? i will remain a member of the -lrb- european -rrb- commission until november 1 .
beyond that nothing has been decided .
i have armed myself with great patience . gabriele feil interviewed günter verheugen for tagesschau.de -lrb- ncy -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de croatia inches closer to eu membership the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .

on may 1 , the eu will grow to a 25 member bloc of states .
dw-world content partner tagesschau.de spoke to günter verheugen , who has been responsible for designing the current round of eu expansion . günter verheugen is the eu executive 's commissioner for expansion .
german public broadcaster tagesschau.de spoke to verheugen about the fears , expectations and future of european union expansion . tagesschau.de : you are the architect of this eu expansion ; for years you 've been working toward may 1 , 2004 .
what does this day mean to you personally ? günter verheugen : gratification , relief - but also a very muted feeling of concern or trepidation .
it can be best compared with the feelings of a soccer trainer , who for the first time sees his team go play a match and asks himself whether they will all show what they have learned .
of course , i ask myself whether everything will work , if we really did do everything right , if we perhaps overlooked problems .
but my basic feeling is satisfaction for having created this large and meaningful peace project . many germans see it differently .
according to surveys every third german opposes eu expansion .
how do you explain this skepticism ? that 's very easy to explain .
as always when people are confronted by something that they do n't know well , they react with fear .
the problem is that there has n't been any sizable and broad political debate on this topic .
and that 's why expansion has n't really registered with people .
now that it 's directly imminent it has an enormous media presence : something 's coming , but what is it ?
the problems that citizens pinpoint in the context of the expansion - from cross-border criminality to competition problems - are very real .
it 's just that they have nothing to do with the impending expansion .
instead , they are the consequences of the collapse of the communist world of states , the fall of the iron curtain .
that 's why european integration is neither a part nor the origin of the problem , rather the reasonable , perhaps also the only , possible solution to the problem . even so , many people are afraid that businesses will export jobs to the low-wage countries in the eu 's new east ... they have already been doing that for a long time .
that will also continue , but it does n't have anything to do with the expansion either .
for , the result of the expansion is that these countries will not remain low-wage countries .
through their eu membership , the competitive situation in the old member states will improve .
from -lrb- the moment of -rrb- entry , the new members must assume our social standards , our environmental standards and our professional standards ; they must observe our competition and subsidy regulations .
that means that the cost advantages that they now have will decrease gradually .
the outsourcing or migration of production components is a process that we have been observing for 40 years .
it is not a result of european integration but rather a result of economic globalization . what does the expansion offer germans ? in the first place , it 's a peace project .
it creates peace , stability , and safety in the region of europe that immediately borders germany .
people there have known for years what political , economic and financial results instability leads to .
german soldiers are in kosovo , german soldiers are in bosnia … in kosovo alone , for one million people , europe raised € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- to maintain the ceasefire .
peace pays off , after all .
as luxemburg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , said : a year of peace costs less than a day of war ! the second is an enormous economic profit - especially for germany .
it arises from -lrb- the fact -rrb- that this economic area will be populated after all by 110 million people , if we include romania and bulgaria , and everywhere here there is an immense unsatisfied demand .
we have very stabile , very robust growth rates in these countries , that are noticeably above the growth rates in the remainder of the eu .
the export-oriented german economy profits particularly from this quickly growing market . but initially the germans will have to dig deeper into their pockets for the expansion .
the european commission has demanded more money for it , more than € 37 billion will be pumped into the new countries in the coming years .
how can you make that appealing to the taxpayer ? the financing for this expansion round was already decided in berlin in 1999 .
we are spending around € 15 billion less than was then calculated and will get by with a total of € 40 billion until 2006 .
the new countries will pay € 15 billion of that themselves .
all in all , the expansion will cost germany a net total of € 2.5 billion in the first three years .
on the other hand , germany will have an enormous trade balance surplus .
that 's why viewed economically it 's a win-win situation .
it makes no sense to say that the expansion will lead to an additional burden for the germans . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de croatia inches closer to eu membership the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .

on may 1 , the eu will grow to a 25 member bloc of states .
dw-world content partner tagesschau.de spoke to günter verheugen , who has been responsible for designing the current round of eu expansion . günter verheugen is the eu executive 's commissioner for expansion .
german public broadcaster tagesschau.de spoke to verheugen about the fears , expectations and future of european union expansion . tagesschau.de : you are the architect of this eu expansion ; for years you 've been working toward may 1 , 2004 .
what does this day mean to you personally ? günter verheugen : gratification , relief - but also a very muted feeling of concern or trepidation .
it can be best compared with the feelings of a soccer trainer , who for the first time sees his team go play a match and asks himself whether they will all show what they have learned .
of course , i ask myself whether everything will work , if we really did do everything right , if we perhaps overlooked problems .
but my basic feeling is satisfaction for having created this large and meaningful peace project . many germans see it differently .
according to surveys every third german opposes eu expansion .
how do you explain this skepticism ? that 's very easy to explain .
as always when people are confronted by something that they do n't know well , they react with fear .
the problem is that there has n't been any sizable and broad political debate on this topic .
and that 's why expansion has n't really registered with people .
now that it 's directly imminent it has an enormous media presence : something 's coming , but what is it ?
the problems that citizens pinpoint in the context of the expansion - from cross-border criminality to competition problems - are very real .
it 's just that they have nothing to do with the impending expansion .
instead , they are the consequences of the collapse of the communist world of states , the fall of the iron curtain .
that 's why european integration is neither a part nor the origin of the problem , rather the reasonable , perhaps also the only , possible solution to the problem . even so , many people are afraid that businesses will export jobs to the low-wage countries in the eu 's new east ... they have already been doing that for a long time .
that will also continue , but it does n't have anything to do with the expansion either .
for , the result of the expansion is that these countries will not remain low-wage countries .
through their eu membership , the competitive situation in the old member states will improve .
from -lrb- the moment of -rrb- entry , the new members must assume our social standards , our environmental standards and our professional standards ; they must observe our competition and subsidy regulations .
that means that the cost advantages that they now have will decrease gradually .
the outsourcing or migration of production components is a process that we have been observing for 40 years .
it is not a result of european integration but rather a result of economic globalization . what does the expansion offer germans ? in the first place , it 's a peace project .
it creates peace , stability , and safety in the region of europe that immediately borders germany .
people there have known for years what political , economic and financial results instability leads to .
german soldiers are in kosovo , german soldiers are in bosnia … in kosovo alone , for one million people , europe raised € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- to maintain the ceasefire .
peace pays off , after all .
as luxemburg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , said : a year of peace costs less than a day of war ! the second is an enormous economic profit - especially for germany .
it arises from -lrb- the fact -rrb- that this economic area will be populated after all by 110 million people , if we include romania and bulgaria , and everywhere here there is an immense unsatisfied demand .
we have very stabile , very robust growth rates in these countries , that are noticeably above the growth rates in the remainder of the eu .
the export-oriented german economy profits particularly from this quickly growing market . but initially the germans will have to dig deeper into their pockets for the expansion .
the european commission has demanded more money for it , more than € 37 billion will be pumped into the new countries in the coming years .
how can you make that appealing to the taxpayer ? the financing for this expansion round was already decided in berlin in 1999 .
we are spending around € 15 billion less than was then calculated and will get by with a total of € 40 billion until 2006 .
the new countries will pay € 15 billion of that themselves .
all in all , the expansion will cost germany a net total of € 2.5 billion in the first three years .
on the other hand , germany will have an enormous trade balance surplus .
that 's why viewed economically it 's a win-win situation .
it makes no sense to say that the expansion will lead to an additional burden for the germans . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de croatia inches closer to eu membership the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .
although a start date for accession talks wo n't be confirmed until june , the former yugoslav republic is already en-route to home base .

lithuania and latvia , for example , will need decades to reach our economic level .
how can you ensure that economically a europe of two speeds does n't develop ? you could also ask why greece , an eu member for 30 years , has n't been able to reduce the distance to the rest of the eu - but still no one talks about a europe of two economic speeds .
what we see is a higher speed of growth in the new countries , and that 's good . people talk about 50 to 60 years for some of the new member countries . … but where 's the problem ?
it took a long time with ireland too .
for greece the distance from the average is still the same but in the meantime at a much higher level .
the most important thing is that the new member countries grow , and their growth potential is large .
incidentally , individual citizens ' or businesses ' rights to eu funds do n't arise from eu membership .
it 's not like it was with german unification .
unification has cost € 1.25 trillion so far .
in contrast , expansion can not put us in danger in terms of costs because the eu budget is club funds by nature .
the club ca n't spend one euro more than the members voluntarily put into the club funds . in negotiations with countries such as poland , people had the impression that they want to get the maximum out of europe and only contribute a little .
did that annoy you ? certainly not .
poland negotiated well but no tougher than others ; they are n't getting more either .
even in 2013 , the union 's per capita benefits for poland will be distinctly lower than the per capita benefits for spain .
poland is a large country , a very proud nation , that needs a certain amount of time to find its place and role in the european union .
people should show a little patience and not pillory a country that is encumbered by a formidable historic burden . still , the new members apparently have n't completed the homework that is a condition for receiving eu funds .
for example , corruption in the new member states , such as slovakia or the czech republic , is high .
how will you get that under control ? i ca n't dispute that a certain kind of corruption remains quite strong in these countries - in connection with large-scale privatization , for example .
-lrb- german interior minister -rrb- otto schily once said he thought that around 10 percent of the funds that went to eastern germany in the context of economic reconstruction were illegal .
i would n't estimate the magnitude to be so high for poland and the czech republic .
but it is a typical phenomenon . regarding homework , i would n't agree with your thesis .
on may 1 we will see that the new member countries will assume -lrb- eu -rrb- community law to 100 percent .
while in the old countries more than 2,000 legal actions are underway due to contract breaches , that is , due to the incomplete or completely inadequate application of community law . do you mean to say that the new acceding states are better prepared than earlier acceding states ? it 's safe to say that .
although we have much more extensive and complicated community legislation today .
now there 's much , much more to negotiate .
during earlier expansions , the commission was n't worried about whether the greeks , spanish or portuguese were also capable of applying community law .
this is an entirely new method that we first developed for this expansion . the balkan countries want to join the eu ; the accession of turkey , romania and bulgaria 's is planned for 2007 .
where do you think europe stops ? romania and bulgaria are part of the current round .
and then everything 's open .
the balkan countries do indeed have the prospect of joining , though there 's no schedule for them .
they are still too far away from national or regional stability or also from economic integration - with the exception of croatia , whose accession application has been submitted .
turkey is a special case .
it has had the prospect of joining since 1963 .
at the end of the year it will be decided whether turkey has in the meantime gotten far enough to start negotiations . for the eastern european countries , such as russia , ukraine , but also the caucasus countries or the southern mediterranean countries , membership is not on the agenda .
however , we offer these countries very far-ranging neighborhood policies . your time as expansion commissioner comes to an end on may 1 … correct , i have made myself redundant .
but do n't forget bulgaria , romania and turkey . what will you do afterwards ? i will remain a member of the -lrb- european -rrb- commission until november 1 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the new europe the eve of enlargement where is europe headed ? a final report card for new eu members getting the green light europe -pipe- 22.04.2004 verheugen : eu expansion brings peace and profit 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen 's job may be over come may 1 .
on may 1 , the eu will grow to a 25 member bloc of states .
dw-world content partner tagesschau.de spoke to günter verheugen , who has been responsible for designing the current round of eu expansion . günter verheugen is the eu executive 's commissioner for expansion .
german public broadcaster tagesschau.de spoke to verheugen about the fears , expectations and future of european union expansion . tagesschau.de : you are the architect of this eu expansion ; for years you 've been working toward may 1 , 2004 .
what does this day mean to you personally ? günter verheugen : gratification , relief - but also a very muted feeling of concern or trepidation .
it can be best compared with the feelings of a soccer trainer , who for the first time sees his team go play a match and asks himself whether they will all show what they have learned .
of course , i ask myself whether everything will work , if we really did do everything right , if we perhaps overlooked problems .
but my basic feeling is satisfaction for having created this large and meaningful peace project . many germans see it differently .
according to surveys every third german opposes eu expansion .
how do you explain this skepticism ? that 's very easy to explain .
as always when people are confronted by something that they do n't know well , they react with fear .
the problem is that there has n't been any sizable and broad political debate on this topic .
and that 's why expansion has n't really registered with people .
now that it 's directly imminent it has an enormous media presence : something 's coming , but what is it ?
the problems that citizens pinpoint in the context of the expansion - from cross-border criminality to competition problems - are very real .
it 's just that they have nothing to do with the impending expansion .
instead , they are the consequences of the collapse of the communist world of states , the fall of the iron curtain .
that 's why european integration is neither a part nor the origin of the problem , rather the reasonable , perhaps also the only , possible solution to the problem . even so , many people are afraid that businesses will export jobs to the low-wage countries in the eu 's new east ... they have already been doing that for a long time .
that will also continue , but it does n't have anything to do with the expansion either .
for , the result of the expansion is that these countries will not remain low-wage countries .
through their eu membership , the competitive situation in the old member states will improve .
from -lrb- the moment of -rrb- entry , the new members must assume our social standards , our environmental standards and our professional standards ; they must observe our competition and subsidy regulations .
that means that the cost advantages that they now have will decrease gradually .
the outsourcing or migration of production components is a process that we have been observing for 40 years .
it is not a result of european integration but rather a result of economic globalization . what does the expansion offer germans ? in the first place , it 's a peace project .
it creates peace , stability , and safety in the region of europe that immediately borders germany .
people there have known for years what political , economic and financial results instability leads to .
german soldiers are in kosovo , german soldiers are in bosnia … in kosovo alone , for one million people , europe raised € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- to maintain the ceasefire .
peace pays off , after all .
as luxemburg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , said : a year of peace costs less than a day of war ! the second is an enormous economic profit - especially for germany .
it arises from -lrb- the fact -rrb- that this economic area will be populated after all by 110 million people , if we include romania and bulgaria , and everywhere here there is an immense unsatisfied demand .
we have very stabile , very robust growth rates in these countries , that are noticeably above the growth rates in the remainder of the eu .
the export-oriented german economy profits particularly from this quickly growing market . but initially the germans will have to dig deeper into their pockets for the expansion .
the european commission has demanded more money for it , more than € 37 billion will be pumped into the new countries in the coming years .
how can you make that appealing to the taxpayer ? the financing for this expansion round was already decided in berlin in 1999 .
we are spending around € 15 billion less than was then calculated and will get by with a total of € 40 billion until 2006 .
the new countries will pay € 15 billion of that themselves .
all in all , the expansion will cost germany a net total of € 2.5 billion in the first three years .
on the other hand , germany will have an enormous trade balance surplus .
that 's why viewed economically it 's a win-win situation .
it makes no sense to say that the expansion will lead to an additional burden for the germans . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de croatia inches closer to eu membership the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .
although a start date for accession talks wo n't be confirmed until june , the former yugoslav republic is already en-route to home base .

on may 1 , the eu will grow to a 25 member bloc of states .
dw-world content partner tagesschau.de spoke to günter verheugen , who has been responsible for designing the current round of eu expansion . günter verheugen is the eu executive 's commissioner for expansion .
german public broadcaster tagesschau.de spoke to verheugen about the fears , expectations and future of european union expansion . tagesschau.de : you are the architect of this eu expansion ; for years you 've been working toward may 1 , 2004 .
what does this day mean to you personally ? günter verheugen : gratification , relief - but also a very muted feeling of concern or trepidation .
it can be best compared with the feelings of a soccer trainer , who for the first time sees his team go play a match and asks himself whether they will all show what they have learned .
of course , i ask myself whether everything will work , if we really did do everything right , if we perhaps overlooked problems .
but my basic feeling is satisfaction for having created this large and meaningful peace project . many germans see it differently .
according to surveys every third german opposes eu expansion .
how do you explain this skepticism ? that 's very easy to explain .
as always when people are confronted by something that they do n't know well , they react with fear .
the problem is that there has n't been any sizable and broad political debate on this topic .
and that 's why expansion has n't really registered with people .
now that it 's directly imminent it has an enormous media presence : something 's coming , but what is it ?
the problems that citizens pinpoint in the context of the expansion - from cross-border criminality to competition problems - are very real .
it 's just that they have nothing to do with the impending expansion .
instead , they are the consequences of the collapse of the communist world of states , the fall of the iron curtain .
that 's why european integration is neither a part nor the origin of the problem , rather the reasonable , perhaps also the only , possible solution to the problem . even so , many people are afraid that businesses will export jobs to the low-wage countries in the eu 's new east ... they have already been doing that for a long time .
that will also continue , but it does n't have anything to do with the expansion either .
for , the result of the expansion is that these countries will not remain low-wage countries .
through their eu membership , the competitive situation in the old member states will improve .
from -lrb- the moment of -rrb- entry , the new members must assume our social standards , our environmental standards and our professional standards ; they must observe our competition and subsidy regulations .
that means that the cost advantages that they now have will decrease gradually .
the outsourcing or migration of production components is a process that we have been observing for 40 years .
it is not a result of european integration but rather a result of economic globalization . what does the expansion offer germans ? in the first place , it 's a peace project .
it creates peace , stability , and safety in the region of europe that immediately borders germany .
people there have known for years what political , economic and financial results instability leads to .
german soldiers are in kosovo , german soldiers are in bosnia … in kosovo alone , for one million people , europe raised € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- to maintain the ceasefire .
peace pays off , after all .
as luxemburg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , said : a year of peace costs less than a day of war ! the second is an enormous economic profit - especially for germany .
it arises from -lrb- the fact -rrb- that this economic area will be populated after all by 110 million people , if we include romania and bulgaria , and everywhere here there is an immense unsatisfied demand .
we have very stabile , very robust growth rates in these countries , that are noticeably above the growth rates in the remainder of the eu .
the export-oriented german economy profits particularly from this quickly growing market . but initially the germans will have to dig deeper into their pockets for the expansion .
the european commission has demanded more money for it , more than € 37 billion will be pumped into the new countries in the coming years .
how can you make that appealing to the taxpayer ? the financing for this expansion round was already decided in berlin in 1999 .
we are spending around € 15 billion less than was then calculated and will get by with a total of € 40 billion until 2006 .
the new countries will pay € 15 billion of that themselves .
all in all , the expansion will cost germany a net total of € 2.5 billion in the first three years .
on the other hand , germany will have an enormous trade balance surplus .
that 's why viewed economically it 's a win-win situation .
it makes no sense to say that the expansion will lead to an additional burden for the germans . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de croatia inches closer to eu membership the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .

what does this day mean to you personally ? günter verheugen : gratification , relief - but also a very muted feeling of concern or trepidation .
it can be best compared with the feelings of a soccer trainer , who for the first time sees his team go play a match and asks himself whether they will all show what they have learned .
of course , i ask myself whether everything will work , if we really did do everything right , if we perhaps overlooked problems .
but my basic feeling is satisfaction for having created this large and meaningful peace project . many germans see it differently .
according to surveys every third german opposes eu expansion .
how do you explain this skepticism ? that 's very easy to explain .
as always when people are confronted by something that they do n't know well , they react with fear .
the problem is that there has n't been any sizable and broad political debate on this topic .
and that 's why expansion has n't really registered with people .
now that it 's directly imminent it has an enormous media presence : something 's coming , but what is it ?
the problems that citizens pinpoint in the context of the expansion - from cross-border criminality to competition problems - are very real .
it 's just that they have nothing to do with the impending expansion .
instead , they are the consequences of the collapse of the communist world of states , the fall of the iron curtain .
that 's why european integration is neither a part nor the origin of the problem , rather the reasonable , perhaps also the only , possible solution to the problem . even so , many people are afraid that businesses will export jobs to the low-wage countries in the eu 's new east ... they have already been doing that for a long time .
that will also continue , but it does n't have anything to do with the expansion either .
for , the result of the expansion is that these countries will not remain low-wage countries .
through their eu membership , the competitive situation in the old member states will improve .
from -lrb- the moment of -rrb- entry , the new members must assume our social standards , our environmental standards and our professional standards ; they must observe our competition and subsidy regulations .
that means that the cost advantages that they now have will decrease gradually .
the outsourcing or migration of production components is a process that we have been observing for 40 years .
it is not a result of european integration but rather a result of economic globalization . what does the expansion offer germans ? in the first place , it 's a peace project .
it creates peace , stability , and safety in the region of europe that immediately borders germany .
people there have known for years what political , economic and financial results instability leads to .
german soldiers are in kosovo , german soldiers are in bosnia … in kosovo alone , for one million people , europe raised € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- to maintain the ceasefire .
peace pays off , after all .
as luxemburg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , said : a year of peace costs less than a day of war ! the second is an enormous economic profit - especially for germany .
it arises from -lrb- the fact -rrb- that this economic area will be populated after all by 110 million people , if we include romania and bulgaria , and everywhere here there is an immense unsatisfied demand .
we have very stabile , very robust growth rates in these countries , that are noticeably above the growth rates in the remainder of the eu .
the export-oriented german economy profits particularly from this quickly growing market . but initially the germans will have to dig deeper into their pockets for the expansion .
the european commission has demanded more money for it , more than € 37 billion will be pumped into the new countries in the coming years .
how can you make that appealing to the taxpayer ? the financing for this expansion round was already decided in berlin in 1999 .
we are spending around € 15 billion less than was then calculated and will get by with a total of € 40 billion until 2006 .
the new countries will pay € 15 billion of that themselves .
all in all , the expansion will cost germany a net total of € 2.5 billion in the first three years .
on the other hand , germany will have an enormous trade balance surplus .
that 's why viewed economically it 's a win-win situation .
it makes no sense to say that the expansion will lead to an additional burden for the germans . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de croatia inches closer to eu membership the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .

lithuania and latvia , for example , will need decades to reach our economic level .
how can you ensure that economically a europe of two speeds does n't develop ? you could also ask why greece , an eu member for 30 years , has n't been able to reduce the distance to the rest of the eu - but still no one talks about a europe of two economic speeds .
what we see is a higher speed of growth in the new countries , and that 's good . people talk about 50 to 60 years for some of the new member countries . … but where 's the problem ?

the most important thing is that the new member countries grow , and their growth potential is large .
incidentally , individual citizens ' or businesses ' rights to eu funds do n't arise from eu membership .
it 's not like it was with german unification .
unification has cost € 1.25 trillion so far .
in contrast , expansion can not put us in danger in terms of costs because the eu budget is club funds by nature .
the club ca n't spend one euro more than the members voluntarily put into the club funds . in negotiations with countries such as poland , people had the impression that they want to get the maximum out of europe and only contribute a little .
did that annoy you ? certainly not .
poland negotiated well but no tougher than others ; they are n't getting more either .
even in 2013 , the union 's per capita benefits for poland will be distinctly lower than the per capita benefits for spain .
poland is a large country , a very proud nation , that needs a certain amount of time to find its place and role in the european union .
people should show a little patience and not pillory a country that is encumbered by a formidable historic burden . still , the new members apparently have n't completed the homework that is a condition for receiving eu funds .
for example , corruption in the new member states , such as slovakia or the czech republic , is high .
how will you get that under control ? i ca n't dispute that a certain kind of corruption remains quite strong in these countries - in connection with large-scale privatization , for example .
-lrb- german interior minister -rrb- otto schily once said he thought that around 10 percent of the funds that went to eastern germany in the context of economic reconstruction were illegal .
i would n't estimate the magnitude to be so high for poland and the czech republic .
but it is a typical phenomenon . regarding homework , i would n't agree with your thesis .
on may 1 we will see that the new member countries will assume -lrb- eu -rrb- community law to 100 percent .
while in the old countries more than 2,000 legal actions are underway due to contract breaches , that is , due to the incomplete or completely inadequate application of community law . do you mean to say that the new acceding states are better prepared than earlier acceding states ? it 's safe to say that .
although we have much more extensive and complicated community legislation today .
now there 's much , much more to negotiate .
during earlier expansions , the commission was n't worried about whether the greeks , spanish or portuguese were also capable of applying community law .
this is an entirely new method that we first developed for this expansion . the balkan countries want to join the eu ; the accession of turkey , romania and bulgaria 's is planned for 2007 .
where do you think europe stops ? romania and bulgaria are part of the current round .
and then everything 's open .
the balkan countries do indeed have the prospect of joining , though there 's no schedule for them .
they are still too far away from national or regional stability or also from economic integration - with the exception of croatia , whose accession application has been submitted .
turkey is a special case .

during his visit to afghanistan on tuesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer praised the work of german troops and said the reconstruction effort there should serve as a role model to iraq . fischer 's first stop in afghanistan on tuesday was the northern city of kunduz , home to a provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- of about 300 german troops .
there are about a dozen such prt 's spread out in several cities around the country to provide security and help oversee reconstruction projects .
in kunduz , the germans are responsible for training local police officers .
at each major intersection , there 's a uniformed officer trying , often in vain , to regulate traffic .
still , there 's optimism that things are starting to improve .
at the city 's bazaar , residents can get most of what they need .
electricity is being imported from neighboring tajikistan , with varying regularity .
but there 's one area the residents have firmly under control - they 've organized at least 30 football clubs . " we have the trust of the afghan people right now , " fischer said , adding that this trust be put to use to enhance reconstruction in the country .
he praised the german troops for doing a great job , and said the combination of civil and military personnel was proving to be effective .
" i think we should continue down this path . " role model for iraq the foreign minister reminded troops in kunduz of the importance of the decision to extend nato 's mission in afghanistan beyond the area around the capital , kabul .
expanding security operations is seen as vital to the success of landmark presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled for september . fischer also said the progress made in afghanistan should serve as a role model in iraq , where the reconstruction process is being stalled by fighting between coalition troops and iraqi insurgents .
" it 's never too late to learn from our mistakes .
it 'll perhaps be more difficult , because time is being wasted , but it 's never too late to learn , " he said , adding that it 's hardly a coincidence that the un 's former commissioner for afghanistan , lakhdar brahimi , is now the commissioner for iraq . renewed committment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister , joschka fischer , left , speaks to reporters during a press conference in kabul , afghanistan on tuesday , april 20 , 2004 .

fischer 's trip comes just three weeks after an international donor conference for afghanistan was held in berlin , which garnered $ 8.2 billion in new pledges for reconstruction .

"
turkish films are securing a place in german cinemas now that producers have discovered a new target audience of german-turks .
far from being on the fringe , the films are making it into the nation 's biggest theaters . turkish films shown in germany have long conveyed a rather bleak view of the bosporus state .
they typically dealt with issues such as the kurdish conflict , the problems facing women , illiteracy , military dominance , and censorship .
but in recent years , that 's started to change .
following the success of yavuz turgul 's drama " eskiya , the bandit , " more and more popular turkish films have made it onto german movie screens , including those in the big multi-plex cinemas . whereas in the past , turks in germany had to wait months for a film showing in turkey to be released here , now it 's often only a matter of days separating release dates , making it easier for the turkish community to stay in touch with the zeitgeist in the bosporus . distributors making the trend two companies are leading the way in distribution .
warner attracted turkish and german audiences alike with films such as " propaganda , " " güle güle , " and " commissar shekspir . "
and then there 's maxximum film distribution , started by anil sahin , a former executive with the hamburg-based cinemaxx cinema group .
when he saw the potential of the turkish market , he immediately founded his own company . sahin 's first venture , " balalaika " in october 2001 proved to be a flop in german cinemas , so the businessman set about refining his marketing strategy .
turkish movie-goers proved to be loyal customers with a high level of attachment to the product .
the particular film being shown matters less to them than the movie-going experience . though warner had high box office numbers , it did n't make a huge profit , since it had falsely calculated the advertising budget .
maxximum , on the other hand , began collecting german " bogeys " - prizes for the highest number of screenings . " deli yürek " played in 150 cinemas in over 70 cities .
the final episode of the turkish cult soap " asmali konak " was the most successful title with 35 copies and over 220,000 viewers . maxximum productions run in other countries as well , for example austria , bulgaria and switzerland .
a few weeks ago , one of its films took third place in the dutch box office charts . here , the films are shown with german subtitles .
that does n't just help the handful of non-turkish audience members , it also helps to fill the gaps in the sometimes scanty knowledge of turkish among german-turks .
and surprisingly , any scenes containing swear words or naked skin have to be cut out of all the films shown in germany , as the target audience here is much more conservative than in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actor moritz bleibtreu .
the increasing level of german involvement in the turkish film industry could soon see the tables being turned , with german-turkish productions being exported back to the bosporus .
maxximum , for example , is planning to produce a vehicle for popular german actor moritz bleibtreu -lrb- photo -rrb- .
and in hamburg , a film called " süperseks " is in the works .
the comedy by a german director about a turkish sex hotline is being produced with german money - and it has a good chance of being successful in turkey . rambo and big happy families just how well these films reflect the realities of everyday turkish life can be left for viewers to decide .
" propaganda " and " vizontele , " for example , are filled with the kind of antics and buffoonery that are guaranteed to have even german audiences splitting their sides .
but while they portray turkey as a conflict-free , multi-ethnic society full of big happy families , the film " deli yürek " shows quite a different side .
the action flick takes its inspiration from the conflict in kurdistan , and presents it as a conspiracy between the cia and hizbollah that can only be resolved by a turkish version of rambo . possible superficialities aside , anil sahin deems the trend toward popular turkish cinema a positive one .
these colorful films convey a more positive image of turkey and help create a closer affiliation to europe .
but one of the superstars of turkish cinema sees things differently .
haluk bilgener welcomes the current hype , but he 's skeptical about the dominance of these so-called " popcorn films . " " they cater to a pleasure-seeking generation that is totally apolitical , " he said . amin farzanefar -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lost in translation many english language films make it to the german screens with their original titles intact .

joschka fischer will wrap up his trip to the caucasus region on thursday with stops in armenia and georgia .
his visit in armenia comes during considerable political instability in the country . following visits to afghanistan and azerbaijan , germany 's fischer continued his week-long trip abroad by arriving in the armenian capital yerevan on thursday morning .
as he did in azerbaijan , he is expected to encourage both southern caucasus nations to continue to improve their democratic and human rights credentials by holding out the prospect of closer ties to the european union . fischer will need plenty of diplomatic tact in yerevan , since armenian president robert kocharian is under increasing pressure to step down .
on wednesday , opposition groups held a protest rally that attracted an estimated 10,000 people , according to the associated press .
opposition groups allege kocharian won reelection last year only through widespread election fraud , a charge which the president denies . tensions in the country rose on april 13 , when police used force to break up a protest rally .
around 100 people were reportedly detained and several protestors were injured .
" any administration relying on violence is doomed .
kocharian must go , " said stepan demirchyan , leader of the opposition justice party and runner-up in last year 's presidential election , according to the reuters news agency . kocharian 's opponents hope to oust him though continued popular unrest , similar to how neighboring georgia toppled the government of former president eduard shevardnadze late last year .
but some experts are skeptical kocharian will be removed from power . " the armenian authorities are better consolidated and will defend their position more strongly .
moreover , there 's no clear leader of the opposition like there was in georgia , " andranik migranyan told dw-radio . conflict with azerbaijan while in yerevan , fischer will also address the dispute over the nagorno-karabakh region , which though part of azerbaijan has been separated from the country since the mid-1990s after a war with ethnic armenians .
a cease-fire in the conflict was signed in 1994 , but the final status of nagorno-karabakh has not been resolved .
in the azerbaijani capital baku on wednesday , fischer already said germany and the eu were prepared to help find a solution to the conflict . fischer 's visit to armenia will also include a memorial for armenians killed by turks in 1915 .
the armenians claim ottoman turkish forces committed genocide at the time , slaughtering some 1.5 million people between 1915 and 1923 .
turkey rejects the charges , saying the armenians were killed in a partisan war as the ottoman empire collapsed . heading to tbilisi later in the day , fischer will meet with georgian president mikhail saakashvili to show support for his western oriented reform course .
saakashvili came to power in a bloodless coup that ousted shevardnadze in november , but he has run into trouble recently , as military commanders in the rebellious black sea province of adzhara refuse to follow the orders of the central government . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rebuilding afghanistan and setting an example for iraq during his visit to afghanistan on tuesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer praised the work of german troops and said the reconstruction effort there should serve as a role model to iraq .

turkish films are securing a place in german cinemas now that producers have discovered a new target audience of german-turks .
far from being on the fringe , the films are making it into the nation 's biggest theaters . turkish films shown in germany have long conveyed a rather bleak view of the bosporus state .
they typically dealt with issues such as the kurdish conflict , the problems facing women , illiteracy , military dominance , and censorship .
but in recent years , that 's started to change .
following the success of yavuz turgul 's drama " eskiya , the bandit , " more and more popular turkish films have made it onto german movie screens , including those in the big multi-plex cinemas . whereas in the past , turks in germany had to wait months for a film showing in turkey to be released here , now it 's often only a matter of days separating release dates , making it easier for the turkish community to stay in touch with the zeitgeist in the bosporus . distributors making the trend two companies are leading the way in distribution .
warner attracted turkish and german audiences alike with films such as " propaganda , " " güle güle , " and " commissar shekspir . "
and then there 's maxximum film distribution , started by anil sahin , a former executive with the hamburg-based cinemaxx cinema group .
when he saw the potential of the turkish market , he immediately founded his own company . sahin 's first venture , " balalaika " in october 2001 proved to be a flop in german cinemas , so the businessman set about refining his marketing strategy .
turkish movie-goers proved to be loyal customers with a high level of attachment to the product .
the particular film being shown matters less to them than the movie-going experience . though warner had high box office numbers , it did n't make a huge profit , since it had falsely calculated the advertising budget .
maxximum , on the other hand , began collecting german " bogeys " - prizes for the highest number of screenings . " deli yürek " played in 150 cinemas in over 70 cities .
the final episode of the turkish cult soap " asmali konak " was the most successful title with 35 copies and over 220,000 viewers . maxximum productions run in other countries as well , for example austria , bulgaria and switzerland .
a few weeks ago , one of its films took third place in the dutch box office charts . here , the films are shown with german subtitles .
that does n't just help the handful of non-turkish audience members , it also helps to fill the gaps in the sometimes scanty knowledge of turkish among german-turks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 22.04.2004 popular cinema , turkish-style großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filmmakers are appealing to the german-turkish population , for example with " güle güle . "
turkish films are securing a place in german cinemas now that producers have discovered a new target audience of german-turks .
far from being on the fringe , the films are making it into the nation 's biggest theaters . turkish films shown in germany have long conveyed a rather bleak view of the bosporus state .
they typically dealt with issues such as the kurdish conflict , the problems facing women , illiteracy , military dominance , and censorship .
but in recent years , that 's started to change .
following the success of yavuz turgul 's drama " eskiya , the bandit , " more and more popular turkish films have made it onto german movie screens , including those in the big multi-plex cinemas . whereas in the past , turks in germany had to wait months for a film showing in turkey to be released here , now it 's often only a matter of days separating release dates , making it easier for the turkish community to stay in touch with the zeitgeist in the bosporus . distributors making the trend two companies are leading the way in distribution .
warner attracted turkish and german audiences alike with films such as " propaganda , " " güle güle , " and " commissar shekspir . "
and then there 's maxximum film distribution , started by anil sahin , a former executive with the hamburg-based cinemaxx cinema group .
when he saw the potential of the turkish market , he immediately founded his own company . sahin 's first venture , " balalaika " in october 2001 proved to be a flop in german cinemas , so the businessman set about refining his marketing strategy .
turkish movie-goers proved to be loyal customers with a high level of attachment to the product .
the particular film being shown matters less to them than the movie-going experience . though warner had high box office numbers , it did n't make a huge profit , since it had falsely calculated the advertising budget .
maxximum , on the other hand , began collecting german " bogeys " - prizes for the highest number of screenings . " deli yürek " played in 150 cinemas in over 70 cities .
the final episode of the turkish cult soap " asmali konak " was the most successful title with 35 copies and over 220,000 viewers . maxximum productions run in other countries as well , for example austria , bulgaria and switzerland .
a few weeks ago , one of its films took third place in the dutch box office charts . here , the films are shown with german subtitles .
that does n't just help the handful of non-turkish audience members , it also helps to fill the gaps in the sometimes scanty knowledge of turkish among german-turks .
and surprisingly , any scenes containing swear words or naked skin have to be cut out of all the films shown in germany , as the target audience here is much more conservative than in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actor moritz bleibtreu .
the increasing level of german involvement in the turkish film industry could soon see the tables being turned , with german-turkish productions being exported back to the bosporus .
maxximum , for example , is planning to produce a vehicle for popular german actor moritz bleibtreu -lrb- photo -rrb- .
and in hamburg , a film called " süperseks " is in the works .
the comedy by a german director about a turkish sex hotline is being produced with german money - and it has a good chance of being successful in turkey . rambo and big happy families just how well these films reflect the realities of everyday turkish life can be left for viewers to decide .
" propaganda " and " vizontele , " for example , are filled with the kind of antics and buffoonery that are guaranteed to have even german audiences splitting their sides .
but while they portray turkey as a conflict-free , multi-ethnic society full of big happy families , the film " deli yürek " shows quite a different side .
the action flick takes its inspiration from the conflict in kurdistan , and presents it as a conspiracy between the cia and hizbollah that can only be resolved by a turkish version of rambo . possible superficialities aside , anil sahin deems the trend toward popular turkish cinema a positive one .
these colorful films convey a more positive image of turkey and help create a closer affiliation to europe .
but one of the superstars of turkish cinema sees things differently .
haluk bilgener welcomes the current hype , but he 's skeptical about the dominance of these so-called " popcorn films . " " they cater to a pleasure-seeking generation that is totally apolitical , " he said . amin farzanefar -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lost in translation many english language films make it to the german screens with their original titles intact .

joschka fischer will wrap up his trip to the caucasus region on thursday with stops in armenia and georgia .
his visit in armenia comes during considerable political instability in the country . following visits to afghanistan and azerbaijan , germany 's fischer continued his week-long trip abroad by arriving in the armenian capital yerevan on thursday morning .
as he did in azerbaijan , he is expected to encourage both southern caucasus nations to continue to improve their democratic and human rights credentials by holding out the prospect of closer ties to the european union . fischer will need plenty of diplomatic tact in yerevan , since armenian president robert kocharian is under increasing pressure to step down .
on wednesday , opposition groups held a protest rally that attracted an estimated 10,000 people , according to the associated press .
opposition groups allege kocharian won reelection last year only through widespread election fraud , a charge which the president denies . tensions in the country rose on april 13 , when police used force to break up a protest rally .
around 100 people were reportedly detained and several protestors were injured .
" any administration relying on violence is doomed .

a cease-fire in the conflict was signed in 1994 , but the final status of nagorno-karabakh has not been resolved .
in the azerbaijani capital baku on wednesday , fischer already said germany and the eu were prepared to help find a solution to the conflict . fischer 's visit to armenia will also include a memorial for armenians killed by turks in 1915 .
the armenians claim ottoman turkish forces committed genocide at the time , slaughtering some 1.5 million people between 1915 and 1923 .
turkey rejects the charges , saying the armenians were killed in a partisan war as the ottoman empire collapsed . heading to tbilisi later in the day , fischer will meet with georgian president mikhail saakashvili to show support for his western oriented reform course .
saakashvili came to power in a bloodless coup that ousted shevardnadze in november , but he has run into trouble recently , as military commanders in the rebellious black sea province of adzhara refuse to follow the orders of the central government . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rebuilding afghanistan and setting an example for iraq during his visit to afghanistan on tuesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer praised the work of german troops and said the reconstruction effort there should serve as a role model to iraq .

kalle kiez -lrb- left -rrb- tells tidy berliners berlin partygoers may come to the conclusion they had one too many to drink when rubbish bins start shouting at them on the city 's streets .
but the talking trashcans are n't a figment of inebriated imaginations . siggi sport , hitlist harry and susi smart have taken to the streets of berlin , doing their part to create an upbeat and tidy atmosphere in the city known for its , some say , crude vernacular .
siggi sport hollers " go-a-a-al " when cleanly passersby toss their trash into his welcoming receptacle .
hitlist harry sings a takeoff of a german pop song and susi smart thanks her benefactor in english , french and japanese . the three faceless , orange characters are solar-powered , multilingual rubbish bins .
the berlin city sanitation department introduced the five trashcan characters on wednesday in an effort to show that cleanliness is " cool " and to help polish the capital 's image .
on top of showing their appreciation for being " fed , " the wastebaskets will relay information on what 's going on in berlin over the summer to tidy pedestrians . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the new europe the eve of enlargement where is europe headed ? a final report card for new eu members getting the green light europe -pipe- 22.04.2004 verheugen : eu expansion brings peace and profit back to first page back 2/2 the economic differential between the countries of the old europe and many new members is huge .
lithuania and latvia , for example , will need decades to reach our economic level .
how can you ensure that economically a europe of two speeds does n't develop ? you could also ask why greece , an eu member for 30 years , has n't been able to reduce the distance to the rest of the eu - but still no one talks about a europe of two economic speeds .
what we see is a higher speed of growth in the new countries , and that 's good . people talk about 50 to 60 years for some of the new member countries . … but where 's the problem ?
it took a long time with ireland too .
for greece the distance from the average is still the same but in the meantime at a much higher level .
the most important thing is that the new member countries grow , and their growth potential is large .
incidentally , individual citizens ' or businesses ' rights to eu funds do n't arise from eu membership .
it 's not like it was with german unification .
unification has cost € 1.25 trillion so far .
in contrast , expansion can not put us in danger in terms of costs because the eu budget is club funds by nature .
the club ca n't spend one euro more than the members voluntarily put into the club funds . in negotiations with countries such as poland , people had the impression that they want to get the maximum out of europe and only contribute a little .
did that annoy you ? certainly not .
poland negotiated well but no tougher than others ; they are n't getting more either .
even in 2013 , the union 's per capita benefits for poland will be distinctly lower than the per capita benefits for spain .
poland is a large country , a very proud nation , that needs a certain amount of time to find its place and role in the european union .
people should show a little patience and not pillory a country that is encumbered by a formidable historic burden . still , the new members apparently have n't completed the homework that is a condition for receiving eu funds .
for example , corruption in the new member states , such as slovakia or the czech republic , is high .
how will you get that under control ? i ca n't dispute that a certain kind of corruption remains quite strong in these countries - in connection with large-scale privatization , for example .
-lrb- german interior minister -rrb- otto schily once said he thought that around 10 percent of the funds that went to eastern germany in the context of economic reconstruction were illegal .
i would n't estimate the magnitude to be so high for poland and the czech republic .
but it is a typical phenomenon . regarding homework , i would n't agree with your thesis .
on may 1 we will see that the new member countries will assume -lrb- eu -rrb- community law to 100 percent .
while in the old countries more than 2,000 legal actions are underway due to contract breaches , that is , due to the incomplete or completely inadequate application of community law . do you mean to say that the new acceding states are better prepared than earlier acceding states ? it 's safe to say that .
although we have much more extensive and complicated community legislation today .
now there 's much , much more to negotiate .
during earlier expansions , the commission was n't worried about whether the greeks , spanish or portuguese were also capable of applying community law .
this is an entirely new method that we first developed for this expansion . the balkan countries want to join the eu ; the accession of turkey , romania and bulgaria 's is planned for 2007 .
where do you think europe stops ? romania and bulgaria are part of the current round .
and then everything 's open .
the balkan countries do indeed have the prospect of joining , though there 's no schedule for them .
they are still too far away from national or regional stability or also from economic integration - with the exception of croatia , whose accession application has been submitted .
turkey is a special case .
it has had the prospect of joining since 1963 .
at the end of the year it will be decided whether turkey has in the meantime gotten far enough to start negotiations . for the eastern european countries , such as russia , ukraine , but also the caucasus countries or the southern mediterranean countries , membership is not on the agenda .
however , we offer these countries very far-ranging neighborhood policies . your time as expansion commissioner comes to an end on may 1 … correct , i have made myself redundant .
but do n't forget bulgaria , romania and turkey . what will you do afterwards ? i will remain a member of the -lrb- european -rrb- commission until november 1 .
beyond that nothing has been decided .
i have armed myself with great patience . gabriele feil interviewed günter verheugen for tagesschau.de -lrb- ncy -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de croatia inches closer to eu membership the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .
although a start date for accession talks wo n't be confirmed until june , the former yugoslav republic is already en-route to home base .

swiss pharmaceutical giant novartis said on thursday it would enter merger talks with france 's aventis , possibly preventing a bid by rival sanofi-synthelabo which is backed by the french government . basel-based novartis said it would begin negotiations with aventis despite previous reservations about interference by government officials in paris , who have made clear they would prefer an all-french linkup with sanofi-synthelabo .
if successful , the merged novartis-aventis would create the world 's second-largest pharmaceutical firm after the u.s.-based pfizer . a spokesman for aventis , which itself was created from a merger of france 's rhone-poulenc and germany 's hoechst in 2000 , said the company was pleased by novartis ' willingness to negotiate , but remained cautious about the final outcome of the talks . " we welcome this decision , -lsb- but -rsb- no assurances can be given that an agreement can be reached , " spokesman tony rodham told the associated press .
aventis 's board invited novartis to enter talks three weeks ago . the announcement strengthens aventis ' hand in its attempt to fend off a hostile bid from much smaller french rival sanofi-synthelabo , which has offered to pay € 45 billion -lrb- $ 53.2 billion -rrb- for the company .
that encouraged novartis to get involved , but the swiss were then put off by comments from french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , who said he would prefer a french-only merger in order to help protect the country 's national interests . " we 're not at the endgame here yet , " richard jarvis , a pharmaceutical analyst at pictet & cie in london , told bloomberg news .
" the french government has n't changed their position and novartis is keen to try and persuade them .
it 's not completely in their hands and it is n't just in the hands of aventis shareholders at present . " aventis sees risks with sanofi however , since aventis has shown no interest in merging with sanofi-synthelabo and the french government would have to justify blocking any deal to the european union , novartis now appears ready to risk rankling paris . " a combination with aventis has a very convincing industrial logic .
it creates value and it addresses the legitimate concerns of the french government , " novartis chief financial officer raymond breu told reporters on thursday . strasbourg-based aventis has said novartis would be a much stronger partner than sanofi , which faces possible patent challenges to some of its more important drugs such as its plavix blood-thinner . although half the size of it 's competitor , sanofi is asking for a 100 percent takeover of aventis and demanding 50 percent of aventis shares and voting rights - a bold move that sanofi is able to make because of aventis ' currently weaker financial position . unions opposed novartis would protect aventis from sanofi , but the firm 's unions are opposed to a merger with the swiss and on thursday showed they would not shy away from using concerns about france 's national interest to try and hinder a deal . bloomberg reported that the unions sent a letter to french finance minister nicolas sarkozy , saying an aventis novartis merger would mean " france would have to give up its independence on products as crucial as vaccines and antibiotics , not to speak of the industrial and research sacrifice .

swiss pharmaceutical giant novartis said on thursday it would enter merger talks with france 's aventis , possibly preventing a bid by rival sanofi-synthelabo which is backed by the french government . basel-based novartis said it would begin negotiations with aventis despite previous reservations about interference by government officials in paris , who have made clear they would prefer an all-french linkup with sanofi-synthelabo .
if successful , the merged novartis-aventis would create the world 's second-largest pharmaceutical firm after the u.s.-based pfizer . a spokesman for aventis , which itself was created from a merger of france 's rhone-poulenc and germany 's hoechst in 2000 , said the company was pleased by novartis ' willingness to negotiate , but remained cautious about the final outcome of the talks . " we welcome this decision , -lsb- but -rsb- no assurances can be given that an agreement can be reached , " spokesman tony rodham told the associated press .
aventis 's board invited novartis to enter talks three weeks ago . the announcement strengthens aventis ' hand in its attempt to fend off a hostile bid from much smaller french rival sanofi-synthelabo , which has offered to pay € 45 billion -lrb- $ 53.2 billion -rrb- for the company .
that encouraged novartis to get involved , but the swiss were then put off by comments from french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , who said he would prefer a french-only merger in order to help protect the country 's national interests . " we 're not at the endgame here yet , " richard jarvis , a pharmaceutical analyst at pictet & cie in london , told bloomberg news .

joschka fischer will wrap up his trip to the caucasus region on thursday with stops in armenia and georgia .
his visit in armenia comes during considerable political instability in the country . following visits to afghanistan and azerbaijan , germany 's fischer continued his week-long trip abroad by arriving in the armenian capital yerevan on thursday morning .
as he did in azerbaijan , he is expected to encourage both southern caucasus nations to continue to improve their democratic and human rights credentials by holding out the prospect of closer ties to the european union . fischer will need plenty of diplomatic tact in yerevan , since armenian president robert kocharian is under increasing pressure to step down .
on wednesday , opposition groups held a protest rally that attracted an estimated 10,000 people , according to the associated press .
opposition groups allege kocharian won reelection last year only through widespread election fraud , a charge which the president denies . tensions in the country rose on april 13 , when police used force to break up a protest rally .
around 100 people were reportedly detained and several protestors were injured .
" any administration relying on violence is doomed .
kocharian must go , " said stepan demirchyan , leader of the opposition justice party and runner-up in last year 's presidential election , according to the reuters news agency . kocharian 's opponents hope to oust him though continued popular unrest , similar to how neighboring georgia toppled the government of former president eduard shevardnadze late last year .
but some experts are skeptical kocharian will be removed from power . " the armenian authorities are better consolidated and will defend their position more strongly .
moreover , there 's no clear leader of the opposition like there was in georgia , " andranik migranyan told dw-radio . conflict with azerbaijan while in yerevan , fischer will also address the dispute over the nagorno-karabakh region , which though part of azerbaijan has been separated from the country since the mid-1990s after a war with ethnic armenians .
a cease-fire in the conflict was signed in 1994 , but the final status of nagorno-karabakh has not been resolved .
in the azerbaijani capital baku on wednesday , fischer already said germany and the eu were prepared to help find a solution to the conflict . fischer 's visit to armenia will also include a memorial for armenians killed by turks in 1915 .
the armenians claim ottoman turkish forces committed genocide at the time , slaughtering some 1.5 million people between 1915 and 1923 .
turkey rejects the charges , saying the armenians were killed in a partisan war as the ottoman empire collapsed . heading to tbilisi later in the day , fischer will meet with georgian president mikhail saakashvili to show support for his western oriented reform course .
saakashvili came to power in a bloodless coup that ousted shevardnadze in november , but he has run into trouble recently , as military commanders in the rebellious black sea province of adzhara refuse to follow the orders of the central government . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rebuilding afghanistan and setting an example for iraq during his visit to afghanistan on tuesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer praised the work of german troops and said the reconstruction effort there should serve as a role model to iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 22.04.2004 popular cinema , turkish-style großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filmmakers are appealing to the german-turkish population , for example with " güle güle . "
turkish films are securing a place in german cinemas now that producers have discovered a new target audience of german-turks .
far from being on the fringe , the films are making it into the nation 's biggest theaters . turkish films shown in germany have long conveyed a rather bleak view of the bosporus state .
they typically dealt with issues such as the kurdish conflict , the problems facing women , illiteracy , military dominance , and censorship .
but in recent years , that 's started to change .
following the success of yavuz turgul 's drama " eskiya , the bandit , " more and more popular turkish films have made it onto german movie screens , including those in the big multi-plex cinemas . whereas in the past , turks in germany had to wait months for a film showing in turkey to be released here , now it 's often only a matter of days separating release dates , making it easier for the turkish community to stay in touch with the zeitgeist in the bosporus . distributors making the trend two companies are leading the way in distribution .
warner attracted turkish and german audiences alike with films such as " propaganda , " " güle güle , " and " commissar shekspir . "
and then there 's maxximum film distribution , started by anil sahin , a former executive with the hamburg-based cinemaxx cinema group .
when he saw the potential of the turkish market , he immediately founded his own company . sahin 's first venture , " balalaika " in october 2001 proved to be a flop in german cinemas , so the businessman set about refining his marketing strategy .
turkish movie-goers proved to be loyal customers with a high level of attachment to the product .
the particular film being shown matters less to them than the movie-going experience . though warner had high box office numbers , it did n't make a huge profit , since it had falsely calculated the advertising budget .
maxximum , on the other hand , began collecting german " bogeys " - prizes for the highest number of screenings . " deli yürek " played in 150 cinemas in over 70 cities .
the final episode of the turkish cult soap " asmali konak " was the most successful title with 35 copies and over 220,000 viewers . maxximum productions run in other countries as well , for example austria , bulgaria and switzerland .
a few weeks ago , one of its films took third place in the dutch box office charts . here , the films are shown with german subtitles .
that does n't just help the handful of non-turkish audience members , it also helps to fill the gaps in the sometimes scanty knowledge of turkish among german-turks .
and surprisingly , any scenes containing swear words or naked skin have to be cut out of all the films shown in germany , as the target audience here is much more conservative than in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actor moritz bleibtreu .
the increasing level of german involvement in the turkish film industry could soon see the tables being turned , with german-turkish productions being exported back to the bosporus .
maxximum , for example , is planning to produce a vehicle for popular german actor moritz bleibtreu -lrb- photo -rrb- .
and in hamburg , a film called " süperseks " is in the works .
the comedy by a german director about a turkish sex hotline is being produced with german money - and it has a good chance of being successful in turkey . rambo and big happy families just how well these films reflect the realities of everyday turkish life can be left for viewers to decide .
" propaganda " and " vizontele , " for example , are filled with the kind of antics and buffoonery that are guaranteed to have even german audiences splitting their sides .
but while they portray turkey as a conflict-free , multi-ethnic society full of big happy families , the film " deli yürek " shows quite a different side .
the action flick takes its inspiration from the conflict in kurdistan , and presents it as a conspiracy between the cia and hizbollah that can only be resolved by a turkish version of rambo . possible superficialities aside , anil sahin deems the trend toward popular turkish cinema a positive one .
these colorful films convey a more positive image of turkey and help create a closer affiliation to europe .
but one of the superstars of turkish cinema sees things differently .
haluk bilgener welcomes the current hype , but he 's skeptical about the dominance of these so-called " popcorn films . " " they cater to a pleasure-seeking generation that is totally apolitical , " he said . amin farzanefar -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lost in translation many english language films make it to the german screens with their original titles intact .

during his visit to afghanistan on tuesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer praised the work of german troops and said the reconstruction effort there should serve as a role model to iraq . fischer 's first stop in afghanistan on tuesday was the northern city of kunduz , home to a provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- of about 300 german troops .
there are about a dozen such prt 's spread out in several cities around the country to provide security and help oversee reconstruction projects .
in kunduz , the germans are responsible for training local police officers .
at each major intersection , there 's a uniformed officer trying , often in vain , to regulate traffic .
still , there 's optimism that things are starting to improve .
at the city 's bazaar , residents can get most of what they need .
electricity is being imported from neighboring tajikistan , with varying regularity .
but there 's one area the residents have firmly under control - they 've organized at least 30 football clubs . " we have the trust of the afghan people right now , " fischer said , adding that this trust be put to use to enhance reconstruction in the country .
he praised the german troops for doing a great job , and said the combination of civil and military personnel was proving to be effective .
" i think we should continue down this path . " role model for iraq the foreign minister reminded troops in kunduz of the importance of the decision to extend nato 's mission in afghanistan beyond the area around the capital , kabul .
expanding security operations is seen as vital to the success of landmark presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled for september . fischer also said the progress made in afghanistan should serve as a role model in iraq , where the reconstruction process is being stalled by fighting between coalition troops and iraqi insurgents .
" it 's never too late to learn from our mistakes .
it 'll perhaps be more difficult , because time is being wasted , but it 's never too late to learn , " he said , adding that it 's hardly a coincidence that the un 's former commissioner for afghanistan , lakhdar brahimi , is now the commissioner for iraq . renewed committment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister , joschka fischer , left , speaks to reporters during a press conference in kabul , afghanistan on tuesday , april 20 , 2004 .

fischer 's trip comes just three weeks after an international donor conference for afghanistan was held in berlin , which garnered $ 8.2 billion in new pledges for reconstruction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the new europe the eve of enlargement where is europe headed ? a final report card for new eu members getting the green light europe -pipe- 22.04.2004 verheugen : eu expansion brings peace and profit back to first page back 2/2 the economic differential between the countries of the old europe and many new members is huge .
lithuania and latvia , for example , will need decades to reach our economic level .
how can you ensure that economically a europe of two speeds does n't develop ? you could also ask why greece , an eu member for 30 years , has n't been able to reduce the distance to the rest of the eu - but still no one talks about a europe of two economic speeds .
what we see is a higher speed of growth in the new countries , and that 's good . people talk about 50 to 60 years for some of the new member countries . … but where 's the problem ?
it took a long time with ireland too .
for greece the distance from the average is still the same but in the meantime at a much higher level .
the most important thing is that the new member countries grow , and their growth potential is large .
incidentally , individual citizens ' or businesses ' rights to eu funds do n't arise from eu membership .
it 's not like it was with german unification .
unification has cost € 1.25 trillion so far .
in contrast , expansion can not put us in danger in terms of costs because the eu budget is club funds by nature .
the club ca n't spend one euro more than the members voluntarily put into the club funds . in negotiations with countries such as poland , people had the impression that they want to get the maximum out of europe and only contribute a little .
did that annoy you ? certainly not .
poland negotiated well but no tougher than others ; they are n't getting more either .
even in 2013 , the union 's per capita benefits for poland will be distinctly lower than the per capita benefits for spain .
poland is a large country , a very proud nation , that needs a certain amount of time to find its place and role in the european union .
people should show a little patience and not pillory a country that is encumbered by a formidable historic burden . still , the new members apparently have n't completed the homework that is a condition for receiving eu funds .
for example , corruption in the new member states , such as slovakia or the czech republic , is high .
how will you get that under control ? i ca n't dispute that a certain kind of corruption remains quite strong in these countries - in connection with large-scale privatization , for example .
-lrb- german interior minister -rrb- otto schily once said he thought that around 10 percent of the funds that went to eastern germany in the context of economic reconstruction were illegal .
i would n't estimate the magnitude to be so high for poland and the czech republic .
but it is a typical phenomenon . regarding homework , i would n't agree with your thesis .
on may 1 we will see that the new member countries will assume -lrb- eu -rrb- community law to 100 percent .
while in the old countries more than 2,000 legal actions are underway due to contract breaches , that is , due to the incomplete or completely inadequate application of community law . do you mean to say that the new acceding states are better prepared than earlier acceding states ? it 's safe to say that .
although we have much more extensive and complicated community legislation today .
now there 's much , much more to negotiate .
during earlier expansions , the commission was n't worried about whether the greeks , spanish or portuguese were also capable of applying community law .
this is an entirely new method that we first developed for this expansion . the balkan countries want to join the eu ; the accession of turkey , romania and bulgaria 's is planned for 2007 .
where do you think europe stops ? romania and bulgaria are part of the current round .
and then everything 's open .
the balkan countries do indeed have the prospect of joining , though there 's no schedule for them .
they are still too far away from national or regional stability or also from economic integration - with the exception of croatia , whose accession application has been submitted .
turkey is a special case .
it has had the prospect of joining since 1963 .
at the end of the year it will be decided whether turkey has in the meantime gotten far enough to start negotiations . for the eastern european countries , such as russia , ukraine , but also the caucasus countries or the southern mediterranean countries , membership is not on the agenda .
however , we offer these countries very far-ranging neighborhood policies . your time as expansion commissioner comes to an end on may 1 … correct , i have made myself redundant .
but do n't forget bulgaria , romania and turkey . what will you do afterwards ? i will remain a member of the -lrb- european -rrb- commission until november 1 .
beyond that nothing has been decided .
i have armed myself with great patience . gabriele feil interviewed günter verheugen for tagesschau.de -lrb- ncy -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de croatia inches closer to eu membership the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .
although a start date for accession talks wo n't be confirmed until june , the former yugoslav republic is already en-route to home base .

even in 2013 , the union 's per capita benefits for poland will be distinctly lower than the per capita benefits for spain .
poland is a large country , a very proud nation , that needs a certain amount of time to find its place and role in the european union .
people should show a little patience and not pillory a country that is encumbered by a formidable historic burden . still , the new members apparently have n't completed the homework that is a condition for receiving eu funds .
for example , corruption in the new member states , such as slovakia or the czech republic , is high .
how will you get that under control ? i ca n't dispute that a certain kind of corruption remains quite strong in these countries - in connection with large-scale privatization , for example .
-lrb- german interior minister -rrb- otto schily once said he thought that around 10 percent of the funds that went to eastern germany in the context of economic reconstruction were illegal .
i would n't estimate the magnitude to be so high for poland and the czech republic .
but it is a typical phenomenon . regarding homework , i would n't agree with your thesis .
on may 1 we will see that the new member countries will assume -lrb- eu -rrb- community law to 100 percent .
while in the old countries more than 2,000 legal actions are underway due to contract breaches , that is , due to the incomplete or completely inadequate application of community law . do you mean to say that the new acceding states are better prepared than earlier acceding states ? it 's safe to say that .
although we have much more extensive and complicated community legislation today .
now there 's much , much more to negotiate .
during earlier expansions , the commission was n't worried about whether the greeks , spanish or portuguese were also capable of applying community law .
this is an entirely new method that we first developed for this expansion . the balkan countries want to join the eu ; the accession of turkey , romania and bulgaria 's is planned for 2007 .
where do you think europe stops ? romania and bulgaria are part of the current round .
and then everything 's open .
the balkan countries do indeed have the prospect of joining , though there 's no schedule for them .
they are still too far away from national or regional stability or also from economic integration - with the exception of croatia , whose accession application has been submitted .
turkey is a special case .
it has had the prospect of joining since 1963 .
at the end of the year it will be decided whether turkey has in the meantime gotten far enough to start negotiations . for the eastern european countries , such as russia , ukraine , but also the caucasus countries or the southern mediterranean countries , membership is not on the agenda .
however , we offer these countries very far-ranging neighborhood policies . your time as expansion commissioner comes to an end on may 1 … correct , i have made myself redundant .
but do n't forget bulgaria , romania and turkey . what will you do afterwards ? i will remain a member of the -lrb- european -rrb- commission until november 1 .
beyond that nothing has been decided .
i have armed myself with great patience . gabriele feil interviewed günter verheugen for tagesschau.de -lrb- ncy -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de croatia inches closer to eu membership the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .

"
turkish films are securing a place in german cinemas now that producers have discovered a new target audience of german-turks .
far from being on the fringe , the films are making it into the nation 's biggest theaters . turkish films shown in germany have long conveyed a rather bleak view of the bosporus state .
they typically dealt with issues such as the kurdish conflict , the problems facing women , illiteracy , military dominance , and censorship .
but in recent years , that 's started to change .
following the success of yavuz turgul 's drama " eskiya , the bandit , " more and more popular turkish films have made it onto german movie screens , including those in the big multi-plex cinemas . whereas in the past , turks in germany had to wait months for a film showing in turkey to be released here , now it 's often only a matter of days separating release dates , making it easier for the turkish community to stay in touch with the zeitgeist in the bosporus . distributors making the trend two companies are leading the way in distribution .
warner attracted turkish and german audiences alike with films such as " propaganda , " " güle güle , " and " commissar shekspir . "
and then there 's maxximum film distribution , started by anil sahin , a former executive with the hamburg-based cinemaxx cinema group .
when he saw the potential of the turkish market , he immediately founded his own company . sahin 's first venture , " balalaika " in october 2001 proved to be a flop in german cinemas , so the businessman set about refining his marketing strategy .
turkish movie-goers proved to be loyal customers with a high level of attachment to the product .
the particular film being shown matters less to them than the movie-going experience . though warner had high box office numbers , it did n't make a huge profit , since it had falsely calculated the advertising budget .
maxximum , on the other hand , began collecting german " bogeys " - prizes for the highest number of screenings . " deli yürek " played in 150 cinemas in over 70 cities .
the final episode of the turkish cult soap " asmali konak " was the most successful title with 35 copies and over 220,000 viewers . maxximum productions run in other countries as well , for example austria , bulgaria and switzerland .
a few weeks ago , one of its films took third place in the dutch box office charts . here , the films are shown with german subtitles .
that does n't just help the handful of non-turkish audience members , it also helps to fill the gaps in the sometimes scanty knowledge of turkish among german-turks .
and surprisingly , any scenes containing swear words or naked skin have to be cut out of all the films shown in germany , as the target audience here is much more conservative than in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actor moritz bleibtreu .
the increasing level of german involvement in the turkish film industry could soon see the tables being turned , with german-turkish productions being exported back to the bosporus .
maxximum , for example , is planning to produce a vehicle for popular german actor moritz bleibtreu -lrb- photo -rrb- .
and in hamburg , a film called " süperseks " is in the works .
the comedy by a german director about a turkish sex hotline is being produced with german money - and it has a good chance of being successful in turkey . rambo and big happy families just how well these films reflect the realities of everyday turkish life can be left for viewers to decide .
" propaganda " and " vizontele , " for example , are filled with the kind of antics and buffoonery that are guaranteed to have even german audiences splitting their sides .
but while they portray turkey as a conflict-free , multi-ethnic society full of big happy families , the film " deli yürek " shows quite a different side .
the action flick takes its inspiration from the conflict in kurdistan , and presents it as a conspiracy between the cia and hizbollah that can only be resolved by a turkish version of rambo . possible superficialities aside , anil sahin deems the trend toward popular turkish cinema a positive one .
these colorful films convey a more positive image of turkey and help create a closer affiliation to europe .
but one of the superstars of turkish cinema sees things differently .
haluk bilgener welcomes the current hype , but he 's skeptical about the dominance of these so-called " popcorn films . " " they cater to a pleasure-seeking generation that is totally apolitical , " he said . amin farzanefar -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lost in translation many english language films make it to the german screens with their original titles intact .

german public broadcaster tagesschau.de spoke to verheugen about the fears , expectations and future of european union expansion . tagesschau.de : you are the architect of this eu expansion ; for years you 've been working toward may 1 , 2004 .
what does this day mean to you personally ? günter verheugen : gratification , relief - but also a very muted feeling of concern or trepidation .
it can be best compared with the feelings of a soccer trainer , who for the first time sees his team go play a match and asks himself whether they will all show what they have learned .
of course , i ask myself whether everything will work , if we really did do everything right , if we perhaps overlooked problems .
but my basic feeling is satisfaction for having created this large and meaningful peace project . many germans see it differently .
according to surveys every third german opposes eu expansion .
how do you explain this skepticism ? that 's very easy to explain .
as always when people are confronted by something that they do n't know well , they react with fear .
the problem is that there has n't been any sizable and broad political debate on this topic .
and that 's why expansion has n't really registered with people .
now that it 's directly imminent it has an enormous media presence : something 's coming , but what is it ?
the problems that citizens pinpoint in the context of the expansion - from cross-border criminality to competition problems - are very real .
it 's just that they have nothing to do with the impending expansion .
instead , they are the consequences of the collapse of the communist world of states , the fall of the iron curtain .
that 's why european integration is neither a part nor the origin of the problem , rather the reasonable , perhaps also the only , possible solution to the problem . even so , many people are afraid that businesses will export jobs to the low-wage countries in the eu 's new east ... they have already been doing that for a long time .
that will also continue , but it does n't have anything to do with the expansion either .
for , the result of the expansion is that these countries will not remain low-wage countries .
through their eu membership , the competitive situation in the old member states will improve .
from -lrb- the moment of -rrb- entry , the new members must assume our social standards , our environmental standards and our professional standards ; they must observe our competition and subsidy regulations .
that means that the cost advantages that they now have will decrease gradually .
the outsourcing or migration of production components is a process that we have been observing for 40 years .
it is not a result of european integration but rather a result of economic globalization . what does the expansion offer germans ? in the first place , it 's a peace project .
it creates peace , stability , and safety in the region of europe that immediately borders germany .
people there have known for years what political , economic and financial results instability leads to .
german soldiers are in kosovo , german soldiers are in bosnia … in kosovo alone , for one million people , europe raised € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- to maintain the ceasefire .
peace pays off , after all .
as luxemburg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , said : a year of peace costs less than a day of war ! the second is an enormous economic profit - especially for germany .
it arises from -lrb- the fact -rrb- that this economic area will be populated after all by 110 million people , if we include romania and bulgaria , and everywhere here there is an immense unsatisfied demand .
we have very stabile , very robust growth rates in these countries , that are noticeably above the growth rates in the remainder of the eu .
the export-oriented german economy profits particularly from this quickly growing market . but initially the germans will have to dig deeper into their pockets for the expansion .
the european commission has demanded more money for it , more than € 37 billion will be pumped into the new countries in the coming years .
how can you make that appealing to the taxpayer ? the financing for this expansion round was already decided in berlin in 1999 .
we are spending around € 15 billion less than was then calculated and will get by with a total of € 40 billion until 2006 .
the new countries will pay € 15 billion of that themselves .
all in all , the expansion will cost germany a net total of € 2.5 billion in the first three years .
on the other hand , germany will have an enormous trade balance surplus .
that 's why viewed economically it 's a win-win situation .

it can be best compared with the feelings of a soccer trainer , who for the first time sees his team go play a match and asks himself whether they will all show what they have learned .
of course , i ask myself whether everything will work , if we really did do everything right , if we perhaps overlooked problems .
but my basic feeling is satisfaction for having created this large and meaningful peace project . many germans see it differently .
according to surveys every third german opposes eu expansion .
how do you explain this skepticism ? that 's very easy to explain .

the problems that citizens pinpoint in the context of the expansion - from cross-border criminality to competition problems - are very real .
it 's just that they have nothing to do with the impending expansion .
instead , they are the consequences of the collapse of the communist world of states , the fall of the iron curtain .
that 's why european integration is neither a part nor the origin of the problem , rather the reasonable , perhaps also the only , possible solution to the problem . even so , many people are afraid that businesses will export jobs to the low-wage countries in the eu 's new east ... they have already been doing that for a long time .
that will also continue , but it does n't have anything to do with the expansion either .

it is not a result of european integration but rather a result of economic globalization . what does the expansion offer germans ? in the first place , it 's a peace project .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.04.2004 what german prostitutes want großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not much has changed for prostitutes in germany .
the german government legalized prostitution two years ago , but many sex workers remain reluctant to register with authorities as they continue to experience discrimination , a new study has revealed . sex is big business in germany .
with some 400,000 prostitutes and an annual 1.2 million men who use their services , the yearly turnover has hit a massive € 14 billion -lrb- $ 16.5 billion -rrb- .
but paid sex can be a nasty business .
two years ago the german government introduced a new prostitution law in what was an earnest attempt to protect prostitutes ' working conditions and even offer them some protection against violence and exploitation .
there is even scope for girls on the game to join a union , but that has proved to be something that few have taken advantage of .
at a loss to understand the reluctance among the country 's sex work force to become unionized , the services trade union verdi commissioned hamburg-based social scientist emilija mitrovic to find out why .
mitrovic , who is due to publish the results of her study at the end of the month , has spent a lot of time travelling across germany , talking with prostitutes , brothel owners , police officers and social workers in a bid to find out what difference the new law has made to prostitutes . " the desired effect of the law was to create a better social situation for prostitutes , to do away with the immoral stigma attached to their work , to give them the right to sue for unpaid fees , and make health insurance and social security payments , " mitrovic told deutsche welle . continued discrimination her study , which examined the varying consequences of the law in different cities and states across germany , revealed that the majority of prostitutes in germany still prefer to do the job secretly , because although prostitution is officially legal , sex workers still experience discrimination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a prostitute in frankfurt mitrovic also discovered that women are often put in unnecessarily dangerous situations as a result of arbitrary rules that dictate exactly where they are allowed to tout for business .
these are often dark and dead industrial areas , where the women are far more vulnerable to violence . on top of this , the study showed discrimination from most of germany 's federal job agencies , who will neither broker jobs in the sex industry nor offer retraining .
and even health insurance companies do n't offer any kind of special health provisions for prostitutes . verdi is prepared to fight the exploitation of sex workers , but so far , the union has failed to come up with any concrete solutions .
however , at a conference on the subject of prostitution at the end of april , they will present a sample contract for sex workers . mitrovic believes this is a step forward .
" the contract would regulate holiday pay , sick pay and something very special , namely medical examinations during work time , " she said .
" the contract would also ensure women a fixed income which could be transferred to their bank accounts . " it 's all well and good in theory , but just how likely are the brothel owners and managers to go along with it ?
mitrovic is optimistic and has already found one brothel manager who wants to try out the contract , and who also wants to employ immigrants , and who is looking for legal ways to do this . law does n't apply to all one of the problems with the new prostitution law is that it does nothing to help foreign prostitutes , who constitute almost half of germany sex workers , who do n't have a legal work permit .
without it , they ca n't report ill treatment or exploitation to the police unless they want to run the high risk of subsequent deportation . the sad reality of prostitution in germany is that despite the new law , most prostitutes still work under very poor conditions .
the majority of the money they earn is taken away from them by pimps and landlords and , for those who are trying to work by the book , from the tax office as well . perhaps the biggest problem for prostitutes here is still the way they are treated socially .
on the one hand paid sex is considered a part of 21st century life , but very few women are actually prepared to come out and admit that is what they do . as far as mitrovic is concerned , prostitution wo n't shed its criminal stigma until the pimps put up their hands and confess that they are making money from selling sex , and that it is a socially acceptable thing to do . udo taubitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stolen youth : child prostitution plagues german-czech border the united nations children 's agency says child prostitution is rising across the german border in the czech republic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the new europe the eve of enlargement where is europe headed ? a final report card for new eu members getting the green light europe -pipe- 22.04.2004 verheugen : eu expansion brings peace and profit back to first page back 2/2 the economic differential between the countries of the old europe and many new members is huge .
lithuania and latvia , for example , will need decades to reach our economic level .
how can you ensure that economically a europe of two speeds does n't develop ? you could also ask why greece , an eu member for 30 years , has n't been able to reduce the distance to the rest of the eu - but still no one talks about a europe of two economic speeds .
what we see is a higher speed of growth in the new countries , and that 's good . people talk about 50 to 60 years for some of the new member countries . … but where 's the problem ?
it took a long time with ireland too .
for greece the distance from the average is still the same but in the meantime at a much higher level .
the most important thing is that the new member countries grow , and their growth potential is large .
incidentally , individual citizens ' or businesses ' rights to eu funds do n't arise from eu membership .
it 's not like it was with german unification .
unification has cost € 1.25 trillion so far .
in contrast , expansion can not put us in danger in terms of costs because the eu budget is club funds by nature .
the club ca n't spend one euro more than the members voluntarily put into the club funds . in negotiations with countries such as poland , people had the impression that they want to get the maximum out of europe and only contribute a little .
did that annoy you ? certainly not .
poland negotiated well but no tougher than others ; they are n't getting more either .
even in 2013 , the union 's per capita benefits for poland will be distinctly lower than the per capita benefits for spain .
poland is a large country , a very proud nation , that needs a certain amount of time to find its place and role in the european union .
people should show a little patience and not pillory a country that is encumbered by a formidable historic burden . still , the new members apparently have n't completed the homework that is a condition for receiving eu funds .
for example , corruption in the new member states , such as slovakia or the czech republic , is high .
how will you get that under control ? i ca n't dispute that a certain kind of corruption remains quite strong in these countries - in connection with large-scale privatization , for example .
-lrb- german interior minister -rrb- otto schily once said he thought that around 10 percent of the funds that went to eastern germany in the context of economic reconstruction were illegal .
i would n't estimate the magnitude to be so high for poland and the czech republic .
but it is a typical phenomenon . regarding homework , i would n't agree with your thesis .
on may 1 we will see that the new member countries will assume -lrb- eu -rrb- community law to 100 percent .
while in the old countries more than 2,000 legal actions are underway due to contract breaches , that is , due to the incomplete or completely inadequate application of community law . do you mean to say that the new acceding states are better prepared than earlier acceding states ? it 's safe to say that .
although we have much more extensive and complicated community legislation today .
now there 's much , much more to negotiate .
during earlier expansions , the commission was n't worried about whether the greeks , spanish or portuguese were also capable of applying community law .
this is an entirely new method that we first developed for this expansion . the balkan countries want to join the eu ; the accession of turkey , romania and bulgaria 's is planned for 2007 .
where do you think europe stops ? romania and bulgaria are part of the current round .
and then everything 's open .
the balkan countries do indeed have the prospect of joining , though there 's no schedule for them .
they are still too far away from national or regional stability or also from economic integration - with the exception of croatia , whose accession application has been submitted .
turkey is a special case .
it has had the prospect of joining since 1963 .
at the end of the year it will be decided whether turkey has in the meantime gotten far enough to start negotiations . for the eastern european countries , such as russia , ukraine , but also the caucasus countries or the southern mediterranean countries , membership is not on the agenda .
however , we offer these countries very far-ranging neighborhood policies . your time as expansion commissioner comes to an end on may 1 … correct , i have made myself redundant .
but do n't forget bulgaria , romania and turkey . what will you do afterwards ? i will remain a member of the -lrb- european -rrb- commission until november 1 .
beyond that nothing has been decided .
i have armed myself with great patience . gabriele feil interviewed günter verheugen for tagesschau.de -lrb- ncy -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de croatia inches closer to eu membership the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .
although a start date for accession talks wo n't be confirmed until june , the former yugoslav republic is already en-route to home base .

incidentally , individual citizens ' or businesses ' rights to eu funds do n't arise from eu membership .
it 's not like it was with german unification .
unification has cost € 1.25 trillion so far .
in contrast , expansion can not put us in danger in terms of costs because the eu budget is club funds by nature .
the club ca n't spend one euro more than the members voluntarily put into the club funds . in negotiations with countries such as poland , people had the impression that they want to get the maximum out of europe and only contribute a little .
did that annoy you ? certainly not .
poland negotiated well but no tougher than others ; they are n't getting more either .
even in 2013 , the union 's per capita benefits for poland will be distinctly lower than the per capita benefits for spain .
poland is a large country , a very proud nation , that needs a certain amount of time to find its place and role in the european union .
people should show a little patience and not pillory a country that is encumbered by a formidable historic burden . still , the new members apparently have n't completed the homework that is a condition for receiving eu funds .
for example , corruption in the new member states , such as slovakia or the czech republic , is high .
how will you get that under control ? i ca n't dispute that a certain kind of corruption remains quite strong in these countries - in connection with large-scale privatization , for example .
-lrb- german interior minister -rrb- otto schily once said he thought that around 10 percent of the funds that went to eastern germany in the context of economic reconstruction were illegal .
i would n't estimate the magnitude to be so high for poland and the czech republic .
but it is a typical phenomenon . regarding homework , i would n't agree with your thesis .
on may 1 we will see that the new member countries will assume -lrb- eu -rrb- community law to 100 percent .
while in the old countries more than 2,000 legal actions are underway due to contract breaches , that is , due to the incomplete or completely inadequate application of community law . do you mean to say that the new acceding states are better prepared than earlier acceding states ? it 's safe to say that .
although we have much more extensive and complicated community legislation today .
now there 's much , much more to negotiate .
during earlier expansions , the commission was n't worried about whether the greeks , spanish or portuguese were also capable of applying community law .
this is an entirely new method that we first developed for this expansion . the balkan countries want to join the eu ; the accession of turkey , romania and bulgaria 's is planned for 2007 .
where do you think europe stops ? romania and bulgaria are part of the current round .
and then everything 's open .
the balkan countries do indeed have the prospect of joining , though there 's no schedule for them .
they are still too far away from national or regional stability or also from economic integration - with the exception of croatia , whose accession application has been submitted .
turkey is a special case .
it has had the prospect of joining since 1963 .
at the end of the year it will be decided whether turkey has in the meantime gotten far enough to start negotiations . for the eastern european countries , such as russia , ukraine , but also the caucasus countries or the southern mediterranean countries , membership is not on the agenda .
however , we offer these countries very far-ranging neighborhood policies . your time as expansion commissioner comes to an end on may 1 … correct , i have made myself redundant .

swiss pharmaceutical giant novartis said on thursday it would enter merger talks with france 's aventis , possibly preventing a bid by rival sanofi-synthelabo which is backed by the french government . basel-based novartis said it would begin negotiations with aventis despite previous reservations about interference by government officials in paris , who have made clear they would prefer an all-french linkup with sanofi-synthelabo .
if successful , the merged novartis-aventis would create the world 's second-largest pharmaceutical firm after the u.s.-based pfizer . a spokesman for aventis , which itself was created from a merger of france 's rhone-poulenc and germany 's hoechst in 2000 , said the company was pleased by novartis ' willingness to negotiate , but remained cautious about the final outcome of the talks . " we welcome this decision , -lsb- but -rsb- no assurances can be given that an agreement can be reached , " spokesman tony rodham told the associated press .
aventis 's board invited novartis to enter talks three weeks ago . the announcement strengthens aventis ' hand in its attempt to fend off a hostile bid from much smaller french rival sanofi-synthelabo , which has offered to pay € 45 billion -lrb- $ 53.2 billion -rrb- for the company .
that encouraged novartis to get involved , but the swiss were then put off by comments from french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , who said he would prefer a french-only merger in order to help protect the country 's national interests . " we 're not at the endgame here yet , " richard jarvis , a pharmaceutical analyst at pictet & cie in london , told bloomberg news .
" the french government has n't changed their position and novartis is keen to try and persuade them .
it 's not completely in their hands and it is n't just in the hands of aventis shareholders at present . " aventis sees risks with sanofi however , since aventis has shown no interest in merging with sanofi-synthelabo and the french government would have to justify blocking any deal to the european union , novartis now appears ready to risk rankling paris . " a combination with aventis has a very convincing industrial logic .
it creates value and it addresses the legitimate concerns of the french government , " novartis chief financial officer raymond breu told reporters on thursday . strasbourg-based aventis has said novartis would be a much stronger partner than sanofi , which faces possible patent challenges to some of its more important drugs such as its plavix blood-thinner . although half the size of it 's competitor , sanofi is asking for a 100 percent takeover of aventis and demanding 50 percent of aventis shares and voting rights - a bold move that sanofi is able to make because of aventis ' currently weaker financial position . unions opposed novartis would protect aventis from sanofi , but the firm 's unions are opposed to a merger with the swiss and on thursday showed they would not shy away from using concerns about france 's national interest to try and hinder a deal . bloomberg reported that the unions sent a letter to french finance minister nicolas sarkozy , saying an aventis novartis merger would mean " france would have to give up its independence on products as crucial as vaccines and antibiotics , not to speak of the industrial and research sacrifice . " novartis shares were down 2.4 percent to 57.35 swiss francs -lrb- us $ 43.64 -rrb- in early trading on the zurich exchange following the announcement , and aventis shares rose 2.7 percent to € 64.45 -lrb- us $ 76.53 -rrb- in early paris trading . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis posts profits to ward off hostile takeover bid the french-german pharmaceutical company aventis announced growing profits for 2003 in an effort to ward off a hostile takeover bid from a smaller french drug firm .

swiss pharmaceutical giant novartis said on thursday it would enter merger talks with france 's aventis , possibly preventing a bid by rival sanofi-synthelabo which is backed by the french government . basel-based novartis said it would begin negotiations with aventis despite previous reservations about interference by government officials in paris , who have made clear they would prefer an all-french linkup with sanofi-synthelabo .
if successful , the merged novartis-aventis would create the world 's second-largest pharmaceutical firm after the u.s.-based pfizer . a spokesman for aventis , which itself was created from a merger of france 's rhone-poulenc and germany 's hoechst in 2000 , said the company was pleased by novartis ' willingness to negotiate , but remained cautious about the final outcome of the talks . " we welcome this decision , -lsb- but -rsb- no assurances can be given that an agreement can be reached , " spokesman tony rodham told the associated press .
aventis 's board invited novartis to enter talks three weeks ago . the announcement strengthens aventis ' hand in its attempt to fend off a hostile bid from much smaller french rival sanofi-synthelabo , which has offered to pay € 45 billion -lrb- $ 53.2 billion -rrb- for the company .
that encouraged novartis to get involved , but the swiss were then put off by comments from french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , who said he would prefer a french-only merger in order to help protect the country 's national interests . " we 're not at the endgame here yet , " richard jarvis , a pharmaceutical analyst at pictet & cie in london , told bloomberg news .
" the french government has n't changed their position and novartis is keen to try and persuade them .
it 's not completely in their hands and it is n't just in the hands of aventis shareholders at present . " aventis sees risks with sanofi however , since aventis has shown no interest in merging with sanofi-synthelabo and the french government would have to justify blocking any deal to the european union , novartis now appears ready to risk rankling paris . " a combination with aventis has a very convincing industrial logic .
it creates value and it addresses the legitimate concerns of the french government , " novartis chief financial officer raymond breu told reporters on thursday . strasbourg-based aventis has said novartis would be a much stronger partner than sanofi , which faces possible patent challenges to some of its more important drugs such as its plavix blood-thinner . although half the size of it 's competitor , sanofi is asking for a 100 percent takeover of aventis and demanding 50 percent of aventis shares and voting rights - a bold move that sanofi is able to make because of aventis ' currently weaker financial position . unions opposed novartis would protect aventis from sanofi , but the firm 's unions are opposed to a merger with the swiss and on thursday showed they would not shy away from using concerns about france 's national interest to try and hinder a deal . bloomberg reported that the unions sent a letter to french finance minister nicolas sarkozy , saying an aventis novartis merger would mean " france would have to give up its independence on products as crucial as vaccines and antibiotics , not to speak of the industrial and research sacrifice . " novartis shares were down 2.4 percent to 57.35 swiss francs -lrb- us $ 43.64 -rrb- in early trading on the zurich exchange following the announcement , and aventis shares rose 2.7 percent to € 64.45 -lrb- us $ 76.53 -rrb- in early paris trading . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis posts profits to ward off hostile takeover bid the french-german pharmaceutical company aventis announced growing profits for 2003 in an effort to ward off a hostile takeover bid from a smaller french drug firm .

lithuania and latvia , for example , will need decades to reach our economic level .
how can you ensure that economically a europe of two speeds does n't develop ? you could also ask why greece , an eu member for 30 years , has n't been able to reduce the distance to the rest of the eu - but still no one talks about a europe of two economic speeds .
what we see is a higher speed of growth in the new countries , and that 's good . people talk about 50 to 60 years for some of the new member countries . … but where 's the problem ?
it took a long time with ireland too .
for greece the distance from the average is still the same but in the meantime at a much higher level .
the most important thing is that the new member countries grow , and their growth potential is large .
incidentally , individual citizens ' or businesses ' rights to eu funds do n't arise from eu membership .
it 's not like it was with german unification .
unification has cost € 1.25 trillion so far .
in contrast , expansion can not put us in danger in terms of costs because the eu budget is club funds by nature .
the club ca n't spend one euro more than the members voluntarily put into the club funds . in negotiations with countries such as poland , people had the impression that they want to get the maximum out of europe and only contribute a little .
did that annoy you ? certainly not .
poland negotiated well but no tougher than others ; they are n't getting more either .
even in 2013 , the union 's per capita benefits for poland will be distinctly lower than the per capita benefits for spain .
poland is a large country , a very proud nation , that needs a certain amount of time to find its place and role in the european union .
people should show a little patience and not pillory a country that is encumbered by a formidable historic burden . still , the new members apparently have n't completed the homework that is a condition for receiving eu funds .
for example , corruption in the new member states , such as slovakia or the czech republic , is high .
how will you get that under control ? i ca n't dispute that a certain kind of corruption remains quite strong in these countries - in connection with large-scale privatization , for example .
-lrb- german interior minister -rrb- otto schily once said he thought that around 10 percent of the funds that went to eastern germany in the context of economic reconstruction were illegal .
i would n't estimate the magnitude to be so high for poland and the czech republic .
but it is a typical phenomenon . regarding homework , i would n't agree with your thesis .
on may 1 we will see that the new member countries will assume -lrb- eu -rrb- community law to 100 percent .
while in the old countries more than 2,000 legal actions are underway due to contract breaches , that is , due to the incomplete or completely inadequate application of community law . do you mean to say that the new acceding states are better prepared than earlier acceding states ? it 's safe to say that .
although we have much more extensive and complicated community legislation today .
now there 's much , much more to negotiate .
during earlier expansions , the commission was n't worried about whether the greeks , spanish or portuguese were also capable of applying community law .
this is an entirely new method that we first developed for this expansion . the balkan countries want to join the eu ; the accession of turkey , romania and bulgaria 's is planned for 2007 .
where do you think europe stops ? romania and bulgaria are part of the current round .
and then everything 's open .
the balkan countries do indeed have the prospect of joining , though there 's no schedule for them .
they are still too far away from national or regional stability or also from economic integration - with the exception of croatia , whose accession application has been submitted .
turkey is a special case .
it has had the prospect of joining since 1963 .
at the end of the year it will be decided whether turkey has in the meantime gotten far enough to start negotiations . for the eastern european countries , such as russia , ukraine , but also the caucasus countries or the southern mediterranean countries , membership is not on the agenda .
however , we offer these countries very far-ranging neighborhood policies . your time as expansion commissioner comes to an end on may 1 … correct , i have made myself redundant .
but do n't forget bulgaria , romania and turkey . what will you do afterwards ? i will remain a member of the -lrb- european -rrb- commission until november 1 .
beyond that nothing has been decided .

on may 1 , the eu will grow to a 25 member bloc of states .
dw-world content partner tagesschau.de spoke to günter verheugen , who has been responsible for designing the current round of eu expansion . günter verheugen is the eu executive 's commissioner for expansion .
german public broadcaster tagesschau.de spoke to verheugen about the fears , expectations and future of european union expansion . tagesschau.de : you are the architect of this eu expansion ; for years you 've been working toward may 1 , 2004 .
what does this day mean to you personally ? günter verheugen : gratification , relief - but also a very muted feeling of concern or trepidation .
it can be best compared with the feelings of a soccer trainer , who for the first time sees his team go play a match and asks himself whether they will all show what they have learned .
of course , i ask myself whether everything will work , if we really did do everything right , if we perhaps overlooked problems .
but my basic feeling is satisfaction for having created this large and meaningful peace project . many germans see it differently .
according to surveys every third german opposes eu expansion .
how do you explain this skepticism ? that 's very easy to explain .
as always when people are confronted by something that they do n't know well , they react with fear .
the problem is that there has n't been any sizable and broad political debate on this topic .
and that 's why expansion has n't really registered with people .
now that it 's directly imminent it has an enormous media presence : something 's coming , but what is it ?
the problems that citizens pinpoint in the context of the expansion - from cross-border criminality to competition problems - are very real .
it 's just that they have nothing to do with the impending expansion .
instead , they are the consequences of the collapse of the communist world of states , the fall of the iron curtain .
that 's why european integration is neither a part nor the origin of the problem , rather the reasonable , perhaps also the only , possible solution to the problem . even so , many people are afraid that businesses will export jobs to the low-wage countries in the eu 's new east ... they have already been doing that for a long time .
that will also continue , but it does n't have anything to do with the expansion either .
for , the result of the expansion is that these countries will not remain low-wage countries .
through their eu membership , the competitive situation in the old member states will improve .
from -lrb- the moment of -rrb- entry , the new members must assume our social standards , our environmental standards and our professional standards ; they must observe our competition and subsidy regulations .
that means that the cost advantages that they now have will decrease gradually .
the outsourcing or migration of production components is a process that we have been observing for 40 years .
it is not a result of european integration but rather a result of economic globalization . what does the expansion offer germans ? in the first place , it 's a peace project .
it creates peace , stability , and safety in the region of europe that immediately borders germany .
people there have known for years what political , economic and financial results instability leads to .
german soldiers are in kosovo , german soldiers are in bosnia … in kosovo alone , for one million people , europe raised € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- to maintain the ceasefire .
peace pays off , after all .
as luxemburg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , said : a year of peace costs less than a day of war ! the second is an enormous economic profit - especially for germany .
it arises from -lrb- the fact -rrb- that this economic area will be populated after all by 110 million people , if we include romania and bulgaria , and everywhere here there is an immense unsatisfied demand .
we have very stabile , very robust growth rates in these countries , that are noticeably above the growth rates in the remainder of the eu .
the export-oriented german economy profits particularly from this quickly growing market . but initially the germans will have to dig deeper into their pockets for the expansion .
the european commission has demanded more money for it , more than € 37 billion will be pumped into the new countries in the coming years .
how can you make that appealing to the taxpayer ? the financing for this expansion round was already decided in berlin in 1999 .
we are spending around € 15 billion less than was then calculated and will get by with a total of € 40 billion until 2006 .
the new countries will pay € 15 billion of that themselves .
all in all , the expansion will cost germany a net total of € 2.5 billion in the first three years .
on the other hand , germany will have an enormous trade balance surplus .
that 's why viewed economically it 's a win-win situation .
it makes no sense to say that the expansion will lead to an additional burden for the germans . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de croatia inches closer to eu membership the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .

dw-world content partner tagesschau.de spoke to günter verheugen , who has been responsible for designing the current round of eu expansion . günter verheugen is the eu executive 's commissioner for expansion .
german public broadcaster tagesschau.de spoke to verheugen about the fears , expectations and future of european union expansion . tagesschau.de : you are the architect of this eu expansion ; for years you 've been working toward may 1 , 2004 .
what does this day mean to you personally ? günter verheugen : gratification , relief - but also a very muted feeling of concern or trepidation .
it can be best compared with the feelings of a soccer trainer , who for the first time sees his team go play a match and asks himself whether they will all show what they have learned .
of course , i ask myself whether everything will work , if we really did do everything right , if we perhaps overlooked problems .
but my basic feeling is satisfaction for having created this large and meaningful peace project . many germans see it differently .
according to surveys every third german opposes eu expansion .
how do you explain this skepticism ? that 's very easy to explain .
as always when people are confronted by something that they do n't know well , they react with fear .
the problem is that there has n't been any sizable and broad political debate on this topic .
and that 's why expansion has n't really registered with people .
now that it 's directly imminent it has an enormous media presence : something 's coming , but what is it ?
the problems that citizens pinpoint in the context of the expansion - from cross-border criminality to competition problems - are very real .
it 's just that they have nothing to do with the impending expansion .
instead , they are the consequences of the collapse of the communist world of states , the fall of the iron curtain .
that 's why european integration is neither a part nor the origin of the problem , rather the reasonable , perhaps also the only , possible solution to the problem . even so , many people are afraid that businesses will export jobs to the low-wage countries in the eu 's new east ... they have already been doing that for a long time .
that will also continue , but it does n't have anything to do with the expansion either .
for , the result of the expansion is that these countries will not remain low-wage countries .
through their eu membership , the competitive situation in the old member states will improve .
from -lrb- the moment of -rrb- entry , the new members must assume our social standards , our environmental standards and our professional standards ; they must observe our competition and subsidy regulations .
that means that the cost advantages that they now have will decrease gradually .
the outsourcing or migration of production components is a process that we have been observing for 40 years .
it is not a result of european integration but rather a result of economic globalization . what does the expansion offer germans ? in the first place , it 's a peace project .
it creates peace , stability , and safety in the region of europe that immediately borders germany .

german soldiers are in kosovo , german soldiers are in bosnia … in kosovo alone , for one million people , europe raised € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- to maintain the ceasefire .

it arises from -lrb- the fact -rrb- that this economic area will be populated after all by 110 million people , if we include romania and bulgaria , and everywhere here there is an immense unsatisfied demand .
we have very stabile , very robust growth rates in these countries , that are noticeably above the growth rates in the remainder of the eu .
the export-oriented german economy profits particularly from this quickly growing market . but initially the germans will have to dig deeper into their pockets for the expansion .
the european commission has demanded more money for it , more than € 37 billion will be pumped into the new countries in the coming years .
how can you make that appealing to the taxpayer ? the financing for this expansion round was already decided in berlin in 1999 .
we are spending around € 15 billion less than was then calculated and will get by with a total of € 40 billion until 2006 .
the new countries will pay € 15 billion of that themselves .
all in all , the expansion will cost germany a net total of € 2.5 billion in the first three years .
on the other hand , germany will have an enormous trade balance surplus .
that 's why viewed economically it 's a win-win situation .

dw-world content partner tagesschau.de spoke to günter verheugen , who has been responsible for designing the current round of eu expansion . günter verheugen is the eu executive 's commissioner for expansion .
german public broadcaster tagesschau.de spoke to verheugen about the fears , expectations and future of european union expansion . tagesschau.de : you are the architect of this eu expansion ; for years you 've been working toward may 1 , 2004 .
what does this day mean to you personally ? günter verheugen : gratification , relief - but also a very muted feeling of concern or trepidation .
it can be best compared with the feelings of a soccer trainer , who for the first time sees his team go play a match and asks himself whether they will all show what they have learned .
of course , i ask myself whether everything will work , if we really did do everything right , if we perhaps overlooked problems .
but my basic feeling is satisfaction for having created this large and meaningful peace project . many germans see it differently .
according to surveys every third german opposes eu expansion .
how do you explain this skepticism ? that 's very easy to explain .
as always when people are confronted by something that they do n't know well , they react with fear .
the problem is that there has n't been any sizable and broad political debate on this topic .
and that 's why expansion has n't really registered with people .
now that it 's directly imminent it has an enormous media presence : something 's coming , but what is it ?
the problems that citizens pinpoint in the context of the expansion - from cross-border criminality to competition problems - are very real .
it 's just that they have nothing to do with the impending expansion .
instead , they are the consequences of the collapse of the communist world of states , the fall of the iron curtain .
that 's why european integration is neither a part nor the origin of the problem , rather the reasonable , perhaps also the only , possible solution to the problem . even so , many people are afraid that businesses will export jobs to the low-wage countries in the eu 's new east ... they have already been doing that for a long time .
that will also continue , but it does n't have anything to do with the expansion either .
for , the result of the expansion is that these countries will not remain low-wage countries .
through their eu membership , the competitive situation in the old member states will improve .
from -lrb- the moment of -rrb- entry , the new members must assume our social standards , our environmental standards and our professional standards ; they must observe our competition and subsidy regulations .
that means that the cost advantages that they now have will decrease gradually .
the outsourcing or migration of production components is a process that we have been observing for 40 years .
it is not a result of european integration but rather a result of economic globalization . what does the expansion offer germans ? in the first place , it 's a peace project .
it creates peace , stability , and safety in the region of europe that immediately borders germany .
people there have known for years what political , economic and financial results instability leads to .
german soldiers are in kosovo , german soldiers are in bosnia … in kosovo alone , for one million people , europe raised € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- to maintain the ceasefire .
peace pays off , after all .
as luxemburg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , said : a year of peace costs less than a day of war ! the second is an enormous economic profit - especially for germany .
it arises from -lrb- the fact -rrb- that this economic area will be populated after all by 110 million people , if we include romania and bulgaria , and everywhere here there is an immense unsatisfied demand .
we have very stabile , very robust growth rates in these countries , that are noticeably above the growth rates in the remainder of the eu .
the export-oriented german economy profits particularly from this quickly growing market . but initially the germans will have to dig deeper into their pockets for the expansion .
the european commission has demanded more money for it , more than € 37 billion will be pumped into the new countries in the coming years .
how can you make that appealing to the taxpayer ? the financing for this expansion round was already decided in berlin in 1999 .
we are spending around € 15 billion less than was then calculated and will get by with a total of € 40 billion until 2006 .
the new countries will pay € 15 billion of that themselves .
all in all , the expansion will cost germany a net total of € 2.5 billion in the first three years .
on the other hand , germany will have an enormous trade balance surplus .
that 's why viewed economically it 's a win-win situation .
it makes no sense to say that the expansion will lead to an additional burden for the germans . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de croatia inches closer to eu membership the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.04.2004 novartis to join merger talks with aventis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deal with novartis would make the world 's second-largest drug company .
swiss pharmaceutical giant novartis said on thursday it would enter merger talks with france 's aventis , possibly preventing a bid by rival sanofi-synthelabo which is backed by the french government . basel-based novartis said it would begin negotiations with aventis despite previous reservations about interference by government officials in paris , who have made clear they would prefer an all-french linkup with sanofi-synthelabo .
if successful , the merged novartis-aventis would create the world 's second-largest pharmaceutical firm after the u.s.-based pfizer . a spokesman for aventis , which itself was created from a merger of france 's rhone-poulenc and germany 's hoechst in 2000 , said the company was pleased by novartis ' willingness to negotiate , but remained cautious about the final outcome of the talks . " we welcome this decision , -lsb- but -rsb- no assurances can be given that an agreement can be reached , " spokesman tony rodham told the associated press .
aventis 's board invited novartis to enter talks three weeks ago . the announcement strengthens aventis ' hand in its attempt to fend off a hostile bid from much smaller french rival sanofi-synthelabo , which has offered to pay € 45 billion -lrb- $ 53.2 billion -rrb- for the company .
that encouraged novartis to get involved , but the swiss were then put off by comments from french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , who said he would prefer a french-only merger in order to help protect the country 's national interests . " we 're not at the endgame here yet , " richard jarvis , a pharmaceutical analyst at pictet & cie in london , told bloomberg news .
" the french government has n't changed their position and novartis is keen to try and persuade them .
it 's not completely in their hands and it is n't just in the hands of aventis shareholders at present . " aventis sees risks with sanofi however , since aventis has shown no interest in merging with sanofi-synthelabo and the french government would have to justify blocking any deal to the european union , novartis now appears ready to risk rankling paris . " a combination with aventis has a very convincing industrial logic .
it creates value and it addresses the legitimate concerns of the french government , " novartis chief financial officer raymond breu told reporters on thursday . strasbourg-based aventis has said novartis would be a much stronger partner than sanofi , which faces possible patent challenges to some of its more important drugs such as its plavix blood-thinner . although half the size of it 's competitor , sanofi is asking for a 100 percent takeover of aventis and demanding 50 percent of aventis shares and voting rights - a bold move that sanofi is able to make because of aventis ' currently weaker financial position . unions opposed novartis would protect aventis from sanofi , but the firm 's unions are opposed to a merger with the swiss and on thursday showed they would not shy away from using concerns about france 's national interest to try and hinder a deal . bloomberg reported that the unions sent a letter to french finance minister nicolas sarkozy , saying an aventis novartis merger would mean " france would have to give up its independence on products as crucial as vaccines and antibiotics , not to speak of the industrial and research sacrifice . " novartis shares were down 2.4 percent to 57.35 swiss francs -lrb- us $ 43.64 -rrb- in early trading on the zurich exchange following the announcement , and aventis shares rose 2.7 percent to € 64.45 -lrb- us $ 76.53 -rrb- in early paris trading . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis posts profits to ward off hostile takeover bid the french-german pharmaceutical company aventis announced growing profits for 2003 in an effort to ward off a hostile takeover bid from a smaller french drug firm .

on may 1 , the eu will grow to a 25 member bloc of states .
dw-world content partner tagesschau.de spoke to günter verheugen , who has been responsible for designing the current round of eu expansion . günter verheugen is the eu executive 's commissioner for expansion .
german public broadcaster tagesschau.de spoke to verheugen about the fears , expectations and future of european union expansion . tagesschau.de : you are the architect of this eu expansion ; for years you 've been working toward may 1 , 2004 .
what does this day mean to you personally ? günter verheugen : gratification , relief - but also a very muted feeling of concern or trepidation .
it can be best compared with the feelings of a soccer trainer , who for the first time sees his team go play a match and asks himself whether they will all show what they have learned .
of course , i ask myself whether everything will work , if we really did do everything right , if we perhaps overlooked problems .
but my basic feeling is satisfaction for having created this large and meaningful peace project . many germans see it differently .
according to surveys every third german opposes eu expansion .
how do you explain this skepticism ? that 's very easy to explain .
as always when people are confronted by something that they do n't know well , they react with fear .
the problem is that there has n't been any sizable and broad political debate on this topic .
and that 's why expansion has n't really registered with people .
now that it 's directly imminent it has an enormous media presence : something 's coming , but what is it ?
the problems that citizens pinpoint in the context of the expansion - from cross-border criminality to competition problems - are very real .
it 's just that they have nothing to do with the impending expansion .
instead , they are the consequences of the collapse of the communist world of states , the fall of the iron curtain .
that 's why european integration is neither a part nor the origin of the problem , rather the reasonable , perhaps also the only , possible solution to the problem . even so , many people are afraid that businesses will export jobs to the low-wage countries in the eu 's new east ... they have already been doing that for a long time .
that will also continue , but it does n't have anything to do with the expansion either .
for , the result of the expansion is that these countries will not remain low-wage countries .
through their eu membership , the competitive situation in the old member states will improve .
from -lrb- the moment of -rrb- entry , the new members must assume our social standards , our environmental standards and our professional standards ; they must observe our competition and subsidy regulations .
that means that the cost advantages that they now have will decrease gradually .
the outsourcing or migration of production components is a process that we have been observing for 40 years .
it is not a result of european integration but rather a result of economic globalization . what does the expansion offer germans ? in the first place , it 's a peace project .
it creates peace , stability , and safety in the region of europe that immediately borders germany .
people there have known for years what political , economic and financial results instability leads to .
german soldiers are in kosovo , german soldiers are in bosnia … in kosovo alone , for one million people , europe raised € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- to maintain the ceasefire .
peace pays off , after all .
as luxemburg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , said : a year of peace costs less than a day of war ! the second is an enormous economic profit - especially for germany .
it arises from -lrb- the fact -rrb- that this economic area will be populated after all by 110 million people , if we include romania and bulgaria , and everywhere here there is an immense unsatisfied demand .
we have very stabile , very robust growth rates in these countries , that are noticeably above the growth rates in the remainder of the eu .
the export-oriented german economy profits particularly from this quickly growing market . but initially the germans will have to dig deeper into their pockets for the expansion .
the european commission has demanded more money for it , more than € 37 billion will be pumped into the new countries in the coming years .
how can you make that appealing to the taxpayer ? the financing for this expansion round was already decided in berlin in 1999 .
we are spending around € 15 billion less than was then calculated and will get by with a total of € 40 billion until 2006 .
the new countries will pay € 15 billion of that themselves .
all in all , the expansion will cost germany a net total of € 2.5 billion in the first three years .
on the other hand , germany will have an enormous trade balance surplus .
that 's why viewed economically it 's a win-win situation .
it makes no sense to say that the expansion will lead to an additional burden for the germans . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de croatia inches closer to eu membership the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .

swiss pharmaceutical giant novartis said on thursday it would enter merger talks with france 's aventis , possibly preventing a bid by rival sanofi-synthelabo which is backed by the french government . basel-based novartis said it would begin negotiations with aventis despite previous reservations about interference by government officials in paris , who have made clear they would prefer an all-french linkup with sanofi-synthelabo .
if successful , the merged novartis-aventis would create the world 's second-largest pharmaceutical firm after the u.s.-based pfizer . a spokesman for aventis , which itself was created from a merger of france 's rhone-poulenc and germany 's hoechst in 2000 , said the company was pleased by novartis ' willingness to negotiate , but remained cautious about the final outcome of the talks . " we welcome this decision , -lsb- but -rsb- no assurances can be given that an agreement can be reached , " spokesman tony rodham told the associated press .
aventis 's board invited novartis to enter talks three weeks ago . the announcement strengthens aventis ' hand in its attempt to fend off a hostile bid from much smaller french rival sanofi-synthelabo , which has offered to pay € 45 billion -lrb- $ 53.2 billion -rrb- for the company .
that encouraged novartis to get involved , but the swiss were then put off by comments from french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin , who said he would prefer a french-only merger in order to help protect the country 's national interests . " we 're not at the endgame here yet , " richard jarvis , a pharmaceutical analyst at pictet & cie in london , told bloomberg news .
" the french government has n't changed their position and novartis is keen to try and persuade them .
it 's not completely in their hands and it is n't just in the hands of aventis shareholders at present . " aventis sees risks with sanofi however , since aventis has shown no interest in merging with sanofi-synthelabo and the french government would have to justify blocking any deal to the european union , novartis now appears ready to risk rankling paris . " a combination with aventis has a very convincing industrial logic .
it creates value and it addresses the legitimate concerns of the french government , " novartis chief financial officer raymond breu told reporters on thursday . strasbourg-based aventis has said novartis would be a much stronger partner than sanofi , which faces possible patent challenges to some of its more important drugs such as its plavix blood-thinner . although half the size of it 's competitor , sanofi is asking for a 100 percent takeover of aventis and demanding 50 percent of aventis shares and voting rights - a bold move that sanofi is able to make because of aventis ' currently weaker financial position . unions opposed novartis would protect aventis from sanofi , but the firm 's unions are opposed to a merger with the swiss and on thursday showed they would not shy away from using concerns about france 's national interest to try and hinder a deal . bloomberg reported that the unions sent a letter to french finance minister nicolas sarkozy , saying an aventis novartis merger would mean " france would have to give up its independence on products as crucial as vaccines and antibiotics , not to speak of the industrial and research sacrifice . " novartis shares were down 2.4 percent to 57.35 swiss francs -lrb- us $ 43.64 -rrb- in early trading on the zurich exchange following the announcement , and aventis shares rose 2.7 percent to € 64.45 -lrb- us $ 76.53 -rrb- in early paris trading . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis posts profits to ward off hostile takeover bid the french-german pharmaceutical company aventis announced growing profits for 2003 in an effort to ward off a hostile takeover bid from a smaller french drug firm .

according to reports , the deal will mean that some subsidies are no longer linked to production , theoretically reducing incentives for overproduction .
concerns over the social consequences of funding tobacco production and harming cotton producers from developing countries appear to have marginally outweighed the economic interests of france , greece , italy , portugal and spain .
many developing countries are dependent on cotton and tobacco , and olive oil is a staple of the mediterranean economy as well as the diet .
the move mirrors one made last year when agriculture ministers agreed to break the link between production and subsidies in the eu ’ s common agricultural policy , but olive oil , cotton and tobacco were excluded from that agreement .
reforms of these sectors will come into effect in 2006 , although major exceptions apply .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.04.2004 -pipe- 15:00 utc politicians , people polled on reform process the results of two separate surveys on germany 's reform process have been published , which , taken together , provide an insight into how both the population and the politicians see the current situation .
the forsa institute polled 1,300 politicians across the country , while an online survey conducted by the consulting group mckinsey sought the views of over 450,000 citizens .
the results ?
both a majority of politicians and citizens agree that the reform process is necessary .
a majority of political representatives thought that germany 's problems are often played down by politicians .
that could explain the overwhelming majority of citizens who say they 've lost trust in the government and unions .
most citizens are prepared to accept major reforms , especially if they address their main concerns , which include better schools , better conditions for families with children , and a more dynamic economy .
however , they draw the line at toying with germany 's job protection laws .
only 28 percent said they 'd accept more flexible hiring and firing practices , even if that meant more job creation . more briefs 22.04.2004 -pipe- german comeback in cannes 21.04.2004 -pipe- german military mulls scrapping sex ban on bases 21.04.2004 -pipe- mother tries to auction daughter on ebay 21.04.2004 -pipe- possible new start for nazi documentation center 21.04.2004 -pipe- rau visits holocaust memorial in budapest 21.04.2004 -pipe- two germans die in fighter jet collision 20.04.2004 -pipe- germans spend less than one hour a day reading 20.04.2004 -pipe- german film prize nominations announced radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" such matters should be decided by parliament , not left to the courts , " union chief bernhard gertz told deutsche welle .
gertz was referring to a decision by an administrative court in cologne that ruled in favor of a 21-year old conscript who sued the bundeswehr , arguing that conscription was an arbitrary process with no basic legal guidelines .
the court 's verdict has once again sparked political debate over germany 's mandatory military service , with leading green politicians demanding that conscription be abolished in favor of a professional army . dw-world.de germany set to abolish the draft young german men could soon be free of compulsory military service .
but abolishing the draft may pose a serious problem for the social system , which depends on those men that opt for the alternative - community service .

wella and gucci disagree over how long the german company can make perfumes and fragrances under the gucci brand , a spokesman for wella 's cosmopolitan cosmetics unit said .
the german firm believes it has a 50-year contract to develop , produce and sell gucci fragrances including rush , envy , accenti , nobile or eau de gucci , while the upscale french-owned gucci claims the contract ran out in 2003 .
lawsuits have been filed simultaneously in new york , milan and cologne , but wella said it was keen to reach an out-of-court settlement .
wella 's fragrances division , which employs more than 2,500 , is one of the company 's strongest performing businesses .
it accounts for about a quarter of total wella sales . more briefs 22.04.2004 -pipe- german economy minister meets novartis chief 21.04.2004 -pipe- study says germany need not fear eu enlargement 21.04.2004 -pipe- more german women opt to become their own bosses 21.04.2004 -pipe- german minister mulls easing shopping hours 21.04.2004 -pipe- eu threatens suit over germany 's can deposit law 20.04.2004 -pipe- spd , greens want more expensive air travel 20.04.2004 -pipe- more pessimism about german economic recovery 20.04.2004 -pipe- puma chases record profits radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

lawsuits have been filed simultaneously in new york , milan and cologne , but wella said it was keen to reach an out-of-court settlement .

the german government legalized prostitution two years ago , but many sex workers remain reluctant to register with authorities as they continue to experience discrimination , a new study has revealed . sex is big business in germany .
with some 400,000 prostitutes and an annual 1.2 million men who use their services , the yearly turnover has hit a massive € 14 billion -lrb- $ 16.5 billion -rrb- .
but paid sex can be a nasty business .
two years ago the german government introduced a new prostitution law in what was an earnest attempt to protect prostitutes ' working conditions and even offer them some protection against violence and exploitation .
there is even scope for girls on the game to join a union , but that has proved to be something that few have taken advantage of .
at a loss to understand the reluctance among the country 's sex work force to become unionized , the services trade union verdi commissioned hamburg-based social scientist emilija mitrovic to find out why .
mitrovic , who is due to publish the results of her study at the end of the month , has spent a lot of time travelling across germany , talking with prostitutes , brothel owners , police officers and social workers in a bid to find out what difference the new law has made to prostitutes . " the desired effect of the law was to create a better social situation for prostitutes , to do away with the immoral stigma attached to their work , to give them the right to sue for unpaid fees , and make health insurance and social security payments , " mitrovic told deutsche welle . continued discrimination her study , which examined the varying consequences of the law in different cities and states across germany , revealed that the majority of prostitutes in germany still prefer to do the job secretly , because although prostitution is officially legal , sex workers still experience discrimination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a prostitute in frankfurt mitrovic also discovered that women are often put in unnecessarily dangerous situations as a result of arbitrary rules that dictate exactly where they are allowed to tout for business .
these are often dark and dead industrial areas , where the women are far more vulnerable to violence . on top of this , the study showed discrimination from most of germany 's federal job agencies , who will neither broker jobs in the sex industry nor offer retraining .
and even health insurance companies do n't offer any kind of special health provisions for prostitutes . verdi is prepared to fight the exploitation of sex workers , but so far , the union has failed to come up with any concrete solutions .
however , at a conference on the subject of prostitution at the end of april , they will present a sample contract for sex workers . mitrovic believes this is a step forward .
" the contract would regulate holiday pay , sick pay and something very special , namely medical examinations during work time , " she said .
" the contract would also ensure women a fixed income which could be transferred to their bank accounts . " it 's all well and good in theory , but just how likely are the brothel owners and managers to go along with it ?
mitrovic is optimistic and has already found one brothel manager who wants to try out the contract , and who also wants to employ immigrants , and who is looking for legal ways to do this . law does n't apply to all one of the problems with the new prostitution law is that it does nothing to help foreign prostitutes , who constitute almost half of germany sex workers , who do n't have a legal work permit .
without it , they ca n't report ill treatment or exploitation to the police unless they want to run the high risk of subsequent deportation . the sad reality of prostitution in germany is that despite the new law , most prostitutes still work under very poor conditions .
the majority of the money they earn is taken away from them by pimps and landlords and , for those who are trying to work by the book , from the tax office as well . perhaps the biggest problem for prostitutes here is still the way they are treated socially .
on the one hand paid sex is considered a part of 21st century life , but very few women are actually prepared to come out and admit that is what they do . as far as mitrovic is concerned , prostitution wo n't shed its criminal stigma until the pimps put up their hands and confess that they are making money from selling sex , and that it is a socially acceptable thing to do . udo taubitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stolen youth : child prostitution plagues german-czech border the united nations children 's agency says child prostitution is rising across the german border in the czech republic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.04.2004 german press review : the new face of the bundesbank editorial writers on thursday praise the nomination of axel weber as germany 's next central bank chief and give mixed reviews to a government minister 's proposal to extend store opening hours . most editorials seem to agree that axel weber 's nomination as the new central bank head has helped prevent a potentially dangerous display of political partisanship on the part of the ruling spd-green coalition and its finance minister , hans eichel .
the frankfurter rundschau called weber , a professor from the university of cologne , " a brilliant social scientist " and said he enjoys " an excellent reputation in economics circles . "
two years ago he was called up to be one of the " five wise men , " independent economists who advise the federal government .
" thus , he 's not just a theorist , but has done practical research and knows about the real question of how changing interest rates affect the economy . "
the nürnberger nachrichten compared weber to other possible candidates , such as the bank 's vice president , jürgen stark .
the paper 's editors pointed out that he was also touched by the scandal that brought down the bank 's recently resigned leader , ernst welteke .
weber seems to the paper to be a man who gets praise from all sides .
die welt from berlin wrote that with the choice of weber , the damage from the scandal around welteke will be less than had been feared .
in fact , the paper wrote , the central bank could come out of the while affair " strengthened . "
only the financial daily handelsblatt in düsseldorf expressed alarm at the decision , saying the political elite in germany is in a state of emergency : " they ca n't recruit one of their own for high offices . "
the paper lamented that , after the opposition conservatives proposed the largely unknown horst köhler for the position of federal president , now the ruling social democrats have nominated a politically inexperienced professor to head the central bank .
in a separate development that captivated editorialists on thursday , german economics minister wolfgang clement has suggested a further liberalization of the country 's store opening hours .
clement said the government should lift the restriction that most stores ca n't be open past 8 a.m. , and that states should be left alone to decide whether shops can open on sundays .
papers mostly applauded the idea , but some expressed skepticism that the move would have any beneficial economic effect .
cologne 's express newspaper said it does n't see why the state should tell a retailer when they can sell their goods and when they ca n't .
referring to the fact that stores in train stations and gas stations are already allowed to be open on sundays , the paper said that there are so many exceptions , that the old rule has become out-of-date .
it would make more sense , the paper wrote , for store owners to set their own opening hours .
but even if the law is changed , express does n't foresee any dramatic change in the habits of german shoppers or that stores would then open their doors around the clock .
for its part , the westdeutsche zeitung praised the shopping example set by other countries , many of which already have 24-hour stores - like the united states , where farmers happily go to wal-mart shops at 3 a.m. before going out to milk their cows .
" foreigners have long been shaking their heads at germany 's strict rules , " the paper observed .
the ostsee-zeitung summed up a more critical argument , saying extended opening hours would n't provide much growth for the hare-paced economy .

the frankfurter rundschau called weber , a professor from the university of cologne , " a brilliant social scientist " and said he enjoys " an excellent reputation in economics circles . "
two years ago he was called up to be one of the " five wise men , " independent economists who advise the federal government .
" thus , he 's not just a theorist , but has done practical research and knows about the real question of how changing interest rates affect the economy . "
the nürnberger nachrichten compared weber to other possible candidates , such as the bank 's vice president , jürgen stark .
the paper 's editors pointed out that he was also touched by the scandal that brought down the bank 's recently resigned leader , ernst welteke .
weber seems to the paper to be a man who gets praise from all sides .
die welt from berlin wrote that with the choice of weber , the damage from the scandal around welteke will be less than had been feared .
in fact , the paper wrote , the central bank could come out of the while affair " strengthened . "
only the financial daily handelsblatt in düsseldorf expressed alarm at the decision , saying the political elite in germany is in a state of emergency : " they ca n't recruit one of their own for high offices . "
the paper lamented that , after the opposition conservatives proposed the largely unknown horst köhler for the position of federal president , now the ruling social democrats have nominated a politically inexperienced professor to head the central bank .
in a separate development that captivated editorialists on thursday , german economics minister wolfgang clement has suggested a further liberalization of the country 's store opening hours .
clement said the government should lift the restriction that most stores ca n't be open past 8 a.m. , and that states should be left alone to decide whether shops can open on sundays .
papers mostly applauded the idea , but some expressed skepticism that the move would have any beneficial economic effect .
cologne 's express newspaper said it does n't see why the state should tell a retailer when they can sell their goods and when they ca n't .
referring to the fact that stores in train stations and gas stations are already allowed to be open on sundays , the paper said that there are so many exceptions , that the old rule has become out-of-date .
it would make more sense , the paper wrote , for store owners to set their own opening hours .
but even if the law is changed , express does n't foresee any dramatic change in the habits of german shoppers or that stores would then open their doors around the clock .
for its part , the westdeutsche zeitung praised the shopping example set by other countries , many of which already have 24-hour stores - like the united states , where farmers happily go to wal-mart shops at 3 a.m. before going out to milk their cows .
" foreigners have long been shaking their heads at germany 's strict rules , " the paper observed .
the ostsee-zeitung summed up a more critical argument , saying extended opening hours would n't provide much growth for the hare-paced economy .
" fewer and fewer people have a job , " the paper noted , and more and more are earning less in real terms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.04.2004 german press review : the new face of the bundesbank editorial writers on thursday praise the nomination of axel weber as germany 's next central bank chief and give mixed reviews to a government minister 's proposal to extend store opening hours . most editorials seem to agree that axel weber 's nomination as the new central bank head has helped prevent a potentially dangerous display of political partisanship on the part of the ruling spd-green coalition and its finance minister , hans eichel .
the frankfurter rundschau called weber , a professor from the university of cologne , " a brilliant social scientist " and said he enjoys " an excellent reputation in economics circles . "
two years ago he was called up to be one of the " five wise men , " independent economists who advise the federal government .
" thus , he 's not just a theorist , but has done practical research and knows about the real question of how changing interest rates affect the economy . "
the nürnberger nachrichten compared weber to other possible candidates , such as the bank 's vice president , jürgen stark .
the paper 's editors pointed out that he was also touched by the scandal that brought down the bank 's recently resigned leader , ernst welteke .
weber seems to the paper to be a man who gets praise from all sides .
die welt from berlin wrote that with the choice of weber , the damage from the scandal around welteke will be less than had been feared .
in fact , the paper wrote , the central bank could come out of the while affair " strengthened . "
only the financial daily handelsblatt in düsseldorf expressed alarm at the decision , saying the political elite in germany is in a state of emergency : " they ca n't recruit one of their own for high offices . "
the paper lamented that , after the opposition conservatives proposed the largely unknown horst köhler for the position of federal president , now the ruling social democrats have nominated a politically inexperienced professor to head the central bank .
in a separate development that captivated editorialists on thursday , german economics minister wolfgang clement has suggested a further liberalization of the country 's store opening hours .
clement said the government should lift the restriction that most stores ca n't be open past 8 a.m. , and that states should be left alone to decide whether shops can open on sundays .
papers mostly applauded the idea , but some expressed skepticism that the move would have any beneficial economic effect .
cologne 's express newspaper said it does n't see why the state should tell a retailer when they can sell their goods and when they ca n't .
referring to the fact that stores in train stations and gas stations are already allowed to be open on sundays , the paper said that there are so many exceptions , that the old rule has become out-of-date .
it would make more sense , the paper wrote , for store owners to set their own opening hours .
but even if the law is changed , express does n't foresee any dramatic change in the habits of german shoppers or that stores would then open their doors around the clock .
for its part , the westdeutsche zeitung praised the shopping example set by other countries , many of which already have 24-hour stores - like the united states , where farmers happily go to wal-mart shops at 3 a.m. before going out to milk their cows .
" foreigners have long been shaking their heads at germany 's strict rules , " the paper observed .
the ostsee-zeitung summed up a more critical argument , saying extended opening hours would n't provide much growth for the hare-paced economy .
" fewer and fewer people have a job , " the paper noted , and more and more are earning less in real terms .
" and those who do have enough income are more in savings-mode than spend-mode .
people who have no money in their pocket do n't go shopping , " the paper quipped .
it would make more sense , the paper concluded , if germany got rid of its massive unemployment and fear of the future before it let its shops stay open longer . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

joschka fischer will wrap up his trip to the caucasus region on thursday with stops in armenia and georgia .
his visit in armenia comes during considerable political instability in the country . following visits to afghanistan and azerbaijan , germany 's fischer continued his week-long trip abroad by arriving in the armenian capital yerevan on thursday morning .
as he did in azerbaijan , he is expected to encourage both southern caucasus nations to continue to improve their democratic and human rights credentials by holding out the prospect of closer ties to the european union . fischer will need plenty of diplomatic tact in yerevan , since armenian president robert kocharian is under increasing pressure to step down .
on wednesday , opposition groups held a protest rally that attracted an estimated 10,000 people , according to the associated press .
opposition groups allege kocharian won reelection last year only through widespread election fraud , a charge which the president denies . tensions in the country rose on april 13 , when police used force to break up a protest rally .
around 100 people were reportedly detained and several protestors were injured .
" any administration relying on violence is doomed .
kocharian must go , " said stepan demirchyan , leader of the opposition justice party and runner-up in last year 's presidential election , according to the reuters news agency . kocharian 's opponents hope to oust him though continued popular unrest , similar to how neighboring georgia toppled the government of former president eduard shevardnadze late last year .

a cease-fire in the conflict was signed in 1994 , but the final status of nagorno-karabakh has not been resolved .
in the azerbaijani capital baku on wednesday , fischer already said germany and the eu were prepared to help find a solution to the conflict . fischer 's visit to armenia will also include a memorial for armenians killed by turks in 1915 .
the armenians claim ottoman turkish forces committed genocide at the time , slaughtering some 1.5 million people between 1915 and 1923 .
turkey rejects the charges , saying the armenians were killed in a partisan war as the ottoman empire collapsed . heading to tbilisi later in the day , fischer will meet with georgian president mikhail saakashvili to show support for his western oriented reform course .
saakashvili came to power in a bloodless coup that ousted shevardnadze in november , but he has run into trouble recently , as military commanders in the rebellious black sea province of adzhara refuse to follow the orders of the central government . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rebuilding afghanistan and setting an example for iraq during his visit to afghanistan on tuesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer praised the work of german troops and said the reconstruction effort there should serve as a role model to iraq .

a question mark now hangs over his future after he resigned from itv sport following a racist comment made " off-air " in the wake of chelsea 's defeat to monaco on tuesday .
the 65-year-old former manchester united and aston villa manager has attracted attention in the past for his often clumsy on-air comments and eccentric turn-of-phrase .
he has provided summaries at five world cups , six european championships and many other major matches for itv including champions league and fa cup finals .
big ron 's career highs and lows 1956 - signs for aston villa 1961 - helps oxford united win southern league 1971 - ends playing days with witney town 1978 - takes over at west bromwich albion 1981 - lands top job at manchester united 1983 and 1985 - manchester united win fa cup 1986 - sacked from old trafford 1988 - leaves second stint at west brom for atletico madrid 1989 - takes over at sheffield wednesday 1994 - sacked by aston villa 1999 - decides to concentrate on media career 2004 - resigns as pundit for itv sport after making racist comments off-air on resigning , he said he had made " a stupid mistake " - which he regretted - and pointed to his track record of bringing on black players during his coaching career , particularly at west brom .
atkinson had concentrated on punditry since leaving management in may 1999 , when he failed to prevent nottingham forest 's relegation from top flight football .
it was as a manager that atkinson really made his mark on the game , with his most successful spell at old trafford .

a question mark now hangs over his future after he resigned from itv sport following a racist comment made " off-air " in the wake of chelsea 's defeat to monaco on tuesday .
the 65-year-old former manchester united and aston villa manager has attracted attention in the past for his often clumsy on-air comments and eccentric turn-of-phrase .
he has provided summaries at five world cups , six european championships and many other major matches for itv including champions league and fa cup finals .
big ron 's career highs and lows 1956 - signs for aston villa 1961 - helps oxford united win southern league 1971 - ends playing days with witney town 1978 - takes over at west bromwich albion 1981 - lands top job at manchester united 1983 and 1985 - manchester united win fa cup 1986 - sacked from old trafford 1988 - leaves second stint at west brom for atletico madrid 1989 - takes over at sheffield wednesday 1994 - sacked by aston villa 1999 - decides to concentrate on media career 2004 - resigns as pundit for itv sport after making racist comments off-air on resigning , he said he had made " a stupid mistake " - which he regretted - and pointed to his track record of bringing on black players during his coaching career , particularly at west brom .
atkinson had concentrated on punditry since leaving management in may 1999 , when he failed to prevent nottingham forest 's relegation from top flight football .
it was as a manager that atkinson really made his mark on the game , with his most successful spell at old trafford .
he led manchester united to fa cup victory in 1983 and 1985 , not finishing lower than fourth position in the first division .
greener pastures however , his failure to win the league title meant he was replaced by sir alex ferguson in 1987 , after six years at the club .
after a spell at west bromwich albion , atkinson looked for greener pastures abroad with a brief stint at atletico madrid .
he returned to england in 1989 to take on the top job at sheffield wednesday .
the owls endured relegation under his charge but subsequently bounced back to the top flight and won the league cup in 1991 .
his success attracted aston villa , who atkinson led to premiership runners-up spot in 1993 and league cup success in 1994 .
cult following but he was sacked after a poor start to the next season and moved on to coventry , a club struggling to keep in the top flight .
coventry moved him " upstairs " to director of football but , craving hands-on management , he filled in for six months at wednesday , staving off relegation in 1998 .
an attempt to do the same thing for nottingham forest a year later failed - leading atkinson to move into the commentary box .
his " ronisms " while commentating attracted a cult following , with a website devoted to his expressions such as " early doors " , " lollipop " and " back stick " .
he first came to the attention of the soccer world as " the tank " , playing more than 400 games for oxford united as they rose from the southern league to division two .
he had moved to the club after failing to make the grade at aston villa , whom he joined in the late 1950s .

the clydesdale bank research said they were being hit by a surge in house prices and a rise in interest rates .
more than 40 % were prepared to buy houses they did not really like , while 36 % thought they would end up in areas they did not want to live .
one in five first time buyers admitted offering way over the odds for homes .
almost 400 people were questioned across scotland for the bank 's housebuyers survey .
it 's a sad situation when people are buying homes they do n't really want , in places they do n't want to live and at prices inflated by sheer desperation steve reid clydesdale bank it found that four in 10 first time buyers were facing a quandary - whether to save up a deposit and risk being priced out of the market , or go for a 100 % mortgage and risk negative equity .
some 37 % of those questioned said they had given up hope of buying their first home in the coming year .
steve reid , the clydesdale bank 's head of personal financial services , said : " our latest survey of housebuyers has uncovered the emergence of some worrying trends , particularly amongst first time buyers , as both prices and interest rates increase .
" first time buyers clearly need help - especially as their predicament is endangering the property market as a whole - but we are firm believers in responsible lending .
" increasing numbers of other lenders out there are now offering very high income multipliers which can be very risky . "
he said this could encourage people to take on levels of debt which could become unmanageable if interest rates rose further .
people are prepared to pay over the odds for a house two-bedroom terraced houses were the property of choice for more than 40 % of those questioned .
" such is their desperation to get hold of a house , our research shows first-time buyers are fuelling their own frustrations by entering bidding wars for these properties , " said mr reid .
" forty per cent of people in scotland are prepared to offer at least 25 % more than the ' offers over ' price to ensure they have a chance of getting a house .
" it 's a sad situation when people are buying homes they do n't really want , in places they do n't want to live and at prices inflated by sheer desperation . "

the auditor general for wales found basic computer records exist for about a third of its collection .
it could also take 20 staff 20 years to clear the backlog in storing items .
the museum said it had increased information held on computer by 200 % in recent years but if it concentrated wholly on this area , services to the public could suffer .
the backlog includes recording items ranging from paintings to locomotives , and from shells to ancient coins .
the auditor general for wales sir john bourn congratulated the museum on improvements since his last report but said more were needed .
however , the museum estimates it would take 384 staff years to clear .
at current funding levels , the estimate is that the museum needs another £ 1.65 million over 10 years to deal completely with the outstanding items .
although over the last few years , storage space has improved , the report says more needs to be done in this area .
the assembly government has now earmarked £ 3.5 million for this work to continue but it would take 20 dedicated staff 20 years to deal with these backlogs .
items that are not stored appropriately are at risk of deterioration and there have been examples of damage such as to boats at the museum of welsh life .
tackling the backlog ca n't happen overnight says the museum sir john said it was " essential " that the museum prioritises its resources to ensure it drives its programme of improvements even further forward .
he added : " the backlogs that persist mean that much of the collection is not maintained as well as it ought to be and that this needs to be addressed to preserve welsh national heritage for future generations .
" until these are dealt with , the public can not take the full advantage of all that the museum has to offer . "
robin gwyn , of the museum said conservation was not something which could be undertaken quickly .
he said : " it 's a time consuming area of work .
to have to assess the size of an object , its location , its ownership , its condition , all those details have to be gathered in a painstaking way , you ca n't cut corners , it does mean extra people . "
one of the museum 's painting conservationists eleri evans added : " you have to make sure work is kept in a stable condition , you care for it , you clean it and investigate it and sometimes unexpected things can happen . "
mr gwyn said there were backlogs in every museum but the right balance between such curation work and the visitor experience was a delicate task .
" were we to concentrate wholly on ensuring that all records are computerised over a short period , then other aspects of work , such as services to the public might have to be revised to enable this work to be completed . "
museum officials will be answering questions from the assembly 's audit committee next month .

nuneaton and bedworth borough council have fought an ongoing battle to evict the families , who have lived on the land in bulkington for two years .
the travellers did not apply for planning permission to erect buildings , fences and roads on the land .
a planning meeting will now discuss how to provide alternative accommodation for the families affected .
the travellers bought the land before moving into caravans on the site , building roads and erecting fences .
although they had purchased the land , the development of the site was against the law .
the council postponed an eviction in january after the group dug trenches , formed a human shield and set fire to caravans to prevent bailiffs from evicting them .

he is not a stock broker , brain surgeon or lawyer .
but he is learning a skill which is just as lucrative in today 's market - bricklaying .
qualified construction workers are in huge demand in britain .
in the south-east , where the building of terminal 5 at heathrow airport is attracting builders from across the world , they are almost impossible to find for a reasonable price .
as with computer programmers amid the millennium bug worries in the run up to 31 december 2000 , the most highly-skilled builders are demanding bumper salaries .
" with the building of terminal 5 , the prospects are really good , " mr hill admits .
" i 've always had an interest in the construction industry .
my dad earns a fair bit from it . "
job creation terminal 5 - to cost $ 6bn - is one of the biggest construction projects in europe .
it will boast 110 aircraft stands , 40,000 car parking spaces , 18 conveyor belts , the tallest control tower in the country and hundreds of shops by the time it is completed in 2011 .
new roads and rail links will serve the terminal which is set to house british airways ' entire heathrow operation .
in the process , more than 50,000 people will have been provided with well-paid jobs for the best part of a decade .
but at present there is an expertise shortage .
this has led baa , the company that operates heathrow , to join the learning and skills council -lrb- lsc -rrb- - a government body - to set up the heathrow construction centre to train young people carpentry , joinery and bricklaying .
onsite training the centre , which officially opens on thursday has would-be recruits knocking on the doors : more than 250 people applied for 50 places last year there are now 80 16-to-18-year-olds training at the centre , which plans to expand .
" young people see there is good money , if they 've got the right skills , " says david boyer from the lsc .
" many 16-year-olds look around and do n't see anything they want to do and so are falling out of education .
" the key is finding something that young people want to do but that employees will pay for . "
construction fits the bill perfectly , he says .
although students do have to attend lectures , most of their learning takes place in a workshop .

a worker on a state farm near czluchow , in the north-east of poland , she remembers a time of hard work , plentiful harvests and a close , caring community .
but when the berlin wall fell in 1989 , it also brought her world crashing down .
" now i am unemployed , i live on state benefit and am too old to get a job , " she says , as the other members of the farmers ' wives group nod in agreement .
" we think it was a mistake to liquidate all the state farms . "
divisive issues certainly the effects have been devastating .
unemployment in the czluchow region stands at 30 % .
there is a group of people that will forever live on state benefits adam marciniec head of czluchow 's rural municipality for poland as a whole it is close to 20 % , with many of the jobless either former agricultural workers or people who eke out a living as smallholding farmers .
already left behind by the rapid changes , they risk being marginalised even further by the modernization that european union -lrb- eu -rrb- membership seems to entail .
the eu is now fretting over how it will pick up the pieces once poland becomes a member on 1 may .
agriculture and the subsidies attached to it are some of the most divisive issues within the eu and the upcoming enlargement is set to complicate matters further .
state benefits the head of czluchow 's rural municipality is adam marciniec .
cattle sheds like these are finding new life as factories and offices he was the local vet before the farmers asked him to represent them more than 12 years ago , and is honest about the problems facing many of his voters .
" there is a group of people that will forever live on state benefits , " he said .
" they are trained to milk cows and i am afraid that there are no good jobs for them in the future . "
but for the rest of the community , he says , things are looking far more optimistic .
economic zone in the past few years , more than 1,000 jobs have been created in the area .
i love farming and want to leave something for my children farmer andrzej lemanczyk a plot of land on the outskirts of town has been turned into an industrial park and the unused cowsheds now house small start up businesses such as a furniture maker and a coffin producer .
there are even plans for a special economic zone that has been approved by the eu .
it is to offer fast-track planning approval , tax exemptions and cheap land , and already a number of companies have signed up .
access problems with local funding , the old boiler room at mrs wroblewska 's state farm has been turned into a community centre that gives the workers and children somewhere where they can all meet for tea , cake and a chat .
mr marciniec wants investment to give people back their self respect small things , says mr marciniec , but important all the same .
he hopes that eu membership will mean more access to money , but does not hold out too much hope .
he explains that the means to distribute the cash are not in place in poland , and as result the eu will not release the funds .
born to farm what money has made it through has been put to good use .
andrzej lemanczyk is a father of four who tends a family farm on the outskirts of czluchow .
mr lemanczyk 's wife complains that all he does is work with a 220,000 polish zloty -lrb- £ 30,862 ; $ 54,765 -rrb- loan from the eu , mr lemanczyk bought a new tractor and muck spreader , and put in windows and ventilation for his pigs .
" we are young and we want to achieve something , " he says from the living-room of the house which is doing up during his free time .
" i love farming and want to leave something for my children .
i am a farmer and i was born to farm . "
optimistic outlook mr lemanczyk plans to increase his number of pigs from 35 to 50 , allowing him to use up everything that is grown on the farm to feed them .

but production has peaked , and those who benefited most have now been faced with the challenge of making a new living for themselves .
for the uk 's oil industry , it has been transformed by the challenges of north sea production .
the long-term benefits will largely come from exploiting techniques developed in this harsh environment .
tony wood , an economist with the royal bank of scotland who specialises in the oil and gas sector , has watched the north sea industry change over the years .
" we 're around half way through the life of it in volume terms , " he said .
" if we assume that north sea production really got going in the late 70s or early 80s , what we 're talking about is another 20 years of gradually declining production .
" from the scottish point of view , one of the real strengths of the industry has been the service and supply businesses that we 've developed on the back of oil production .
" the extent to which that is exporting its activity and developing international markets will help stem the impact of the north sea 's decline on the scottish economy . "
global supply but the north sea industry has been a benefit for the economy of the whole of the uk .
the uk government will have to manage its decline in a global context .
mr wood said : " from a uk economy point of view , there will be a fairly significant decline in the rate of treasury receipts but also there will be an increasing strategic issue around security of supply and where we import oil and gas from . "
the businesses which support north sea production range from local companies , some of which have become international players on the strength of the uk oil boom , to offshoots of giant multinational corporations .
just as people have a midlife crisis , i think the north sea is at that stage of its life as well alan booth encana uk tadg slattery is vice-president of kbr production services , part of the halliburton group .
he has described the coming changes in the industry as a chance to find new business .
" it creates opportunity for us contractors , " he said .
" there is this whole ' decline atmosphere ' about the place i suppose but when the big operators start to divert their resources to concentrate on bigger things - in central asia , or the far east , or west africa or deep water in the gulf of mexico - that means that they leave big openings for us here to come and do the things that we 're really good at .
" we can produce ideas for cost savings , for production optimisation , for squeezing more out of assets . "
many of the companies operating in the north sea believe that this process , of pumping every last drop of recoverable oil , will continue for many years .
new finds as the larger oil discoveries have given way to the exploitation of more modest fields , the major oil companies have started to move out , replaced by smaller independent businesses .
one of the most significant finds of recent years was the buzzard oil field , 60 miles -lrb- 100km -rrb- off aberdeen in the central north sea .
the major share in this field is owned by encana , a leading independent oil and gas company .
skills developed in the north sea will be used around the world .
the uk 's energy policy its uk managing director , alan booth , is also president of the united kingdom offshore operators association -lrb- ukooa -rrb- .

brewing will be moved two miles away to a site at dunston which s & n is buying from the federation brewery for £ 7.2m.
about 100 jobs are to be lost .
scottish & newcastle said production at the tyne brewery was " no longer commercially viable " .
in february , s & n closed its 150-year-old fountainbridge brewery in edinburgh as part of an ongoing restructuring .
heritage lost ?
the final closure of the 121-year-old tyne brewery next spring will mean that the world famous newcastle brown ale will no longer be brewed in the city of its name .
" i accept that this is sad news for newcastle , but it is more about securing our commitment to the tyneside and the north east in general stephen glancey , director of operations at scottish courage the combined brewing business at dunston will employ about 170 people - the tyne brewery currently employs 150 and federation 130 .
s & n said it wants to carry out the job losses via a voluntary redundancy scheme .
the company has already said it intends to take £ 45m of costs out of the uk brewing operations over the next three years .
a spokesman for the t & g union , which represents workers affected by the announcement , said : " we are disappointed with the news of another scottish & newcastle brewery closure .
" but we are assured that the major regional brands will continue to be brewed on tyneside through the acquisition of the federation brewery . "
more space " this news is bad for jobs and we will do all we can to avoid compulsory redundancies when the plant closes in eight months ' time , " the spokesman added .
scottish & newcastle said that a move to the dunston brewery , which was built in 1979 , would provide the opportunity to brew both lager and ale , as well as offer extensive packaging facilities and room for development .
stephen glancey , director of operations at scottish courage , the uk division of scottish & newcastle , said the move was about securing the company 's future attachment to the north east and tyneside .
" this is a sad day for brewing in newcastle , and all our efforts will be focused on working with the trade unions to help those workers affected , " he said .
" however , we announced the manufacturing review 12 months ago , and have previously closed a brewery in edinburgh .
this is the second stage .
he added : " the move to dunston simply gives us increased capacity and flexibility , not only to increase production of newcastle brown , but also to produce lagers , which are today two-thirds of the market in the uk , and were not possible to make at the newcastle brewery .
" i accept that this is sad news for newcastle , but it is more about securing our commitment to the tyneside and the north east in general . "

alisher usmanov , who owns a 13.4 % stake in corus , had been planning to try and have his own representative voted onto the board of the anglo-dutch group .
the russian has now withdrawn his nomination in the face of opposition from the board and other shareholders .
but mr usmanov has said his backing down was only temporary .
he said changes were still needed at the top of loss-making corus to refresh the business , and is believed to be in favour of reducing the company 's steel making in the uk in favour of more production in the nederland 's .
" as shareholders we of course have an interest in the company ceasing to make losses , " mr usmanov told bbc news .
" the board of directors led by chairman jim leng in my opinion is not the organ needed by corus . "
takeover attempt it is the dutch side of the business that has made money in recent years , while the uk arm has made large losses .
however at its agm , corus announced that it had returned to overall operating profit in the first quarter of 2004 , as its peformance continued to improve .
mr leng said the company had already been through a huge amount of positive reform and did not need the charges being urged by mr usmanov .
mr usmanov has made no secret of his ambitions to influence corus ' strategy .
what only he knows at present is whether his aim is to receive a higher return on his shares , to push for some sort of strategic link with his russian interests , or the beginnings of a straight takeover attempt .
