" learning to shout " came to the eriksdal sports stadium in stockholm this week after first being shown on the finnish island of aaland in the baltic sea , home to composer and author of the piece peter laang . after exploring romantic themes , making an oratorio on large sailboats and an opera for children , laang was searching for a brand new topic for his sixth opera .
" i was watching the 1998 world cup in france on television and i was looking for a way to get back to work and still keep watching the games , " he told afp the day before the premiere last week in stockholm .
" suddenly , all became clear .
i had found the solution : i would make an opera on football , " he said . " learning to shout " is a " pop opera " created on a budget of only € 280,000 -lrb- $ 340,000 -rrb- .
it is made up " of two half-times , lasting 45 minutes each , and includes tackles , shots , passes and dodges " , according to the program . hector leads the troy inter-city firm hebe , the greek goddess of youth personified by soprano therese karlsson , sells beer - instead of the nectar of the legends - on the stands , where she meets hector , trojan warrior and soccer supporter , played by baritone johan hallsten . a black player tackles a white opponent in the penalty area .
the referee does n't blow his whistle for a penalty , and hebe pays the price with her life as the fury of the hooligans bear down upon her . good and evil battle it out the choir plays a fundamental role in this libretto .
the young girls and boys of the estonian 21st century orchestra personify the two teams , g.o.d. and o.n.d. - good and evil in swedish - which correspond to homer 's clash between the trojans and the greeks . for arn-henrik blomqvist , director of the piece and former soccer coach , " the entire tragedy is concentrated in the tiers .
we did n't need to add drama to the field .
the intensity of one match was enough in itself . " " soccer is like life .
it evokes strong feelings .
that 's how i 've gotten into my part , " soprano karlsson said . with a mix of classicism and avant-garde , a giant screen towers over the choir flashing " pop-art " soccer pictures signed by laang .
a television sports commentator sits facing a small screen , belting out his comments while a hooligan chorus wearing t-shirts with the logo " troy fc " let loose a torrent of abuse and belches .
agitation among players in the center circle rises . contemporary soccer issues the violence , intolerance and racism , a familiar curse of contemporary soccer , is expressed through dramatic violins accompanied by african percussion instruments and accordions .
the effect is clear . but " it 's not obvious that we 'll attract traditional opera amateurs " , admits producer ulrika lind , who makes no secret of her ambition to suck in organizers of the 2006 world cup in germany with the opera 's themes of fair play and the fight against racism . laang meanwhile is exasperated by what he calls the " blindness " of the swedish football federation when it comes to addressing these issues .
" i have contacted them to get them involved , and they told me that there was no racism in swedish soccer . " it is stupefying .
just a few hundred meters from here there is a plaque commemorating a supporter who was beaten to death after a game , " he said . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fighting racism in the soccer stadium under pressure following numerous incidents of racist activity in europe ’ s soccer stadiums , the sport ’ s governing body held its first-ever conference on battling racism among fans and players .

volkswagen is pushing for a wage freeze and more flexibility in working hours to counteract falling sales . according to volkswagen 's finance chief hans dieter pötsch , the german-based car manufacturer could be forced to drastically slash jobs if trade unions are n't willing to back the company 's cost-cutting initiatives .

volkswagen is pushing for a wage freeze and more flexibility in working hours to counteract falling sales . according to volkswagen 's finance chief hans dieter pötsch , the german-based car manufacturer could be forced to drastically slash jobs if trade unions are n't willing to back the company 's cost-cutting initiatives .
" if we end up nowhere , which means no movement -lrb- in the negotiations -rrb- ... this would be an extreme negative for the employment situation in germany , " he said in the thursday edition of wall street journal europe .
asked how many jobs the company might have to cut , pötsch responded " 30,000 plus . "
although that number represents about 17 percent of the company 's 176,000-strong german workforce , vw is committed to keeping as many jobs in germany as possible , pötsch stressed .
worry over job loss in germany the state of lower saxony , which has a significant stake in the company 's shares , expressed concern that vw could be removing jobs from germany .
" we hope of course that all the positions will remain in germany , but we will not get involved in tariff negotiations , " said a speaker for the state executive office in hanover .

the company 's board members have argued that the hold on wage increases as well as the introduction of a lower company pay scale for new employees are necessary in order to bring down vw 's personnel expenditures by two billion euros over the next six years .
" unacceptable " cuts for its part , the powerful ig metall labor union is calling for wage increases of four percent and job guarantees for employees at vw 's six production sites around country .
the union , germany 's largest , reacted angrily to pötsch 's newspaper interview , saying the comments could lead to an escalation of the wage negotiations , scheduled to begin next week .

germans - and much of the rest of the world - would like to see a change in u.s. leadership as the transatlantic alliance drifts further apart , a number of recent studies show . a poll of 35 nations released wednesday showed that 30 countries would prefer to see john kerry win the next presidential election , ousting george w. bush .
just three nations came out in favor of the current regime .
the study , released by the canadian opinion research firm globescan and the university of maryland 's program on international policy and attitudes -lrb- pipa -rrb- , polled some 34,000 people in 35 countries .
overall , 46 percent of respondents said they would prefer to see kerry win the election , while support for bush was around 20 percent .
in germany , strong opposition in germany , 74 percent of respondents were for kerry , with only 10 percent supporting bush .
similar results came out from norway , canada and italy .
countries that showed less than 10 percent support for bush were argentina , france , the netherlands , spain and uruguay .
bush only got more support than kerry in poland , nigeria and the philippines ; in india and thailand the numbers were equally divided .
the poll covered countries where questions could be added to ongoing polls , and did not end up including any arab countries or israel .
" only one in five want to see bush reelected .
though he is not as well known , kerry would win handily if the people of the world were to elect the us president , " steven kull , director of pipa , told news organizations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush in addition , a german study , run by the institute for german opinion polling , allensbach -lrb- ifda -rrb- showed germans support a u.s. regime change in november .
in the ifda poll , just 4 percent of 1,023 germans polled said they would opt to re-elect bush , while 68 percent said they would vote for kerry .
the globescan / pipa study also revealed the extent of damage the u.s. image has suffered in europe , especially germany .
in nearly every country of the 35 polled , respondents said that their opinion of america had grown worse since bush took office .
damaged view of u.s. germans showed the greatest loss of respect , with 83 percent of respondents saying their opinion of america had changed for the worse in that time period .
france , mexico , china , the netherlands , italy and brazil showed similar percentages .
as if more evidence of a widening transatlantic rift was needed , an opinion survey conducted for the german marshall fund of the united states and the compagnia di san paolo think-tank in italy , showed the united states and europe are drifting further apart on security issues and the use of force in the aftermath of the war in iraq .
' undesirable ' world leaders in the transatlantic trends 2004 opinion poll of 11,000 americans and europeans , conducted in june , three quarters of europeans said they disapprove of bush 's policies , while a majority said strong u.s. leadership in the world was undesirable .
some 58 percent of europeans said strong u.s. leadership in the world was undesirable , an increase of nine percentage points from a similar poll last year .
only in britain and the netherlands do a majority desire strong u.s. leadership .
by contrast , 79 percent of americans said they support strong european union leadership in world affairs and look to europe as their preferred partner for solving global problems , even though 51 percent of them approve of bush 's foreign policy .
common values while americans are almost evenly divided along ideological lines , 80 percent of europeans surveyed do not believe the u.s.-led invasion of iraq last year was worth the loss of life and cost .
some 73 percent of europeans believe the iraq war increased the risk of terrorism , as do 49 percent of americans .
and while americans and europeans agree on the main threats they face , a higher percentage of americans support using force to prevent a terrorist attack , stop the spread of nuclear weapons , defend a nato ally or remove a regime that abuses human rights .
but despite transatlantic strains , the survey found europeans and americans believe they share enough common values to cooperate on international problems . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : can kerry bring the us and europe back together ?

germans - and much of the rest of the world - would like to see a change in u.s. leadership as the transatlantic alliance drifts further apart , a number of recent studies show . a poll of 35 nations released wednesday showed that 30 countries would prefer to see john kerry win the next presidential election , ousting george w. bush .
just three nations came out in favor of the current regime .
the study , released by the canadian opinion research firm globescan and the university of maryland 's program on international policy and attitudes -lrb- pipa -rrb- , polled some 34,000 people in 35 countries .
overall , 46 percent of respondents said they would prefer to see kerry win the election , while support for bush was around 20 percent .
in germany , strong opposition in germany , 74 percent of respondents were for kerry , with only 10 percent supporting bush .
similar results came out from norway , canada and italy .
countries that showed less than 10 percent support for bush were argentina , france , the netherlands , spain and uruguay .
bush only got more support than kerry in poland , nigeria and the philippines ; in india and thailand the numbers were equally divided .
the poll covered countries where questions could be added to ongoing polls , and did not end up including any arab countries or israel .
" only one in five want to see bush reelected .
though he is not as well known , kerry would win handily if the people of the world were to elect the us president , " steven kull , director of pipa , told news organizations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush in addition , a german study , run by the institute for german opinion polling , allensbach -lrb- ifda -rrb- showed germans support a u.s. regime change in november .
in the ifda poll , just 4 percent of 1,023 germans polled said they would opt to re-elect bush , while 68 percent said they would vote for kerry .
the globescan / pipa study also revealed the extent of damage the u.s. image has suffered in europe , especially germany .
in nearly every country of the 35 polled , respondents said that their opinion of america had grown worse since bush took office .
damaged view of u.s. germans showed the greatest loss of respect , with 83 percent of respondents saying their opinion of america had changed for the worse in that time period .
france , mexico , china , the netherlands , italy and brazil showed similar percentages .
as if more evidence of a widening transatlantic rift was needed , an opinion survey conducted for the german marshall fund of the united states and the compagnia di san paolo think-tank in italy , showed the united states and europe are drifting further apart on security issues and the use of force in the aftermath of the war in iraq .
' undesirable ' world leaders in the transatlantic trends 2004 opinion poll of 11,000 americans and europeans , conducted in june , three quarters of europeans said they disapprove of bush 's policies , while a majority said strong u.s. leadership in the world was undesirable .
some 58 percent of europeans said strong u.s. leadership in the world was undesirable , an increase of nine percentage points from a similar poll last year .
only in britain and the netherlands do a majority desire strong u.s. leadership .
by contrast , 79 percent of americans said they support strong european union leadership in world affairs and look to europe as their preferred partner for solving global problems , even though 51 percent of them approve of bush 's foreign policy .
common values while americans are almost evenly divided along ideological lines , 80 percent of europeans surveyed do not believe the u.s.-led invasion of iraq last year was worth the loss of life and cost .
some 73 percent of europeans believe the iraq war increased the risk of terrorism , as do 49 percent of americans .
and while americans and europeans agree on the main threats they face , a higher percentage of americans support using force to prevent a terrorist attack , stop the spread of nuclear weapons , defend a nato ally or remove a regime that abuses human rights .
but despite transatlantic strains , the survey found europeans and americans believe they share enough common values to cooperate on international problems . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : can kerry bring the us and europe back together ?

in one of the most brazen abductions so far , two italian women aid workers were snatched from their office in downtown baghdad in broad daylight . up until two days ago simona torretta and simona pari felt secure in iraq .
they were working in the office of the italian humanitarian organization a bridge to baghdad .
but then on tuesday morning , a group of armed men stormed their office and took the two aid workers and two iraqi colleagues hostage .
no word has emerged yet from the captors .
taking place in broad daylight in the middle of the busy iraqi capital , the abduction is one of the most brazen a string of recent kidnappings .
since april , people from more than two dozen countries have been kidnapped as guerrillas try to force foreign troops and companies to leave .
more than 20 foreigners have been killed .
torretta and pari , both under 30 , are the first western women to have been taken hostage in iraq .
a statement posted on a web site used by islamic militants said the women " spies were kidnapped to punish italy for not withdrawing troops from iraq and for cooperating with american forces . "
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , whose voters already strongly oppose italy 's military role in iraq , is now under increased pressure to recall the 2,700 troops .

belusconi reaped hefty criticism at the time for not doing enough to protect baldoni .
" what happened when baldoni was kidnapped must not be repeated , " said luciano violante , a leading member of italy 's left-wing opposition .
no distinction between civilians and military an italian government official called the kidnapping a " declaration of war against the west . "
for many observers , tuesday 's events send a clear warning that militants in iraq are no longer making the distinction between military and civilian foreigners .
" this is no longer iraqi resistance , " said gianfranco casinis , speaker of parliament 's lower house .
" these people -lrb- hostage-takers -rrb- first targeted soldiers , but now helpless civilians , two women whose only wrong was to sacrifice their daily lives to alleviate the suffering of the iraqi people . "
berlusconi convened an emergency meeting of the cabinet late tuesday night and appealed for a united national response .
it was the first time that the italian prime minister has adopted a non-partisan approach over the course of several iraq hostage dramas that have deeply shaken italy this year .
representatives of the opposition , staunch opponents to sending troops to iraq , appeared ready for talks with the government wednesday .

meanwhile , deputy foreign minister margherita boniver has set off to the middle east to seek arab help from officials and women 's organizations in releasing the charity workers .
boniver told ansa news agency her visit was aimed at " raising awareness in the arab world about how monstrous the kidnapping of these two women was . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 09.09.2004 confident germany hold brazil in friendly draw großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann and co-trainer joachim löw celebrate a job well done the german contingent in the 74,000-strong crowd that packed out the new look olympic stadium in berlin on wednesday night were pleasantly surprised to see a positive , attacking germany team draw 1-1 with brazil . on wednesday evening , germany 's soccer players faced world champions brazil in what was an important game for the germans , as it 's been a long while since they had a victory against a major international rival .
german national coach jürgen klinsmann 's squad had been hoping for a change in fortunes when they took on the south americans in berlin 's olympic stadium . it was klinsmann 's first home match in charge and his team turned in a determined display to offer hope for the 2006 world cup on home soil , a 1-1 draw against world champions brazil . however the three-time world cup victors failed to end a miserable winless streak against big nations . ronaldinho free-kick opens scoring billed as the “ world cup 2002 revenge ” the match in berlin was just nine minutes old when brazilian star ronaldinho scored a cheeky goal from a free-kick just outside germany ’ s penalty area .
ex-german captain oliver kahn did not react at all .
he had been expecting a long range shot on goal from roberto carlos . the situation probably had oliver kahn thinking back to the last time the teams had played against each other in the world cup final in yokohama , japan .
his only mistake of the championships maybe cost germany the final . but germany were back in the game just 8 minutes later when brazilian-born kevin kuranyi scored in the 17th minute , following a deflected cross from thorsten frings .
kuranyi has scored six of germany 's last eight goals . brazilian-born kuranyi levels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi is congratulated after scoring against the country of his birth .
kuranyi , the stuttgart striker , chested down the ball and slid it past goalkeeper julio cesar .
kuranyi scored all three goals for germany in a 3-1 win over austria last month .
“ it 's great that i scored against brazil .
i could n't be happier ” , kuranyi said . the equalizer came just at the right time and motivated the team to push forward more . in the 24th minute kuranyi had another shot on goal saved by brazilian keeper julio cesar from a pass from bayern munich 's sebastian deisler , making his comeback game in the national side , after successfully beating serious knee injuries and a bout of depression . germany had two chances to take the lead before halftime , but gerald asamoah and philipp lahm both shot poorly .
the visitors pushed germany in the second period with ronaldo shooting high and wide after shaking free of newcomer frank fahrenhorst in one of the few opportunities in the second half . we can hold our own , says klinsmann before the game , klinsmann said it ’ s better to make mistakes than not to take any risks and the german side dictated the pace of the play for much of the match : " yes we can play with them , " klinsmann said , " and hold our own if we can keep the pace . " but it was anything other than a friendly match with much at stake for germany .
the three-time world cup champions have not beaten a top-ranked team for nearly four years when they beat england 1:0 in 2000 .
in addition , the germans have received a lot of criticism since the euro 2004 championships . but the 74,000 fans could sense the new self-confidence growing in the german side and reacted well to germany ’ s game strategy of aggressive marking , risk taking , crisp offensive play and lots of running . against a side rated number one in the world , it seemed to pay off . nigel tandy -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the future beckons for klinsmann 's germany talk of avenging the 2-0 world cup final defeat against wednesday night 's opponents brazil has been dismissed by german coach jürgen klinsmann .
the friendly in berlin will be all about germany 's future not its past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.09.2004 building a new reputation abroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's chancellery building was designed by a german despite their strong architectural tradition , very few germans get to build important projects abroad .
but at this month 's architecture biennale in venice and at similar events , they 're trying to change that . for some , german architecture invokes historic images of the bauhaus era when mies van der rohe and walter gropius set a new international standard .
but more recently , contemporary german architects have gone largely unnoticed , particularly abroad .
fewer than two percent are offered work beyond their country 's borders , despite the fact that german exports in other fields are otherwise hot sellers . indeed , when architecture buffs reel off the names of those most frequently mentioned in the international design press - and the winners of high-profile competitions for projects like the guggenheim museum in bilbao - germans are not among the gehrys , eisenmans , pianos and hadids . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's reichstag was designed by norman foster , a brit .
at home , they do n't necessarily get a better deal : even the reichstag , the centerpiece of " new berlin , " given a pricey architectural makeover after the fall of the wall , was designed by sir norman foster , a brit .
it 's hard to imagine the brits , french or danes passing over their own talent for such a national commission . but as some are pronouncing germany 's days at the cutting edge of architectural innovation over - others are taking on the task of turning things around . raising germany 's profile abroad for this month 's architecture biennale in venice , curators put together a special exhibition highlighting german inventiveness , " deutschlandscape , " which they hope will prompt renewed interest among foreigners . meanwhile , the federal chamber of architects -lrb- bak -rrb- has launched an initiative , the network for architectural export -lrb- nax -rrb- , to promote german architecture around the world and provide resources for those looking to seek their fortunes abroad .
for the first time next month , nax will attend the expo real in munich and host a panel discussion featuring top german architects entitled , " german architects , worldwide chances . " thanks in part to such efforts , things might be starting to turn around .
three german firms were among the winners of the prestigious royal institute of british architects -lrb- riba -rrb- awards announced in june .
still , say experts , there is much work to be done . inheritors of legacy go unnoticed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauhaus buildings , like this complex in bernau , set a new international standard .
how did german architecture , which with bauhaus and the so-called " new objectivity " was once among the most forward-thinking in the world , fall so far from grace ?
for some , the explanation is simple : postwar german engineering , while highly regarded for its durability and quality , has simply become " unsexy . " thomas weller , the director of the nax initiative concedes this is a problem .
" it 's true foreigners think german architecture is technically proficient , but lacks charm and espirit - it 's too down-to-earth , " he told dw-world . but , weller and others say the problem is more complicated than that , even if they do not agree on a single root cause . mercedes not lamborghinis ingeborg flagge , a curator at the frankfurt-based german architecture museum -lrb- dam -rrb- , is not so quick to blame an unexciting product .
for her , that 's a matter of taste .
" germans do n't build lamborghinis , they build porsches and mercedes , " she said . instead , flagge cites more practical considerations .
" for a long time , it did n't pay for german architects to work elsewhere , since in the postwar years there was plenty of work to do at home , " she said .
what 's more , germany , compared to other countries like great britain and france , does not have a colonial past and has , therefore , found it more difficult to establish cultural connections abroad . few stars among the newcomers compared to other countries , germany does not produce what one could call " star architects , " akin to frank gehry , zaha hadid and rem koolhaas , whose first name alone conjures up fantastic images .
and not only are german architects not recognized elsewhere , they suffer from a lack of name recognition at home . klaus dieter weiss , an architecture critic , said german architects are themselves partly to blame .
they are less willing to put themselves front-and-center - call it humility or lack of self confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerbruch hutton 's new environmental ministry in dessau .
for jens ludloff , a partner at sauerbruch hutton , one of the firms awarded the riba prize this year , german architects ' low-profile and unwillingness to tackle the question of " what should be considered ' german ' in the world of design " is largely due to the historical legacy of predecessors like hitler 's architect albert speer , who crafted a very distinctive brand of architecture reflecting nazi ambitions . " due to that experience , german architect 's have a different sense of self confidence , " he told dw-world . that , combined with poorly-coordinated marketing efforts - until recently the architectural associations did n't take on overseas public relations tasks - has contributed to the decline .
even if germans are still producing forward-thinking work , they are n't telling anyone about it . stars in the making ? so who are among the unsung talents hidden away in germany , just waiting for their chance to shine on the international stage ?
weiss , author of " young german architects , " says hamburg-based carsten roth tops his list . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten roth 's cd packaging center in röbel .
according to weiss , roth 's designs , including several housing projects and a cd packaging center in röbel , are based on provacative theoretical studies - unusual since german architecture tends to be less theory-based .
roth plays with the complex relationship between old and new . for weiss , it is precisely that kind of return to theory and incorporation of more sophisticated ideas into their work , that is necessary for germans to reclaim a top spot in the world of international architecture . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " energy passports " for german homes under eu regulations , european homeowners will be required to have their property inspected for energy efficiency starting in 2006 .

but at this month 's architecture biennale in venice and at similar events , they 're trying to change that . for some , german architecture invokes historic images of the bauhaus era when mies van der rohe and walter gropius set a new international standard .
but more recently , contemporary german architects have gone largely unnoticed , particularly abroad .
fewer than two percent are offered work beyond their country 's borders , despite the fact that german exports in other fields are otherwise hot sellers . indeed , when architecture buffs reel off the names of those most frequently mentioned in the international design press - and the winners of high-profile competitions for projects like the guggenheim museum in bilbao - germans are not among the gehrys , eisenmans , pianos and hadids . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's reichstag was designed by norman foster , a brit .
at home , they do n't necessarily get a better deal : even the reichstag , the centerpiece of " new berlin , " given a pricey architectural makeover after the fall of the wall , was designed by sir norman foster , a brit .
it 's hard to imagine the brits , french or danes passing over their own talent for such a national commission . but as some are pronouncing germany 's days at the cutting edge of architectural innovation over - others are taking on the task of turning things around . raising germany 's profile abroad for this month 's architecture biennale in venice , curators put together a special exhibition highlighting german inventiveness , " deutschlandscape , " which they hope will prompt renewed interest among foreigners . meanwhile , the federal chamber of architects -lrb- bak -rrb- has launched an initiative , the network for architectural export -lrb- nax -rrb- , to promote german architecture around the world and provide resources for those looking to seek their fortunes abroad .
for the first time next month , nax will attend the expo real in munich and host a panel discussion featuring top german architects entitled , " german architects , worldwide chances . " thanks in part to such efforts , things might be starting to turn around .
three german firms were among the winners of the prestigious royal institute of british architects -lrb- riba -rrb- awards announced in june .
still , say experts , there is much work to be done . inheritors of legacy go unnoticed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauhaus buildings , like this complex in bernau , set a new international standard .
how did german architecture , which with bauhaus and the so-called " new objectivity " was once among the most forward-thinking in the world , fall so far from grace ?
for some , the explanation is simple : postwar german engineering , while highly regarded for its durability and quality , has simply become " unsexy . " thomas weller , the director of the nax initiative concedes this is a problem .
" it 's true foreigners think german architecture is technically proficient , but lacks charm and espirit - it 's too down-to-earth , " he told dw-world . but , weller and others say the problem is more complicated than that , even if they do not agree on a single root cause . mercedes not lamborghinis ingeborg flagge , a curator at the frankfurt-based german architecture museum -lrb- dam -rrb- , is not so quick to blame an unexciting product .
for her , that 's a matter of taste .
" germans do n't build lamborghinis , they build porsches and mercedes , " she said . instead , flagge cites more practical considerations .
" for a long time , it did n't pay for german architects to work elsewhere , since in the postwar years there was plenty of work to do at home , " she said .
what 's more , germany , compared to other countries like great britain and france , does not have a colonial past and has , therefore , found it more difficult to establish cultural connections abroad . few stars among the newcomers compared to other countries , germany does not produce what one could call " star architects , " akin to frank gehry , zaha hadid and rem koolhaas , whose first name alone conjures up fantastic images .
and not only are german architects not recognized elsewhere , they suffer from a lack of name recognition at home . klaus dieter weiss , an architecture critic , said german architects are themselves partly to blame .

for jens ludloff , a partner at sauerbruch hutton , one of the firms awarded the riba prize this year , german architects ' low-profile and unwillingness to tackle the question of " what should be considered ' german ' in the world of design " is largely due to the historical legacy of predecessors like hitler 's architect albert speer , who crafted a very distinctive brand of architecture reflecting nazi ambitions .

on thursday , the team 's former commander faces murder charges in a munich court . the 86-year-old former commander of a nazi special forces unit faces court in munich , germany on thursday on charges of murdering 164 people in czechoslovakia at the end of world war ii .
with suspects and potential witnesses dying of old age , the trial of ladislav niznanksy - who led the so-called edelweiss unit that hunted down and killed slovak resistance fighters - may be one of the last of its kind .
niznansky is accused of taking part in the massacre of 146 people in two villages in slovakia in 1945 and later of ordering the execution of 18 jews , mostly women and children , in another village .
former nazi captain held since jan .
16 after living quietly with his wife for 33 years in a munich suburb , the former nazi captain , whom neighbors describe as a friendly old man , was jolted back to the reality of the past when police rang his door bell on january 16 .
since then , the man the nazi-hunting simon wiesenthal center describes as " a mass murderer " has been held in remand .
despite the passing of 60 years , 24 witnesses , some of them survivors , have been located and will testify against the leader of a unit prosecutors say was known for the " special treacherousness and brutality " of its operations .
the edelweiss team was tasked with hunting partisans in slovakia , at the time a nazi puppet state , but niznansky told the german news magazine focus that he " never had to kill someone " while serving with it .
prosecuters claim complicity in 146 murders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to prosecutors , the unit , which also included troops from the notorious german ss , rounded up and shot 146 people from the villages of klak and ostry grun , including 70 women and 51 children , on january 21 , 1945 .
niznansky , who was born in czechoslovakia but has german citizenship , is said to have ordered that no one should be allowed to escape and to have personally shot dead 20 of the victims .
on february 7 , 1945 he formed an execution commando team and ordered the killing of 18 jews who had been found hiding in bunkers in ksina , prosecutors say .
after his arrest in january , the director of the jerusalem branch of the wiesenthal center urged germany to expedite his trial so that he could finally be held accountable for his crimes .
" the numerous innocent victims murdered by the edelweiss unit fully deserve that the person responsible for their tragic fate be held accountable for his crimes , " said director efraim zuroff .
" in that respect , the passing of time since the crimes were committed and the fact that niznansky has hereto escaped justice in no way diminish the severity of his crimes and his own personal culpability . "
" the holocaust was neither an earthquake nor a hurricane , but a manmade crime for which those responsible must be held accountable , " he said .
niznansky fled into anonymity niznansky is believed to have fled to germany in 1948 after a communist coup and was sentenced to death in czechoslovakia in his absence in 1962 .
he worked unnoticed for several years in munich at radio free europe , the us-funded station that broadcast to eastern europe during the cold war , and was given german citizenship in 1996 .
germany was only alerted to his presence in 2001 after an investigation by slovak justice authorities .

with suspects and potential witnesses dying of old age , the trial of ladislav niznanksy - who led the so-called edelweiss unit that hunted down and killed slovak resistance fighters - may be one of the last of its kind .
niznansky is accused of taking part in the massacre of 146 people in two villages in slovakia in 1945 and later of ordering the execution of 18 jews , mostly women and children , in another village .
former nazi captain held since jan .
16 after living quietly with his wife for 33 years in a munich suburb , the former nazi captain , whom neighbors describe as a friendly old man , was jolted back to the reality of the past when police rang his door bell on january 16 .

despite the passing of 60 years , 24 witnesses , some of them survivors , have been located and will testify against the leader of a unit prosecutors say was known for the " special treacherousness and brutality " of its operations .

it ’ s easy to see why after one city employee was fined € 300 for trying to cut through the red tape . civil servants apparently aren ’ t paid enough to think for themselves , they should just do as they ’ re told .
that ’ s the message an administrative court ’ s disciplinary chamber in munich had for one of the city ’ s employees when he made some changes on his own , according to thursday ’ s süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . some may think he ’ s just a headstrong clerical employee , but no one could compel the 57-year-old to file records according to the phonetic alphabet , which would have required him to file " knight " under " n . " after all , the regular alphabet covered all his abc needs for so many years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does n't look like we 'll be needing these anymore ! then , when he decided to throw away over 20,000 index cards - which referred to nonexistent files - it was clear to everyone in munich ’ s city hall that someone had to stop this renegade record-keeper . slow down with all the improvements the prosecutor argued that changes , even improvements , can ’ t just be implemented willy-nilly .
germany has rules and regulations which exist for just these reasons .
it could lead to chaos if rebel filers kept track of paperwork any way they wanted . the court ’ s chief judge saw things the same way .

a european parliament delegation returning from the crisis area is calling for more aid and increased pressure to end the conflict . while the united nations security council deliberates its response to secretary general kofi annan 's report on the crisis in sudan , the european parliament sent its own delegation to the war-torn region of darfur .
the six-member team will present an evaluation of the humanitarian situation when the parliamentarians return to session next week .
it is also very likely that the subject will make it into the official round of debate as the parliament mulls a possible response to the ongoing crisis .
late last week the european union renewed its threat to slap sanctions on the sudanese government if it does not do more to rein in militias fighting in the western darfur region .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , welcomed the fact that some progress has been made on improving the humanitarian situation in darfur , but lamented that security remains a problem .
" whereas we note some progress in the humanitarian field we are still particularly worried at the security situation caused by lack of progress in disarming and controlling the janjaweed " pro-government militias , he said .
increase international pressure the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- is also not ruling out increasing pressure on khartoum to comply with international demands for an immediate cease-fire .
apart from continuing efforts to help alleviate the humanitarian crisis , which displaced over two million people in darfur , members of the parliament 's development committee stressed the need to find a political solution for sudan .
fiona hall , one of the six parliamentarians who traveled to sudan , told deutsche welle that in the face of renewed attacks it was " very important to keep the pressure on the government . "
" i am particularly concerned about the lack of the security the people in the refugee camps feel , " she said in an interview .
after traveling in the darfur region , meeting with sudanese authorities and speaking with aid workers , refugees and african union observers she said , " basically the message we got was that people wanted to go home but were petrified that there might be new attacks . "
" we spoke to local activists and tribal representatives and they said it is not really a conflict between arab and african tribes , " as the crisis has sometimes been presented , " but that the government is responsible . "
humanitarian nightmare hall , a european parliamentarian from great britain , described the experiences many of the refugees had as " quite harrowing . "
although she acknowledged that things had improved slightly in the refugee camps themselves , especially since non-government organizations have bee granted free access , she said there is still quite a bit of work to do to ensure that aid reaches all the displaced people .
" there are around 1.2 million displaced people in sudan .
some of them are still out of the reach of ngos .
about 200,000 people are impossible to reach because of rain and another 200,000 because they are in a region controlled by the rebels , " she said .
hall echoed an earlier evaluation by the ep that the emergency in darfur is likely to continue for more than a year .
" really this is a long-term crisis .
the people who fled their villages have not had a chance to cultivate their land .
so they will depend on international aid for up to 18 months . "

social democrat zypries initially wanted to allow the police to carry out surveillance on such professionals in their work places or private rooms , but came up against significant opposition including from green party members of the governing coalition .
the newest version of the law will now come before the cabinet in around two weeks .
the legislation only allows investigators to listen in on people with client secrecy privileges if the professionals themselves are suspected of having committed crimes .
eavesdropping surveillance solely in order to acquire evidence against a third party will not be allowed . more briefs 07.09.2004 -pipe- swedish eurosceptics may enter national politics 30.08.2004 -pipe- spd plans referendum law reform 09.08.2004 -pipe- saudis may close islamic school in bonn 30.07.2004 -pipe- roma mep urges commission to act for her people 29.07.2004 -pipe- jewish leader warns of right-wing terror groups 29.07.2004 -pipe- german authorities register 6,000 gay partnerships 29.07.2004 -pipe- kahn looks to flee the german spotlight 27.07.2004 -pipe- jacket allows music tastes to be worn on the sleeve 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

germans - and much of the rest of the world - would like to see a change in u.s. leadership as the transatlantic alliance drifts further apart , a number of recent studies show . a poll of 35 nations released wednesday showed that 30 countries would prefer to see john kerry win the next presidential election , ousting george w. bush .
just three nations came out in favor of the current regime .
the study , released by the canadian opinion research firm globescan and the university of maryland 's program on international policy and attitudes -lrb- pipa -rrb- , polled some 34,000 people in 35 countries .
overall , 46 percent of respondents said they would prefer to see kerry win the election , while support for bush was around 20 percent .
in germany , strong opposition in germany , 74 percent of respondents were for kerry , with only 10 percent supporting bush .
similar results came out from norway , canada and italy .
countries that showed less than 10 percent support for bush were argentina , france , the netherlands , spain and uruguay .
bush only got more support than kerry in poland , nigeria and the philippines ; in india and thailand the numbers were equally divided .
the poll covered countries where questions could be added to ongoing polls , and did not end up including any arab countries or israel .
" only one in five want to see bush reelected .
though he is not as well known , kerry would win handily if the people of the world were to elect the us president , " steven kull , director of pipa , told news organizations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush in addition , a german study , run by the institute for german opinion polling , allensbach -lrb- ifda -rrb- showed germans support a u.s. regime change in november .
in the ifda poll , just 4 percent of 1,023 germans polled said they would opt to re-elect bush , while 68 percent said they would vote for kerry .
the globescan / pipa study also revealed the extent of damage the u.s. image has suffered in europe , especially germany .
in nearly every country of the 35 polled , respondents said that their opinion of america had grown worse since bush took office .
damaged view of u.s. germans showed the greatest loss of respect , with 83 percent of respondents saying their opinion of america had changed for the worse in that time period .
france , mexico , china , the netherlands , italy and brazil showed similar percentages .
as if more evidence of a widening transatlantic rift was needed , an opinion survey conducted for the german marshall fund of the united states and the compagnia di san paolo think-tank in italy , showed the united states and europe are drifting further apart on security issues and the use of force in the aftermath of the war in iraq .
' undesirable ' world leaders in the transatlantic trends 2004 opinion poll of 11,000 americans and europeans , conducted in june , three quarters of europeans said they disapprove of bush 's policies , while a majority said strong u.s. leadership in the world was undesirable .
some 58 percent of europeans said strong u.s. leadership in the world was undesirable , an increase of nine percentage points from a similar poll last year .
only in britain and the netherlands do a majority desire strong u.s. leadership .
by contrast , 79 percent of americans said they support strong european union leadership in world affairs and look to europe as their preferred partner for solving global problems , even though 51 percent of them approve of bush 's foreign policy .
common values while americans are almost evenly divided along ideological lines , 80 percent of europeans surveyed do not believe the u.s.-led invasion of iraq last year was worth the loss of life and cost .
some 73 percent of europeans believe the iraq war increased the risk of terrorism , as do 49 percent of americans .
and while americans and europeans agree on the main threats they face , a higher percentage of americans support using force to prevent a terrorist attack , stop the spread of nuclear weapons , defend a nato ally or remove a regime that abuses human rights .
but despite transatlantic strains , the survey found europeans and americans believe they share enough common values to cooperate on international problems . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : can kerry bring the us and europe back together ?

germans - and much of the rest of the world - would like to see a change in u.s. leadership as the transatlantic alliance drifts further apart , a number of recent studies show . a poll of 35 nations released wednesday showed that 30 countries would prefer to see john kerry win the next presidential election , ousting george w. bush .
just three nations came out in favor of the current regime .
the study , released by the canadian opinion research firm globescan and the university of maryland 's program on international policy and attitudes -lrb- pipa -rrb- , polled some 34,000 people in 35 countries .
overall , 46 percent of respondents said they would prefer to see kerry win the election , while support for bush was around 20 percent .
in germany , strong opposition in germany , 74 percent of respondents were for kerry , with only 10 percent supporting bush .
similar results came out from norway , canada and italy .
countries that showed less than 10 percent support for bush were argentina , france , the netherlands , spain and uruguay .
bush only got more support than kerry in poland , nigeria and the philippines ; in india and thailand the numbers were equally divided .
the poll covered countries where questions could be added to ongoing polls , and did not end up including any arab countries or israel .
" only one in five want to see bush reelected .
though he is not as well known , kerry would win handily if the people of the world were to elect the us president , " steven kull , director of pipa , told news organizations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush in addition , a german study , run by the institute for german opinion polling , allensbach -lrb- ifda -rrb- showed germans support a u.s. regime change in november .
in the ifda poll , just 4 percent of 1,023 germans polled said they would opt to re-elect bush , while 68 percent said they would vote for kerry .
the globescan / pipa study also revealed the extent of damage the u.s. image has suffered in europe , especially germany .
in nearly every country of the 35 polled , respondents said that their opinion of america had grown worse since bush took office .
damaged view of u.s. germans showed the greatest loss of respect , with 83 percent of respondents saying their opinion of america had changed for the worse in that time period .
france , mexico , china , the netherlands , italy and brazil showed similar percentages .

on thursday , the team 's former commander faces murder charges in a munich court . the 86-year-old former commander of a nazi special forces unit faces court in munich , germany on thursday on charges of murdering 164 people in czechoslovakia at the end of world war ii .
with suspects and potential witnesses dying of old age , the trial of ladislav niznanksy - who led the so-called edelweiss unit that hunted down and killed slovak resistance fighters - may be one of the last of its kind .
niznansky is accused of taking part in the massacre of 146 people in two villages in slovakia in 1945 and later of ordering the execution of 18 jews , mostly women and children , in another village .
former nazi captain held since jan .
16 after living quietly with his wife for 33 years in a munich suburb , the former nazi captain , whom neighbors describe as a friendly old man , was jolted back to the reality of the past when police rang his door bell on january 16 .
since then , the man the nazi-hunting simon wiesenthal center describes as " a mass murderer " has been held in remand .
despite the passing of 60 years , 24 witnesses , some of them survivors , have been located and will testify against the leader of a unit prosecutors say was known for the " special treacherousness and brutality " of its operations .
the edelweiss team was tasked with hunting partisans in slovakia , at the time a nazi puppet state , but niznansky told the german news magazine focus that he " never had to kill someone " while serving with it .
prosecuters claim complicity in 146 murders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to prosecutors , the unit , which also included troops from the notorious german ss , rounded up and shot 146 people from the villages of klak and ostry grun , including 70 women and 51 children , on january 21 , 1945 .
niznansky , who was born in czechoslovakia but has german citizenship , is said to have ordered that no one should be allowed to escape and to have personally shot dead 20 of the victims .
on february 7 , 1945 he formed an execution commando team and ordered the killing of 18 jews who had been found hiding in bunkers in ksina , prosecutors say .
after his arrest in january , the director of the jerusalem branch of the wiesenthal center urged germany to expedite his trial so that he could finally be held accountable for his crimes .
" the numerous innocent victims murdered by the edelweiss unit fully deserve that the person responsible for their tragic fate be held accountable for his crimes , " said director efraim zuroff .
" in that respect , the passing of time since the crimes were committed and the fact that niznansky has hereto escaped justice in no way diminish the severity of his crimes and his own personal culpability . "
" the holocaust was neither an earthquake nor a hurricane , but a manmade crime for which those responsible must be held accountable , " he said .
niznansky fled into anonymity niznansky is believed to have fled to germany in 1948 after a communist coup and was sentenced to death in czechoslovakia in his absence in 1962 .

a european parliament delegation returning from the crisis area is calling for more aid and increased pressure to end the conflict . while the united nations security council deliberates its response to secretary general kofi annan 's report on the crisis in sudan , the european parliament sent its own delegation to the war-torn region of darfur .
the six-member team will present an evaluation of the humanitarian situation when the parliamentarians return to session next week .
it is also very likely that the subject will make it into the official round of debate as the parliament mulls a possible response to the ongoing crisis .
late last week the european union renewed its threat to slap sanctions on the sudanese government if it does not do more to rein in militias fighting in the western darfur region .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , welcomed the fact that some progress has been made on improving the humanitarian situation in darfur , but lamented that security remains a problem .
" whereas we note some progress in the humanitarian field we are still particularly worried at the security situation caused by lack of progress in disarming and controlling the janjaweed " pro-government militias , he said .
increase international pressure the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- is also not ruling out increasing pressure on khartoum to comply with international demands for an immediate cease-fire .
apart from continuing efforts to help alleviate the humanitarian crisis , which displaced over two million people in darfur , members of the parliament 's development committee stressed the need to find a political solution for sudan .
fiona hall , one of the six parliamentarians who traveled to sudan , told deutsche welle that in the face of renewed attacks it was " very important to keep the pressure on the government . "
" i am particularly concerned about the lack of the security the people in the refugee camps feel , " she said in an interview .
after traveling in the darfur region , meeting with sudanese authorities and speaking with aid workers , refugees and african union observers she said , " basically the message we got was that people wanted to go home but were petrified that there might be new attacks . "
" we spoke to local activists and tribal representatives and they said it is not really a conflict between arab and african tribes , " as the crisis has sometimes been presented , " but that the government is responsible . "
humanitarian nightmare hall , a european parliamentarian from great britain , described the experiences many of the refugees had as " quite harrowing . "
although she acknowledged that things had improved slightly in the refugee camps themselves , especially since non-government organizations have bee granted free access , she said there is still quite a bit of work to do to ensure that aid reaches all the displaced people .
" there are around 1.2 million displaced people in sudan .
some of them are still out of the reach of ngos .
about 200,000 people are impossible to reach because of rain and another 200,000 because they are in a region controlled by the rebels , " she said .
hall echoed an earlier evaluation by the ep that the emergency in darfur is likely to continue for more than a year .
" really this is a long-term crisis .
the people who fled their villages have not had a chance to cultivate their land .
so they will depend on international aid for up to 18 months . "
however , " she warned , " there is no help in the pipeline beyond the end of november that would be sufficient .

volkswagen is pushing for a wage freeze and more flexibility in working hours to counteract falling sales . according to volkswagen 's finance chief hans dieter pötsch , the german-based car manufacturer could be forced to drastically slash jobs if trade unions are n't willing to back the company 's cost-cutting initiatives .
" if we end up nowhere , which means no movement -lrb- in the negotiations -rrb- ... this would be an extreme negative for the employment situation in germany , " he said in the thursday edition of wall street journal europe .
asked how many jobs the company might have to cut , pötsch responded " 30,000 plus . "
although that number represents about 17 percent of the company 's 176,000-strong german workforce , vw is committed to keeping as many jobs in germany as possible , pötsch stressed .
worry over job loss in germany the state of lower saxony , which has a significant stake in the company 's shares , expressed concern that vw could be removing jobs from germany .
" we hope of course that all the positions will remain in germany , but we will not get involved in tariff negotiations , " said a speaker for the state executive office in hanover .
a vw spokesman tried to play down the figure , insisting that the " 30,000-number is based on a purely mathematical model for a scenario when the cost situation does not improve . "
it is based on " pure theory , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen headquarters in wolfsburg , germany : die autostadt faced with falling sales , a bitter price battle among the competition and a weak us dollar , the volkswagen is seeking a two-year wage freeze and increased flexibility of working hours for its german employees during the upcoming round of tariff talks .
the company 's board members have argued that the hold on wage increases as well as the introduction of a lower company pay scale for new employees are necessary in order to bring down vw 's personnel expenditures by two billion euros over the next six years .
" unacceptable " cuts for its part , the powerful ig metall labor union is calling for wage increases of four percent and job guarantees for employees at vw 's six production sites around country .
the union , germany 's largest , reacted angrily to pötsch 's newspaper interview , saying the comments could lead to an escalation of the wage negotiations , scheduled to begin next week .
" it 's completely unacceptable " that a vw board member is " pouring oil onto the fire of the wage dispute , " said ig metalls chief negotiator hartmut meine .
" it is also irresponsible to play with peoples ' fears for their jobs , " he said .
" employees are not abstract numbers .
it is unusual that a finance chief makes a comment about the wage round , especially before the talks have even started . "
the union vowed to " fight now more than ever to push through their demands .

" learning to shout " came to the eriksdal sports stadium in stockholm this week after first being shown on the finnish island of aaland in the baltic sea , home to composer and author of the piece peter laang . after exploring romantic themes , making an oratorio on large sailboats and an opera for children , laang was searching for a brand new topic for his sixth opera .
" i was watching the 1998 world cup in france on television and i was looking for a way to get back to work and still keep watching the games , " he told afp the day before the premiere last week in stockholm .
" suddenly , all became clear .
i had found the solution : i would make an opera on football , " he said . " learning to shout " is a " pop opera " created on a budget of only € 280,000 -lrb- $ 340,000 -rrb- .
it is made up " of two half-times , lasting 45 minutes each , and includes tackles , shots , passes and dodges " , according to the program . hector leads the troy inter-city firm hebe , the greek goddess of youth personified by soprano therese karlsson , sells beer - instead of the nectar of the legends - on the stands , where she meets hector , trojan warrior and soccer supporter , played by baritone johan hallsten . a black player tackles a white opponent in the penalty area .
the referee does n't blow his whistle for a penalty , and hebe pays the price with her life as the fury of the hooligans bear down upon her . good and evil battle it out the choir plays a fundamental role in this libretto .
the young girls and boys of the estonian 21st century orchestra personify the two teams , g.o.d. and o.n.d. - good and evil in swedish - which correspond to homer 's clash between the trojans and the greeks . for arn-henrik blomqvist , director of the piece and former soccer coach , " the entire tragedy is concentrated in the tiers .
we did n't need to add drama to the field .
the intensity of one match was enough in itself . " " soccer is like life .
it evokes strong feelings .
that 's how i 've gotten into my part , " soprano karlsson said . with a mix of classicism and avant-garde , a giant screen towers over the choir flashing " pop-art " soccer pictures signed by laang .
a television sports commentator sits facing a small screen , belting out his comments while a hooligan chorus wearing t-shirts with the logo " troy fc " let loose a torrent of abuse and belches .
agitation among players in the center circle rises . contemporary soccer issues the violence , intolerance and racism , a familiar curse of contemporary soccer , is expressed through dramatic violins accompanied by african percussion instruments and accordions .
the effect is clear . but " it 's not obvious that we 'll attract traditional opera amateurs " , admits producer ulrika lind , who makes no secret of her ambition to suck in organizers of the 2006 world cup in germany with the opera 's themes of fair play and the fight against racism . laang meanwhile is exasperated by what he calls the " blindness " of the swedish football federation when it comes to addressing these issues .
" i have contacted them to get them involved , and they told me that there was no racism in swedish soccer . " it is stupefying .

fewer than two percent are offered work beyond their country 's borders , despite the fact that german exports in other fields are otherwise hot sellers . indeed , when architecture buffs reel off the names of those most frequently mentioned in the international design press - and the winners of high-profile competitions for projects like the guggenheim museum in bilbao - germans are not among the gehrys , eisenmans , pianos and hadids . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's reichstag was designed by norman foster , a brit .

for jens ludloff , a partner at sauerbruch hutton , one of the firms awarded the riba prize this year , german architects ' low-profile and unwillingness to tackle the question of " what should be considered ' german ' in the world of design " is largely due to the historical legacy of predecessors like hitler 's architect albert speer , who crafted a very distinctive brand of architecture reflecting nazi ambitions .

dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , welcomed the fact that some progress has been made on improving the humanitarian situation in darfur , but lamented that security remains a problem .

a european parliament delegation returning from the crisis area is calling for more aid and increased pressure to end the conflict . while the united nations security council deliberates its response to secretary general kofi annan 's report on the crisis in sudan , the european parliament sent its own delegation to the war-torn region of darfur .
the six-member team will present an evaluation of the humanitarian situation when the parliamentarians return to session next week .
it is also very likely that the subject will make it into the official round of debate as the parliament mulls a possible response to the ongoing crisis .
late last week the european union renewed its threat to slap sanctions on the sudanese government if it does not do more to rein in militias fighting in the western darfur region .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , welcomed the fact that some progress has been made on improving the humanitarian situation in darfur , but lamented that security remains a problem .
" whereas we note some progress in the humanitarian field we are still particularly worried at the security situation caused by lack of progress in disarming and controlling the janjaweed " pro-government militias , he said .
increase international pressure the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- is also not ruling out increasing pressure on khartoum to comply with international demands for an immediate cease-fire .
apart from continuing efforts to help alleviate the humanitarian crisis , which displaced over two million people in darfur , members of the parliament 's development committee stressed the need to find a political solution for sudan .
fiona hall , one of the six parliamentarians who traveled to sudan , told deutsche welle that in the face of renewed attacks it was " very important to keep the pressure on the government . "
" i am particularly concerned about the lack of the security the people in the refugee camps feel , " she said in an interview .
after traveling in the darfur region , meeting with sudanese authorities and speaking with aid workers , refugees and african union observers she said , " basically the message we got was that people wanted to go home but were petrified that there might be new attacks . "
" we spoke to local activists and tribal representatives and they said it is not really a conflict between arab and african tribes , " as the crisis has sometimes been presented , " but that the government is responsible . "
humanitarian nightmare hall , a european parliamentarian from great britain , described the experiences many of the refugees had as " quite harrowing . "
although she acknowledged that things had improved slightly in the refugee camps themselves , especially since non-government organizations have bee granted free access , she said there is still quite a bit of work to do to ensure that aid reaches all the displaced people .
" there are around 1.2 million displaced people in sudan .
some of them are still out of the reach of ngos .
about 200,000 people are impossible to reach because of rain and another 200,000 because they are in a region controlled by the rebels , " she said .
hall echoed an earlier evaluation by the ep that the emergency in darfur is likely to continue for more than a year .
" really this is a long-term crisis .
the people who fled their villages have not had a chance to cultivate their land .
so they will depend on international aid for up to 18 months . "
however , " she warned , " there is no help in the pipeline beyond the end of november that would be sufficient .

volkswagen is pushing for a wage freeze and more flexibility in working hours to counteract falling sales . according to volkswagen 's finance chief hans dieter pötsch , the german-based car manufacturer could be forced to drastically slash jobs if trade unions are n't willing to back the company 's cost-cutting initiatives .
" if we end up nowhere , which means no movement -lrb- in the negotiations -rrb- ... this would be an extreme negative for the employment situation in germany , " he said in the thursday edition of wall street journal europe .
asked how many jobs the company might have to cut , pötsch responded " 30,000 plus . "
although that number represents about 17 percent of the company 's 176,000-strong german workforce , vw is committed to keeping as many jobs in germany as possible , pötsch stressed .
worry over job loss in germany the state of lower saxony , which has a significant stake in the company 's shares , expressed concern that vw could be removing jobs from germany .
" we hope of course that all the positions will remain in germany , but we will not get involved in tariff negotiations , " said a speaker for the state executive office in hanover .
a vw spokesman tried to play down the figure , insisting that the " 30,000-number is based on a purely mathematical model for a scenario when the cost situation does not improve . "

the company 's board members have argued that the hold on wage increases as well as the introduction of a lower company pay scale for new employees are necessary in order to bring down vw 's personnel expenditures by two billion euros over the next six years .
" unacceptable " cuts for its part , the powerful ig metall labor union is calling for wage increases of four percent and job guarantees for employees at vw 's six production sites around country .
the union , germany 's largest , reacted angrily to pötsch 's newspaper interview , saying the comments could lead to an escalation of the wage negotiations , scheduled to begin next week .
" it 's completely unacceptable " that a vw board member is " pouring oil onto the fire of the wage dispute , " said ig metalls chief negotiator hartmut meine .
" it is also irresponsible to play with peoples ' fears for their jobs , " he said .

but at this month 's architecture biennale in venice and at similar events , they 're trying to change that . for some , german architecture invokes historic images of the bauhaus era when mies van der rohe and walter gropius set a new international standard .
but more recently , contemporary german architects have gone largely unnoticed , particularly abroad .
fewer than two percent are offered work beyond their country 's borders , despite the fact that german exports in other fields are otherwise hot sellers . indeed , when architecture buffs reel off the names of those most frequently mentioned in the international design press - and the winners of high-profile competitions for projects like the guggenheim museum in bilbao - germans are not among the gehrys , eisenmans , pianos and hadids . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's reichstag was designed by norman foster , a brit .
at home , they do n't necessarily get a better deal : even the reichstag , the centerpiece of " new berlin , " given a pricey architectural makeover after the fall of the wall , was designed by sir norman foster , a brit .
it 's hard to imagine the brits , french or danes passing over their own talent for such a national commission . but as some are pronouncing germany 's days at the cutting edge of architectural innovation over - others are taking on the task of turning things around . raising germany 's profile abroad for this month 's architecture biennale in venice , curators put together a special exhibition highlighting german inventiveness , " deutschlandscape , " which they hope will prompt renewed interest among foreigners . meanwhile , the federal chamber of architects -lrb- bak -rrb- has launched an initiative , the network for architectural export -lrb- nax -rrb- , to promote german architecture around the world and provide resources for those looking to seek their fortunes abroad .
for the first time next month , nax will attend the expo real in munich and host a panel discussion featuring top german architects entitled , " german architects , worldwide chances . " thanks in part to such efforts , things might be starting to turn around .
three german firms were among the winners of the prestigious royal institute of british architects -lrb- riba -rrb- awards announced in june .
still , say experts , there is much work to be done . inheritors of legacy go unnoticed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauhaus buildings , like this complex in bernau , set a new international standard .
how did german architecture , which with bauhaus and the so-called " new objectivity " was once among the most forward-thinking in the world , fall so far from grace ?
for some , the explanation is simple : postwar german engineering , while highly regarded for its durability and quality , has simply become " unsexy . " thomas weller , the director of the nax initiative concedes this is a problem .
" it 's true foreigners think german architecture is technically proficient , but lacks charm and espirit - it 's too down-to-earth , " he told dw-world . but , weller and others say the problem is more complicated than that , even if they do not agree on a single root cause . mercedes not lamborghinis ingeborg flagge , a curator at the frankfurt-based german architecture museum -lrb- dam -rrb- , is not so quick to blame an unexciting product .
for her , that 's a matter of taste .
" germans do n't build lamborghinis , they build porsches and mercedes , " she said . instead , flagge cites more practical considerations .
" for a long time , it did n't pay for german architects to work elsewhere , since in the postwar years there was plenty of work to do at home , " she said .
what 's more , germany , compared to other countries like great britain and france , does not have a colonial past and has , therefore , found it more difficult to establish cultural connections abroad . few stars among the newcomers compared to other countries , germany does not produce what one could call " star architects , " akin to frank gehry , zaha hadid and rem koolhaas , whose first name alone conjures up fantastic images .
and not only are german architects not recognized elsewhere , they suffer from a lack of name recognition at home . klaus dieter weiss , an architecture critic , said german architects are themselves partly to blame .
they are less willing to put themselves front-and-center - call it humility or lack of self confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerbruch hutton 's new environmental ministry in dessau .
for jens ludloff , a partner at sauerbruch hutton , one of the firms awarded the riba prize this year , german architects ' low-profile and unwillingness to tackle the question of " what should be considered ' german ' in the world of design " is largely due to the historical legacy of predecessors like hitler 's architect albert speer , who crafted a very distinctive brand of architecture reflecting nazi ambitions . " due to that experience , german architect 's have a different sense of self confidence , " he told dw-world . that , combined with poorly-coordinated marketing efforts - until recently the architectural associations did n't take on overseas public relations tasks - has contributed to the decline .
even if germans are still producing forward-thinking work , they are n't telling anyone about it . stars in the making ? so who are among the unsung talents hidden away in germany , just waiting for their chance to shine on the international stage ?
weiss , author of " young german architects , " says hamburg-based carsten roth tops his list . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten roth 's cd packaging center in röbel .
according to weiss , roth 's designs , including several housing projects and a cd packaging center in röbel , are based on provacative theoretical studies - unusual since german architecture tends to be less theory-based .
roth plays with the complex relationship between old and new . for weiss , it is precisely that kind of return to theory and incorporation of more sophisticated ideas into their work , that is necessary for germans to reclaim a top spot in the world of international architecture . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " energy passports " for german homes under eu regulations , european homeowners will be required to have their property inspected for energy efficiency starting in 2006 .

german national coach jürgen klinsmann 's squad had been hoping for a change in fortunes when they took on the south americans in berlin 's olympic stadium . it was klinsmann 's first home match in charge and his team turned in a determined display to offer hope for the 2006 world cup on home soil , a 1-1 draw against world champions brazil . however the three-time world cup victors failed to end a miserable winless streak against big nations . ronaldinho free-kick opens scoring billed as the “ world cup 2002 revenge ” the match in berlin was just nine minutes old when brazilian star ronaldinho scored a cheeky goal from a free-kick just outside germany ’ s penalty area .
ex-german captain oliver kahn did not react at all .
he had been expecting a long range shot on goal from roberto carlos . the situation probably had oliver kahn thinking back to the last time the teams had played against each other in the world cup final in yokohama , japan .
his only mistake of the championships maybe cost germany the final . but germany were back in the game just 8 minutes later when brazilian-born kevin kuranyi scored in the 17th minute , following a deflected cross from thorsten frings .
kuranyi has scored six of germany 's last eight goals . brazilian-born kuranyi levels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi is congratulated after scoring against the country of his birth .

kuranyi scored all three goals for germany in a 3-1 win over austria last month .
“ it 's great that i scored against brazil .
i could n't be happier ” , kuranyi said . the equalizer came just at the right time and motivated the team to push forward more . in the 24th minute kuranyi had another shot on goal saved by brazilian keeper julio cesar from a pass from bayern munich 's sebastian deisler , making his comeback game in the national side , after successfully beating serious knee injuries and a bout of depression . germany had two chances to take the lead before halftime , but gerald asamoah and philipp lahm both shot poorly .
the visitors pushed germany in the second period with ronaldo shooting high and wide after shaking free of newcomer frank fahrenhorst in one of the few opportunities in the second half . we can hold our own , says klinsmann before the game , klinsmann said it ’ s better to make mistakes than not to take any risks and the german side dictated the pace of the play for much of the match : " yes we can play with them , " klinsmann said , " and hold our own if we can keep the pace . " but it was anything other than a friendly match with much at stake for germany .
the three-time world cup champions have not beaten a top-ranked team for nearly four years when they beat england 1:0 in 2000 .
in addition , the germans have received a lot of criticism since the euro 2004 championships . but the 74,000 fans could sense the new self-confidence growing in the german side and reacted well to germany ’ s game strategy of aggressive marking , risk taking , crisp offensive play and lots of running . against a side rated number one in the world , it seemed to pay off . nigel tandy -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the future beckons for klinsmann 's germany talk of avenging the 2-0 world cup final defeat against wednesday night 's opponents brazil has been dismissed by german coach jürgen klinsmann .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.09.2004 building a new reputation abroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's chancellery building was designed by a german despite their strong architectural tradition , very few germans get to build important projects abroad .
but at this month 's architecture biennale in venice and at similar events , they 're trying to change that . for some , german architecture invokes historic images of the bauhaus era when mies van der rohe and walter gropius set a new international standard .
but more recently , contemporary german architects have gone largely unnoticed , particularly abroad .
fewer than two percent are offered work beyond their country 's borders , despite the fact that german exports in other fields are otherwise hot sellers . indeed , when architecture buffs reel off the names of those most frequently mentioned in the international design press - and the winners of high-profile competitions for projects like the guggenheim museum in bilbao - germans are not among the gehrys , eisenmans , pianos and hadids . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's reichstag was designed by norman foster , a brit .
at home , they do n't necessarily get a better deal : even the reichstag , the centerpiece of " new berlin , " given a pricey architectural makeover after the fall of the wall , was designed by sir norman foster , a brit .
it 's hard to imagine the brits , french or danes passing over their own talent for such a national commission . but as some are pronouncing germany 's days at the cutting edge of architectural innovation over - others are taking on the task of turning things around . raising germany 's profile abroad for this month 's architecture biennale in venice , curators put together a special exhibition highlighting german inventiveness , " deutschlandscape , " which they hope will prompt renewed interest among foreigners . meanwhile , the federal chamber of architects -lrb- bak -rrb- has launched an initiative , the network for architectural export -lrb- nax -rrb- , to promote german architecture around the world and provide resources for those looking to seek their fortunes abroad .
for the first time next month , nax will attend the expo real in munich and host a panel discussion featuring top german architects entitled , " german architects , worldwide chances . " thanks in part to such efforts , things might be starting to turn around .
three german firms were among the winners of the prestigious royal institute of british architects -lrb- riba -rrb- awards announced in june .
still , say experts , there is much work to be done . inheritors of legacy go unnoticed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauhaus buildings , like this complex in bernau , set a new international standard .
how did german architecture , which with bauhaus and the so-called " new objectivity " was once among the most forward-thinking in the world , fall so far from grace ?
for some , the explanation is simple : postwar german engineering , while highly regarded for its durability and quality , has simply become " unsexy . " thomas weller , the director of the nax initiative concedes this is a problem .
" it 's true foreigners think german architecture is technically proficient , but lacks charm and espirit - it 's too down-to-earth , " he told dw-world . but , weller and others say the problem is more complicated than that , even if they do not agree on a single root cause . mercedes not lamborghinis ingeborg flagge , a curator at the frankfurt-based german architecture museum -lrb- dam -rrb- , is not so quick to blame an unexciting product .
for her , that 's a matter of taste .
" germans do n't build lamborghinis , they build porsches and mercedes , " she said . instead , flagge cites more practical considerations .
" for a long time , it did n't pay for german architects to work elsewhere , since in the postwar years there was plenty of work to do at home , " she said .
what 's more , germany , compared to other countries like great britain and france , does not have a colonial past and has , therefore , found it more difficult to establish cultural connections abroad . few stars among the newcomers compared to other countries , germany does not produce what one could call " star architects , " akin to frank gehry , zaha hadid and rem koolhaas , whose first name alone conjures up fantastic images .
and not only are german architects not recognized elsewhere , they suffer from a lack of name recognition at home . klaus dieter weiss , an architecture critic , said german architects are themselves partly to blame .
they are less willing to put themselves front-and-center - call it humility or lack of self confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerbruch hutton 's new environmental ministry in dessau .
for jens ludloff , a partner at sauerbruch hutton , one of the firms awarded the riba prize this year , german architects ' low-profile and unwillingness to tackle the question of " what should be considered ' german ' in the world of design " is largely due to the historical legacy of predecessors like hitler 's architect albert speer , who crafted a very distinctive brand of architecture reflecting nazi ambitions . " due to that experience , german architect 's have a different sense of self confidence , " he told dw-world . that , combined with poorly-coordinated marketing efforts - until recently the architectural associations did n't take on overseas public relations tasks - has contributed to the decline .
even if germans are still producing forward-thinking work , they are n't telling anyone about it . stars in the making ? so who are among the unsung talents hidden away in germany , just waiting for their chance to shine on the international stage ?
weiss , author of " young german architects , " says hamburg-based carsten roth tops his list . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten roth 's cd packaging center in röbel .
according to weiss , roth 's designs , including several housing projects and a cd packaging center in röbel , are based on provacative theoretical studies - unusual since german architecture tends to be less theory-based .
roth plays with the complex relationship between old and new . for weiss , it is precisely that kind of return to theory and incorporation of more sophisticated ideas into their work , that is necessary for germans to reclaim a top spot in the world of international architecture . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " energy passports " for german homes under eu regulations , european homeowners will be required to have their property inspected for energy efficiency starting in 2006 .

in one of the most brazen abductions so far , two italian women aid workers were snatched from their office in downtown baghdad in broad daylight . up until two days ago simona torretta and simona pari felt secure in iraq .
they were working in the office of the italian humanitarian organization a bridge to baghdad .
but then on tuesday morning , a group of armed men stormed their office and took the two aid workers and two iraqi colleagues hostage .
no word has emerged yet from the captors .
taking place in broad daylight in the middle of the busy iraqi capital , the abduction is one of the most brazen a string of recent kidnappings .
since april , people from more than two dozen countries have been kidnapped as guerrillas try to force foreign troops and companies to leave .
more than 20 foreigners have been killed .
torretta and pari , both under 30 , are the first western women to have been taken hostage in iraq .
a statement posted on a web site used by islamic militants said the women " spies were kidnapped to punish italy for not withdrawing troops from iraq and for cooperating with american forces . "
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , whose voters already strongly oppose italy 's military role in iraq , is now under increased pressure to recall the 2,700 troops .
after the us and great britain , italy supplies the third largest military contingent in iraq .
italians in shock all across the country , italians have come out in full force condemning the abduction of the two women , who had gone to baghdad to help provide assistance to the civilian population .
rallies in support of the two women took place in rome and naples on wednesday evening , with people calling on the government to take swift action to guarantee the release of the two women .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an italian carabinieri looks at the portrait of simona pari , above , and simona torretta during a press conference at the rome headquarters of the italian aid organization " un ponte per baghdad " many worry the current kidnapping could end up like the abduction of italian journalist enzo baldoni was taken hostage on aug .
20 .
before rome could secure his release , he was murdered by his captors .
belusconi reaped hefty criticism at the time for not doing enough to protect baldoni .
" what happened when baldoni was kidnapped must not be repeated , " said luciano violante , a leading member of italy 's left-wing opposition .
no distinction between civilians and military an italian government official called the kidnapping a " declaration of war against the west . "
for many observers , tuesday 's events send a clear warning that militants in iraq are no longer making the distinction between military and civilian foreigners .

no word has emerged yet from the captors .
taking place in broad daylight in the middle of the busy iraqi capital , the abduction is one of the most brazen a string of recent kidnappings .
since april , people from more than two dozen countries have been kidnapped as guerrillas try to force foreign troops and companies to leave .
more than 20 foreigners have been killed .

germans - and much of the rest of the world - would like to see a change in u.s. leadership as the transatlantic alliance drifts further apart , a number of recent studies show . a poll of 35 nations released wednesday showed that 30 countries would prefer to see john kerry win the next presidential election , ousting george w. bush .
just three nations came out in favor of the current regime .
the study , released by the canadian opinion research firm globescan and the university of maryland 's program on international policy and attitudes -lrb- pipa -rrb- , polled some 34,000 people in 35 countries .
overall , 46 percent of respondents said they would prefer to see kerry win the election , while support for bush was around 20 percent .
in germany , strong opposition in germany , 74 percent of respondents were for kerry , with only 10 percent supporting bush .
similar results came out from norway , canada and italy .
countries that showed less than 10 percent support for bush were argentina , france , the netherlands , spain and uruguay .
bush only got more support than kerry in poland , nigeria and the philippines ; in india and thailand the numbers were equally divided .
the poll covered countries where questions could be added to ongoing polls , and did not end up including any arab countries or israel .
" only one in five want to see bush reelected .
though he is not as well known , kerry would win handily if the people of the world were to elect the us president , " steven kull , director of pipa , told news organizations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush in addition , a german study , run by the institute for german opinion polling , allensbach -lrb- ifda -rrb- showed germans support a u.s. regime change in november .
in the ifda poll , just 4 percent of 1,023 germans polled said they would opt to re-elect bush , while 68 percent said they would vote for kerry .
the globescan / pipa study also revealed the extent of damage the u.s. image has suffered in europe , especially germany .
in nearly every country of the 35 polled , respondents said that their opinion of america had grown worse since bush took office .
damaged view of u.s. germans showed the greatest loss of respect , with 83 percent of respondents saying their opinion of america had changed for the worse in that time period .
france , mexico , china , the netherlands , italy and brazil showed similar percentages .
as if more evidence of a widening transatlantic rift was needed , an opinion survey conducted for the german marshall fund of the united states and the compagnia di san paolo think-tank in italy , showed the united states and europe are drifting further apart on security issues and the use of force in the aftermath of the war in iraq .
' undesirable ' world leaders in the transatlantic trends 2004 opinion poll of 11,000 americans and europeans , conducted in june , three quarters of europeans said they disapprove of bush 's policies , while a majority said strong u.s. leadership in the world was undesirable .
some 58 percent of europeans said strong u.s. leadership in the world was undesirable , an increase of nine percentage points from a similar poll last year .
only in britain and the netherlands do a majority desire strong u.s. leadership .
by contrast , 79 percent of americans said they support strong european union leadership in world affairs and look to europe as their preferred partner for solving global problems , even though 51 percent of them approve of bush 's foreign policy .
common values while americans are almost evenly divided along ideological lines , 80 percent of europeans surveyed do not believe the u.s.-led invasion of iraq last year was worth the loss of life and cost .
some 73 percent of europeans believe the iraq war increased the risk of terrorism , as do 49 percent of americans .
and while americans and europeans agree on the main threats they face , a higher percentage of americans support using force to prevent a terrorist attack , stop the spread of nuclear weapons , defend a nato ally or remove a regime that abuses human rights .
but despite transatlantic strains , the survey found europeans and americans believe they share enough common values to cooperate on international problems . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : can kerry bring the us and europe back together ?

volkswagen is pushing for a wage freeze and more flexibility in working hours to counteract falling sales . according to volkswagen 's finance chief hans dieter pötsch , the german-based car manufacturer could be forced to drastically slash jobs if trade unions are n't willing to back the company 's cost-cutting initiatives .
" if we end up nowhere , which means no movement -lrb- in the negotiations -rrb- ... this would be an extreme negative for the employment situation in germany , " he said in the thursday edition of wall street journal europe .
asked how many jobs the company might have to cut , pötsch responded " 30,000 plus . "
although that number represents about 17 percent of the company 's 176,000-strong german workforce , vw is committed to keeping as many jobs in germany as possible , pötsch stressed .
worry over job loss in germany the state of lower saxony , which has a significant stake in the company 's shares , expressed concern that vw could be removing jobs from germany .
" we hope of course that all the positions will remain in germany , but we will not get involved in tariff negotiations , " said a speaker for the state executive office in hanover .

the company 's board members have argued that the hold on wage increases as well as the introduction of a lower company pay scale for new employees are necessary in order to bring down vw 's personnel expenditures by two billion euros over the next six years .
" unacceptable " cuts for its part , the powerful ig metall labor union is calling for wage increases of four percent and job guarantees for employees at vw 's six production sites around country .
the union , germany 's largest , reacted angrily to pötsch 's newspaper interview , saying the comments could lead to an escalation of the wage negotiations , scheduled to begin next week .
" it 's completely unacceptable " that a vw board member is " pouring oil onto the fire of the wage dispute , " said ig metalls chief negotiator hartmut meine .

a european parliament delegation returning from the crisis area is calling for more aid and increased pressure to end the conflict . while the united nations security council deliberates its response to secretary general kofi annan 's report on the crisis in sudan , the european parliament sent its own delegation to the war-torn region of darfur .
the six-member team will present an evaluation of the humanitarian situation when the parliamentarians return to session next week .
it is also very likely that the subject will make it into the official round of debate as the parliament mulls a possible response to the ongoing crisis .
late last week the european union renewed its threat to slap sanctions on the sudanese government if it does not do more to rein in militias fighting in the western darfur region .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , welcomed the fact that some progress has been made on improving the humanitarian situation in darfur , but lamented that security remains a problem .
" whereas we note some progress in the humanitarian field we are still particularly worried at the security situation caused by lack of progress in disarming and controlling the janjaweed " pro-government militias , he said .
increase international pressure the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- is also not ruling out increasing pressure on khartoum to comply with international demands for an immediate cease-fire .
apart from continuing efforts to help alleviate the humanitarian crisis , which displaced over two million people in darfur , members of the parliament 's development committee stressed the need to find a political solution for sudan .
fiona hall , one of the six parliamentarians who traveled to sudan , told deutsche welle that in the face of renewed attacks it was " very important to keep the pressure on the government . "
" i am particularly concerned about the lack of the security the people in the refugee camps feel , " she said in an interview .
after traveling in the darfur region , meeting with sudanese authorities and speaking with aid workers , refugees and african union observers she said , " basically the message we got was that people wanted to go home but were petrified that there might be new attacks . "
" we spoke to local activists and tribal representatives and they said it is not really a conflict between arab and african tribes , " as the crisis has sometimes been presented , " but that the government is responsible . "
humanitarian nightmare hall , a european parliamentarian from great britain , described the experiences many of the refugees had as " quite harrowing . "
although she acknowledged that things had improved slightly in the refugee camps themselves , especially since non-government organizations have bee granted free access , she said there is still quite a bit of work to do to ensure that aid reaches all the displaced people .
" there are around 1.2 million displaced people in sudan .
some of them are still out of the reach of ngos .
about 200,000 people are impossible to reach because of rain and another 200,000 because they are in a region controlled by the rebels , " she said .
hall echoed an earlier evaluation by the ep that the emergency in darfur is likely to continue for more than a year .
" really this is a long-term crisis .
the people who fled their villages have not had a chance to cultivate their land .

volkswagen is pushing for a wage freeze and more flexibility in working hours to counteract falling sales . according to volkswagen 's finance chief hans dieter pötsch , the german-based car manufacturer could be forced to drastically slash jobs if trade unions are n't willing to back the company 's cost-cutting initiatives .

on thursday , the team 's former commander faces murder charges in a munich court . the 86-year-old former commander of a nazi special forces unit faces court in munich , germany on thursday on charges of murdering 164 people in czechoslovakia at the end of world war ii .
with suspects and potential witnesses dying of old age , the trial of ladislav niznanksy - who led the so-called edelweiss unit that hunted down and killed slovak resistance fighters - may be one of the last of its kind .
niznansky is accused of taking part in the massacre of 146 people in two villages in slovakia in 1945 and later of ordering the execution of 18 jews , mostly women and children , in another village .
former nazi captain held since jan .
16 after living quietly with his wife for 33 years in a munich suburb , the former nazi captain , whom neighbors describe as a friendly old man , was jolted back to the reality of the past when police rang his door bell on january 16 .
since then , the man the nazi-hunting simon wiesenthal center describes as " a mass murderer " has been held in remand .
despite the passing of 60 years , 24 witnesses , some of them survivors , have been located and will testify against the leader of a unit prosecutors say was known for the " special treacherousness and brutality " of its operations .
the edelweiss team was tasked with hunting partisans in slovakia , at the time a nazi puppet state , but niznansky told the german news magazine focus that he " never had to kill someone " while serving with it .
prosecuters claim complicity in 146 murders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to prosecutors , the unit , which also included troops from the notorious german ss , rounded up and shot 146 people from the villages of klak and ostry grun , including 70 women and 51 children , on january 21 , 1945 .
niznansky , who was born in czechoslovakia but has german citizenship , is said to have ordered that no one should be allowed to escape and to have personally shot dead 20 of the victims .
on february 7 , 1945 he formed an execution commando team and ordered the killing of 18 jews who had been found hiding in bunkers in ksina , prosecutors say .
after his arrest in january , the director of the jerusalem branch of the wiesenthal center urged germany to expedite his trial so that he could finally be held accountable for his crimes .
" the numerous innocent victims murdered by the edelweiss unit fully deserve that the person responsible for their tragic fate be held accountable for his crimes , " said director efraim zuroff .
" in that respect , the passing of time since the crimes were committed and the fact that niznansky has hereto escaped justice in no way diminish the severity of his crimes and his own personal culpability . "
" the holocaust was neither an earthquake nor a hurricane , but a manmade crime for which those responsible must be held accountable , " he said .
niznansky fled into anonymity niznansky is believed to have fled to germany in 1948 after a communist coup and was sentenced to death in czechoslovakia in his absence in 1962 .
he worked unnoticed for several years in munich at radio free europe , the us-funded station that broadcast to eastern europe during the cold war , and was given german citizenship in 1996 .
germany was only alerted to his presence in 2001 after an investigation by slovak justice authorities .
munich prosecutors then launched their own inquiry . his trial here is expected to involve 15 days of hearings and run until the end of october . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de search for nazis in germany starts soon the simon wiesenthal center in jerusalem announced on wednesday it would start its “ operation last chance ” campaign to track down the last nazi criminals in germany in november .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.09.2004 italy in shock over kidnapping of aid workers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simona toretta is one of the aid workers abducted in baghdad after france , italy is now faced with the shock of kidnappings in iraq .
in one of the most brazen abductions so far , two italian women aid workers were snatched from their office in downtown baghdad in broad daylight . up until two days ago simona torretta and simona pari felt secure in iraq .
they were working in the office of the italian humanitarian organization a bridge to baghdad .
but then on tuesday morning , a group of armed men stormed their office and took the two aid workers and two iraqi colleagues hostage .
no word has emerged yet from the captors .
taking place in broad daylight in the middle of the busy iraqi capital , the abduction is one of the most brazen a string of recent kidnappings .
since april , people from more than two dozen countries have been kidnapped as guerrillas try to force foreign troops and companies to leave .
more than 20 foreigners have been killed .
torretta and pari , both under 30 , are the first western women to have been taken hostage in iraq .
a statement posted on a web site used by islamic militants said the women " spies were kidnapped to punish italy for not withdrawing troops from iraq and for cooperating with american forces . "
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , whose voters already strongly oppose italy 's military role in iraq , is now under increased pressure to recall the 2,700 troops .
after the us and great britain , italy supplies the third largest military contingent in iraq .
italians in shock all across the country , italians have come out in full force condemning the abduction of the two women , who had gone to baghdad to help provide assistance to the civilian population .
rallies in support of the two women took place in rome and naples on wednesday evening , with people calling on the government to take swift action to guarantee the release of the two women .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an italian carabinieri looks at the portrait of simona pari , above , and simona torretta during a press conference at the rome headquarters of the italian aid organization " un ponte per baghdad " many worry the current kidnapping could end up like the abduction of italian journalist enzo baldoni was taken hostage on aug .
20 .
before rome could secure his release , he was murdered by his captors .
belusconi reaped hefty criticism at the time for not doing enough to protect baldoni .
" what happened when baldoni was kidnapped must not be repeated , " said luciano violante , a leading member of italy 's left-wing opposition .
no distinction between civilians and military an italian government official called the kidnapping a " declaration of war against the west . "
for many observers , tuesday 's events send a clear warning that militants in iraq are no longer making the distinction between military and civilian foreigners .
" this is no longer iraqi resistance , " said gianfranco casinis , speaker of parliament 's lower house .
" these people -lrb- hostage-takers -rrb- first targeted soldiers , but now helpless civilians , two women whose only wrong was to sacrifice their daily lives to alleviate the suffering of the iraqi people . "
berlusconi convened an emergency meeting of the cabinet late tuesday night and appealed for a united national response .
it was the first time that the italian prime minister has adopted a non-partisan approach over the course of several iraq hostage dramas that have deeply shaken italy this year .
representatives of the opposition , staunch opponents to sending troops to iraq , appeared ready for talks with the government wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young boy , benefiting from the work done by the aid organization " a bridge to baghdad " , pleads with insurgents to release aid workers kidnapped this week " we need a revolt of everyone against terrorism , violence and threats , " said opposition leader francesco rutelli .
" everyone must mobilize without distinctions , " he added .
" we are prepared to collaborate with the government , with the institutions to save these two brave and honest women . "
meanwhile , deputy foreign minister margherita boniver has set off to the middle east to seek arab help from officials and women 's organizations in releasing the charity workers .
boniver told ansa news agency her visit was aimed at " raising awareness in the arab world about how monstrous the kidnapping of these two women was . "
removing aid workers the abduction of torretta and pari , as well as the kidnapping of two french journalists , who have been held since aug .
20 , has fueled the uncertainty in humanitarian organizations with regard to the security situation in iraq .
the long line of hostage-takings and attacks have forced many to consider whether operating in iraq is worth the risk .
on wednesday international aid agencies met in baghdad to consider withdrawing from iraq entirely .
jean-dominique bunel , a frenchman helping to coordinate aid groups operating in iraq , said he expected most of the remaining 50 foreign aid workers to pull out soon .
" following the discussions i had this morning , it seems that most foreign ngos are preparing to leave , and some expatriates already left this morning , " bunel said on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france calls for release of journalists held in iraq the french government , in crisis mode , on sunday called for the release of two french journalists kidnapped in iraq by islamic militants demanding that paris rescind a ban on headscarves in state schools .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 09.09.2004 -pipe- 16:00 utc minister drops change to surveillance law german justice minister brigitte zypries will not extend the law allowing for electronic surveillance in the home to people with client secrecy privileges , such as doctors , lawyers , priests and journalists , a ministry spokesperson said thursday .
social democrat zypries initially wanted to allow the police to carry out surveillance on such professionals in their work places or private rooms , but came up against significant opposition including from green party members of the governing coalition .

it ’ s easy to see why after one city employee was fined € 300 for trying to cut through the red tape . civil servants apparently aren ’ t paid enough to think for themselves , they should just do as they ’ re told .
that ’ s the message an administrative court ’ s disciplinary chamber in munich had for one of the city ’ s employees when he made some changes on his own , according to thursday ’ s süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . some may think he ’ s just a headstrong clerical employee , but no one could compel the 57-year-old to file records according to the phonetic alphabet , which would have required him to file " knight " under " n . " after all , the regular alphabet covered all his abc needs for so many years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does n't look like we 'll be needing these anymore ! then , when he decided to throw away over 20,000 index cards - which referred to nonexistent files - it was clear to everyone in munich ’ s city hall that someone had to stop this renegade record-keeper . slow down with all the improvements the prosecutor argued that changes , even improvements , can ’ t just be implemented willy-nilly .
germany has rules and regulations which exist for just these reasons .
it could lead to chaos if rebel filers kept track of paperwork any way they wanted . the court ’ s chief judge saw things the same way .
while the chief justice saw fit to lower the man ’ s fine from € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,342 -rrb- to € 300 , she also warned him that changes , no matter how well meant , can not be put in place by anyone and definitely “ not as fast ” as he acted . it ’ s still unclear who has the unenviable task of filing some 16,000 index cards for a second time , a process officials said could take months . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the very best of dw-world 's collection of the offbeat , the funny and the totally bizarre .

in one of the most brazen abductions so far , two italian women aid workers were snatched from their office in downtown baghdad in broad daylight . up until two days ago simona torretta and simona pari felt secure in iraq .
they were working in the office of the italian humanitarian organization a bridge to baghdad .
but then on tuesday morning , a group of armed men stormed their office and took the two aid workers and two iraqi colleagues hostage .
no word has emerged yet from the captors .
taking place in broad daylight in the middle of the busy iraqi capital , the abduction is one of the most brazen a string of recent kidnappings .
since april , people from more than two dozen countries have been kidnapped as guerrillas try to force foreign troops and companies to leave .
more than 20 foreigners have been killed .
torretta and pari , both under 30 , are the first western women to have been taken hostage in iraq .
a statement posted on a web site used by islamic militants said the women " spies were kidnapped to punish italy for not withdrawing troops from iraq and for cooperating with american forces . "
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , whose voters already strongly oppose italy 's military role in iraq , is now under increased pressure to recall the 2,700 troops .
after the us and great britain , italy supplies the third largest military contingent in iraq .
italians in shock all across the country , italians have come out in full force condemning the abduction of the two women , who had gone to baghdad to help provide assistance to the civilian population .
rallies in support of the two women took place in rome and naples on wednesday evening , with people calling on the government to take swift action to guarantee the release of the two women .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an italian carabinieri looks at the portrait of simona pari , above , and simona torretta during a press conference at the rome headquarters of the italian aid organization " un ponte per baghdad " many worry the current kidnapping could end up like the abduction of italian journalist enzo baldoni was taken hostage on aug .
20 .
before rome could secure his release , he was murdered by his captors .
belusconi reaped hefty criticism at the time for not doing enough to protect baldoni .
" what happened when baldoni was kidnapped must not be repeated , " said luciano violante , a leading member of italy 's left-wing opposition .
no distinction between civilians and military an italian government official called the kidnapping a " declaration of war against the west . "
for many observers , tuesday 's events send a clear warning that militants in iraq are no longer making the distinction between military and civilian foreigners .
" this is no longer iraqi resistance , " said gianfranco casinis , speaker of parliament 's lower house .
" these people -lrb- hostage-takers -rrb- first targeted soldiers , but now helpless civilians , two women whose only wrong was to sacrifice their daily lives to alleviate the suffering of the iraqi people . "
berlusconi convened an emergency meeting of the cabinet late tuesday night and appealed for a united national response .
it was the first time that the italian prime minister has adopted a non-partisan approach over the course of several iraq hostage dramas that have deeply shaken italy this year .
representatives of the opposition , staunch opponents to sending troops to iraq , appeared ready for talks with the government wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young boy , benefiting from the work done by the aid organization " a bridge to baghdad " , pleads with insurgents to release aid workers kidnapped this week " we need a revolt of everyone against terrorism , violence and threats , " said opposition leader francesco rutelli .
" everyone must mobilize without distinctions , " he added .
" we are prepared to collaborate with the government , with the institutions to save these two brave and honest women . "
meanwhile , deputy foreign minister margherita boniver has set off to the middle east to seek arab help from officials and women 's organizations in releasing the charity workers .
boniver told ansa news agency her visit was aimed at " raising awareness in the arab world about how monstrous the kidnapping of these two women was . "
removing aid workers the abduction of torretta and pari , as well as the kidnapping of two french journalists , who have been held since aug .
20 , has fueled the uncertainty in humanitarian organizations with regard to the security situation in iraq .
the long line of hostage-takings and attacks have forced many to consider whether operating in iraq is worth the risk .
on wednesday international aid agencies met in baghdad to consider withdrawing from iraq entirely .
jean-dominique bunel , a frenchman helping to coordinate aid groups operating in iraq , said he expected most of the remaining 50 foreign aid workers to pull out soon .
" following the discussions i had this morning , it seems that most foreign ngos are preparing to leave , and some expatriates already left this morning , " bunel said on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france calls for release of journalists held in iraq the french government , in crisis mode , on sunday called for the release of two french journalists kidnapped in iraq by islamic militants demanding that paris rescind a ban on headscarves in state schools .

but then on tuesday morning , a group of armed men stormed their office and took the two aid workers and two iraqi colleagues hostage .
no word has emerged yet from the captors .
taking place in broad daylight in the middle of the busy iraqi capital , the abduction is one of the most brazen a string of recent kidnappings .
since april , people from more than two dozen countries have been kidnapped as guerrillas try to force foreign troops and companies to leave .
more than 20 foreigners have been killed .
torretta and pari , both under 30 , are the first western women to have been taken hostage in iraq .
a statement posted on a web site used by islamic militants said the women " spies were kidnapped to punish italy for not withdrawing troops from iraq and for cooperating with american forces . "
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , whose voters already strongly oppose italy 's military role in iraq , is now under increased pressure to recall the 2,700 troops .
after the us and great britain , italy supplies the third largest military contingent in iraq .
italians in shock all across the country , italians have come out in full force condemning the abduction of the two women , who had gone to baghdad to help provide assistance to the civilian population .
rallies in support of the two women took place in rome and naples on wednesday evening , with people calling on the government to take swift action to guarantee the release of the two women .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an italian carabinieri looks at the portrait of simona pari , above , and simona torretta during a press conference at the rome headquarters of the italian aid organization " un ponte per baghdad " many worry the current kidnapping could end up like the abduction of italian journalist enzo baldoni was taken hostage on aug .

before rome could secure his release , he was murdered by his captors .

" what happened when baldoni was kidnapped must not be repeated , " said luciano violante , a leading member of italy 's left-wing opposition .
no distinction between civilians and military an italian government official called the kidnapping a " declaration of war against the west . "
for many observers , tuesday 's events send a clear warning that militants in iraq are no longer making the distinction between military and civilian foreigners .
" this is no longer iraqi resistance , " said gianfranco casinis , speaker of parliament 's lower house .
" these people -lrb- hostage-takers -rrb- first targeted soldiers , but now helpless civilians , two women whose only wrong was to sacrifice their daily lives to alleviate the suffering of the iraqi people . "
berlusconi convened an emergency meeting of the cabinet late tuesday night and appealed for a united national response .
it was the first time that the italian prime minister has adopted a non-partisan approach over the course of several iraq hostage dramas that have deeply shaken italy this year .
representatives of the opposition , staunch opponents to sending troops to iraq , appeared ready for talks with the government wednesday .

" everyone must mobilize without distinctions , " he added .
" we are prepared to collaborate with the government , with the institutions to save these two brave and honest women . "
meanwhile , deputy foreign minister margherita boniver has set off to the middle east to seek arab help from officials and women 's organizations in releasing the charity workers .
boniver told ansa news agency her visit was aimed at " raising awareness in the arab world about how monstrous the kidnapping of these two women was . "

the long line of hostage-takings and attacks have forced many to consider whether operating in iraq is worth the risk .
on wednesday international aid agencies met in baghdad to consider withdrawing from iraq entirely .
jean-dominique bunel , a frenchman helping to coordinate aid groups operating in iraq , said he expected most of the remaining 50 foreign aid workers to pull out soon .

germans - and much of the rest of the world - would like to see a change in u.s. leadership as the transatlantic alliance drifts further apart , a number of recent studies show . a poll of 35 nations released wednesday showed that 30 countries would prefer to see john kerry win the next presidential election , ousting george w. bush .
just three nations came out in favor of the current regime .
the study , released by the canadian opinion research firm globescan and the university of maryland 's program on international policy and attitudes -lrb- pipa -rrb- , polled some 34,000 people in 35 countries .
overall , 46 percent of respondents said they would prefer to see kerry win the election , while support for bush was around 20 percent .
in germany , strong opposition in germany , 74 percent of respondents were for kerry , with only 10 percent supporting bush .
similar results came out from norway , canada and italy .
countries that showed less than 10 percent support for bush were argentina , france , the netherlands , spain and uruguay .
bush only got more support than kerry in poland , nigeria and the philippines ; in india and thailand the numbers were equally divided .
the poll covered countries where questions could be added to ongoing polls , and did not end up including any arab countries or israel .
" only one in five want to see bush reelected .
though he is not as well known , kerry would win handily if the people of the world were to elect the us president , " steven kull , director of pipa , told news organizations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush in addition , a german study , run by the institute for german opinion polling , allensbach -lrb- ifda -rrb- showed germans support a u.s. regime change in november .
in the ifda poll , just 4 percent of 1,023 germans polled said they would opt to re-elect bush , while 68 percent said they would vote for kerry .
the globescan / pipa study also revealed the extent of damage the u.s. image has suffered in europe , especially germany .
in nearly every country of the 35 polled , respondents said that their opinion of america had grown worse since bush took office .
damaged view of u.s. germans showed the greatest loss of respect , with 83 percent of respondents saying their opinion of america had changed for the worse in that time period .
france , mexico , china , the netherlands , italy and brazil showed similar percentages .
as if more evidence of a widening transatlantic rift was needed , an opinion survey conducted for the german marshall fund of the united states and the compagnia di san paolo think-tank in italy , showed the united states and europe are drifting further apart on security issues and the use of force in the aftermath of the war in iraq .
' undesirable ' world leaders in the transatlantic trends 2004 opinion poll of 11,000 americans and europeans , conducted in june , three quarters of europeans said they disapprove of bush 's policies , while a majority said strong u.s. leadership in the world was undesirable .
some 58 percent of europeans said strong u.s. leadership in the world was undesirable , an increase of nine percentage points from a similar poll last year .
only in britain and the netherlands do a majority desire strong u.s. leadership .
by contrast , 79 percent of americans said they support strong european union leadership in world affairs and look to europe as their preferred partner for solving global problems , even though 51 percent of them approve of bush 's foreign policy .
common values while americans are almost evenly divided along ideological lines , 80 percent of europeans surveyed do not believe the u.s.-led invasion of iraq last year was worth the loss of life and cost .
some 73 percent of europeans believe the iraq war increased the risk of terrorism , as do 49 percent of americans .
and while americans and europeans agree on the main threats they face , a higher percentage of americans support using force to prevent a terrorist attack , stop the spread of nuclear weapons , defend a nato ally or remove a regime that abuses human rights .
but despite transatlantic strains , the survey found europeans and americans believe they share enough common values to cooperate on international problems . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : can kerry bring the us and europe back together ?

germans - and much of the rest of the world - would like to see a change in u.s. leadership as the transatlantic alliance drifts further apart , a number of recent studies show . a poll of 35 nations released wednesday showed that 30 countries would prefer to see john kerry win the next presidential election , ousting george w. bush .
just three nations came out in favor of the current regime .
the study , released by the canadian opinion research firm globescan and the university of maryland 's program on international policy and attitudes -lrb- pipa -rrb- , polled some 34,000 people in 35 countries .
overall , 46 percent of respondents said they would prefer to see kerry win the election , while support for bush was around 20 percent .
in germany , strong opposition in germany , 74 percent of respondents were for kerry , with only 10 percent supporting bush .
similar results came out from norway , canada and italy .
countries that showed less than 10 percent support for bush were argentina , france , the netherlands , spain and uruguay .
bush only got more support than kerry in poland , nigeria and the philippines ; in india and thailand the numbers were equally divided .
the poll covered countries where questions could be added to ongoing polls , and did not end up including any arab countries or israel .
" only one in five want to see bush reelected .
though he is not as well known , kerry would win handily if the people of the world were to elect the us president , " steven kull , director of pipa , told news organizations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush in addition , a german study , run by the institute for german opinion polling , allensbach -lrb- ifda -rrb- showed germans support a u.s. regime change in november .
in the ifda poll , just 4 percent of 1,023 germans polled said they would opt to re-elect bush , while 68 percent said they would vote for kerry .
the globescan / pipa study also revealed the extent of damage the u.s. image has suffered in europe , especially germany .
in nearly every country of the 35 polled , respondents said that their opinion of america had grown worse since bush took office .
damaged view of u.s. germans showed the greatest loss of respect , with 83 percent of respondents saying their opinion of america had changed for the worse in that time period .
france , mexico , china , the netherlands , italy and brazil showed similar percentages .
as if more evidence of a widening transatlantic rift was needed , an opinion survey conducted for the german marshall fund of the united states and the compagnia di san paolo think-tank in italy , showed the united states and europe are drifting further apart on security issues and the use of force in the aftermath of the war in iraq .

it ’ s easy to see why after one city employee was fined € 300 for trying to cut through the red tape . civil servants apparently aren ’ t paid enough to think for themselves , they should just do as they ’ re told .
that ’ s the message an administrative court ’ s disciplinary chamber in munich had for one of the city ’ s employees when he made some changes on his own , according to thursday ’ s süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . some may think he ’ s just a headstrong clerical employee , but no one could compel the 57-year-old to file records according to the phonetic alphabet , which would have required him to file " knight " under " n . " after all , the regular alphabet covered all his abc needs for so many years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does n't look like we 'll be needing these anymore ! then , when he decided to throw away over 20,000 index cards - which referred to nonexistent files - it was clear to everyone in munich ’ s city hall that someone had to stop this renegade record-keeper . slow down with all the improvements the prosecutor argued that changes , even improvements , can ’ t just be implemented willy-nilly .
germany has rules and regulations which exist for just these reasons .
it could lead to chaos if rebel filers kept track of paperwork any way they wanted . the court ’ s chief judge saw things the same way .
while the chief justice saw fit to lower the man ’ s fine from € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,342 -rrb- to € 300 , she also warned him that changes , no matter how well meant , can not be put in place by anyone and definitely “ not as fast ” as he acted . it ’ s still unclear who has the unenviable task of filing some 16,000 index cards for a second time , a process officials said could take months . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the very best of dw-world 's collection of the offbeat , the funny and the totally bizarre .

volkswagen is pushing for a wage freeze and more flexibility in working hours to counteract falling sales . according to volkswagen 's finance chief hans dieter pötsch , the german-based car manufacturer could be forced to drastically slash jobs if trade unions are n't willing to back the company 's cost-cutting initiatives .
" if we end up nowhere , which means no movement -lrb- in the negotiations -rrb- ... this would be an extreme negative for the employment situation in germany , " he said in the thursday edition of wall street journal europe .
asked how many jobs the company might have to cut , pötsch responded " 30,000 plus . "
although that number represents about 17 percent of the company 's 176,000-strong german workforce , vw is committed to keeping as many jobs in germany as possible , pötsch stressed .
worry over job loss in germany the state of lower saxony , which has a significant stake in the company 's shares , expressed concern that vw could be removing jobs from germany .
" we hope of course that all the positions will remain in germany , but we will not get involved in tariff negotiations , " said a speaker for the state executive office in hanover .

" unacceptable " cuts for its part , the powerful ig metall labor union is calling for wage increases of four percent and job guarantees for employees at vw 's six production sites around country .
the union , germany 's largest , reacted angrily to pötsch 's newspaper interview , saying the comments could lead to an escalation of the wage negotiations , scheduled to begin next week .
" it 's completely unacceptable " that a vw board member is " pouring oil onto the fire of the wage dispute , " said ig metalls chief negotiator hartmut meine .

social democrat zypries initially wanted to allow the police to carry out surveillance on such professionals in their work places or private rooms , but came up against significant opposition including from green party members of the governing coalition .
the newest version of the law will now come before the cabinet in around two weeks .
the legislation only allows investigators to listen in on people with client secrecy privileges if the professionals themselves are suspected of having committed crimes .
eavesdropping surveillance solely in order to acquire evidence against a third party will not be allowed . more briefs 07.09.2004 -pipe- swedish eurosceptics may enter national politics 30.08.2004 -pipe- spd plans referendum law reform 09.08.2004 -pipe- saudis may close islamic school in bonn 30.07.2004 -pipe- roma mep urges commission to act for her people 29.07.2004 -pipe- jewish leader warns of right-wing terror groups 29.07.2004 -pipe- german authorities register 6,000 gay partnerships 29.07.2004 -pipe- kahn looks to flee the german spotlight 27.07.2004 -pipe- jacket allows music tastes to be worn on the sleeve 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

german national coach jürgen klinsmann 's squad had been hoping for a change in fortunes when they took on the south americans in berlin 's olympic stadium . it was klinsmann 's first home match in charge and his team turned in a determined display to offer hope for the 2006 world cup on home soil , a 1-1 draw against world champions brazil . however the three-time world cup victors failed to end a miserable winless streak against big nations . ronaldinho free-kick opens scoring billed as the “ world cup 2002 revenge ” the match in berlin was just nine minutes old when brazilian star ronaldinho scored a cheeky goal from a free-kick just outside germany ’ s penalty area .
ex-german captain oliver kahn did not react at all .
he had been expecting a long range shot on goal from roberto carlos . the situation probably had oliver kahn thinking back to the last time the teams had played against each other in the world cup final in yokohama , japan .
his only mistake of the championships maybe cost germany the final . but germany were back in the game just 8 minutes later when brazilian-born kevin kuranyi scored in the 17th minute , following a deflected cross from thorsten frings .
kuranyi has scored six of germany 's last eight goals . brazilian-born kuranyi levels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi is congratulated after scoring against the country of his birth .

kuranyi scored all three goals for germany in a 3-1 win over austria last month .
“ it 's great that i scored against brazil .
i could n't be happier ” , kuranyi said . the equalizer came just at the right time and motivated the team to push forward more . in the 24th minute kuranyi had another shot on goal saved by brazilian keeper julio cesar from a pass from bayern munich 's sebastian deisler , making his comeback game in the national side , after successfully beating serious knee injuries and a bout of depression . germany had two chances to take the lead before halftime , but gerald asamoah and philipp lahm both shot poorly .
the visitors pushed germany in the second period with ronaldo shooting high and wide after shaking free of newcomer frank fahrenhorst in one of the few opportunities in the second half . we can hold our own , says klinsmann before the game , klinsmann said it ’ s better to make mistakes than not to take any risks and the german side dictated the pace of the play for much of the match : " yes we can play with them , " klinsmann said , " and hold our own if we can keep the pace . " but it was anything other than a friendly match with much at stake for germany .
the three-time world cup champions have not beaten a top-ranked team for nearly four years when they beat england 1:0 in 2000 .
in addition , the germans have received a lot of criticism since the euro 2004 championships . but the 74,000 fans could sense the new self-confidence growing in the german side and reacted well to germany ’ s game strategy of aggressive marking , risk taking , crisp offensive play and lots of running . against a side rated number one in the world , it seemed to pay off . nigel tandy -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the future beckons for klinsmann 's germany talk of avenging the 2-0 world cup final defeat against wednesday night 's opponents brazil has been dismissed by german coach jürgen klinsmann .

german national coach jürgen klinsmann 's squad had been hoping for a change in fortunes when they took on the south americans in berlin 's olympic stadium . it was klinsmann 's first home match in charge and his team turned in a determined display to offer hope for the 2006 world cup on home soil , a 1-1 draw against world champions brazil . however the three-time world cup victors failed to end a miserable winless streak against big nations . ronaldinho free-kick opens scoring billed as the “ world cup 2002 revenge ” the match in berlin was just nine minutes old when brazilian star ronaldinho scored a cheeky goal from a free-kick just outside germany ’ s penalty area .
ex-german captain oliver kahn did not react at all .
he had been expecting a long range shot on goal from roberto carlos . the situation probably had oliver kahn thinking back to the last time the teams had played against each other in the world cup final in yokohama , japan .
his only mistake of the championships maybe cost germany the final . but germany were back in the game just 8 minutes later when brazilian-born kevin kuranyi scored in the 17th minute , following a deflected cross from thorsten frings .
kuranyi has scored six of germany 's last eight goals . brazilian-born kuranyi levels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi is congratulated after scoring against the country of his birth .
kuranyi , the stuttgart striker , chested down the ball and slid it past goalkeeper julio cesar .
kuranyi scored all three goals for germany in a 3-1 win over austria last month .
“ it 's great that i scored against brazil .
i could n't be happier ” , kuranyi said . the equalizer came just at the right time and motivated the team to push forward more . in the 24th minute kuranyi had another shot on goal saved by brazilian keeper julio cesar from a pass from bayern munich 's sebastian deisler , making his comeback game in the national side , after successfully beating serious knee injuries and a bout of depression . germany had two chances to take the lead before halftime , but gerald asamoah and philipp lahm both shot poorly .
the visitors pushed germany in the second period with ronaldo shooting high and wide after shaking free of newcomer frank fahrenhorst in one of the few opportunities in the second half . we can hold our own , says klinsmann before the game , klinsmann said it ’ s better to make mistakes than not to take any risks and the german side dictated the pace of the play for much of the match : " yes we can play with them , " klinsmann said , " and hold our own if we can keep the pace . " but it was anything other than a friendly match with much at stake for germany .
the three-time world cup champions have not beaten a top-ranked team for nearly four years when they beat england 1:0 in 2000 .
in addition , the germans have received a lot of criticism since the euro 2004 championships . but the 74,000 fans could sense the new self-confidence growing in the german side and reacted well to germany ’ s game strategy of aggressive marking , risk taking , crisp offensive play and lots of running . against a side rated number one in the world , it seemed to pay off . nigel tandy -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the future beckons for klinsmann 's germany talk of avenging the 2-0 world cup final defeat against wednesday night 's opponents brazil has been dismissed by german coach jürgen klinsmann .

german national coach jürgen klinsmann 's squad had been hoping for a change in fortunes when they took on the south americans in berlin 's olympic stadium . it was klinsmann 's first home match in charge and his team turned in a determined display to offer hope for the 2006 world cup on home soil , a 1-1 draw against world champions brazil . however the three-time world cup victors failed to end a miserable winless streak against big nations . ronaldinho free-kick opens scoring billed as the “ world cup 2002 revenge ” the match in berlin was just nine minutes old when brazilian star ronaldinho scored a cheeky goal from a free-kick just outside germany ’ s penalty area .
ex-german captain oliver kahn did not react at all .

germans - and much of the rest of the world - would like to see a change in u.s. leadership as the transatlantic alliance drifts further apart , a number of recent studies show . a poll of 35 nations released wednesday showed that 30 countries would prefer to see john kerry win the next presidential election , ousting george w. bush .
just three nations came out in favor of the current regime .
the study , released by the canadian opinion research firm globescan and the university of maryland 's program on international policy and attitudes -lrb- pipa -rrb- , polled some 34,000 people in 35 countries .
overall , 46 percent of respondents said they would prefer to see kerry win the election , while support for bush was around 20 percent .
in germany , strong opposition in germany , 74 percent of respondents were for kerry , with only 10 percent supporting bush .
similar results came out from norway , canada and italy .
countries that showed less than 10 percent support for bush were argentina , france , the netherlands , spain and uruguay .
bush only got more support than kerry in poland , nigeria and the philippines ; in india and thailand the numbers were equally divided .
the poll covered countries where questions could be added to ongoing polls , and did not end up including any arab countries or israel .
" only one in five want to see bush reelected .
though he is not as well known , kerry would win handily if the people of the world were to elect the us president , " steven kull , director of pipa , told news organizations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush in addition , a german study , run by the institute for german opinion polling , allensbach -lrb- ifda -rrb- showed germans support a u.s. regime change in november .
in the ifda poll , just 4 percent of 1,023 germans polled said they would opt to re-elect bush , while 68 percent said they would vote for kerry .
the globescan / pipa study also revealed the extent of damage the u.s. image has suffered in europe , especially germany .
in nearly every country of the 35 polled , respondents said that their opinion of america had grown worse since bush took office .
damaged view of u.s. germans showed the greatest loss of respect , with 83 percent of respondents saying their opinion of america had changed for the worse in that time period .
france , mexico , china , the netherlands , italy and brazil showed similar percentages .
as if more evidence of a widening transatlantic rift was needed , an opinion survey conducted for the german marshall fund of the united states and the compagnia di san paolo think-tank in italy , showed the united states and europe are drifting further apart on security issues and the use of force in the aftermath of the war in iraq .
' undesirable ' world leaders in the transatlantic trends 2004 opinion poll of 11,000 americans and europeans , conducted in june , three quarters of europeans said they disapprove of bush 's policies , while a majority said strong u.s. leadership in the world was undesirable .
some 58 percent of europeans said strong u.s. leadership in the world was undesirable , an increase of nine percentage points from a similar poll last year .
only in britain and the netherlands do a majority desire strong u.s. leadership .
by contrast , 79 percent of americans said they support strong european union leadership in world affairs and look to europe as their preferred partner for solving global problems , even though 51 percent of them approve of bush 's foreign policy .
common values while americans are almost evenly divided along ideological lines , 80 percent of europeans surveyed do not believe the u.s.-led invasion of iraq last year was worth the loss of life and cost .
some 73 percent of europeans believe the iraq war increased the risk of terrorism , as do 49 percent of americans .
and while americans and europeans agree on the main threats they face , a higher percentage of americans support using force to prevent a terrorist attack , stop the spread of nuclear weapons , defend a nato ally or remove a regime that abuses human rights .
but despite transatlantic strains , the survey found europeans and americans believe they share enough common values to cooperate on international problems . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : can kerry bring the us and europe back together ?

germans - and much of the rest of the world - would like to see a change in u.s. leadership as the transatlantic alliance drifts further apart , a number of recent studies show . a poll of 35 nations released wednesday showed that 30 countries would prefer to see john kerry win the next presidential election , ousting george w. bush .
just three nations came out in favor of the current regime .
the study , released by the canadian opinion research firm globescan and the university of maryland 's program on international policy and attitudes -lrb- pipa -rrb- , polled some 34,000 people in 35 countries .
overall , 46 percent of respondents said they would prefer to see kerry win the election , while support for bush was around 20 percent .
in germany , strong opposition in germany , 74 percent of respondents were for kerry , with only 10 percent supporting bush .
similar results came out from norway , canada and italy .
countries that showed less than 10 percent support for bush were argentina , france , the netherlands , spain and uruguay .
bush only got more support than kerry in poland , nigeria and the philippines ; in india and thailand the numbers were equally divided .
the poll covered countries where questions could be added to ongoing polls , and did not end up including any arab countries or israel .
" only one in five want to see bush reelected .
though he is not as well known , kerry would win handily if the people of the world were to elect the us president , " steven kull , director of pipa , told news organizations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush in addition , a german study , run by the institute for german opinion polling , allensbach -lrb- ifda -rrb- showed germans support a u.s. regime change in november .
in the ifda poll , just 4 percent of 1,023 germans polled said they would opt to re-elect bush , while 68 percent said they would vote for kerry .
the globescan / pipa study also revealed the extent of damage the u.s. image has suffered in europe , especially germany .
in nearly every country of the 35 polled , respondents said that their opinion of america had grown worse since bush took office .
damaged view of u.s. germans showed the greatest loss of respect , with 83 percent of respondents saying their opinion of america had changed for the worse in that time period .
france , mexico , china , the netherlands , italy and brazil showed similar percentages .
as if more evidence of a widening transatlantic rift was needed , an opinion survey conducted for the german marshall fund of the united states and the compagnia di san paolo think-tank in italy , showed the united states and europe are drifting further apart on security issues and the use of force in the aftermath of the war in iraq .
' undesirable ' world leaders in the transatlantic trends 2004 opinion poll of 11,000 americans and europeans , conducted in june , three quarters of europeans said they disapprove of bush 's policies , while a majority said strong u.s. leadership in the world was undesirable .
some 58 percent of europeans said strong u.s. leadership in the world was undesirable , an increase of nine percentage points from a similar poll last year .
only in britain and the netherlands do a majority desire strong u.s. leadership .
by contrast , 79 percent of americans said they support strong european union leadership in world affairs and look to europe as their preferred partner for solving global problems , even though 51 percent of them approve of bush 's foreign policy .
common values while americans are almost evenly divided along ideological lines , 80 percent of europeans surveyed do not believe the u.s.-led invasion of iraq last year was worth the loss of life and cost .
some 73 percent of europeans believe the iraq war increased the risk of terrorism , as do 49 percent of americans .
and while americans and europeans agree on the main threats they face , a higher percentage of americans support using force to prevent a terrorist attack , stop the spread of nuclear weapons , defend a nato ally or remove a regime that abuses human rights .
but despite transatlantic strains , the survey found europeans and americans believe they share enough common values to cooperate on international problems . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : can kerry bring the us and europe back together ?

what 's more , germany , compared to other countries like great britain and france , does not have a colonial past and has , therefore , found it more difficult to establish cultural connections abroad . few stars among the newcomers compared to other countries , germany does not produce what one could call " star architects , " akin to frank gehry , zaha hadid and rem koolhaas , whose first name alone conjures up fantastic images .
and not only are german architects not recognized elsewhere , they suffer from a lack of name recognition at home . klaus dieter weiss , an architecture critic , said german architects are themselves partly to blame .
they are less willing to put themselves front-and-center - call it humility or lack of self confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerbruch hutton 's new environmental ministry in dessau .
for jens ludloff , a partner at sauerbruch hutton , one of the firms awarded the riba prize this year , german architects ' low-profile and unwillingness to tackle the question of " what should be considered ' german ' in the world of design " is largely due to the historical legacy of predecessors like hitler 's architect albert speer , who crafted a very distinctive brand of architecture reflecting nazi ambitions . " due to that experience , german architect 's have a different sense of self confidence , " he told dw-world . that , combined with poorly-coordinated marketing efforts - until recently the architectural associations did n't take on overseas public relations tasks - has contributed to the decline .
even if germans are still producing forward-thinking work , they are n't telling anyone about it . stars in the making ? so who are among the unsung talents hidden away in germany , just waiting for their chance to shine on the international stage ?
weiss , author of " young german architects , " says hamburg-based carsten roth tops his list . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten roth 's cd packaging center in röbel .
according to weiss , roth 's designs , including several housing projects and a cd packaging center in röbel , are based on provacative theoretical studies - unusual since german architecture tends to be less theory-based .
roth plays with the complex relationship between old and new . for weiss , it is precisely that kind of return to theory and incorporation of more sophisticated ideas into their work , that is necessary for germans to reclaim a top spot in the world of international architecture . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " energy passports " for german homes under eu regulations , european homeowners will be required to have their property inspected for energy efficiency starting in 2006 .

germans - and much of the rest of the world - would like to see a change in u.s. leadership as the transatlantic alliance drifts further apart , a number of recent studies show . a poll of 35 nations released wednesday showed that 30 countries would prefer to see john kerry win the next presidential election , ousting george w. bush .
just three nations came out in favor of the current regime .
the study , released by the canadian opinion research firm globescan and the university of maryland 's program on international policy and attitudes -lrb- pipa -rrb- , polled some 34,000 people in 35 countries .
overall , 46 percent of respondents said they would prefer to see kerry win the election , while support for bush was around 20 percent .
in germany , strong opposition in germany , 74 percent of respondents were for kerry , with only 10 percent supporting bush .
similar results came out from norway , canada and italy .
countries that showed less than 10 percent support for bush were argentina , france , the netherlands , spain and uruguay .
bush only got more support than kerry in poland , nigeria and the philippines ; in india and thailand the numbers were equally divided .
the poll covered countries where questions could be added to ongoing polls , and did not end up including any arab countries or israel .
" only one in five want to see bush reelected .
though he is not as well known , kerry would win handily if the people of the world were to elect the us president , " steven kull , director of pipa , told news organizations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush in addition , a german study , run by the institute for german opinion polling , allensbach -lrb- ifda -rrb- showed germans support a u.s. regime change in november .
in the ifda poll , just 4 percent of 1,023 germans polled said they would opt to re-elect bush , while 68 percent said they would vote for kerry .
the globescan / pipa study also revealed the extent of damage the u.s. image has suffered in europe , especially germany .
in nearly every country of the 35 polled , respondents said that their opinion of america had grown worse since bush took office .
damaged view of u.s. germans showed the greatest loss of respect , with 83 percent of respondents saying their opinion of america had changed for the worse in that time period .
france , mexico , china , the netherlands , italy and brazil showed similar percentages .
as if more evidence of a widening transatlantic rift was needed , an opinion survey conducted for the german marshall fund of the united states and the compagnia di san paolo think-tank in italy , showed the united states and europe are drifting further apart on security issues and the use of force in the aftermath of the war in iraq .
' undesirable ' world leaders in the transatlantic trends 2004 opinion poll of 11,000 americans and europeans , conducted in june , three quarters of europeans said they disapprove of bush 's policies , while a majority said strong u.s. leadership in the world was undesirable .
some 58 percent of europeans said strong u.s. leadership in the world was undesirable , an increase of nine percentage points from a similar poll last year .
only in britain and the netherlands do a majority desire strong u.s. leadership .
by contrast , 79 percent of americans said they support strong european union leadership in world affairs and look to europe as their preferred partner for solving global problems , even though 51 percent of them approve of bush 's foreign policy .
common values while americans are almost evenly divided along ideological lines , 80 percent of europeans surveyed do not believe the u.s.-led invasion of iraq last year was worth the loss of life and cost .
some 73 percent of europeans believe the iraq war increased the risk of terrorism , as do 49 percent of americans .
and while americans and europeans agree on the main threats they face , a higher percentage of americans support using force to prevent a terrorist attack , stop the spread of nuclear weapons , defend a nato ally or remove a regime that abuses human rights .
but despite transatlantic strains , the survey found europeans and americans believe they share enough common values to cooperate on international problems . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : can kerry bring the us and europe back together ?

on thursday , the team 's former commander faces murder charges in a munich court . the 86-year-old former commander of a nazi special forces unit faces court in munich , germany on thursday on charges of murdering 164 people in czechoslovakia at the end of world war ii .
with suspects and potential witnesses dying of old age , the trial of ladislav niznanksy - who led the so-called edelweiss unit that hunted down and killed slovak resistance fighters - may be one of the last of its kind .
niznansky is accused of taking part in the massacre of 146 people in two villages in slovakia in 1945 and later of ordering the execution of 18 jews , mostly women and children , in another village .
former nazi captain held since jan .

since then , the man the nazi-hunting simon wiesenthal center describes as " a mass murderer " has been held in remand .
despite the passing of 60 years , 24 witnesses , some of them survivors , have been located and will testify against the leader of a unit prosecutors say was known for the " special treacherousness and brutality " of its operations .

after his arrest in january , the director of the jerusalem branch of the wiesenthal center urged germany to expedite his trial so that he could finally be held accountable for his crimes .
" the numerous innocent victims murdered by the edelweiss unit fully deserve that the person responsible for their tragic fate be held accountable for his crimes , " said director efraim zuroff .
" in that respect , the passing of time since the crimes were committed and the fact that niznansky has hereto escaped justice in no way diminish the severity of his crimes and his own personal culpability . "
" the holocaust was neither an earthquake nor a hurricane , but a manmade crime for which those responsible must be held accountable , " he said .
niznansky fled into anonymity niznansky is believed to have fled to germany in 1948 after a communist coup and was sentenced to death in czechoslovakia in his absence in 1962 .
he worked unnoticed for several years in munich at radio free europe , the us-funded station that broadcast to eastern europe during the cold war , and was given german citizenship in 1996 .

on february 7 , 1945 he formed an execution commando team and ordered the killing of 18 jews who had been found hiding in bunkers in ksina , prosecutors say .
after his arrest in january , the director of the jerusalem branch of the wiesenthal center urged germany to expedite his trial so that he could finally be held accountable for his crimes .

volkswagen is pushing for a wage freeze and more flexibility in working hours to counteract falling sales . according to volkswagen 's finance chief hans dieter pötsch , the german-based car manufacturer could be forced to drastically slash jobs if trade unions are n't willing to back the company 's cost-cutting initiatives .
" if we end up nowhere , which means no movement -lrb- in the negotiations -rrb- ... this would be an extreme negative for the employment situation in germany , " he said in the thursday edition of wall street journal europe .
asked how many jobs the company might have to cut , pötsch responded " 30,000 plus . "
although that number represents about 17 percent of the company 's 176,000-strong german workforce , vw is committed to keeping as many jobs in germany as possible , pötsch stressed .
worry over job loss in germany the state of lower saxony , which has a significant stake in the company 's shares , expressed concern that vw could be removing jobs from germany .
" we hope of course that all the positions will remain in germany , but we will not get involved in tariff negotiations , " said a speaker for the state executive office in hanover .
a vw spokesman tried to play down the figure , insisting that the " 30,000-number is based on a purely mathematical model for a scenario when the cost situation does not improve . "
it is based on " pure theory , " he said .

the company 's board members have argued that the hold on wage increases as well as the introduction of a lower company pay scale for new employees are necessary in order to bring down vw 's personnel expenditures by two billion euros over the next six years .
" unacceptable " cuts for its part , the powerful ig metall labor union is calling for wage increases of four percent and job guarantees for employees at vw 's six production sites around country .
the union , germany 's largest , reacted angrily to pötsch 's newspaper interview , saying the comments could lead to an escalation of the wage negotiations , scheduled to begin next week .
" it 's completely unacceptable " that a vw board member is " pouring oil onto the fire of the wage dispute , " said ig metalls chief negotiator hartmut meine .
" it is also irresponsible to play with peoples ' fears for their jobs , " he said .
" employees are not abstract numbers .
it is unusual that a finance chief makes a comment about the wage round , especially before the talks have even started . "

a european parliament delegation returning from the crisis area is calling for more aid and increased pressure to end the conflict . while the united nations security council deliberates its response to secretary general kofi annan 's report on the crisis in sudan , the european parliament sent its own delegation to the war-torn region of darfur .
the six-member team will present an evaluation of the humanitarian situation when the parliamentarians return to session next week .
it is also very likely that the subject will make it into the official round of debate as the parliament mulls a possible response to the ongoing crisis .
late last week the european union renewed its threat to slap sanctions on the sudanese government if it does not do more to rein in militias fighting in the western darfur region .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , welcomed the fact that some progress has been made on improving the humanitarian situation in darfur , but lamented that security remains a problem .
" whereas we note some progress in the humanitarian field we are still particularly worried at the security situation caused by lack of progress in disarming and controlling the janjaweed " pro-government militias , he said .
increase international pressure the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- is also not ruling out increasing pressure on khartoum to comply with international demands for an immediate cease-fire .
apart from continuing efforts to help alleviate the humanitarian crisis , which displaced over two million people in darfur , members of the parliament 's development committee stressed the need to find a political solution for sudan .
fiona hall , one of the six parliamentarians who traveled to sudan , told deutsche welle that in the face of renewed attacks it was " very important to keep the pressure on the government . "
" i am particularly concerned about the lack of the security the people in the refugee camps feel , " she said in an interview .
after traveling in the darfur region , meeting with sudanese authorities and speaking with aid workers , refugees and african union observers she said , " basically the message we got was that people wanted to go home but were petrified that there might be new attacks . "
" we spoke to local activists and tribal representatives and they said it is not really a conflict between arab and african tribes , " as the crisis has sometimes been presented , " but that the government is responsible . "
humanitarian nightmare hall , a european parliamentarian from great britain , described the experiences many of the refugees had as " quite harrowing . "
although she acknowledged that things had improved slightly in the refugee camps themselves , especially since non-government organizations have bee granted free access , she said there is still quite a bit of work to do to ensure that aid reaches all the displaced people .
" there are around 1.2 million displaced people in sudan .
some of them are still out of the reach of ngos .
about 200,000 people are impossible to reach because of rain and another 200,000 because they are in a region controlled by the rebels , " she said .
hall echoed an earlier evaluation by the ep that the emergency in darfur is likely to continue for more than a year .
" really this is a long-term crisis .
the people who fled their villages have not had a chance to cultivate their land .
so they will depend on international aid for up to 18 months . "

a european parliament delegation returning from the crisis area is calling for more aid and increased pressure to end the conflict . while the united nations security council deliberates its response to secretary general kofi annan 's report on the crisis in sudan , the european parliament sent its own delegation to the war-torn region of darfur .
the six-member team will present an evaluation of the humanitarian situation when the parliamentarians return to session next week .
it is also very likely that the subject will make it into the official round of debate as the parliament mulls a possible response to the ongoing crisis .
late last week the european union renewed its threat to slap sanctions on the sudanese government if it does not do more to rein in militias fighting in the western darfur region .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , welcomed the fact that some progress has been made on improving the humanitarian situation in darfur , but lamented that security remains a problem .
" whereas we note some progress in the humanitarian field we are still particularly worried at the security situation caused by lack of progress in disarming and controlling the janjaweed " pro-government militias , he said .
increase international pressure the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- is also not ruling out increasing pressure on khartoum to comply with international demands for an immediate cease-fire .
apart from continuing efforts to help alleviate the humanitarian crisis , which displaced over two million people in darfur , members of the parliament 's development committee stressed the need to find a political solution for sudan .
fiona hall , one of the six parliamentarians who traveled to sudan , told deutsche welle that in the face of renewed attacks it was " very important to keep the pressure on the government . "
" i am particularly concerned about the lack of the security the people in the refugee camps feel , " she said in an interview .
after traveling in the darfur region , meeting with sudanese authorities and speaking with aid workers , refugees and african union observers she said , " basically the message we got was that people wanted to go home but were petrified that there might be new attacks . "
" we spoke to local activists and tribal representatives and they said it is not really a conflict between arab and african tribes , " as the crisis has sometimes been presented , " but that the government is responsible . "
humanitarian nightmare hall , a european parliamentarian from great britain , described the experiences many of the refugees had as " quite harrowing . "
although she acknowledged that things had improved slightly in the refugee camps themselves , especially since non-government organizations have bee granted free access , she said there is still quite a bit of work to do to ensure that aid reaches all the displaced people .
" there are around 1.2 million displaced people in sudan .
some of them are still out of the reach of ngos .
about 200,000 people are impossible to reach because of rain and another 200,000 because they are in a region controlled by the rebels , " she said .
hall echoed an earlier evaluation by the ep that the emergency in darfur is likely to continue for more than a year .
" really this is a long-term crisis .
the people who fled their villages have not had a chance to cultivate their land .
so they will depend on international aid for up to 18 months . "
however , " she warned , " there is no help in the pipeline beyond the end of november that would be sufficient .

it ’ s easy to see why after one city employee was fined € 300 for trying to cut through the red tape . civil servants apparently aren ’ t paid enough to think for themselves , they should just do as they ’ re told .
that ’ s the message an administrative court ’ s disciplinary chamber in munich had for one of the city ’ s employees when he made some changes on his own , according to thursday ’ s süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . some may think he ’ s just a headstrong clerical employee , but no one could compel the 57-year-old to file records according to the phonetic alphabet , which would have required him to file " knight " under " n . " after all , the regular alphabet covered all his abc needs for so many years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does n't look like we 'll be needing these anymore ! then , when he decided to throw away over 20,000 index cards - which referred to nonexistent files - it was clear to everyone in munich ’ s city hall that someone had to stop this renegade record-keeper . slow down with all the improvements the prosecutor argued that changes , even improvements , can ’ t just be implemented willy-nilly .
germany has rules and regulations which exist for just these reasons .
it could lead to chaos if rebel filers kept track of paperwork any way they wanted . the court ’ s chief judge saw things the same way .
while the chief justice saw fit to lower the man ’ s fine from € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,342 -rrb- to € 300 , she also warned him that changes , no matter how well meant , can not be put in place by anyone and definitely “ not as fast ” as he acted . it ’ s still unclear who has the unenviable task of filing some 16,000 index cards for a second time , a process officials said could take months . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the very best of dw-world 's collection of the offbeat , the funny and the totally bizarre .

a european parliament delegation returning from the crisis area is calling for more aid and increased pressure to end the conflict . while the united nations security council deliberates its response to secretary general kofi annan 's report on the crisis in sudan , the european parliament sent its own delegation to the war-torn region of darfur .
the six-member team will present an evaluation of the humanitarian situation when the parliamentarians return to session next week .
it is also very likely that the subject will make it into the official round of debate as the parliament mulls a possible response to the ongoing crisis .
late last week the european union renewed its threat to slap sanctions on the sudanese government if it does not do more to rein in militias fighting in the western darfur region .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , welcomed the fact that some progress has been made on improving the humanitarian situation in darfur , but lamented that security remains a problem .
" whereas we note some progress in the humanitarian field we are still particularly worried at the security situation caused by lack of progress in disarming and controlling the janjaweed " pro-government militias , he said .
increase international pressure the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- is also not ruling out increasing pressure on khartoum to comply with international demands for an immediate cease-fire .
apart from continuing efforts to help alleviate the humanitarian crisis , which displaced over two million people in darfur , members of the parliament 's development committee stressed the need to find a political solution for sudan .
fiona hall , one of the six parliamentarians who traveled to sudan , told deutsche welle that in the face of renewed attacks it was " very important to keep the pressure on the government . "
" i am particularly concerned about the lack of the security the people in the refugee camps feel , " she said in an interview .
after traveling in the darfur region , meeting with sudanese authorities and speaking with aid workers , refugees and african union observers she said , " basically the message we got was that people wanted to go home but were petrified that there might be new attacks . "
" we spoke to local activists and tribal representatives and they said it is not really a conflict between arab and african tribes , " as the crisis has sometimes been presented , " but that the government is responsible . "
humanitarian nightmare hall , a european parliamentarian from great britain , described the experiences many of the refugees had as " quite harrowing . "
although she acknowledged that things had improved slightly in the refugee camps themselves , especially since non-government organizations have bee granted free access , she said there is still quite a bit of work to do to ensure that aid reaches all the displaced people .
" there are around 1.2 million displaced people in sudan .
some of them are still out of the reach of ngos .
about 200,000 people are impossible to reach because of rain and another 200,000 because they are in a region controlled by the rebels , " she said .
hall echoed an earlier evaluation by the ep that the emergency in darfur is likely to continue for more than a year .
" really this is a long-term crisis .
the people who fled their villages have not had a chance to cultivate their land .
so they will depend on international aid for up to 18 months . "
however , " she warned , " there is no help in the pipeline beyond the end of november that would be sufficient .

they are less willing to put themselves front-and-center - call it humility or lack of self confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerbruch hutton 's new environmental ministry in dessau .
for jens ludloff , a partner at sauerbruch hutton , one of the firms awarded the riba prize this year , german architects ' low-profile and unwillingness to tackle the question of " what should be considered ' german ' in the world of design " is largely due to the historical legacy of predecessors like hitler 's architect albert speer , who crafted a very distinctive brand of architecture reflecting nazi ambitions . " due to that experience , german architect 's have a different sense of self confidence , " he told dw-world . that , combined with poorly-coordinated marketing efforts - until recently the architectural associations did n't take on overseas public relations tasks - has contributed to the decline .
even if germans are still producing forward-thinking work , they are n't telling anyone about it . stars in the making ? so who are among the unsung talents hidden away in germany , just waiting for their chance to shine on the international stage ?
weiss , author of " young german architects , " says hamburg-based carsten roth tops his list . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten roth 's cd packaging center in röbel .
according to weiss , roth 's designs , including several housing projects and a cd packaging center in röbel , are based on provacative theoretical studies - unusual since german architecture tends to be less theory-based .
roth plays with the complex relationship between old and new . for weiss , it is precisely that kind of return to theory and incorporation of more sophisticated ideas into their work , that is necessary for germans to reclaim a top spot in the world of international architecture . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " energy passports " for german homes under eu regulations , european homeowners will be required to have their property inspected for energy efficiency starting in 2006 .

on thursday , the team 's former commander faces murder charges in a munich court . the 86-year-old former commander of a nazi special forces unit faces court in munich , germany on thursday on charges of murdering 164 people in czechoslovakia at the end of world war ii .
with suspects and potential witnesses dying of old age , the trial of ladislav niznanksy - who led the so-called edelweiss unit that hunted down and killed slovak resistance fighters - may be one of the last of its kind .
niznansky is accused of taking part in the massacre of 146 people in two villages in slovakia in 1945 and later of ordering the execution of 18 jews , mostly women and children , in another village .
former nazi captain held since jan .
16 after living quietly with his wife for 33 years in a munich suburb , the former nazi captain , whom neighbors describe as a friendly old man , was jolted back to the reality of the past when police rang his door bell on january 16 .
since then , the man the nazi-hunting simon wiesenthal center describes as " a mass murderer " has been held in remand .
despite the passing of 60 years , 24 witnesses , some of them survivors , have been located and will testify against the leader of a unit prosecutors say was known for the " special treacherousness and brutality " of its operations .
the edelweiss team was tasked with hunting partisans in slovakia , at the time a nazi puppet state , but niznansky told the german news magazine focus that he " never had to kill someone " while serving with it .
prosecuters claim complicity in 146 murders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to prosecutors , the unit , which also included troops from the notorious german ss , rounded up and shot 146 people from the villages of klak and ostry grun , including 70 women and 51 children , on january 21 , 1945 .
niznansky , who was born in czechoslovakia but has german citizenship , is said to have ordered that no one should be allowed to escape and to have personally shot dead 20 of the victims .
on february 7 , 1945 he formed an execution commando team and ordered the killing of 18 jews who had been found hiding in bunkers in ksina , prosecutors say .
after his arrest in january , the director of the jerusalem branch of the wiesenthal center urged germany to expedite his trial so that he could finally be held accountable for his crimes .
" the numerous innocent victims murdered by the edelweiss unit fully deserve that the person responsible for their tragic fate be held accountable for his crimes , " said director efraim zuroff .
" in that respect , the passing of time since the crimes were committed and the fact that niznansky has hereto escaped justice in no way diminish the severity of his crimes and his own personal culpability . "
" the holocaust was neither an earthquake nor a hurricane , but a manmade crime for which those responsible must be held accountable , " he said .
niznansky fled into anonymity niznansky is believed to have fled to germany in 1948 after a communist coup and was sentenced to death in czechoslovakia in his absence in 1962 .
he worked unnoticed for several years in munich at radio free europe , the us-funded station that broadcast to eastern europe during the cold war , and was given german citizenship in 1996 .
germany was only alerted to his presence in 2001 after an investigation by slovak justice authorities .

on thursday , the team 's former commander faces murder charges in a munich court . the 86-year-old former commander of a nazi special forces unit faces court in munich , germany on thursday on charges of murdering 164 people in czechoslovakia at the end of world war ii .
with suspects and potential witnesses dying of old age , the trial of ladislav niznanksy - who led the so-called edelweiss unit that hunted down and killed slovak resistance fighters - may be one of the last of its kind .
niznansky is accused of taking part in the massacre of 146 people in two villages in slovakia in 1945 and later of ordering the execution of 18 jews , mostly women and children , in another village .
former nazi captain held since jan .
16 after living quietly with his wife for 33 years in a munich suburb , the former nazi captain , whom neighbors describe as a friendly old man , was jolted back to the reality of the past when police rang his door bell on january 16 .
since then , the man the nazi-hunting simon wiesenthal center describes as " a mass murderer " has been held in remand .
despite the passing of 60 years , 24 witnesses , some of them survivors , have been located and will testify against the leader of a unit prosecutors say was known for the " special treacherousness and brutality " of its operations .
the edelweiss team was tasked with hunting partisans in slovakia , at the time a nazi puppet state , but niznansky told the german news magazine focus that he " never had to kill someone " while serving with it .
prosecuters claim complicity in 146 murders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to prosecutors , the unit , which also included troops from the notorious german ss , rounded up and shot 146 people from the villages of klak and ostry grun , including 70 women and 51 children , on january 21 , 1945 .
niznansky , who was born in czechoslovakia but has german citizenship , is said to have ordered that no one should be allowed to escape and to have personally shot dead 20 of the victims .
on february 7 , 1945 he formed an execution commando team and ordered the killing of 18 jews who had been found hiding in bunkers in ksina , prosecutors say .
after his arrest in january , the director of the jerusalem branch of the wiesenthal center urged germany to expedite his trial so that he could finally be held accountable for his crimes .
" the numerous innocent victims murdered by the edelweiss unit fully deserve that the person responsible for their tragic fate be held accountable for his crimes , " said director efraim zuroff .
" in that respect , the passing of time since the crimes were committed and the fact that niznansky has hereto escaped justice in no way diminish the severity of his crimes and his own personal culpability . "
" the holocaust was neither an earthquake nor a hurricane , but a manmade crime for which those responsible must be held accountable , " he said .
niznansky fled into anonymity niznansky is believed to have fled to germany in 1948 after a communist coup and was sentenced to death in czechoslovakia in his absence in 1962 .
he worked unnoticed for several years in munich at radio free europe , the us-funded station that broadcast to eastern europe during the cold war , and was given german citizenship in 1996 .
germany was only alerted to his presence in 2001 after an investigation by slovak justice authorities .

a european parliament delegation returning from the crisis area is calling for more aid and increased pressure to end the conflict . while the united nations security council deliberates its response to secretary general kofi annan 's report on the crisis in sudan , the european parliament sent its own delegation to the war-torn region of darfur .
the six-member team will present an evaluation of the humanitarian situation when the parliamentarians return to session next week .
it is also very likely that the subject will make it into the official round of debate as the parliament mulls a possible response to the ongoing crisis .
late last week the european union renewed its threat to slap sanctions on the sudanese government if it does not do more to rein in militias fighting in the western darfur region .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , welcomed the fact that some progress has been made on improving the humanitarian situation in darfur , but lamented that security remains a problem .
" whereas we note some progress in the humanitarian field we are still particularly worried at the security situation caused by lack of progress in disarming and controlling the janjaweed " pro-government militias , he said .
increase international pressure the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- is also not ruling out increasing pressure on khartoum to comply with international demands for an immediate cease-fire .
apart from continuing efforts to help alleviate the humanitarian crisis , which displaced over two million people in darfur , members of the parliament 's development committee stressed the need to find a political solution for sudan .
fiona hall , one of the six parliamentarians who traveled to sudan , told deutsche welle that in the face of renewed attacks it was " very important to keep the pressure on the government . "
" i am particularly concerned about the lack of the security the people in the refugee camps feel , " she said in an interview .
after traveling in the darfur region , meeting with sudanese authorities and speaking with aid workers , refugees and african union observers she said , " basically the message we got was that people wanted to go home but were petrified that there might be new attacks . "
" we spoke to local activists and tribal representatives and they said it is not really a conflict between arab and african tribes , " as the crisis has sometimes been presented , " but that the government is responsible . "
humanitarian nightmare hall , a european parliamentarian from great britain , described the experiences many of the refugees had as " quite harrowing . "
although she acknowledged that things had improved slightly in the refugee camps themselves , especially since non-government organizations have bee granted free access , she said there is still quite a bit of work to do to ensure that aid reaches all the displaced people .
" there are around 1.2 million displaced people in sudan .
some of them are still out of the reach of ngos .
about 200,000 people are impossible to reach because of rain and another 200,000 because they are in a region controlled by the rebels , " she said .
hall echoed an earlier evaluation by the ep that the emergency in darfur is likely to continue for more than a year .
" really this is a long-term crisis .
the people who fled their villages have not had a chance to cultivate their land .
so they will depend on international aid for up to 18 months . "
however , " she warned , " there is no help in the pipeline beyond the end of november that would be sufficient .

on thursday , the team 's former commander faces murder charges in a munich court . the 86-year-old former commander of a nazi special forces unit faces court in munich , germany on thursday on charges of murdering 164 people in czechoslovakia at the end of world war ii .
with suspects and potential witnesses dying of old age , the trial of ladislav niznanksy - who led the so-called edelweiss unit that hunted down and killed slovak resistance fighters - may be one of the last of its kind .
niznansky is accused of taking part in the massacre of 146 people in two villages in slovakia in 1945 and later of ordering the execution of 18 jews , mostly women and children , in another village .
former nazi captain held since jan .
16 after living quietly with his wife for 33 years in a munich suburb , the former nazi captain , whom neighbors describe as a friendly old man , was jolted back to the reality of the past when police rang his door bell on january 16 .
since then , the man the nazi-hunting simon wiesenthal center describes as " a mass murderer " has been held in remand .
despite the passing of 60 years , 24 witnesses , some of them survivors , have been located and will testify against the leader of a unit prosecutors say was known for the " special treacherousness and brutality " of its operations .
the edelweiss team was tasked with hunting partisans in slovakia , at the time a nazi puppet state , but niznansky told the german news magazine focus that he " never had to kill someone " while serving with it .
prosecuters claim complicity in 146 murders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to prosecutors , the unit , which also included troops from the notorious german ss , rounded up and shot 146 people from the villages of klak and ostry grun , including 70 women and 51 children , on january 21 , 1945 .
niznansky , who was born in czechoslovakia but has german citizenship , is said to have ordered that no one should be allowed to escape and to have personally shot dead 20 of the victims .
on february 7 , 1945 he formed an execution commando team and ordered the killing of 18 jews who had been found hiding in bunkers in ksina , prosecutors say .
after his arrest in january , the director of the jerusalem branch of the wiesenthal center urged germany to expedite his trial so that he could finally be held accountable for his crimes .
" the numerous innocent victims murdered by the edelweiss unit fully deserve that the person responsible for their tragic fate be held accountable for his crimes , " said director efraim zuroff .
" in that respect , the passing of time since the crimes were committed and the fact that niznansky has hereto escaped justice in no way diminish the severity of his crimes and his own personal culpability . "
" the holocaust was neither an earthquake nor a hurricane , but a manmade crime for which those responsible must be held accountable , " he said .
niznansky fled into anonymity niznansky is believed to have fled to germany in 1948 after a communist coup and was sentenced to death in czechoslovakia in his absence in 1962 .
he worked unnoticed for several years in munich at radio free europe , the us-funded station that broadcast to eastern europe during the cold war , and was given german citizenship in 1996 .
germany was only alerted to his presence in 2001 after an investigation by slovak justice authorities .
munich prosecutors then launched their own inquiry . his trial here is expected to involve 15 days of hearings and run until the end of october . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de search for nazis in germany starts soon the simon wiesenthal center in jerusalem announced on wednesday it would start its “ operation last chance ” campaign to track down the last nazi criminals in germany in november .

but then on tuesday morning , a group of armed men stormed their office and took the two aid workers and two iraqi colleagues hostage .
no word has emerged yet from the captors .
taking place in broad daylight in the middle of the busy iraqi capital , the abduction is one of the most brazen a string of recent kidnappings .
since april , people from more than two dozen countries have been kidnapped as guerrillas try to force foreign troops and companies to leave .
more than 20 foreigners have been killed .
torretta and pari , both under 30 , are the first western women to have been taken hostage in iraq .
a statement posted on a web site used by islamic militants said the women " spies were kidnapped to punish italy for not withdrawing troops from iraq and for cooperating with american forces . "
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , whose voters already strongly oppose italy 's military role in iraq , is now under increased pressure to recall the 2,700 troops .
after the us and great britain , italy supplies the third largest military contingent in iraq .

20 .
before rome could secure his release , he was murdered by his captors .
belusconi reaped hefty criticism at the time for not doing enough to protect baldoni .
" what happened when baldoni was kidnapped must not be repeated , " said luciano violante , a leading member of italy 's left-wing opposition .
no distinction between civilians and military an italian government official called the kidnapping a " declaration of war against the west . "
for many observers , tuesday 's events send a clear warning that militants in iraq are no longer making the distinction between military and civilian foreigners .
" this is no longer iraqi resistance , " said gianfranco casinis , speaker of parliament 's lower house .
" these people -lrb- hostage-takers -rrb- first targeted soldiers , but now helpless civilians , two women whose only wrong was to sacrifice their daily lives to alleviate the suffering of the iraqi people . "
berlusconi convened an emergency meeting of the cabinet late tuesday night and appealed for a united national response .

" everyone must mobilize without distinctions , " he added .
" we are prepared to collaborate with the government , with the institutions to save these two brave and honest women . "
meanwhile , deputy foreign minister margherita boniver has set off to the middle east to seek arab help from officials and women 's organizations in releasing the charity workers .
boniver told ansa news agency her visit was aimed at " raising awareness in the arab world about how monstrous the kidnapping of these two women was . "
removing aid workers the abduction of torretta and pari , as well as the kidnapping of two french journalists , who have been held since aug .
20 , has fueled the uncertainty in humanitarian organizations with regard to the security situation in iraq .
the long line of hostage-takings and attacks have forced many to consider whether operating in iraq is worth the risk .
on wednesday international aid agencies met in baghdad to consider withdrawing from iraq entirely .
jean-dominique bunel , a frenchman helping to coordinate aid groups operating in iraq , said he expected most of the remaining 50 foreign aid workers to pull out soon .

in one of the most brazen abductions so far , two italian women aid workers were snatched from their office in downtown baghdad in broad daylight . up until two days ago simona torretta and simona pari felt secure in iraq .
they were working in the office of the italian humanitarian organization a bridge to baghdad .
but then on tuesday morning , a group of armed men stormed their office and took the two aid workers and two iraqi colleagues hostage .
no word has emerged yet from the captors .
taking place in broad daylight in the middle of the busy iraqi capital , the abduction is one of the most brazen a string of recent kidnappings .
since april , people from more than two dozen countries have been kidnapped as guerrillas try to force foreign troops and companies to leave .
more than 20 foreigners have been killed .
torretta and pari , both under 30 , are the first western women to have been taken hostage in iraq .
a statement posted on a web site used by islamic militants said the women " spies were kidnapped to punish italy for not withdrawing troops from iraq and for cooperating with american forces . "
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , whose voters already strongly oppose italy 's military role in iraq , is now under increased pressure to recall the 2,700 troops .
after the us and great britain , italy supplies the third largest military contingent in iraq .
italians in shock all across the country , italians have come out in full force condemning the abduction of the two women , who had gone to baghdad to help provide assistance to the civilian population .
rallies in support of the two women took place in rome and naples on wednesday evening , with people calling on the government to take swift action to guarantee the release of the two women .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an italian carabinieri looks at the portrait of simona pari , above , and simona torretta during a press conference at the rome headquarters of the italian aid organization " un ponte per baghdad " many worry the current kidnapping could end up like the abduction of italian journalist enzo baldoni was taken hostage on aug .
20 .
before rome could secure his release , he was murdered by his captors .
belusconi reaped hefty criticism at the time for not doing enough to protect baldoni .
" what happened when baldoni was kidnapped must not be repeated , " said luciano violante , a leading member of italy 's left-wing opposition .
no distinction between civilians and military an italian government official called the kidnapping a " declaration of war against the west . "
for many observers , tuesday 's events send a clear warning that militants in iraq are no longer making the distinction between military and civilian foreigners .
" this is no longer iraqi resistance , " said gianfranco casinis , speaker of parliament 's lower house .
" these people -lrb- hostage-takers -rrb- first targeted soldiers , but now helpless civilians , two women whose only wrong was to sacrifice their daily lives to alleviate the suffering of the iraqi people . "
berlusconi convened an emergency meeting of the cabinet late tuesday night and appealed for a united national response .
it was the first time that the italian prime minister has adopted a non-partisan approach over the course of several iraq hostage dramas that have deeply shaken italy this year .
representatives of the opposition , staunch opponents to sending troops to iraq , appeared ready for talks with the government wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young boy , benefiting from the work done by the aid organization " a bridge to baghdad " , pleads with insurgents to release aid workers kidnapped this week " we need a revolt of everyone against terrorism , violence and threats , " said opposition leader francesco rutelli .
" everyone must mobilize without distinctions , " he added .
" we are prepared to collaborate with the government , with the institutions to save these two brave and honest women . "
meanwhile , deputy foreign minister margherita boniver has set off to the middle east to seek arab help from officials and women 's organizations in releasing the charity workers .
boniver told ansa news agency her visit was aimed at " raising awareness in the arab world about how monstrous the kidnapping of these two women was . "
removing aid workers the abduction of torretta and pari , as well as the kidnapping of two french journalists , who have been held since aug .
20 , has fueled the uncertainty in humanitarian organizations with regard to the security situation in iraq .
the long line of hostage-takings and attacks have forced many to consider whether operating in iraq is worth the risk .
on wednesday international aid agencies met in baghdad to consider withdrawing from iraq entirely .
jean-dominique bunel , a frenchman helping to coordinate aid groups operating in iraq , said he expected most of the remaining 50 foreign aid workers to pull out soon .
" following the discussions i had this morning , it seems that most foreign ngos are preparing to leave , and some expatriates already left this morning , " bunel said on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france calls for release of journalists held in iraq the french government , in crisis mode , on sunday called for the release of two french journalists kidnapped in iraq by islamic militants demanding that paris rescind a ban on headscarves in state schools .

germans - and much of the rest of the world - would like to see a change in u.s. leadership as the transatlantic alliance drifts further apart , a number of recent studies show . a poll of 35 nations released wednesday showed that 30 countries would prefer to see john kerry win the next presidential election , ousting george w. bush .
just three nations came out in favor of the current regime .
the study , released by the canadian opinion research firm globescan and the university of maryland 's program on international policy and attitudes -lrb- pipa -rrb- , polled some 34,000 people in 35 countries .
overall , 46 percent of respondents said they would prefer to see kerry win the election , while support for bush was around 20 percent .
in germany , strong opposition in germany , 74 percent of respondents were for kerry , with only 10 percent supporting bush .
similar results came out from norway , canada and italy .
countries that showed less than 10 percent support for bush were argentina , france , the netherlands , spain and uruguay .
bush only got more support than kerry in poland , nigeria and the philippines ; in india and thailand the numbers were equally divided .
the poll covered countries where questions could be added to ongoing polls , and did not end up including any arab countries or israel .
" only one in five want to see bush reelected .
though he is not as well known , kerry would win handily if the people of the world were to elect the us president , " steven kull , director of pipa , told news organizations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush in addition , a german study , run by the institute for german opinion polling , allensbach -lrb- ifda -rrb- showed germans support a u.s. regime change in november .
in the ifda poll , just 4 percent of 1,023 germans polled said they would opt to re-elect bush , while 68 percent said they would vote for kerry .
the globescan / pipa study also revealed the extent of damage the u.s. image has suffered in europe , especially germany .
in nearly every country of the 35 polled , respondents said that their opinion of america had grown worse since bush took office .
damaged view of u.s. germans showed the greatest loss of respect , with 83 percent of respondents saying their opinion of america had changed for the worse in that time period .
france , mexico , china , the netherlands , italy and brazil showed similar percentages .
as if more evidence of a widening transatlantic rift was needed , an opinion survey conducted for the german marshall fund of the united states and the compagnia di san paolo think-tank in italy , showed the united states and europe are drifting further apart on security issues and the use of force in the aftermath of the war in iraq .
' undesirable ' world leaders in the transatlantic trends 2004 opinion poll of 11,000 americans and europeans , conducted in june , three quarters of europeans said they disapprove of bush 's policies , while a majority said strong u.s. leadership in the world was undesirable .
some 58 percent of europeans said strong u.s. leadership in the world was undesirable , an increase of nine percentage points from a similar poll last year .
only in britain and the netherlands do a majority desire strong u.s. leadership .
by contrast , 79 percent of americans said they support strong european union leadership in world affairs and look to europe as their preferred partner for solving global problems , even though 51 percent of them approve of bush 's foreign policy .
common values while americans are almost evenly divided along ideological lines , 80 percent of europeans surveyed do not believe the u.s.-led invasion of iraq last year was worth the loss of life and cost .
some 73 percent of europeans believe the iraq war increased the risk of terrorism , as do 49 percent of americans .
and while americans and europeans agree on the main threats they face , a higher percentage of americans support using force to prevent a terrorist attack , stop the spread of nuclear weapons , defend a nato ally or remove a regime that abuses human rights .
but despite transatlantic strains , the survey found europeans and americans believe they share enough common values to cooperate on international problems . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : can kerry bring the us and europe back together ?

germans - and much of the rest of the world - would like to see a change in u.s. leadership as the transatlantic alliance drifts further apart , a number of recent studies show . a poll of 35 nations released wednesday showed that 30 countries would prefer to see john kerry win the next presidential election , ousting george w. bush .
just three nations came out in favor of the current regime .
the study , released by the canadian opinion research firm globescan and the university of maryland 's program on international policy and attitudes -lrb- pipa -rrb- , polled some 34,000 people in 35 countries .
overall , 46 percent of respondents said they would prefer to see kerry win the election , while support for bush was around 20 percent .
in germany , strong opposition in germany , 74 percent of respondents were for kerry , with only 10 percent supporting bush .
similar results came out from norway , canada and italy .
countries that showed less than 10 percent support for bush were argentina , france , the netherlands , spain and uruguay .
bush only got more support than kerry in poland , nigeria and the philippines ; in india and thailand the numbers were equally divided .
the poll covered countries where questions could be added to ongoing polls , and did not end up including any arab countries or israel .
" only one in five want to see bush reelected .
though he is not as well known , kerry would win handily if the people of the world were to elect the us president , " steven kull , director of pipa , told news organizations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush in addition , a german study , run by the institute for german opinion polling , allensbach -lrb- ifda -rrb- showed germans support a u.s. regime change in november .
in the ifda poll , just 4 percent of 1,023 germans polled said they would opt to re-elect bush , while 68 percent said they would vote for kerry .
the globescan / pipa study also revealed the extent of damage the u.s. image has suffered in europe , especially germany .
in nearly every country of the 35 polled , respondents said that their opinion of america had grown worse since bush took office .
damaged view of u.s. germans showed the greatest loss of respect , with 83 percent of respondents saying their opinion of america had changed for the worse in that time period .
france , mexico , china , the netherlands , italy and brazil showed similar percentages .
as if more evidence of a widening transatlantic rift was needed , an opinion survey conducted for the german marshall fund of the united states and the compagnia di san paolo think-tank in italy , showed the united states and europe are drifting further apart on security issues and the use of force in the aftermath of the war in iraq .
' undesirable ' world leaders in the transatlantic trends 2004 opinion poll of 11,000 americans and europeans , conducted in june , three quarters of europeans said they disapprove of bush 's policies , while a majority said strong u.s. leadership in the world was undesirable .
some 58 percent of europeans said strong u.s. leadership in the world was undesirable , an increase of nine percentage points from a similar poll last year .
only in britain and the netherlands do a majority desire strong u.s. leadership .
by contrast , 79 percent of americans said they support strong european union leadership in world affairs and look to europe as their preferred partner for solving global problems , even though 51 percent of them approve of bush 's foreign policy .
common values while americans are almost evenly divided along ideological lines , 80 percent of europeans surveyed do not believe the u.s.-led invasion of iraq last year was worth the loss of life and cost .
some 73 percent of europeans believe the iraq war increased the risk of terrorism , as do 49 percent of americans .
and while americans and europeans agree on the main threats they face , a higher percentage of americans support using force to prevent a terrorist attack , stop the spread of nuclear weapons , defend a nato ally or remove a regime that abuses human rights .
but despite transatlantic strains , the survey found europeans and americans believe they share enough common values to cooperate on international problems . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : can kerry bring the us and europe back together ?

german national coach jürgen klinsmann 's squad had been hoping for a change in fortunes when they took on the south americans in berlin 's olympic stadium . it was klinsmann 's first home match in charge and his team turned in a determined display to offer hope for the 2006 world cup on home soil , a 1-1 draw against world champions brazil . however the three-time world cup victors failed to end a miserable winless streak against big nations . ronaldinho free-kick opens scoring billed as the “ world cup 2002 revenge ” the match in berlin was just nine minutes old when brazilian star ronaldinho scored a cheeky goal from a free-kick just outside germany ’ s penalty area .
ex-german captain oliver kahn did not react at all .
he had been expecting a long range shot on goal from roberto carlos . the situation probably had oliver kahn thinking back to the last time the teams had played against each other in the world cup final in yokohama , japan .
his only mistake of the championships maybe cost germany the final . but germany were back in the game just 8 minutes later when brazilian-born kevin kuranyi scored in the 17th minute , following a deflected cross from thorsten frings .
kuranyi has scored six of germany 's last eight goals . brazilian-born kuranyi levels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi is congratulated after scoring against the country of his birth .
kuranyi , the stuttgart striker , chested down the ball and slid it past goalkeeper julio cesar .
kuranyi scored all three goals for germany in a 3-1 win over austria last month .
“ it 's great that i scored against brazil .
i could n't be happier ” , kuranyi said . the equalizer came just at the right time and motivated the team to push forward more . in the 24th minute kuranyi had another shot on goal saved by brazilian keeper julio cesar from a pass from bayern munich 's sebastian deisler , making his comeback game in the national side , after successfully beating serious knee injuries and a bout of depression . germany had two chances to take the lead before halftime , but gerald asamoah and philipp lahm both shot poorly .
the visitors pushed germany in the second period with ronaldo shooting high and wide after shaking free of newcomer frank fahrenhorst in one of the few opportunities in the second half . we can hold our own , says klinsmann before the game , klinsmann said it ’ s better to make mistakes than not to take any risks and the german side dictated the pace of the play for much of the match : " yes we can play with them , " klinsmann said , " and hold our own if we can keep the pace . " but it was anything other than a friendly match with much at stake for germany .
the three-time world cup champions have not beaten a top-ranked team for nearly four years when they beat england 1:0 in 2000 .
in addition , the germans have received a lot of criticism since the euro 2004 championships . but the 74,000 fans could sense the new self-confidence growing in the german side and reacted well to germany ’ s game strategy of aggressive marking , risk taking , crisp offensive play and lots of running . against a side rated number one in the world , it seemed to pay off . nigel tandy -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the future beckons for klinsmann 's germany talk of avenging the 2-0 world cup final defeat against wednesday night 's opponents brazil has been dismissed by german coach jürgen klinsmann .

volkswagen is pushing for a wage freeze and more flexibility in working hours to counteract falling sales . according to volkswagen 's finance chief hans dieter pötsch , the german-based car manufacturer could be forced to drastically slash jobs if trade unions are n't willing to back the company 's cost-cutting initiatives .
" if we end up nowhere , which means no movement -lrb- in the negotiations -rrb- ... this would be an extreme negative for the employment situation in germany , " he said in the thursday edition of wall street journal europe .
asked how many jobs the company might have to cut , pötsch responded " 30,000 plus . "
although that number represents about 17 percent of the company 's 176,000-strong german workforce , vw is committed to keeping as many jobs in germany as possible , pötsch stressed .
worry over job loss in germany the state of lower saxony , which has a significant stake in the company 's shares , expressed concern that vw could be removing jobs from germany .
" we hope of course that all the positions will remain in germany , but we will not get involved in tariff negotiations , " said a speaker for the state executive office in hanover .
a vw spokesman tried to play down the figure , insisting that the " 30,000-number is based on a purely mathematical model for a scenario when the cost situation does not improve . "
it is based on " pure theory , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen headquarters in wolfsburg , germany : die autostadt faced with falling sales , a bitter price battle among the competition and a weak us dollar , the volkswagen is seeking a two-year wage freeze and increased flexibility of working hours for its german employees during the upcoming round of tariff talks .
the company 's board members have argued that the hold on wage increases as well as the introduction of a lower company pay scale for new employees are necessary in order to bring down vw 's personnel expenditures by two billion euros over the next six years .
" unacceptable " cuts for its part , the powerful ig metall labor union is calling for wage increases of four percent and job guarantees for employees at vw 's six production sites around country .
the union , germany 's largest , reacted angrily to pötsch 's newspaper interview , saying the comments could lead to an escalation of the wage negotiations , scheduled to begin next week .
" it 's completely unacceptable " that a vw board member is " pouring oil onto the fire of the wage dispute , " said ig metalls chief negotiator hartmut meine .
" it is also irresponsible to play with peoples ' fears for their jobs , " he said .
" employees are not abstract numbers .
it is unusual that a finance chief makes a comment about the wage round , especially before the talks have even started . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.09.2004 building a new reputation abroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's chancellery building was designed by a german despite their strong architectural tradition , very few germans get to build important projects abroad .
but at this month 's architecture biennale in venice and at similar events , they 're trying to change that . for some , german architecture invokes historic images of the bauhaus era when mies van der rohe and walter gropius set a new international standard .
but more recently , contemporary german architects have gone largely unnoticed , particularly abroad .
fewer than two percent are offered work beyond their country 's borders , despite the fact that german exports in other fields are otherwise hot sellers . indeed , when architecture buffs reel off the names of those most frequently mentioned in the international design press - and the winners of high-profile competitions for projects like the guggenheim museum in bilbao - germans are not among the gehrys , eisenmans , pianos and hadids . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's reichstag was designed by norman foster , a brit .
at home , they do n't necessarily get a better deal : even the reichstag , the centerpiece of " new berlin , " given a pricey architectural makeover after the fall of the wall , was designed by sir norman foster , a brit .
it 's hard to imagine the brits , french or danes passing over their own talent for such a national commission . but as some are pronouncing germany 's days at the cutting edge of architectural innovation over - others are taking on the task of turning things around . raising germany 's profile abroad for this month 's architecture biennale in venice , curators put together a special exhibition highlighting german inventiveness , " deutschlandscape , " which they hope will prompt renewed interest among foreigners . meanwhile , the federal chamber of architects -lrb- bak -rrb- has launched an initiative , the network for architectural export -lrb- nax -rrb- , to promote german architecture around the world and provide resources for those looking to seek their fortunes abroad .
for the first time next month , nax will attend the expo real in munich and host a panel discussion featuring top german architects entitled , " german architects , worldwide chances . " thanks in part to such efforts , things might be starting to turn around .
three german firms were among the winners of the prestigious royal institute of british architects -lrb- riba -rrb- awards announced in june .
still , say experts , there is much work to be done . inheritors of legacy go unnoticed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauhaus buildings , like this complex in bernau , set a new international standard .
how did german architecture , which with bauhaus and the so-called " new objectivity " was once among the most forward-thinking in the world , fall so far from grace ?
for some , the explanation is simple : postwar german engineering , while highly regarded for its durability and quality , has simply become " unsexy . " thomas weller , the director of the nax initiative concedes this is a problem .
" it 's true foreigners think german architecture is technically proficient , but lacks charm and espirit - it 's too down-to-earth , " he told dw-world . but , weller and others say the problem is more complicated than that , even if they do not agree on a single root cause . mercedes not lamborghinis ingeborg flagge , a curator at the frankfurt-based german architecture museum -lrb- dam -rrb- , is not so quick to blame an unexciting product .
for her , that 's a matter of taste .
" germans do n't build lamborghinis , they build porsches and mercedes , " she said . instead , flagge cites more practical considerations .
" for a long time , it did n't pay for german architects to work elsewhere , since in the postwar years there was plenty of work to do at home , " she said .
what 's more , germany , compared to other countries like great britain and france , does not have a colonial past and has , therefore , found it more difficult to establish cultural connections abroad . few stars among the newcomers compared to other countries , germany does not produce what one could call " star architects , " akin to frank gehry , zaha hadid and rem koolhaas , whose first name alone conjures up fantastic images .
and not only are german architects not recognized elsewhere , they suffer from a lack of name recognition at home . klaus dieter weiss , an architecture critic , said german architects are themselves partly to blame .
they are less willing to put themselves front-and-center - call it humility or lack of self confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerbruch hutton 's new environmental ministry in dessau .
for jens ludloff , a partner at sauerbruch hutton , one of the firms awarded the riba prize this year , german architects ' low-profile and unwillingness to tackle the question of " what should be considered ' german ' in the world of design " is largely due to the historical legacy of predecessors like hitler 's architect albert speer , who crafted a very distinctive brand of architecture reflecting nazi ambitions . " due to that experience , german architect 's have a different sense of self confidence , " he told dw-world . that , combined with poorly-coordinated marketing efforts - until recently the architectural associations did n't take on overseas public relations tasks - has contributed to the decline .
even if germans are still producing forward-thinking work , they are n't telling anyone about it . stars in the making ? so who are among the unsung talents hidden away in germany , just waiting for their chance to shine on the international stage ?
weiss , author of " young german architects , " says hamburg-based carsten roth tops his list . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten roth 's cd packaging center in röbel .
according to weiss , roth 's designs , including several housing projects and a cd packaging center in röbel , are based on provacative theoretical studies - unusual since german architecture tends to be less theory-based .
roth plays with the complex relationship between old and new . for weiss , it is precisely that kind of return to theory and incorporation of more sophisticated ideas into their work , that is necessary for germans to reclaim a top spot in the world of international architecture . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " energy passports " for german homes under eu regulations , european homeowners will be required to have their property inspected for energy efficiency starting in 2006 .

but at this month 's architecture biennale in venice and at similar events , they 're trying to change that . for some , german architecture invokes historic images of the bauhaus era when mies van der rohe and walter gropius set a new international standard .
but more recently , contemporary german architects have gone largely unnoticed , particularly abroad .
fewer than two percent are offered work beyond their country 's borders , despite the fact that german exports in other fields are otherwise hot sellers . indeed , when architecture buffs reel off the names of those most frequently mentioned in the international design press - and the winners of high-profile competitions for projects like the guggenheim museum in bilbao - germans are not among the gehrys , eisenmans , pianos and hadids . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's reichstag was designed by norman foster , a brit .
at home , they do n't necessarily get a better deal : even the reichstag , the centerpiece of " new berlin , " given a pricey architectural makeover after the fall of the wall , was designed by sir norman foster , a brit .

how did german architecture , which with bauhaus and the so-called " new objectivity " was once among the most forward-thinking in the world , fall so far from grace ?
for some , the explanation is simple : postwar german engineering , while highly regarded for its durability and quality , has simply become " unsexy . " thomas weller , the director of the nax initiative concedes this is a problem .
" it 's true foreigners think german architecture is technically proficient , but lacks charm and espirit - it 's too down-to-earth , " he told dw-world . but , weller and others say the problem is more complicated than that , even if they do not agree on a single root cause . mercedes not lamborghinis ingeborg flagge , a curator at the frankfurt-based german architecture museum -lrb- dam -rrb- , is not so quick to blame an unexciting product .

" for a long time , it did n't pay for german architects to work elsewhere , since in the postwar years there was plenty of work to do at home , " she said .
what 's more , germany , compared to other countries like great britain and france , does not have a colonial past and has , therefore , found it more difficult to establish cultural connections abroad . few stars among the newcomers compared to other countries , germany does not produce what one could call " star architects , " akin to frank gehry , zaha hadid and rem koolhaas , whose first name alone conjures up fantastic images .

for jens ludloff , a partner at sauerbruch hutton , one of the firms awarded the riba prize this year , german architects ' low-profile and unwillingness to tackle the question of " what should be considered ' german ' in the world of design " is largely due to the historical legacy of predecessors like hitler 's architect albert speer , who crafted a very distinctive brand of architecture reflecting nazi ambitions .

" learning to shout " came to the eriksdal sports stadium in stockholm this week after first being shown on the finnish island of aaland in the baltic sea , home to composer and author of the piece peter laang . after exploring romantic themes , making an oratorio on large sailboats and an opera for children , laang was searching for a brand new topic for his sixth opera .
" i was watching the 1998 world cup in france on television and i was looking for a way to get back to work and still keep watching the games , " he told afp the day before the premiere last week in stockholm .
" suddenly , all became clear .
i had found the solution : i would make an opera on football , " he said . " learning to shout " is a " pop opera " created on a budget of only € 280,000 -lrb- $ 340,000 -rrb- .
it is made up " of two half-times , lasting 45 minutes each , and includes tackles , shots , passes and dodges " , according to the program . hector leads the troy inter-city firm hebe , the greek goddess of youth personified by soprano therese karlsson , sells beer - instead of the nectar of the legends - on the stands , where she meets hector , trojan warrior and soccer supporter , played by baritone johan hallsten . a black player tackles a white opponent in the penalty area .
the referee does n't blow his whistle for a penalty , and hebe pays the price with her life as the fury of the hooligans bear down upon her . good and evil battle it out the choir plays a fundamental role in this libretto .
the young girls and boys of the estonian 21st century orchestra personify the two teams , g.o.d. and o.n.d. - good and evil in swedish - which correspond to homer 's clash between the trojans and the greeks . for arn-henrik blomqvist , director of the piece and former soccer coach , " the entire tragedy is concentrated in the tiers .
we did n't need to add drama to the field .
the intensity of one match was enough in itself . " " soccer is like life .
it evokes strong feelings .
that 's how i 've gotten into my part , " soprano karlsson said . with a mix of classicism and avant-garde , a giant screen towers over the choir flashing " pop-art " soccer pictures signed by laang .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.09.2004 building a new reputation abroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's chancellery building was designed by a german despite their strong architectural tradition , very few germans get to build important projects abroad .
but at this month 's architecture biennale in venice and at similar events , they 're trying to change that . for some , german architecture invokes historic images of the bauhaus era when mies van der rohe and walter gropius set a new international standard .
but more recently , contemporary german architects have gone largely unnoticed , particularly abroad .
fewer than two percent are offered work beyond their country 's borders , despite the fact that german exports in other fields are otherwise hot sellers . indeed , when architecture buffs reel off the names of those most frequently mentioned in the international design press - and the winners of high-profile competitions for projects like the guggenheim museum in bilbao - germans are not among the gehrys , eisenmans , pianos and hadids . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's reichstag was designed by norman foster , a brit .
at home , they do n't necessarily get a better deal : even the reichstag , the centerpiece of " new berlin , " given a pricey architectural makeover after the fall of the wall , was designed by sir norman foster , a brit .
it 's hard to imagine the brits , french or danes passing over their own talent for such a national commission . but as some are pronouncing germany 's days at the cutting edge of architectural innovation over - others are taking on the task of turning things around . raising germany 's profile abroad for this month 's architecture biennale in venice , curators put together a special exhibition highlighting german inventiveness , " deutschlandscape , " which they hope will prompt renewed interest among foreigners . meanwhile , the federal chamber of architects -lrb- bak -rrb- has launched an initiative , the network for architectural export -lrb- nax -rrb- , to promote german architecture around the world and provide resources for those looking to seek their fortunes abroad .
for the first time next month , nax will attend the expo real in munich and host a panel discussion featuring top german architects entitled , " german architects , worldwide chances . " thanks in part to such efforts , things might be starting to turn around .
three german firms were among the winners of the prestigious royal institute of british architects -lrb- riba -rrb- awards announced in june .
still , say experts , there is much work to be done . inheritors of legacy go unnoticed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauhaus buildings , like this complex in bernau , set a new international standard .
how did german architecture , which with bauhaus and the so-called " new objectivity " was once among the most forward-thinking in the world , fall so far from grace ?
for some , the explanation is simple : postwar german engineering , while highly regarded for its durability and quality , has simply become " unsexy . " thomas weller , the director of the nax initiative concedes this is a problem .
" it 's true foreigners think german architecture is technically proficient , but lacks charm and espirit - it 's too down-to-earth , " he told dw-world . but , weller and others say the problem is more complicated than that , even if they do not agree on a single root cause . mercedes not lamborghinis ingeborg flagge , a curator at the frankfurt-based german architecture museum -lrb- dam -rrb- , is not so quick to blame an unexciting product .

but at this month 's architecture biennale in venice and at similar events , they 're trying to change that . for some , german architecture invokes historic images of the bauhaus era when mies van der rohe and walter gropius set a new international standard .
but more recently , contemporary german architects have gone largely unnoticed , particularly abroad .
fewer than two percent are offered work beyond their country 's borders , despite the fact that german exports in other fields are otherwise hot sellers . indeed , when architecture buffs reel off the names of those most frequently mentioned in the international design press - and the winners of high-profile competitions for projects like the guggenheim museum in bilbao - germans are not among the gehrys , eisenmans , pianos and hadids . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's reichstag was designed by norman foster , a brit .
at home , they do n't necessarily get a better deal : even the reichstag , the centerpiece of " new berlin , " given a pricey architectural makeover after the fall of the wall , was designed by sir norman foster , a brit .
it 's hard to imagine the brits , french or danes passing over their own talent for such a national commission . but as some are pronouncing germany 's days at the cutting edge of architectural innovation over - others are taking on the task of turning things around . raising germany 's profile abroad for this month 's architecture biennale in venice , curators put together a special exhibition highlighting german inventiveness , " deutschlandscape , " which they hope will prompt renewed interest among foreigners . meanwhile , the federal chamber of architects -lrb- bak -rrb- has launched an initiative , the network for architectural export -lrb- nax -rrb- , to promote german architecture around the world and provide resources for those looking to seek their fortunes abroad .
for the first time next month , nax will attend the expo real in munich and host a panel discussion featuring top german architects entitled , " german architects , worldwide chances . " thanks in part to such efforts , things might be starting to turn around .
three german firms were among the winners of the prestigious royal institute of british architects -lrb- riba -rrb- awards announced in june .
still , say experts , there is much work to be done . inheritors of legacy go unnoticed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauhaus buildings , like this complex in bernau , set a new international standard .
how did german architecture , which with bauhaus and the so-called " new objectivity " was once among the most forward-thinking in the world , fall so far from grace ?
for some , the explanation is simple : postwar german engineering , while highly regarded for its durability and quality , has simply become " unsexy . " thomas weller , the director of the nax initiative concedes this is a problem .
" it 's true foreigners think german architecture is technically proficient , but lacks charm and espirit - it 's too down-to-earth , " he told dw-world . but , weller and others say the problem is more complicated than that , even if they do not agree on a single root cause . mercedes not lamborghinis ingeborg flagge , a curator at the frankfurt-based german architecture museum -lrb- dam -rrb- , is not so quick to blame an unexciting product .
for her , that 's a matter of taste .
" germans do n't build lamborghinis , they build porsches and mercedes , " she said . instead , flagge cites more practical considerations .
" for a long time , it did n't pay for german architects to work elsewhere , since in the postwar years there was plenty of work to do at home , " she said .
what 's more , germany , compared to other countries like great britain and france , does not have a colonial past and has , therefore , found it more difficult to establish cultural connections abroad . few stars among the newcomers compared to other countries , germany does not produce what one could call " star architects , " akin to frank gehry , zaha hadid and rem koolhaas , whose first name alone conjures up fantastic images .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 09.09.2004 ex-captain of notorious nazi unit faces trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ladislav niznanksy is now 86 years old the edelweiss team was one of the most feared nazi units in world war ii , tracking down and killing partisans in czechoslavakia .
on thursday , the team 's former commander faces murder charges in a munich court . the 86-year-old former commander of a nazi special forces unit faces court in munich , germany on thursday on charges of murdering 164 people in czechoslovakia at the end of world war ii .
with suspects and potential witnesses dying of old age , the trial of ladislav niznanksy - who led the so-called edelweiss unit that hunted down and killed slovak resistance fighters - may be one of the last of its kind .
niznansky is accused of taking part in the massacre of 146 people in two villages in slovakia in 1945 and later of ordering the execution of 18 jews , mostly women and children , in another village .
former nazi captain held since jan .
16 after living quietly with his wife for 33 years in a munich suburb , the former nazi captain , whom neighbors describe as a friendly old man , was jolted back to the reality of the past when police rang his door bell on january 16 .
since then , the man the nazi-hunting simon wiesenthal center describes as " a mass murderer " has been held in remand .
despite the passing of 60 years , 24 witnesses , some of them survivors , have been located and will testify against the leader of a unit prosecutors say was known for the " special treacherousness and brutality " of its operations .
the edelweiss team was tasked with hunting partisans in slovakia , at the time a nazi puppet state , but niznansky told the german news magazine focus that he " never had to kill someone " while serving with it .
prosecuters claim complicity in 146 murders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to prosecutors , the unit , which also included troops from the notorious german ss , rounded up and shot 146 people from the villages of klak and ostry grun , including 70 women and 51 children , on january 21 , 1945 .
niznansky , who was born in czechoslovakia but has german citizenship , is said to have ordered that no one should be allowed to escape and to have personally shot dead 20 of the victims .
on february 7 , 1945 he formed an execution commando team and ordered the killing of 18 jews who had been found hiding in bunkers in ksina , prosecutors say .
after his arrest in january , the director of the jerusalem branch of the wiesenthal center urged germany to expedite his trial so that he could finally be held accountable for his crimes .
" the numerous innocent victims murdered by the edelweiss unit fully deserve that the person responsible for their tragic fate be held accountable for his crimes , " said director efraim zuroff .
" in that respect , the passing of time since the crimes were committed and the fact that niznansky has hereto escaped justice in no way diminish the severity of his crimes and his own personal culpability . "
" the holocaust was neither an earthquake nor a hurricane , but a manmade crime for which those responsible must be held accountable , " he said .
niznansky fled into anonymity niznansky is believed to have fled to germany in 1948 after a communist coup and was sentenced to death in czechoslovakia in his absence in 1962 .
he worked unnoticed for several years in munich at radio free europe , the us-funded station that broadcast to eastern europe during the cold war , and was given german citizenship in 1996 .
germany was only alerted to his presence in 2001 after an investigation by slovak justice authorities .
munich prosecutors then launched their own inquiry . his trial here is expected to involve 15 days of hearings and run until the end of october . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de search for nazis in germany starts soon the simon wiesenthal center in jerusalem announced on wednesday it would start its “ operation last chance ” campaign to track down the last nazi criminals in germany in november .

a european parliament delegation returning from the crisis area is calling for more aid and increased pressure to end the conflict . while the united nations security council deliberates its response to secretary general kofi annan 's report on the crisis in sudan , the european parliament sent its own delegation to the war-torn region of darfur .
the six-member team will present an evaluation of the humanitarian situation when the parliamentarians return to session next week .
it is also very likely that the subject will make it into the official round of debate as the parliament mulls a possible response to the ongoing crisis .
late last week the european union renewed its threat to slap sanctions on the sudanese government if it does not do more to rein in militias fighting in the western darfur region .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , welcomed the fact that some progress has been made on improving the humanitarian situation in darfur , but lamented that security remains a problem .
" whereas we note some progress in the humanitarian field we are still particularly worried at the security situation caused by lack of progress in disarming and controlling the janjaweed " pro-government militias , he said .
increase international pressure the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- is also not ruling out increasing pressure on khartoum to comply with international demands for an immediate cease-fire .
apart from continuing efforts to help alleviate the humanitarian crisis , which displaced over two million people in darfur , members of the parliament 's development committee stressed the need to find a political solution for sudan .
fiona hall , one of the six parliamentarians who traveled to sudan , told deutsche welle that in the face of renewed attacks it was " very important to keep the pressure on the government . "
" i am particularly concerned about the lack of the security the people in the refugee camps feel , " she said in an interview .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.09.2004 building a new reputation abroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's chancellery building was designed by a german despite their strong architectural tradition , very few germans get to build important projects abroad .
but at this month 's architecture biennale in venice and at similar events , they 're trying to change that . for some , german architecture invokes historic images of the bauhaus era when mies van der rohe and walter gropius set a new international standard .
but more recently , contemporary german architects have gone largely unnoticed , particularly abroad .
fewer than two percent are offered work beyond their country 's borders , despite the fact that german exports in other fields are otherwise hot sellers . indeed , when architecture buffs reel off the names of those most frequently mentioned in the international design press - and the winners of high-profile competitions for projects like the guggenheim museum in bilbao - germans are not among the gehrys , eisenmans , pianos and hadids . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's reichstag was designed by norman foster , a brit .
at home , they do n't necessarily get a better deal : even the reichstag , the centerpiece of " new berlin , " given a pricey architectural makeover after the fall of the wall , was designed by sir norman foster , a brit .
it 's hard to imagine the brits , french or danes passing over their own talent for such a national commission . but as some are pronouncing germany 's days at the cutting edge of architectural innovation over - others are taking on the task of turning things around . raising germany 's profile abroad for this month 's architecture biennale in venice , curators put together a special exhibition highlighting german inventiveness , " deutschlandscape , " which they hope will prompt renewed interest among foreigners . meanwhile , the federal chamber of architects -lrb- bak -rrb- has launched an initiative , the network for architectural export -lrb- nax -rrb- , to promote german architecture around the world and provide resources for those looking to seek their fortunes abroad .
for the first time next month , nax will attend the expo real in munich and host a panel discussion featuring top german architects entitled , " german architects , worldwide chances . " thanks in part to such efforts , things might be starting to turn around .
three german firms were among the winners of the prestigious royal institute of british architects -lrb- riba -rrb- awards announced in june .
still , say experts , there is much work to be done . inheritors of legacy go unnoticed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauhaus buildings , like this complex in bernau , set a new international standard .
how did german architecture , which with bauhaus and the so-called " new objectivity " was once among the most forward-thinking in the world , fall so far from grace ?
for some , the explanation is simple : postwar german engineering , while highly regarded for its durability and quality , has simply become " unsexy . " thomas weller , the director of the nax initiative concedes this is a problem .
" it 's true foreigners think german architecture is technically proficient , but lacks charm and espirit - it 's too down-to-earth , " he told dw-world . but , weller and others say the problem is more complicated than that , even if they do not agree on a single root cause . mercedes not lamborghinis ingeborg flagge , a curator at the frankfurt-based german architecture museum -lrb- dam -rrb- , is not so quick to blame an unexciting product .
for her , that 's a matter of taste .
" germans do n't build lamborghinis , they build porsches and mercedes , " she said . instead , flagge cites more practical considerations .
" for a long time , it did n't pay for german architects to work elsewhere , since in the postwar years there was plenty of work to do at home , " she said .
what 's more , germany , compared to other countries like great britain and france , does not have a colonial past and has , therefore , found it more difficult to establish cultural connections abroad . few stars among the newcomers compared to other countries , germany does not produce what one could call " star architects , " akin to frank gehry , zaha hadid and rem koolhaas , whose first name alone conjures up fantastic images .
and not only are german architects not recognized elsewhere , they suffer from a lack of name recognition at home . klaus dieter weiss , an architecture critic , said german architects are themselves partly to blame .
they are less willing to put themselves front-and-center - call it humility or lack of self confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerbruch hutton 's new environmental ministry in dessau .
for jens ludloff , a partner at sauerbruch hutton , one of the firms awarded the riba prize this year , german architects ' low-profile and unwillingness to tackle the question of " what should be considered ' german ' in the world of design " is largely due to the historical legacy of predecessors like hitler 's architect albert speer , who crafted a very distinctive brand of architecture reflecting nazi ambitions . " due to that experience , german architect 's have a different sense of self confidence , " he told dw-world . that , combined with poorly-coordinated marketing efforts - until recently the architectural associations did n't take on overseas public relations tasks - has contributed to the decline .
even if germans are still producing forward-thinking work , they are n't telling anyone about it . stars in the making ? so who are among the unsung talents hidden away in germany , just waiting for their chance to shine on the international stage ?
weiss , author of " young german architects , " says hamburg-based carsten roth tops his list . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten roth 's cd packaging center in röbel .
according to weiss , roth 's designs , including several housing projects and a cd packaging center in röbel , are based on provacative theoretical studies - unusual since german architecture tends to be less theory-based .
roth plays with the complex relationship between old and new . for weiss , it is precisely that kind of return to theory and incorporation of more sophisticated ideas into their work , that is necessary for germans to reclaim a top spot in the world of international architecture . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " energy passports " for german homes under eu regulations , european homeowners will be required to have their property inspected for energy efficiency starting in 2006 .

german national coach jürgen klinsmann 's squad had been hoping for a change in fortunes when they took on the south americans in berlin 's olympic stadium . it was klinsmann 's first home match in charge and his team turned in a determined display to offer hope for the 2006 world cup on home soil , a 1-1 draw against world champions brazil . however the three-time world cup victors failed to end a miserable winless streak against big nations . ronaldinho free-kick opens scoring billed as the “ world cup 2002 revenge ” the match in berlin was just nine minutes old when brazilian star ronaldinho scored a cheeky goal from a free-kick just outside germany ’ s penalty area .
ex-german captain oliver kahn did not react at all .
he had been expecting a long range shot on goal from roberto carlos . the situation probably had oliver kahn thinking back to the last time the teams had played against each other in the world cup final in yokohama , japan .
his only mistake of the championships maybe cost germany the final . but germany were back in the game just 8 minutes later when brazilian-born kevin kuranyi scored in the 17th minute , following a deflected cross from thorsten frings .

i could n't be happier ” , kuranyi said . the equalizer came just at the right time and motivated the team to push forward more . in the 24th minute kuranyi had another shot on goal saved by brazilian keeper julio cesar from a pass from bayern munich 's sebastian deisler , making his comeback game in the national side , after successfully beating serious knee injuries and a bout of depression . germany had two chances to take the lead before halftime , but gerald asamoah and philipp lahm both shot poorly .
the visitors pushed germany in the second period with ronaldo shooting high and wide after shaking free of newcomer frank fahrenhorst in one of the few opportunities in the second half . we can hold our own , says klinsmann before the game , klinsmann said it ’ s better to make mistakes than not to take any risks and the german side dictated the pace of the play for much of the match : " yes we can play with them , " klinsmann said , " and hold our own if we can keep the pace . " but it was anything other than a friendly match with much at stake for germany .
the three-time world cup champions have not beaten a top-ranked team for nearly four years when they beat england 1:0 in 2000 .
in addition , the germans have received a lot of criticism since the euro 2004 championships . but the 74,000 fans could sense the new self-confidence growing in the german side and reacted well to germany ’ s game strategy of aggressive marking , risk taking , crisp offensive play and lots of running . against a side rated number one in the world , it seemed to pay off . nigel tandy -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the future beckons for klinsmann 's germany talk of avenging the 2-0 world cup final defeat against wednesday night 's opponents brazil has been dismissed by german coach jürgen klinsmann .

german national coach jürgen klinsmann 's squad had been hoping for a change in fortunes when they took on the south americans in berlin 's olympic stadium . it was klinsmann 's first home match in charge and his team turned in a determined display to offer hope for the 2006 world cup on home soil , a 1-1 draw against world champions brazil . however the three-time world cup victors failed to end a miserable winless streak against big nations . ronaldinho free-kick opens scoring billed as the “ world cup 2002 revenge ” the match in berlin was just nine minutes old when brazilian star ronaldinho scored a cheeky goal from a free-kick just outside germany ’ s penalty area .

it ’ s easy to see why after one city employee was fined € 300 for trying to cut through the red tape . civil servants apparently aren ’ t paid enough to think for themselves , they should just do as they ’ re told .
that ’ s the message an administrative court ’ s disciplinary chamber in munich had for one of the city ’ s employees when he made some changes on his own , according to thursday ’ s süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . some may think he ’ s just a headstrong clerical employee , but no one could compel the 57-year-old to file records according to the phonetic alphabet , which would have required him to file " knight " under " n . " after all , the regular alphabet covered all his abc needs for so many years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does n't look like we 'll be needing these anymore ! then , when he decided to throw away over 20,000 index cards - which referred to nonexistent files - it was clear to everyone in munich ’ s city hall that someone had to stop this renegade record-keeper . slow down with all the improvements the prosecutor argued that changes , even improvements , can ’ t just be implemented willy-nilly .
germany has rules and regulations which exist for just these reasons .
it could lead to chaos if rebel filers kept track of paperwork any way they wanted . the court ’ s chief judge saw things the same way .
while the chief justice saw fit to lower the man ’ s fine from € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,342 -rrb- to € 300 , she also warned him that changes , no matter how well meant , can not be put in place by anyone and definitely “ not as fast ” as he acted . it ’ s still unclear who has the unenviable task of filing some 16,000 index cards for a second time , a process officials said could take months . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the very best of dw-world 's collection of the offbeat , the funny and the totally bizarre . media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

the referee does n't blow his whistle for a penalty , and hebe pays the price with her life as the fury of the hooligans bear down upon her . good and evil battle it out the choir plays a fundamental role in this libretto .

" learning to shout " came to the eriksdal sports stadium in stockholm this week after first being shown on the finnish island of aaland in the baltic sea , home to composer and author of the piece peter laang . after exploring romantic themes , making an oratorio on large sailboats and an opera for children , laang was searching for a brand new topic for his sixth opera .
" i was watching the 1998 world cup in france on television and i was looking for a way to get back to work and still keep watching the games , " he told afp the day before the premiere last week in stockholm .
" suddenly , all became clear .
i had found the solution : i would make an opera on football , " he said . " learning to shout " is a " pop opera " created on a budget of only € 280,000 -lrb- $ 340,000 -rrb- .
it is made up " of two half-times , lasting 45 minutes each , and includes tackles , shots , passes and dodges " , according to the program . hector leads the troy inter-city firm hebe , the greek goddess of youth personified by soprano therese karlsson , sells beer - instead of the nectar of the legends - on the stands , where she meets hector , trojan warrior and soccer supporter , played by baritone johan hallsten . a black player tackles a white opponent in the penalty area .
the referee does n't blow his whistle for a penalty , and hebe pays the price with her life as the fury of the hooligans bear down upon her . good and evil battle it out the choir plays a fundamental role in this libretto .
the young girls and boys of the estonian 21st century orchestra personify the two teams , g.o.d. and o.n.d. - good and evil in swedish - which correspond to homer 's clash between the trojans and the greeks . for arn-henrik blomqvist , director of the piece and former soccer coach , " the entire tragedy is concentrated in the tiers .
we did n't need to add drama to the field .
the intensity of one match was enough in itself . " " soccer is like life .
it evokes strong feelings .
that 's how i 've gotten into my part , " soprano karlsson said . with a mix of classicism and avant-garde , a giant screen towers over the choir flashing " pop-art " soccer pictures signed by laang .
a television sports commentator sits facing a small screen , belting out his comments while a hooligan chorus wearing t-shirts with the logo " troy fc " let loose a torrent of abuse and belches .
agitation among players in the center circle rises . contemporary soccer issues the violence , intolerance and racism , a familiar curse of contemporary soccer , is expressed through dramatic violins accompanied by african percussion instruments and accordions .
the effect is clear . but " it 's not obvious that we 'll attract traditional opera amateurs " , admits producer ulrika lind , who makes no secret of her ambition to suck in organizers of the 2006 world cup in germany with the opera 's themes of fair play and the fight against racism . laang meanwhile is exasperated by what he calls the " blindness " of the swedish football federation when it comes to addressing these issues .
" i have contacted them to get them involved , and they told me that there was no racism in swedish soccer . " it is stupefying .
just a few hundred meters from here there is a plaque commemorating a supporter who was beaten to death after a game , " he said . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fighting racism in the soccer stadium under pressure following numerous incidents of racist activity in europe ’ s soccer stadiums , the sport ’ s governing body held its first-ever conference on battling racism among fans and players .

the wto delivered its ruling wednesday that eu exports have exceeded quotas for subsidized sugar by up to four times .
the ruling follows a preliminary report from the wto issued last month .
australia , brazil and thailand , who brought the case up in 2002 , complained that eu subsidies allow european producers to slash costs and undermine world prices by up to 17 percent .
the european commission said that it would study the panels report and decide whether it wants to appeal the decision , but development organizations urged the eu to accept the panel 's decision .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 09.09.2004 -pipe- 16:00 utc minister drops change to surveillance law german justice minister brigitte zypries will not extend the law allowing for electronic surveillance in the home to people with client secrecy privileges , such as doctors , lawyers , priests and journalists , a ministry spokesperson said thursday .
social democrat zypries initially wanted to allow the police to carry out surveillance on such professionals in their work places or private rooms , but came up against significant opposition including from green party members of the governing coalition .

" learning to shout " came to the eriksdal sports stadium in stockholm this week after first being shown on the finnish island of aaland in the baltic sea , home to composer and author of the piece peter laang . after exploring romantic themes , making an oratorio on large sailboats and an opera for children , laang was searching for a brand new topic for his sixth opera .
" i was watching the 1998 world cup in france on television and i was looking for a way to get back to work and still keep watching the games , " he told afp the day before the premiere last week in stockholm .
" suddenly , all became clear .
i had found the solution : i would make an opera on football , " he said . " learning to shout " is a " pop opera " created on a budget of only € 280,000 -lrb- $ 340,000 -rrb- .

the referee does n't blow his whistle for a penalty , and hebe pays the price with her life as the fury of the hooligans bear down upon her . good and evil battle it out the choir plays a fundamental role in this libretto .
the young girls and boys of the estonian 21st century orchestra personify the two teams , g.o.d. and o.n.d. - good and evil in swedish - which correspond to homer 's clash between the trojans and the greeks . for arn-henrik blomqvist , director of the piece and former soccer coach , " the entire tragedy is concentrated in the tiers .
we did n't need to add drama to the field .
the intensity of one match was enough in itself . " " soccer is like life .
it evokes strong feelings .
that 's how i 've gotten into my part , " soprano karlsson said . with a mix of classicism and avant-garde , a giant screen towers over the choir flashing " pop-art " soccer pictures signed by laang .
a television sports commentator sits facing a small screen , belting out his comments while a hooligan chorus wearing t-shirts with the logo " troy fc " let loose a torrent of abuse and belches .
agitation among players in the center circle rises . contemporary soccer issues the violence , intolerance and racism , a familiar curse of contemporary soccer , is expressed through dramatic violins accompanied by african percussion instruments and accordions .
the effect is clear . but " it 's not obvious that we 'll attract traditional opera amateurs " , admits producer ulrika lind , who makes no secret of her ambition to suck in organizers of the 2006 world cup in germany with the opera 's themes of fair play and the fight against racism . laang meanwhile is exasperated by what he calls the " blindness " of the swedish football federation when it comes to addressing these issues .
" i have contacted them to get them involved , and they told me that there was no racism in swedish soccer . " it is stupefying .

since april , people from more than two dozen countries have been kidnapped as guerrillas try to force foreign troops and companies to leave .
more than 20 foreigners have been killed .
torretta and pari , both under 30 , are the first western women to have been taken hostage in iraq .
a statement posted on a web site used by islamic militants said the women " spies were kidnapped to punish italy for not withdrawing troops from iraq and for cooperating with american forces . "
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , whose voters already strongly oppose italy 's military role in iraq , is now under increased pressure to recall the 2,700 troops .

" what happened when baldoni was kidnapped must not be repeated , " said luciano violante , a leading member of italy 's left-wing opposition .

for many observers , tuesday 's events send a clear warning that militants in iraq are no longer making the distinction between military and civilian foreigners .
" this is no longer iraqi resistance , " said gianfranco casinis , speaker of parliament 's lower house .
" these people -lrb- hostage-takers -rrb- first targeted soldiers , but now helpless civilians , two women whose only wrong was to sacrifice their daily lives to alleviate the suffering of the iraqi people . "

but then on tuesday morning , a group of armed men stormed their office and took the two aid workers and two iraqi colleagues hostage .
no word has emerged yet from the captors .
taking place in broad daylight in the middle of the busy iraqi capital , the abduction is one of the most brazen a string of recent kidnappings .
since april , people from more than two dozen countries have been kidnapped as guerrillas try to force foreign troops and companies to leave .
more than 20 foreigners have been killed .
torretta and pari , both under 30 , are the first western women to have been taken hostage in iraq .
a statement posted on a web site used by islamic militants said the women " spies were kidnapped to punish italy for not withdrawing troops from iraq and for cooperating with american forces . "
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , whose voters already strongly oppose italy 's military role in iraq , is now under increased pressure to recall the 2,700 troops .
after the us and great britain , italy supplies the third largest military contingent in iraq .
italians in shock all across the country , italians have come out in full force condemning the abduction of the two women , who had gone to baghdad to help provide assistance to the civilian population .

belusconi reaped hefty criticism at the time for not doing enough to protect baldoni .
" what happened when baldoni was kidnapped must not be repeated , " said luciano violante , a leading member of italy 's left-wing opposition .
no distinction between civilians and military an italian government official called the kidnapping a " declaration of war against the west . "
for many observers , tuesday 's events send a clear warning that militants in iraq are no longer making the distinction between military and civilian foreigners .
" this is no longer iraqi resistance , " said gianfranco casinis , speaker of parliament 's lower house .
" these people -lrb- hostage-takers -rrb- first targeted soldiers , but now helpless civilians , two women whose only wrong was to sacrifice their daily lives to alleviate the suffering of the iraqi people . "

boniver told ansa news agency her visit was aimed at " raising awareness in the arab world about how monstrous the kidnapping of these two women was . "
removing aid workers the abduction of torretta and pari , as well as the kidnapping of two french journalists , who have been held since aug .
20 , has fueled the uncertainty in humanitarian organizations with regard to the security situation in iraq .
the long line of hostage-takings and attacks have forced many to consider whether operating in iraq is worth the risk .
on wednesday international aid agencies met in baghdad to consider withdrawing from iraq entirely .
jean-dominique bunel , a frenchman helping to coordinate aid groups operating in iraq , said he expected most of the remaining 50 foreign aid workers to pull out soon .

in one of the most brazen abductions so far , two italian women aid workers were snatched from their office in downtown baghdad in broad daylight . up until two days ago simona torretta and simona pari felt secure in iraq .
they were working in the office of the italian humanitarian organization a bridge to baghdad .
but then on tuesday morning , a group of armed men stormed their office and took the two aid workers and two iraqi colleagues hostage .
no word has emerged yet from the captors .
taking place in broad daylight in the middle of the busy iraqi capital , the abduction is one of the most brazen a string of recent kidnappings .
since april , people from more than two dozen countries have been kidnapped as guerrillas try to force foreign troops and companies to leave .
more than 20 foreigners have been killed .
torretta and pari , both under 30 , are the first western women to have been taken hostage in iraq .
a statement posted on a web site used by islamic militants said the women " spies were kidnapped to punish italy for not withdrawing troops from iraq and for cooperating with american forces . "
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , whose voters already strongly oppose italy 's military role in iraq , is now under increased pressure to recall the 2,700 troops .
after the us and great britain , italy supplies the third largest military contingent in iraq .
italians in shock all across the country , italians have come out in full force condemning the abduction of the two women , who had gone to baghdad to help provide assistance to the civilian population .
rallies in support of the two women took place in rome and naples on wednesday evening , with people calling on the government to take swift action to guarantee the release of the two women .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an italian carabinieri looks at the portrait of simona pari , above , and simona torretta during a press conference at the rome headquarters of the italian aid organization " un ponte per baghdad " many worry the current kidnapping could end up like the abduction of italian journalist enzo baldoni was taken hostage on aug .
20 .
before rome could secure his release , he was murdered by his captors .
belusconi reaped hefty criticism at the time for not doing enough to protect baldoni .
" what happened when baldoni was kidnapped must not be repeated , " said luciano violante , a leading member of italy 's left-wing opposition .
no distinction between civilians and military an italian government official called the kidnapping a " declaration of war against the west . "
for many observers , tuesday 's events send a clear warning that militants in iraq are no longer making the distinction between military and civilian foreigners .
" this is no longer iraqi resistance , " said gianfranco casinis , speaker of parliament 's lower house .
" these people -lrb- hostage-takers -rrb- first targeted soldiers , but now helpless civilians , two women whose only wrong was to sacrifice their daily lives to alleviate the suffering of the iraqi people . "
berlusconi convened an emergency meeting of the cabinet late tuesday night and appealed for a united national response .
it was the first time that the italian prime minister has adopted a non-partisan approach over the course of several iraq hostage dramas that have deeply shaken italy this year .
representatives of the opposition , staunch opponents to sending troops to iraq , appeared ready for talks with the government wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young boy , benefiting from the work done by the aid organization " a bridge to baghdad " , pleads with insurgents to release aid workers kidnapped this week " we need a revolt of everyone against terrorism , violence and threats , " said opposition leader francesco rutelli .
" everyone must mobilize without distinctions , " he added .
" we are prepared to collaborate with the government , with the institutions to save these two brave and honest women . "
meanwhile , deputy foreign minister margherita boniver has set off to the middle east to seek arab help from officials and women 's organizations in releasing the charity workers .
boniver told ansa news agency her visit was aimed at " raising awareness in the arab world about how monstrous the kidnapping of these two women was . "
removing aid workers the abduction of torretta and pari , as well as the kidnapping of two french journalists , who have been held since aug .
20 , has fueled the uncertainty in humanitarian organizations with regard to the security situation in iraq .
the long line of hostage-takings and attacks have forced many to consider whether operating in iraq is worth the risk .
on wednesday international aid agencies met in baghdad to consider withdrawing from iraq entirely .
jean-dominique bunel , a frenchman helping to coordinate aid groups operating in iraq , said he expected most of the remaining 50 foreign aid workers to pull out soon .
" following the discussions i had this morning , it seems that most foreign ngos are preparing to leave , and some expatriates already left this morning , " bunel said on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france calls for release of journalists held in iraq the french government , in crisis mode , on sunday called for the release of two french journalists kidnapped in iraq by islamic militants demanding that paris rescind a ban on headscarves in state schools .

germans - and much of the rest of the world - would like to see a change in u.s. leadership as the transatlantic alliance drifts further apart , a number of recent studies show . a poll of 35 nations released wednesday showed that 30 countries would prefer to see john kerry win the next presidential election , ousting george w. bush .
just three nations came out in favor of the current regime .
the study , released by the canadian opinion research firm globescan and the university of maryland 's program on international policy and attitudes -lrb- pipa -rrb- , polled some 34,000 people in 35 countries .
overall , 46 percent of respondents said they would prefer to see kerry win the election , while support for bush was around 20 percent .
in germany , strong opposition in germany , 74 percent of respondents were for kerry , with only 10 percent supporting bush .
similar results came out from norway , canada and italy .
countries that showed less than 10 percent support for bush were argentina , france , the netherlands , spain and uruguay .
bush only got more support than kerry in poland , nigeria and the philippines ; in india and thailand the numbers were equally divided .
the poll covered countries where questions could be added to ongoing polls , and did not end up including any arab countries or israel .
" only one in five want to see bush reelected .
though he is not as well known , kerry would win handily if the people of the world were to elect the us president , " steven kull , director of pipa , told news organizations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush in addition , a german study , run by the institute for german opinion polling , allensbach -lrb- ifda -rrb- showed germans support a u.s. regime change in november .
in the ifda poll , just 4 percent of 1,023 germans polled said they would opt to re-elect bush , while 68 percent said they would vote for kerry .
the globescan / pipa study also revealed the extent of damage the u.s. image has suffered in europe , especially germany .
in nearly every country of the 35 polled , respondents said that their opinion of america had grown worse since bush took office .
damaged view of u.s. germans showed the greatest loss of respect , with 83 percent of respondents saying their opinion of america had changed for the worse in that time period .
france , mexico , china , the netherlands , italy and brazil showed similar percentages .
as if more evidence of a widening transatlantic rift was needed , an opinion survey conducted for the german marshall fund of the united states and the compagnia di san paolo think-tank in italy , showed the united states and europe are drifting further apart on security issues and the use of force in the aftermath of the war in iraq .
' undesirable ' world leaders in the transatlantic trends 2004 opinion poll of 11,000 americans and europeans , conducted in june , three quarters of europeans said they disapprove of bush 's policies , while a majority said strong u.s. leadership in the world was undesirable .
some 58 percent of europeans said strong u.s. leadership in the world was undesirable , an increase of nine percentage points from a similar poll last year .
only in britain and the netherlands do a majority desire strong u.s. leadership .
by contrast , 79 percent of americans said they support strong european union leadership in world affairs and look to europe as their preferred partner for solving global problems , even though 51 percent of them approve of bush 's foreign policy .
common values while americans are almost evenly divided along ideological lines , 80 percent of europeans surveyed do not believe the u.s.-led invasion of iraq last year was worth the loss of life and cost .
some 73 percent of europeans believe the iraq war increased the risk of terrorism , as do 49 percent of americans .
and while americans and europeans agree on the main threats they face , a higher percentage of americans support using force to prevent a terrorist attack , stop the spread of nuclear weapons , defend a nato ally or remove a regime that abuses human rights .
but despite transatlantic strains , the survey found europeans and americans believe they share enough common values to cooperate on international problems . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : can kerry bring the us and europe back together ?

germans - and much of the rest of the world - would like to see a change in u.s. leadership as the transatlantic alliance drifts further apart , a number of recent studies show . a poll of 35 nations released wednesday showed that 30 countries would prefer to see john kerry win the next presidential election , ousting george w. bush .
just three nations came out in favor of the current regime .
the study , released by the canadian opinion research firm globescan and the university of maryland 's program on international policy and attitudes -lrb- pipa -rrb- , polled some 34,000 people in 35 countries .
overall , 46 percent of respondents said they would prefer to see kerry win the election , while support for bush was around 20 percent .
in germany , strong opposition in germany , 74 percent of respondents were for kerry , with only 10 percent supporting bush .
similar results came out from norway , canada and italy .
countries that showed less than 10 percent support for bush were argentina , france , the netherlands , spain and uruguay .
bush only got more support than kerry in poland , nigeria and the philippines ; in india and thailand the numbers were equally divided .
the poll covered countries where questions could be added to ongoing polls , and did not end up including any arab countries or israel .
" only one in five want to see bush reelected .
though he is not as well known , kerry would win handily if the people of the world were to elect the us president , " steven kull , director of pipa , told news organizations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush in addition , a german study , run by the institute for german opinion polling , allensbach -lrb- ifda -rrb- showed germans support a u.s. regime change in november .
in the ifda poll , just 4 percent of 1,023 germans polled said they would opt to re-elect bush , while 68 percent said they would vote for kerry .
the globescan / pipa study also revealed the extent of damage the u.s. image has suffered in europe , especially germany .
in nearly every country of the 35 polled , respondents said that their opinion of america had grown worse since bush took office .
damaged view of u.s. germans showed the greatest loss of respect , with 83 percent of respondents saying their opinion of america had changed for the worse in that time period .
france , mexico , china , the netherlands , italy and brazil showed similar percentages .
as if more evidence of a widening transatlantic rift was needed , an opinion survey conducted for the german marshall fund of the united states and the compagnia di san paolo think-tank in italy , showed the united states and europe are drifting further apart on security issues and the use of force in the aftermath of the war in iraq .
' undesirable ' world leaders in the transatlantic trends 2004 opinion poll of 11,000 americans and europeans , conducted in june , three quarters of europeans said they disapprove of bush 's policies , while a majority said strong u.s. leadership in the world was undesirable .
some 58 percent of europeans said strong u.s. leadership in the world was undesirable , an increase of nine percentage points from a similar poll last year .

germans - and much of the rest of the world - would like to see a change in u.s. leadership as the transatlantic alliance drifts further apart , a number of recent studies show . a poll of 35 nations released wednesday showed that 30 countries would prefer to see john kerry win the next presidential election , ousting george w. bush .
just three nations came out in favor of the current regime .
the study , released by the canadian opinion research firm globescan and the university of maryland 's program on international policy and attitudes -lrb- pipa -rrb- , polled some 34,000 people in 35 countries .
overall , 46 percent of respondents said they would prefer to see kerry win the election , while support for bush was around 20 percent .
in germany , strong opposition in germany , 74 percent of respondents were for kerry , with only 10 percent supporting bush .
similar results came out from norway , canada and italy .
countries that showed less than 10 percent support for bush were argentina , france , the netherlands , spain and uruguay .
bush only got more support than kerry in poland , nigeria and the philippines ; in india and thailand the numbers were equally divided .
the poll covered countries where questions could be added to ongoing polls , and did not end up including any arab countries or israel .
" only one in five want to see bush reelected .
though he is not as well known , kerry would win handily if the people of the world were to elect the us president , " steven kull , director of pipa , told news organizations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush in addition , a german study , run by the institute for german opinion polling , allensbach -lrb- ifda -rrb- showed germans support a u.s. regime change in november .
in the ifda poll , just 4 percent of 1,023 germans polled said they would opt to re-elect bush , while 68 percent said they would vote for kerry .
the globescan / pipa study also revealed the extent of damage the u.s. image has suffered in europe , especially germany .
in nearly every country of the 35 polled , respondents said that their opinion of america had grown worse since bush took office .
damaged view of u.s. germans showed the greatest loss of respect , with 83 percent of respondents saying their opinion of america had changed for the worse in that time period .
france , mexico , china , the netherlands , italy and brazil showed similar percentages .
as if more evidence of a widening transatlantic rift was needed , an opinion survey conducted for the german marshall fund of the united states and the compagnia di san paolo think-tank in italy , showed the united states and europe are drifting further apart on security issues and the use of force in the aftermath of the war in iraq .
' undesirable ' world leaders in the transatlantic trends 2004 opinion poll of 11,000 americans and europeans , conducted in june , three quarters of europeans said they disapprove of bush 's policies , while a majority said strong u.s. leadership in the world was undesirable .
some 58 percent of europeans said strong u.s. leadership in the world was undesirable , an increase of nine percentage points from a similar poll last year .
only in britain and the netherlands do a majority desire strong u.s. leadership .
by contrast , 79 percent of americans said they support strong european union leadership in world affairs and look to europe as their preferred partner for solving global problems , even though 51 percent of them approve of bush 's foreign policy .
common values while americans are almost evenly divided along ideological lines , 80 percent of europeans surveyed do not believe the u.s.-led invasion of iraq last year was worth the loss of life and cost .
some 73 percent of europeans believe the iraq war increased the risk of terrorism , as do 49 percent of americans .
and while americans and europeans agree on the main threats they face , a higher percentage of americans support using force to prevent a terrorist attack , stop the spread of nuclear weapons , defend a nato ally or remove a regime that abuses human rights .

" learning to shout " came to the eriksdal sports stadium in stockholm this week after first being shown on the finnish island of aaland in the baltic sea , home to composer and author of the piece peter laang . after exploring romantic themes , making an oratorio on large sailboats and an opera for children , laang was searching for a brand new topic for his sixth opera .
" i was watching the 1998 world cup in france on television and i was looking for a way to get back to work and still keep watching the games , " he told afp the day before the premiere last week in stockholm .
" suddenly , all became clear .
i had found the solution : i would make an opera on football , " he said . " learning to shout " is a " pop opera " created on a budget of only € 280,000 -lrb- $ 340,000 -rrb- .
it is made up " of two half-times , lasting 45 minutes each , and includes tackles , shots , passes and dodges " , according to the program . hector leads the troy inter-city firm hebe , the greek goddess of youth personified by soprano therese karlsson , sells beer - instead of the nectar of the legends - on the stands , where she meets hector , trojan warrior and soccer supporter , played by baritone johan hallsten . a black player tackles a white opponent in the penalty area .
the referee does n't blow his whistle for a penalty , and hebe pays the price with her life as the fury of the hooligans bear down upon her . good and evil battle it out the choir plays a fundamental role in this libretto .
the young girls and boys of the estonian 21st century orchestra personify the two teams , g.o.d. and o.n.d. - good and evil in swedish - which correspond to homer 's clash between the trojans and the greeks . for arn-henrik blomqvist , director of the piece and former soccer coach , " the entire tragedy is concentrated in the tiers .
we did n't need to add drama to the field .
the intensity of one match was enough in itself . " " soccer is like life .
it evokes strong feelings .
that 's how i 've gotten into my part , " soprano karlsson said . with a mix of classicism and avant-garde , a giant screen towers over the choir flashing " pop-art " soccer pictures signed by laang .
a television sports commentator sits facing a small screen , belting out his comments while a hooligan chorus wearing t-shirts with the logo " troy fc " let loose a torrent of abuse and belches .
agitation among players in the center circle rises . contemporary soccer issues the violence , intolerance and racism , a familiar curse of contemporary soccer , is expressed through dramatic violins accompanied by african percussion instruments and accordions .
the effect is clear . but " it 's not obvious that we 'll attract traditional opera amateurs " , admits producer ulrika lind , who makes no secret of her ambition to suck in organizers of the 2006 world cup in germany with the opera 's themes of fair play and the fight against racism . laang meanwhile is exasperated by what he calls the " blindness " of the swedish football federation when it comes to addressing these issues .
" i have contacted them to get them involved , and they told me that there was no racism in swedish soccer . " it is stupefying .
just a few hundred meters from here there is a plaque commemorating a supporter who was beaten to death after a game , " he said . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fighting racism in the soccer stadium under pressure following numerous incidents of racist activity in europe ’ s soccer stadiums , the sport ’ s governing body held its first-ever conference on battling racism among fans and players .

i had found the solution : i would make an opera on football , " he said . " learning to shout " is a " pop opera " created on a budget of only € 280,000 -lrb- $ 340,000 -rrb- .
it is made up " of two half-times , lasting 45 minutes each , and includes tackles , shots , passes and dodges " , according to the program . hector leads the troy inter-city firm hebe , the greek goddess of youth personified by soprano therese karlsson , sells beer - instead of the nectar of the legends - on the stands , where she meets hector , trojan warrior and soccer supporter , played by baritone johan hallsten . a black player tackles a white opponent in the penalty area .
the referee does n't blow his whistle for a penalty , and hebe pays the price with her life as the fury of the hooligans bear down upon her . good and evil battle it out the choir plays a fundamental role in this libretto .
the young girls and boys of the estonian 21st century orchestra personify the two teams , g.o.d. and o.n.d. - good and evil in swedish - which correspond to homer 's clash between the trojans and the greeks . for arn-henrik blomqvist , director of the piece and former soccer coach , " the entire tragedy is concentrated in the tiers .
we did n't need to add drama to the field .
the intensity of one match was enough in itself . " " soccer is like life .
it evokes strong feelings .
that 's how i 've gotten into my part , " soprano karlsson said . with a mix of classicism and avant-garde , a giant screen towers over the choir flashing " pop-art " soccer pictures signed by laang .
a television sports commentator sits facing a small screen , belting out his comments while a hooligan chorus wearing t-shirts with the logo " troy fc " let loose a torrent of abuse and belches .
agitation among players in the center circle rises . contemporary soccer issues the violence , intolerance and racism , a familiar curse of contemporary soccer , is expressed through dramatic violins accompanied by african percussion instruments and accordions .
the effect is clear . but " it 's not obvious that we 'll attract traditional opera amateurs " , admits producer ulrika lind , who makes no secret of her ambition to suck in organizers of the 2006 world cup in germany with the opera 's themes of fair play and the fight against racism . laang meanwhile is exasperated by what he calls the " blindness " of the swedish football federation when it comes to addressing these issues .
" i have contacted them to get them involved , and they told me that there was no racism in swedish soccer . " it is stupefying .

but most of all , they fear the repercussions of the serious economic climate .
germans ’ primary fear is an increase in living costs followed by a further deterioration of the economic situation and unemployment , a fear held more by people in the former east germany .
the lack of personal contact with their politicians accounts for the pessimistic view .
the worry of having to spend more money on daily necessities is mainly attributed to the introduction of the euro four years ago .
the survey also showed that more and more people were terrified of specific personal problems , coupled with the increasing fear of poverty in old age .
on the whole , the level of fear remains considerably higher in the east than in the west .
however , the fear of a possible terror attack in germany continues to prevail . more briefs 09.09.2004 -pipe- weimar ’ s library to be restored by 2007 08.09.2004 -pipe- search for nazis in germany starts soon 08.09.2004 -pipe- sasser creator charged with computer sabotage 08.09.2004 -pipe- teenager faces jail term for hamburg station push 08.09.2004 -pipe- schröder to make asian tour in october 08.09.2004 -pipe- police search extreme right candidate 's office 07.09.2004 -pipe- putin postpones trip to germany 07.09.2004 -pipe- faulty cable possible cause of library fire radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

with suspects and potential witnesses dying of old age , the trial of ladislav niznanksy - who led the so-called edelweiss unit that hunted down and killed slovak resistance fighters - may be one of the last of its kind .
niznansky is accused of taking part in the massacre of 146 people in two villages in slovakia in 1945 and later of ordering the execution of 18 jews , mostly women and children , in another village .
former nazi captain held since jan .

since then , the man the nazi-hunting simon wiesenthal center describes as " a mass murderer " has been held in remand .
despite the passing of 60 years , 24 witnesses , some of them survivors , have been located and will testify against the leader of a unit prosecutors say was known for the " special treacherousness and brutality " of its operations .

on february 7 , 1945 he formed an execution commando team and ordered the killing of 18 jews who had been found hiding in bunkers in ksina , prosecutors say .
after his arrest in january , the director of the jerusalem branch of the wiesenthal center urged germany to expedite his trial so that he could finally be held accountable for his crimes .
" the numerous innocent victims murdered by the edelweiss unit fully deserve that the person responsible for their tragic fate be held accountable for his crimes , " said director efraim zuroff .
" in that respect , the passing of time since the crimes were committed and the fact that niznansky has hereto escaped justice in no way diminish the severity of his crimes and his own personal culpability . "

16 after living quietly with his wife for 33 years in a munich suburb , the former nazi captain , whom neighbors describe as a friendly old man , was jolted back to the reality of the past when police rang his door bell on january 16 .
since then , the man the nazi-hunting simon wiesenthal center describes as " a mass murderer " has been held in remand .
despite the passing of 60 years , 24 witnesses , some of them survivors , have been located and will testify against the leader of a unit prosecutors say was known for the " special treacherousness and brutality " of its operations .
the edelweiss team was tasked with hunting partisans in slovakia , at the time a nazi puppet state , but niznansky told the german news magazine focus that he " never had to kill someone " while serving with it .
prosecuters claim complicity in 146 murders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to prosecutors , the unit , which also included troops from the notorious german ss , rounded up and shot 146 people from the villages of klak and ostry grun , including 70 women and 51 children , on january 21 , 1945 .
niznansky , who was born in czechoslovakia but has german citizenship , is said to have ordered that no one should be allowed to escape and to have personally shot dead 20 of the victims .
on february 7 , 1945 he formed an execution commando team and ordered the killing of 18 jews who had been found hiding in bunkers in ksina , prosecutors say .
after his arrest in january , the director of the jerusalem branch of the wiesenthal center urged germany to expedite his trial so that he could finally be held accountable for his crimes .
" the numerous innocent victims murdered by the edelweiss unit fully deserve that the person responsible for their tragic fate be held accountable for his crimes , " said director efraim zuroff .
" in that respect , the passing of time since the crimes were committed and the fact that niznansky has hereto escaped justice in no way diminish the severity of his crimes and his own personal culpability . "
" the holocaust was neither an earthquake nor a hurricane , but a manmade crime for which those responsible must be held accountable , " he said .
niznansky fled into anonymity niznansky is believed to have fled to germany in 1948 after a communist coup and was sentenced to death in czechoslovakia in his absence in 1962 .
he worked unnoticed for several years in munich at radio free europe , the us-funded station that broadcast to eastern europe during the cold war , and was given german citizenship in 1996 .
germany was only alerted to his presence in 2001 after an investigation by slovak justice authorities .
munich prosecutors then launched their own inquiry . his trial here is expected to involve 15 days of hearings and run until the end of october . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de search for nazis in germany starts soon the simon wiesenthal center in jerusalem announced on wednesday it would start its “ operation last chance ” campaign to track down the last nazi criminals in germany in november .

a european parliament delegation returning from the crisis area is calling for more aid and increased pressure to end the conflict . while the united nations security council deliberates its response to secretary general kofi annan 's report on the crisis in sudan , the european parliament sent its own delegation to the war-torn region of darfur .
the six-member team will present an evaluation of the humanitarian situation when the parliamentarians return to session next week .
it is also very likely that the subject will make it into the official round of debate as the parliament mulls a possible response to the ongoing crisis .
late last week the european union renewed its threat to slap sanctions on the sudanese government if it does not do more to rein in militias fighting in the western darfur region .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , welcomed the fact that some progress has been made on improving the humanitarian situation in darfur , but lamented that security remains a problem .
" whereas we note some progress in the humanitarian field we are still particularly worried at the security situation caused by lack of progress in disarming and controlling the janjaweed " pro-government militias , he said .
increase international pressure the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- is also not ruling out increasing pressure on khartoum to comply with international demands for an immediate cease-fire .
apart from continuing efforts to help alleviate the humanitarian crisis , which displaced over two million people in darfur , members of the parliament 's development committee stressed the need to find a political solution for sudan .
fiona hall , one of the six parliamentarians who traveled to sudan , told deutsche welle that in the face of renewed attacks it was " very important to keep the pressure on the government . "
" i am particularly concerned about the lack of the security the people in the refugee camps feel , " she said in an interview .
after traveling in the darfur region , meeting with sudanese authorities and speaking with aid workers , refugees and african union observers she said , " basically the message we got was that people wanted to go home but were petrified that there might be new attacks . "
" we spoke to local activists and tribal representatives and they said it is not really a conflict between arab and african tribes , " as the crisis has sometimes been presented , " but that the government is responsible . "
humanitarian nightmare hall , a european parliamentarian from great britain , described the experiences many of the refugees had as " quite harrowing . "
although she acknowledged that things had improved slightly in the refugee camps themselves , especially since non-government organizations have bee granted free access , she said there is still quite a bit of work to do to ensure that aid reaches all the displaced people .
" there are around 1.2 million displaced people in sudan .
some of them are still out of the reach of ngos .
about 200,000 people are impossible to reach because of rain and another 200,000 because they are in a region controlled by the rebels , " she said .
hall echoed an earlier evaluation by the ep that the emergency in darfur is likely to continue for more than a year .
" really this is a long-term crisis .
the people who fled their villages have not had a chance to cultivate their land .
so they will depend on international aid for up to 18 months . "
however , " she warned , " there is no help in the pipeline beyond the end of november that would be sufficient .

a european parliament delegation returning from the crisis area is calling for more aid and increased pressure to end the conflict . while the united nations security council deliberates its response to secretary general kofi annan 's report on the crisis in sudan , the european parliament sent its own delegation to the war-torn region of darfur .
the six-member team will present an evaluation of the humanitarian situation when the parliamentarians return to session next week .
it is also very likely that the subject will make it into the official round of debate as the parliament mulls a possible response to the ongoing crisis .
late last week the european union renewed its threat to slap sanctions on the sudanese government if it does not do more to rein in militias fighting in the western darfur region .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , welcomed the fact that some progress has been made on improving the humanitarian situation in darfur , but lamented that security remains a problem .
" whereas we note some progress in the humanitarian field we are still particularly worried at the security situation caused by lack of progress in disarming and controlling the janjaweed " pro-government militias , he said .
increase international pressure the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- is also not ruling out increasing pressure on khartoum to comply with international demands for an immediate cease-fire .
apart from continuing efforts to help alleviate the humanitarian crisis , which displaced over two million people in darfur , members of the parliament 's development committee stressed the need to find a political solution for sudan .
fiona hall , one of the six parliamentarians who traveled to sudan , told deutsche welle that in the face of renewed attacks it was " very important to keep the pressure on the government . "
" i am particularly concerned about the lack of the security the people in the refugee camps feel , " she said in an interview .
after traveling in the darfur region , meeting with sudanese authorities and speaking with aid workers , refugees and african union observers she said , " basically the message we got was that people wanted to go home but were petrified that there might be new attacks . "
" we spoke to local activists and tribal representatives and they said it is not really a conflict between arab and african tribes , " as the crisis has sometimes been presented , " but that the government is responsible . "
humanitarian nightmare hall , a european parliamentarian from great britain , described the experiences many of the refugees had as " quite harrowing . "
although she acknowledged that things had improved slightly in the refugee camps themselves , especially since non-government organizations have bee granted free access , she said there is still quite a bit of work to do to ensure that aid reaches all the displaced people .
" there are around 1.2 million displaced people in sudan .
some of them are still out of the reach of ngos .
about 200,000 people are impossible to reach because of rain and another 200,000 because they are in a region controlled by the rebels , " she said .
hall echoed an earlier evaluation by the ep that the emergency in darfur is likely to continue for more than a year .
" really this is a long-term crisis .
the people who fled their villages have not had a chance to cultivate their land .

increase international pressure the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- is also not ruling out increasing pressure on khartoum to comply with international demands for an immediate cease-fire .
apart from continuing efforts to help alleviate the humanitarian crisis , which displaced over two million people in darfur , members of the parliament 's development committee stressed the need to find a political solution for sudan .
fiona hall , one of the six parliamentarians who traveled to sudan , told deutsche welle that in the face of renewed attacks it was " very important to keep the pressure on the government . "
" i am particularly concerned about the lack of the security the people in the refugee camps feel , " she said in an interview .
after traveling in the darfur region , meeting with sudanese authorities and speaking with aid workers , refugees and african union observers she said , " basically the message we got was that people wanted to go home but were petrified that there might be new attacks . "
" we spoke to local activists and tribal representatives and they said it is not really a conflict between arab and african tribes , " as the crisis has sometimes been presented , " but that the government is responsible . "
humanitarian nightmare hall , a european parliamentarian from great britain , described the experiences many of the refugees had as " quite harrowing . "
although she acknowledged that things had improved slightly in the refugee camps themselves , especially since non-government organizations have bee granted free access , she said there is still quite a bit of work to do to ensure that aid reaches all the displaced people .
" there are around 1.2 million displaced people in sudan .
some of them are still out of the reach of ngos .
about 200,000 people are impossible to reach because of rain and another 200,000 because they are in a region controlled by the rebels , " she said .
hall echoed an earlier evaluation by the ep that the emergency in darfur is likely to continue for more than a year .
" really this is a long-term crisis .
the people who fled their villages have not had a chance to cultivate their land .
so they will depend on international aid for up to 18 months . "
however , " she warned , " there is no help in the pipeline beyond the end of november that would be sufficient . " dw staff -lrb- ktz / rl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu again threatens sudan with sanctions the european union on saturday renewed a threat to slap sanctions on the sudanese government if it does not do more to rein in militias in the western darfur region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.09.2004 building a new reputation abroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's chancellery building was designed by a german despite their strong architectural tradition , very few germans get to build important projects abroad .
but at this month 's architecture biennale in venice and at similar events , they 're trying to change that . for some , german architecture invokes historic images of the bauhaus era when mies van der rohe and walter gropius set a new international standard .
but more recently , contemporary german architects have gone largely unnoticed , particularly abroad .
fewer than two percent are offered work beyond their country 's borders , despite the fact that german exports in other fields are otherwise hot sellers . indeed , when architecture buffs reel off the names of those most frequently mentioned in the international design press - and the winners of high-profile competitions for projects like the guggenheim museum in bilbao - germans are not among the gehrys , eisenmans , pianos and hadids . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's reichstag was designed by norman foster , a brit .
at home , they do n't necessarily get a better deal : even the reichstag , the centerpiece of " new berlin , " given a pricey architectural makeover after the fall of the wall , was designed by sir norman foster , a brit .
it 's hard to imagine the brits , french or danes passing over their own talent for such a national commission . but as some are pronouncing germany 's days at the cutting edge of architectural innovation over - others are taking on the task of turning things around . raising germany 's profile abroad for this month 's architecture biennale in venice , curators put together a special exhibition highlighting german inventiveness , " deutschlandscape , " which they hope will prompt renewed interest among foreigners . meanwhile , the federal chamber of architects -lrb- bak -rrb- has launched an initiative , the network for architectural export -lrb- nax -rrb- , to promote german architecture around the world and provide resources for those looking to seek their fortunes abroad .
for the first time next month , nax will attend the expo real in munich and host a panel discussion featuring top german architects entitled , " german architects , worldwide chances . " thanks in part to such efforts , things might be starting to turn around .
three german firms were among the winners of the prestigious royal institute of british architects -lrb- riba -rrb- awards announced in june .
still , say experts , there is much work to be done . inheritors of legacy go unnoticed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauhaus buildings , like this complex in bernau , set a new international standard .
how did german architecture , which with bauhaus and the so-called " new objectivity " was once among the most forward-thinking in the world , fall so far from grace ?
for some , the explanation is simple : postwar german engineering , while highly regarded for its durability and quality , has simply become " unsexy . " thomas weller , the director of the nax initiative concedes this is a problem .
" it 's true foreigners think german architecture is technically proficient , but lacks charm and espirit - it 's too down-to-earth , " he told dw-world . but , weller and others say the problem is more complicated than that , even if they do not agree on a single root cause . mercedes not lamborghinis ingeborg flagge , a curator at the frankfurt-based german architecture museum -lrb- dam -rrb- , is not so quick to blame an unexciting product .
for her , that 's a matter of taste .
" germans do n't build lamborghinis , they build porsches and mercedes , " she said . instead , flagge cites more practical considerations .
" for a long time , it did n't pay for german architects to work elsewhere , since in the postwar years there was plenty of work to do at home , " she said .
what 's more , germany , compared to other countries like great britain and france , does not have a colonial past and has , therefore , found it more difficult to establish cultural connections abroad . few stars among the newcomers compared to other countries , germany does not produce what one could call " star architects , " akin to frank gehry , zaha hadid and rem koolhaas , whose first name alone conjures up fantastic images .
and not only are german architects not recognized elsewhere , they suffer from a lack of name recognition at home . klaus dieter weiss , an architecture critic , said german architects are themselves partly to blame .
they are less willing to put themselves front-and-center - call it humility or lack of self confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerbruch hutton 's new environmental ministry in dessau .
for jens ludloff , a partner at sauerbruch hutton , one of the firms awarded the riba prize this year , german architects ' low-profile and unwillingness to tackle the question of " what should be considered ' german ' in the world of design " is largely due to the historical legacy of predecessors like hitler 's architect albert speer , who crafted a very distinctive brand of architecture reflecting nazi ambitions . " due to that experience , german architect 's have a different sense of self confidence , " he told dw-world . that , combined with poorly-coordinated marketing efforts - until recently the architectural associations did n't take on overseas public relations tasks - has contributed to the decline .
even if germans are still producing forward-thinking work , they are n't telling anyone about it . stars in the making ? so who are among the unsung talents hidden away in germany , just waiting for their chance to shine on the international stage ?
weiss , author of " young german architects , " says hamburg-based carsten roth tops his list . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten roth 's cd packaging center in röbel .
according to weiss , roth 's designs , including several housing projects and a cd packaging center in röbel , are based on provacative theoretical studies - unusual since german architecture tends to be less theory-based .
roth plays with the complex relationship between old and new . for weiss , it is precisely that kind of return to theory and incorporation of more sophisticated ideas into their work , that is necessary for germans to reclaim a top spot in the world of international architecture . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : " energy passports " for german homes under eu regulations , european homeowners will be required to have their property inspected for energy efficiency starting in 2006 .

but at this month 's architecture biennale in venice and at similar events , they 're trying to change that . for some , german architecture invokes historic images of the bauhaus era when mies van der rohe and walter gropius set a new international standard .
but more recently , contemporary german architects have gone largely unnoticed , particularly abroad .
fewer than two percent are offered work beyond their country 's borders , despite the fact that german exports in other fields are otherwise hot sellers . indeed , when architecture buffs reel off the names of those most frequently mentioned in the international design press - and the winners of high-profile competitions for projects like the guggenheim museum in bilbao - germans are not among the gehrys , eisenmans , pianos and hadids . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's reichstag was designed by norman foster , a brit .
at home , they do n't necessarily get a better deal : even the reichstag , the centerpiece of " new berlin , " given a pricey architectural makeover after the fall of the wall , was designed by sir norman foster , a brit .
it 's hard to imagine the brits , french or danes passing over their own talent for such a national commission . but as some are pronouncing germany 's days at the cutting edge of architectural innovation over - others are taking on the task of turning things around . raising germany 's profile abroad for this month 's architecture biennale in venice , curators put together a special exhibition highlighting german inventiveness , " deutschlandscape , " which they hope will prompt renewed interest among foreigners . meanwhile , the federal chamber of architects -lrb- bak -rrb- has launched an initiative , the network for architectural export -lrb- nax -rrb- , to promote german architecture around the world and provide resources for those looking to seek their fortunes abroad .
for the first time next month , nax will attend the expo real in munich and host a panel discussion featuring top german architects entitled , " german architects , worldwide chances . " thanks in part to such efforts , things might be starting to turn around .
three german firms were among the winners of the prestigious royal institute of british architects -lrb- riba -rrb- awards announced in june .
still , say experts , there is much work to be done . inheritors of legacy go unnoticed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauhaus buildings , like this complex in bernau , set a new international standard .
how did german architecture , which with bauhaus and the so-called " new objectivity " was once among the most forward-thinking in the world , fall so far from grace ?
for some , the explanation is simple : postwar german engineering , while highly regarded for its durability and quality , has simply become " unsexy . " thomas weller , the director of the nax initiative concedes this is a problem .
" it 's true foreigners think german architecture is technically proficient , but lacks charm and espirit - it 's too down-to-earth , " he told dw-world . but , weller and others say the problem is more complicated than that , even if they do not agree on a single root cause . mercedes not lamborghinis ingeborg flagge , a curator at the frankfurt-based german architecture museum -lrb- dam -rrb- , is not so quick to blame an unexciting product .
for her , that 's a matter of taste .
" germans do n't build lamborghinis , they build porsches and mercedes , " she said . instead , flagge cites more practical considerations .
" for a long time , it did n't pay for german architects to work elsewhere , since in the postwar years there was plenty of work to do at home , " she said .
what 's more , germany , compared to other countries like great britain and france , does not have a colonial past and has , therefore , found it more difficult to establish cultural connections abroad . few stars among the newcomers compared to other countries , germany does not produce what one could call " star architects , " akin to frank gehry , zaha hadid and rem koolhaas , whose first name alone conjures up fantastic images .
and not only are german architects not recognized elsewhere , they suffer from a lack of name recognition at home . klaus dieter weiss , an architecture critic , said german architects are themselves partly to blame .
they are less willing to put themselves front-and-center - call it humility or lack of self confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerbruch hutton 's new environmental ministry in dessau .
for jens ludloff , a partner at sauerbruch hutton , one of the firms awarded the riba prize this year , german architects ' low-profile and unwillingness to tackle the question of " what should be considered ' german ' in the world of design " is largely due to the historical legacy of predecessors like hitler 's architect albert speer , who crafted a very distinctive brand of architecture reflecting nazi ambitions . " due to that experience , german architect 's have a different sense of self confidence , " he told dw-world . that , combined with poorly-coordinated marketing efforts - until recently the architectural associations did n't take on overseas public relations tasks - has contributed to the decline .
even if germans are still producing forward-thinking work , they are n't telling anyone about it . stars in the making ? so who are among the unsung talents hidden away in germany , just waiting for their chance to shine on the international stage ?
weiss , author of " young german architects , " says hamburg-based carsten roth tops his list . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten roth 's cd packaging center in röbel .
according to weiss , roth 's designs , including several housing projects and a cd packaging center in röbel , are based on provacative theoretical studies - unusual since german architecture tends to be less theory-based .
roth plays with the complex relationship between old and new . for weiss , it is precisely that kind of return to theory and incorporation of more sophisticated ideas into their work , that is necessary for germans to reclaim a top spot in the world of international architecture . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : " energy passports " for german homes under eu regulations , european homeowners will be required to have their property inspected for energy efficiency starting in 2006 .

lulu , a 27-year-old grey jennie , and an unnamed friend , are visiting three care homes in weymouth .
after a greeting session in the lounge , the donkeys will also visit some less mobile residents in their bedrooms .
the animals come from the donkey sanctuary in sidmouth , devon , and will visit weymouth care home , dorset villa and furzey way residential homes .
the donkey will happily visit them in their bedrooms , subject to a suitably large lift janice aherne janice aherne , manager of the sanctuary 's schools education therapy unit , told bbc news online : " all our therapy donkeys are specially trained .
" it 's not natural for them to go inside buildings , but we walk them around the office corridors here to get them used to it .
" lulu is a very calm and has had a lot of experience as a therapy donkey . "
the team visits schools , hospitals and nursing homes within 50 miles of its sidmouth-based sanctuary , an area which includes large parts of dorset .
ms aherne added : " we constantly see the joy and pleasure our donkeys bring to those they visit and are no longer surprised by the effect they evoke in even the most frail or withdrawn resident .
" they always have numerous tales to tell about donkeys they remember .
the donkeys often bring back childhood memories " especially if they grew up in a rural area , like dorset , they might remember how they used to ride to school on a donkey , and how donkeys were used for little jobs around the farm .
" the visits work as memory triggers and get conversation going .
" and for residents that are bed-bound or prefer to stay in their rooms , the donkey will happily visit them in their bedrooms , subject to a suitably large lift , if these are located on higher floors . "
the team always bring a " flexible friend " in the shape of a rubber basket to scoop up any accidents .
" normally the donkeys will give us tell-tale signs so that we can get them outside in time .
in fact they actually get embarrassed if they have to go inside , but of course accidents do happen . "
schools , nursing homes and other institutions that wish to book a visit can contact the donkey sanctuary on 01395 573055 e-mail this to a friend printable version bbc hampshire information and features on the bbc hampshire website see also : beach donkey contest on the pier 19 aug 04 -pipe- lancashire donkey bids to break age record 27 aug 03 -pipe- europe related internet links : the donkey sanctuary the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top dorset stories councils warned over social care injured man airlifted from boat football stadium plan thrown out products and services e-mail news mobiles alerts news feeds podcasts news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health have your say -pipe- in pictures -pipe- week at a glance -pipe- country profiles -pipe- in depth -pipe- programmes bbc copyright notice mmix most popular now -pipe- 23,500 pages were read in the last minute .

they had been arrested in bradford , west yorkshire , on tuesday .
shafilea , 17 , of warrington , went missing last september and her body was found in february this year in cumbria .
a cheshire police spokeswoman said : " all have been released on police bail to return on a date in december and inquiries are continuing . "
shafilea was last seen alive at her home in liverpool road , great sankey , on 11 september .
' honour killing ' her disappearance came just months after she drank bleach while on a family trip to pakistan in an apparent protest at an arranged marriage .
police believe she may have been murdered in a so-called " honour killing " in revenge for refusing a marriage .
it is still not known how she died but detectives are convinced she was murdered .
her parents , iftikhar and farzana , were arrested on suspicion of kidnap but no charges were brought against either of them .
the five bailed on wednesday night are a woman aged in her 20s , one man in his early 30s , two men in their late 30s and one man in his 60s .
meanwhile , police spent wednesday searching a number of properties in the bradford area in connection with the murder inquiry .

it will target careless and dangerous driving , motorists on drink and drugs , excess speed and seat belts .
hundreds of vehicles will be stopped during operation viper , which begins on friday .
its aim is to promote road safety , detect traffic offences and combat ordinary crime .
chief inspector douglas hogg , who is commanding the operation , said : " this is a follow on from previous viper operations and is a response to the mounting road deaths .
" province-wide , 70 people are dead so far this financial year compared to 63 during the same period last year .
" i find this death toll very depressing given that we in road policing , our colleagues in the rest of the police service and road safety campaigners are using every means possible to promote safe driving .
" it is clear that the message is not getting across . "
he said police officers would also be alert to criminal activity , public disorder and the role vehicles played in carrying stolen property .
chief inspector hogg said the decision to announce the operation in advance was a conscious one .
" i would like to think that prior knowledge of this operation will be a deterrent - prevention is an important part of our strategy - but drivers should be in no doubt , if they ignore the warnings they will be facing fines , penalty points or prosecution , " he said .

rhondda am leighton andrews said labour should " stop losers becoming winners " under regional list voting .
labour holds a conference at the weekend on the richard report , which recommends changing its polling system .
opposition ams have hit back over the system which was brought in by labour - and have accused the party of seeking " a one-party state in wales " .

labour should be looking at a voting system that is fair and equitable - they are just trying to alter a discredited system to get a labour majority " peter black he was speaking ahead of saturday 's special labour conference in cardiff at which party members will vote on the labour proposals on the assembly 's future .

" and if they reject someone at the ballot box , they do not expect that candidate 's bonus ball to come up later that night as they sneak in on a list .
he added : " ninety per cent of the 20 assembly list members were defeated in constituency contests but then got elected on the regional lists . "

rhondda am leighton andrews said labour should " stop losers becoming winners " under regional list voting .
labour holds a conference at the weekend on the richard report , which recommends changing its polling system .
opposition ams have hit back over the system which was brought in by labour - and have accused the party of seeking " a one-party state in wales " .
mr andrews ridiculed ams who were able to stand in both constituency seats and on the regional list as " neutered , smashed and stuffed " .
labour should be looking at a voting system that is fair and equitable - they are just trying to alter a discredited system to get a labour majority peter black he was speaking ahead of saturday 's special labour conference in cardiff at which party members will vote on the labour proposals on the assembly 's future .
it follows consultation of labour members by the party and a recommendation by a commission chaired by lord richard that the assembly should gain primary law-making powers .
but other issues under the spotlight include the voting system .
welsh secretary peter hain has already promised to overhaul the " ridiculous farce " which allows candidates to win a seat via the list system under proportional representation even though they have lost in a constituency under the traditional first-past-the-post system .
mr andrews - who won 61 % of the vote in his constituency at the 2003 election - used the lotto as a metaphor for his message and said : " the only lucky winners revealed on election night should be the voting public .
leighton andrews says the list system is a " bonus ball " for candidates " and if they reject someone at the ballot box , they do not expect that candidate 's bonus ball to come up later that night as they sneak in on a list .
he added : " ninety per cent of the 20 assembly list members were defeated in constituency contests but then got elected on the regional lists .
i do n't like the present system , but it was labour 's idea dai lloyd , plaid cymru " all three defeated candidates in clwyd west joined labour 's victorious alun pugh in the assembly by being elected on the north wales regional list . "
he described assembly tory group leader nick bourne as " battered in brecon , " plaid cymru 's janet davies as " obliterated in ogmore , " and lib dem peter black as " stuffed in swansea east " .
mr black responded : " if leighton wants to exercise his limited vocabulary , that 's up to him .
" labour should be looking at a voting system that is fair and equitable - they are just trying to alter a discredited system to get a labour majority . "
plaid cymru 's dai lloyd -lrb- described by mr andrews as " smashed in swansea " -rrb- said : " i do n't like the present system , but it was labour 's idea .
obviously , it is too successful .
" we have n't been able to sort out a one-party state in wales yet , which is why they want to change it .
" we have always been for a single transferable vote system .
" if labour thought about it , they would be the biggest winners with an stv system . "
tory am william graham said : " we would not favour restrictions on standing in elections .
" i doubt this will win leighton a promotion in rhodri morgan 's next cabinet reshuffle . "
