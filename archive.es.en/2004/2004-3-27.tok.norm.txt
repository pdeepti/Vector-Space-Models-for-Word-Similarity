the ban , which comes into force on monday , means that smokers are no longer able to indulge their habit in restaurants , hotels -lrb- with the exception of their bedrooms -rrb- or even the country 's renowned pubs .
unsurprisingly , the decision - aimed at protecting the health of hospitality industry workers - has provoked much debate .
the government has already been forced to postpone the measure once in order to reconsider problematic issues such as smoking in prisons , or psychiatric hospitals .
the pub - traditionally a far from smoke-free environment - is likely to become the next battleground , with landlords facing stiff fines if they fail to prevent their customers from lighting up .
smoking and drinking james scott lennon , who owns the abbey tavern in howth , a seaside town north of dublin , does not expect enforcing the ban to pose any major problems .
this ban could actually make a huge saving to the economy austin hughes , iib bank " i think it 's going to be self-policing , " he told the bbc 's world business report .
" if someone refuses to put their cigarette out , you mention it to the person behind the counter who calls either the manager or if necessary the police .
" but i do n't think it 's going to come down to that .
people are just going to realise you ca n't smoke . "
one irishman who is already feeling the effects of the new regime is businessman michael harrington .

after his release a judge in massachusetts ordered him to set up an educational trust fund for his two children , aged 12 and 14 .
brown , who is married to whitney houston , must also apply for life insurance to benefit his children .
he has been jailed twice this year , the first time for violation of probation .
brown , 35 , had agreed 10 years ago to pay child support and set up a trust for the two children he fathered during his relationship with kim ward .
but he did not follow up on the agreement , leading to his conviction for contempt of court .
he was sentenced on wednesday , just days after he was released two days early from dekalb county jail in atlanta , georgia , where he was serving 60 days for probation violation .
he told the family court that he did not have the money to pay ms ward because he no longer had an income .
future court date but judge paula carey did not believe his testimony and told him he would spend up to 90-days in jail unless he came up with the money .
he spent one night behind bars before the money was paid to the court .
brown is still facing a charge of battery after allegedly hitting houston during an altercation in december 2003 .
he is due to face that charge in a georgia court on 5 may .
houston , who has one child with brown , was recently admitted to a drug treatment clinic , but spent only five days there .

after his release a judge in massachusetts ordered him to set up an educational trust fund for his two children , aged 12 and 14 .
brown , who is married to whitney houston , must also apply for life insurance to benefit his children .
he has been jailed twice this year , the first time for violation of probation .
brown , 35 , had agreed 10 years ago to pay child support and set up a trust for the two children he fathered during his relationship with kim ward .
but he did not follow up on the agreement , leading to his conviction for contempt of court .
he was sentenced on wednesday , just days after he was released two days early from dekalb county jail in atlanta , georgia , where he was serving 60 days for probation violation .
he told the family court that he did not have the money to pay ms ward because he no longer had an income .
future court date but judge paula carey did not believe his testimony and told him he would spend up to 90-days in jail unless he came up with the money .
he spent one night behind bars before the money was paid to the court .
brown is still facing a charge of battery after allegedly hitting houston during an altercation in december 2003 .
he is due to face that charge in a georgia court on 5 may .
houston , who has one child with brown , was recently admitted to a drug treatment clinic , but spent only five days there .

millions of people around the world could soon protect themselves against the hiv virus with the simple dosage .
experts say around 60 gels , known as microbicides , are now in development with about 14 in clinical trials .
women could be the main beneficiaries , international development secretary hilary benn said on saturday .
what microbicides would do is put the power to protect themselves in the hands of women hilary benn , international development secretary laboratory trials of the drugs have proved successful , and researchers will tell a conference in london on sunday that clinical tests will now take place in five african countries .
a total of 12,000 women are expected to take part in the three-year trials to be held in south africa , zambia , tanzania , uganda and cameroon .
barrier if the results are positive , the products could be on the market before the end of the decade .
one expert has estimated that they could save up to two and a half million lives in just three years .
the microbicides were developed through a government-backed study by the medical research council and london 's imperial college and could provide a barrier to the transmission of the hiv virus during sex .
the face of aids is a young woman , says international development secretary hilary benn mr benn said the uk government had invested £ 17m in the research .
he told the bbc 's today programme : " this really is potentially very important .
" women are particularly vulnerable to hiv infection .
they are 20 % more likely than men to be infected in sub-saharan africa .
" the face of hiv is in fact the face of a young woman .
" women ca n't always ensure that their partners use condoms .
" what microbicides would do is put the power to protect themselves in the hands of women . "
' obstacles to overcome ' but mr benn pointed out that even if the microbicides are shown to work , there would still be a obstacles to be overcome in making them affordable and getting them to the women who need them most .
the gels or creams are applied internally - before sex - aiming to stop the virus from entering the body .
an estimated 40m people around the world are hiv positive .
many of these may have contracted the virus because they were unable to protect themselves .
for instance , women in developing countries , in particular , are often unable to persuade their partner to wear a condom .
the microbicides work in one of three ways - by killing the virus before it enters the body ; by preventing it from taking hold once inside the body ; or by creating a barrier to stop it from entering the body in the first place .
the conference on microbicide , which is hosted in london , takes place from 28 to 31 march .
