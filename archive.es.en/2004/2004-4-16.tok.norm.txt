but in recent years the island has been trying to shake off the image that everything is run by organized crime . sicilian authorities are keen to show that large areas of the island are run by honest cooperatives of young farmers and entrepreneurs .
these cooperatives have been allocated millions of dollars worth of land and property that used to be formerly controlled by the mafia . italy first adopted laws on the seizure of financial resources and property from imprisoned mafia bosses over two decades ago .
but it was n't until 1996 that new legislation allowed these confiscated assets to be used " for the good of society " . birthplace of feared mafia bosses nicolo nicolosi , the mayor of corleone , 60 kms south of palermo where land has been confiscated , said the mafia had acquired it illegally .
" these properties were the fruit of money laundering , violence and drug trafficking .
the mafia had taken over the best lands , but now these are being given back to the people . " corleone , a farming community is sicily 's most famous mafia town , largely thanks to a godfather movie trilogy directed by francis ford coppola .
but , nicolosi admitted that corleone 's association with the mafia is not just fiction . " there is no doubt that the most important mafia bosses in the past ten or twenty years were born here .
corleone was the birthplace of the ' boss of bosses ' , toto riina , arrested in 1993 , and of bernardo provenzano , who has been at large for 40 years and is believed to rule the mafia today . " large land holdings were confiscated from riina , now serving numerous life sentences .
the powerful mafia boss ordered the 1992 killings of two crusading anti-mafia judges , causing outrage in italy and abroad .
in corleone , riina was feared and respected by many . fear of retaliatory mafia action nicolosi said that when riina 's seized properties were handed over to a cooperative of farmers , locals were concerned there would be deadly repercussions for those entering what was considered to be " sacred territory " . " generally people were convinced that assets seized by the mafia should not be touched .
just like relatives of turncoats were killed by the mafia , people feared that those who did would pay for violating mafia territory . " this was certainly the case in the beginning .
the ' placido rizzotto ' cooperative was assigned 200 hectares of land , partly owned by mafia boss riina .
the members grow wheat which is then turned into what has been labeled " anti-mafia pasta " . francesca massimino , one of the members said the cooperative has had problems .
" the first year we could find no one to provide the machine to harvest the wheat .
the police had to intervene to find a harvester , " he said .
massimino believes the company that had agreed to provide the machine had been threatened . other cooperatives have also faced trouble including discovering that their vines had been cut or experiencing sudden fires .
in one case , two dobermans disappeared from a farm only to be found days later dead in trash cans . giuseppe randazzo , owner of the tempio del monte jato cooperative , which farms the land that once belonged to another infamous mafia boss romualdo agrigento , too said the going had n't been easy .
" the mafia had carried out acts of vandalism .
when we came here in 1998 we found it totally abandoned , destroyed , with walls torn down , vines cut down , pipelines severed , total destruction , " randazzo said . business interests outweigh mafia fear but the fear of the mafia has not cowed down the young sicilian recipients of formerly mafia-controlled land and property .
they have caught on to the business potential offered by the opportunity . the placido rizzotto cooperative will soon be inaugurating their first country-hotels in formerly mafia owned property and , francesca massimino said they have other plans as well . " there are two country-hotels , one is nearly ready .
then there will be a winery , a laboratory for herbs and a riding school , " he said . profits for the cooperative have been growing steadily .
now members can pay themselves a salary as well as workers , equipment and supplies .
whatever is left over gets reinvested . even giuseppe randazzo 's tempio del monte jato cooperative has just opened its first " anti-mafia restaurant . " the cooperative also markets a crispy white wine produced from the grapes of the large vineyard on the estate . " we made this wine and we decided to dedicate it to the child killed by the mafia , " randazzo said referring to a brutal retaliatory act by mafia boss giovanni brusca , when he dunked in a barrel of acid the son of a man who turned in evidence to the state . " the child looks at the tempio del monte jato with hope .
it is a message of hope for our land , " randazzo said . sicily benefiting from scheme dogged defiance of the mafia is now slowly paying off in sicily .
in areas where unemployment is notoriously high and averages 20 percent , dozens of new jobs have been created . mayor nicolosi said that in addition to greater work opportunities , a culture of legality is now spreading among the people .
the project of giving mafia lands to honest cooperatives has diminished people 's fear in the mafia .
" when people realize that the mafia can be beaten and is no longer invincible , then long-term results can be achieved , " nicolosi said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gangsters of the east pose new threats ahead of a new report into corruption in the european union accession countries , fears have been rekindled of the possible escalation of gangster activity infiltrating germany from former soviet states in the east .

eu officials are reportedly preparing to increase pressure on germany 's state-owned savings and cooperative banks by recommending that it should be easier for private investors to buy so-called sparkassen . the european commission charged a group of specialists with making suggestions for the eu 's banking sector several months ago .
according to a report by the süddeutsche zeitung this week , eu financial experts are concerned the state-backed banks present a hurdle to free competition in the bloc 's internal market . the newspaper said the 21-page study , which has not yet been made public , criticized that in some eu states banking takeovers were prevented by law or through government opposition .
the european commission should work to remove the barriers as soon as possible , the experts concluded .
the eu executive is set to recommend change to the bloc 's financial market in june . action on the part of the commission would be sure to affect germany , since the country 's banking sector is based on a three-pronged system of cooperative , savings and private banks .
the first two are often state backed and control around 60 percent of the market and are virtually impossible to buy by private sector investors . german state governments have to give permission for savings banks to be privatized .

bolkestein has already set his sights on the german savings banks in another matter .
in the rare cases that private investors are allowed to buy them , they are prevented from using the name sparkasse , which means " savings bank . "
bolkestein has said the rule hinders the common financial market and has initiated legal action against germany on the issue . the savings banks have also been under fire within germany this week .
one of the country 's leading economics institutes also determined that private investors should be able to buy state-owned savings banks , the financial times deutschland reported , quoting an unpublished report by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- . commissioned by the finance ministry to investigate banking sector perspectives , diw wrote that the state-run savings banks should follow the example of cooperative banks .

eu officials are reportedly preparing to increase pressure on germany 's state-owned savings and cooperative banks by recommending that it should be easier for private investors to buy so-called sparkassen . the european commission charged a group of specialists with making suggestions for the eu 's banking sector several months ago .
according to a report by the süddeutsche zeitung this week , eu financial experts are concerned the state-backed banks present a hurdle to free competition in the bloc 's internal market . the newspaper said the 21-page study , which has not yet been made public , criticized that in some eu states banking takeovers were prevented by law or through government opposition .
the european commission should work to remove the barriers as soon as possible , the experts concluded .
the eu executive is set to recommend change to the bloc 's financial market in june . action on the part of the commission would be sure to affect germany , since the country 's banking sector is based on a three-pronged system of cooperative , savings and private banks .
the first two are often state backed and control around 60 percent of the market and are virtually impossible to buy by private sector investors . german state governments have to give permission for savings banks to be privatized .
sale of a bank in stralsund , in northern germany , was prevented earlier this year by the local government .
the financially-stricken frankfurt sparkasse is currently awaiting a decision on whether it can be privatized .
germany 's commerzbank is said to be interested in buying the fourth biggest savings bank . savings banks under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frits bolkestein , dutch eu commissioner the study 's finding have reportedly been well received by frits bolkestein -lrb- photo -rrb- , the eu commissioner responsible for the internal market .
bolkestein has already set his sights on the german savings banks in another matter .
in the rare cases that private investors are allowed to buy them , they are prevented from using the name sparkasse , which means " savings bank . "
bolkestein has said the rule hinders the common financial market and has initiated legal action against germany on the issue . the savings banks have also been under fire within germany this week .
one of the country 's leading economics institutes also determined that private investors should be able to buy state-owned savings banks , the financial times deutschland reported , quoting an unpublished report by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- . commissioned by the finance ministry to investigate banking sector perspectives , diw wrote that the state-run savings banks should follow the example of cooperative banks .
diw financial market expert mechthild schrooten said that all credit institutes should by faced with the same rules by 2005 , when public assurances for the state-run banks are largely eliminated .
but that that did n't mean that privatization would necessarily by the result , she told dpa news agency . unfair competition ? german private banks complain that the banking sector is kept from much-needed consolidation and thus earning higher returns , since state-owned savings banks ca n't be privatized .
last year , the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- also said the german sparkasse banks should be privatized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt am main , germany 's banking center but the german savings banks association dsgv criticized the diw report , saying it equates the banking market 's performance and the high profits of private banking firms .
privatizing the savings banks would lead to limited competition and endanger financing for small and medium-sized companies , dsgv executive board member holger berndt said . the german finance ministry is expected to comment on the study in may .
deputy finance minister caio koch-weser is in favor of privatizing the savings banks , according to the financial times deutschland . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sale of state savings bank put on hold the possible sale of the sparkasse -lrb- savings bank -rrb- in the town of stralsund to a private commercial bank has been stopped .

italy 's distribution of former mafia-controlled land and assets to sicilian farmers has not just created jobs and revived the region , but also helped clean up sicily 's notorious gangster image . for most foreigners and even mainland italians , sicily is synonymous with the mafia .
but in recent years the island has been trying to shake off the image that everything is run by organized crime . sicilian authorities are keen to show that large areas of the island are run by honest cooperatives of young farmers and entrepreneurs .
these cooperatives have been allocated millions of dollars worth of land and property that used to be formerly controlled by the mafia . italy first adopted laws on the seizure of financial resources and property from imprisoned mafia bosses over two decades ago .
but it was n't until 1996 that new legislation allowed these confiscated assets to be used " for the good of society " . birthplace of feared mafia bosses nicolo nicolosi , the mayor of corleone , 60 kms south of palermo where land has been confiscated , said the mafia had acquired it illegally .
" these properties were the fruit of money laundering , violence and drug trafficking .
the mafia had taken over the best lands , but now these are being given back to the people . " corleone , a farming community is sicily 's most famous mafia town , largely thanks to a godfather movie trilogy directed by francis ford coppola .
but , nicolosi admitted that corleone 's association with the mafia is not just fiction . " there is no doubt that the most important mafia bosses in the past ten or twenty years were born here .
corleone was the birthplace of the ' boss of bosses ' , toto riina , arrested in 1993 , and of bernardo provenzano , who has been at large for 40 years and is believed to rule the mafia today . " large land holdings were confiscated from riina , now serving numerous life sentences .
the powerful mafia boss ordered the 1992 killings of two crusading anti-mafia judges , causing outrage in italy and abroad .
in corleone , riina was feared and respected by many . fear of retaliatory mafia action nicolosi said that when riina 's seized properties were handed over to a cooperative of farmers , locals were concerned there would be deadly repercussions for those entering what was considered to be " sacred territory " . " generally people were convinced that assets seized by the mafia should not be touched .
just like relatives of turncoats were killed by the mafia , people feared that those who did would pay for violating mafia territory . " this was certainly the case in the beginning .
the ' placido rizzotto ' cooperative was assigned 200 hectares of land , partly owned by mafia boss riina .
the members grow wheat which is then turned into what has been labeled " anti-mafia pasta " . francesca massimino , one of the members said the cooperative has had problems .
" the first year we could find no one to provide the machine to harvest the wheat .
the police had to intervene to find a harvester , " he said .
massimino believes the company that had agreed to provide the machine had been threatened . other cooperatives have also faced trouble including discovering that their vines had been cut or experiencing sudden fires .
in one case , two dobermans disappeared from a farm only to be found days later dead in trash cans . giuseppe randazzo , owner of the tempio del monte jato cooperative , which farms the land that once belonged to another infamous mafia boss romualdo agrigento , too said the going had n't been easy .
" the mafia had carried out acts of vandalism .
when we came here in 1998 we found it totally abandoned , destroyed , with walls torn down , vines cut down , pipelines severed , total destruction , " randazzo said . business interests outweigh mafia fear but the fear of the mafia has not cowed down the young sicilian recipients of formerly mafia-controlled land and property .
they have caught on to the business potential offered by the opportunity . the placido rizzotto cooperative will soon be inaugurating their first country-hotels in formerly mafia owned property and , francesca massimino said they have other plans as well . " there are two country-hotels , one is nearly ready .
then there will be a winery , a laboratory for herbs and a riding school , " he said . profits for the cooperative have been growing steadily .
now members can pay themselves a salary as well as workers , equipment and supplies .
whatever is left over gets reinvested . even giuseppe randazzo 's tempio del monte jato cooperative has just opened its first " anti-mafia restaurant . " the cooperative also markets a crispy white wine produced from the grapes of the large vineyard on the estate . " we made this wine and we decided to dedicate it to the child killed by the mafia , " randazzo said referring to a brutal retaliatory act by mafia boss giovanni brusca , when he dunked in a barrel of acid the son of a man who turned in evidence to the state . " the child looks at the tempio del monte jato with hope .
it is a message of hope for our land , " randazzo said . sicily benefiting from scheme dogged defiance of the mafia is now slowly paying off in sicily .
in areas where unemployment is notoriously high and averages 20 percent , dozens of new jobs have been created . mayor nicolosi said that in addition to greater work opportunities , a culture of legality is now spreading among the people .
the project of giving mafia lands to honest cooperatives has diminished people 's fear in the mafia .
" when people realize that the mafia can be beaten and is no longer invincible , then long-term results can be achieved , " nicolosi said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gangsters of the east pose new threats ahead of a new report into corruption in the european union accession countries , fears have been rekindled of the possible escalation of gangster activity infiltrating germany from former soviet states in the east .

italy 's distribution of former mafia-controlled land and assets to sicilian farmers has not just created jobs and revived the region , but also helped clean up sicily 's notorious gangster image . for most foreigners and even mainland italians , sicily is synonymous with the mafia .
but in recent years the island has been trying to shake off the image that everything is run by organized crime . sicilian authorities are keen to show that large areas of the island are run by honest cooperatives of young farmers and entrepreneurs .
these cooperatives have been allocated millions of dollars worth of land and property that used to be formerly controlled by the mafia . italy first adopted laws on the seizure of financial resources and property from imprisoned mafia bosses over two decades ago .
but it was n't until 1996 that new legislation allowed these confiscated assets to be used " for the good of society " . birthplace of feared mafia bosses nicolo nicolosi , the mayor of corleone , 60 kms south of palermo where land has been confiscated , said the mafia had acquired it illegally .
" these properties were the fruit of money laundering , violence and drug trafficking .
the mafia had taken over the best lands , but now these are being given back to the people . " corleone , a farming community is sicily 's most famous mafia town , largely thanks to a godfather movie trilogy directed by francis ford coppola .
but , nicolosi admitted that corleone 's association with the mafia is not just fiction . " there is no doubt that the most important mafia bosses in the past ten or twenty years were born here .
corleone was the birthplace of the ' boss of bosses ' , toto riina , arrested in 1993 , and of bernardo provenzano , who has been at large for 40 years and is believed to rule the mafia today . " large land holdings were confiscated from riina , now serving numerous life sentences .
the powerful mafia boss ordered the 1992 killings of two crusading anti-mafia judges , causing outrage in italy and abroad .
in corleone , riina was feared and respected by many . fear of retaliatory mafia action nicolosi said that when riina 's seized properties were handed over to a cooperative of farmers , locals were concerned there would be deadly repercussions for those entering what was considered to be " sacred territory " . " generally people were convinced that assets seized by the mafia should not be touched .
just like relatives of turncoats were killed by the mafia , people feared that those who did would pay for violating mafia territory . " this was certainly the case in the beginning .
the ' placido rizzotto ' cooperative was assigned 200 hectares of land , partly owned by mafia boss riina .
the members grow wheat which is then turned into what has been labeled " anti-mafia pasta " . francesca massimino , one of the members said the cooperative has had problems .
" the first year we could find no one to provide the machine to harvest the wheat .
the police had to intervene to find a harvester , " he said .
massimino believes the company that had agreed to provide the machine had been threatened . other cooperatives have also faced trouble including discovering that their vines had been cut or experiencing sudden fires .
in one case , two dobermans disappeared from a farm only to be found days later dead in trash cans . giuseppe randazzo , owner of the tempio del monte jato cooperative , which farms the land that once belonged to another infamous mafia boss romualdo agrigento , too said the going had n't been easy .
" the mafia had carried out acts of vandalism .
when we came here in 1998 we found it totally abandoned , destroyed , with walls torn down , vines cut down , pipelines severed , total destruction , " randazzo said . business interests outweigh mafia fear but the fear of the mafia has not cowed down the young sicilian recipients of formerly mafia-controlled land and property .
they have caught on to the business potential offered by the opportunity . the placido rizzotto cooperative will soon be inaugurating their first country-hotels in formerly mafia owned property and , francesca massimino said they have other plans as well . " there are two country-hotels , one is nearly ready .
then there will be a winery , a laboratory for herbs and a riding school , " he said . profits for the cooperative have been growing steadily .
now members can pay themselves a salary as well as workers , equipment and supplies .
whatever is left over gets reinvested . even giuseppe randazzo 's tempio del monte jato cooperative has just opened its first " anti-mafia restaurant . " the cooperative also markets a crispy white wine produced from the grapes of the large vineyard on the estate . " we made this wine and we decided to dedicate it to the child killed by the mafia , " randazzo said referring to a brutal retaliatory act by mafia boss giovanni brusca , when he dunked in a barrel of acid the son of a man who turned in evidence to the state . " the child looks at the tempio del monte jato with hope .
it is a message of hope for our land , " randazzo said . sicily benefiting from scheme dogged defiance of the mafia is now slowly paying off in sicily .
in areas where unemployment is notoriously high and averages 20 percent , dozens of new jobs have been created . mayor nicolosi said that in addition to greater work opportunities , a culture of legality is now spreading among the people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.04.2004 german state-backed savings banks face uncertain future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's state-run sparkasse banks could be stopped by brussels .
eu officials are reportedly preparing to increase pressure on germany 's state-owned savings and cooperative banks by recommending that it should be easier for private investors to buy so-called sparkassen . the european commission charged a group of specialists with making suggestions for the eu 's banking sector several months ago .
according to a report by the süddeutsche zeitung this week , eu financial experts are concerned the state-backed banks present a hurdle to free competition in the bloc 's internal market . the newspaper said the 21-page study , which has not yet been made public , criticized that in some eu states banking takeovers were prevented by law or through government opposition .
the european commission should work to remove the barriers as soon as possible , the experts concluded .
the eu executive is set to recommend change to the bloc 's financial market in june . action on the part of the commission would be sure to affect germany , since the country 's banking sector is based on a three-pronged system of cooperative , savings and private banks .
the first two are often state backed and control around 60 percent of the market and are virtually impossible to buy by private sector investors . german state governments have to give permission for savings banks to be privatized .
sale of a bank in stralsund , in northern germany , was prevented earlier this year by the local government .
the financially-stricken frankfurt sparkasse is currently awaiting a decision on whether it can be privatized .
germany 's commerzbank is said to be interested in buying the fourth biggest savings bank . savings banks under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frits bolkestein , dutch eu commissioner the study 's finding have reportedly been well received by frits bolkestein -lrb- photo -rrb- , the eu commissioner responsible for the internal market .
bolkestein has already set his sights on the german savings banks in another matter .
in the rare cases that private investors are allowed to buy them , they are prevented from using the name sparkasse , which means " savings bank . "
bolkestein has said the rule hinders the common financial market and has initiated legal action against germany on the issue . the savings banks have also been under fire within germany this week .
one of the country 's leading economics institutes also determined that private investors should be able to buy state-owned savings banks , the financial times deutschland reported , quoting an unpublished report by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- . commissioned by the finance ministry to investigate banking sector perspectives , diw wrote that the state-run savings banks should follow the example of cooperative banks .
diw financial market expert mechthild schrooten said that all credit institutes should by faced with the same rules by 2005 , when public assurances for the state-run banks are largely eliminated .
but that that did n't mean that privatization would necessarily by the result , she told dpa news agency . unfair competition ? german private banks complain that the banking sector is kept from much-needed consolidation and thus earning higher returns , since state-owned savings banks ca n't be privatized .
last year , the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- also said the german sparkasse banks should be privatized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt am main , germany 's banking center but the german savings banks association dsgv criticized the diw report , saying it equates the banking market 's performance and the high profits of private banking firms .
privatizing the savings banks would lead to limited competition and endanger financing for small and medium-sized companies , dsgv executive board member holger berndt said . the german finance ministry is expected to comment on the study in may .
deputy finance minister caio koch-weser is in favor of privatizing the savings banks , according to the financial times deutschland . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sale of state savings bank put on hold the possible sale of the sparkasse -lrb- savings bank -rrb- in the town of stralsund to a private commercial bank has been stopped .

eu officials are reportedly preparing to increase pressure on germany 's state-owned savings and cooperative banks by recommending that it should be easier for private investors to buy so-called sparkassen . the european commission charged a group of specialists with making suggestions for the eu 's banking sector several months ago .
according to a report by the süddeutsche zeitung this week , eu financial experts are concerned the state-backed banks present a hurdle to free competition in the bloc 's internal market . the newspaper said the 21-page study , which has not yet been made public , criticized that in some eu states banking takeovers were prevented by law or through government opposition .
the european commission should work to remove the barriers as soon as possible , the experts concluded .
the eu executive is set to recommend change to the bloc 's financial market in june . action on the part of the commission would be sure to affect germany , since the country 's banking sector is based on a three-pronged system of cooperative , savings and private banks .
the first two are often state backed and control around 60 percent of the market and are virtually impossible to buy by private sector investors . german state governments have to give permission for savings banks to be privatized .
sale of a bank in stralsund , in northern germany , was prevented earlier this year by the local government .
the financially-stricken frankfurt sparkasse is currently awaiting a decision on whether it can be privatized .
germany 's commerzbank is said to be interested in buying the fourth biggest savings bank . savings banks under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frits bolkestein , dutch eu commissioner the study 's finding have reportedly been well received by frits bolkestein -lrb- photo -rrb- , the eu commissioner responsible for the internal market .
bolkestein has already set his sights on the german savings banks in another matter .
in the rare cases that private investors are allowed to buy them , they are prevented from using the name sparkasse , which means " savings bank . "
bolkestein has said the rule hinders the common financial market and has initiated legal action against germany on the issue . the savings banks have also been under fire within germany this week .
one of the country 's leading economics institutes also determined that private investors should be able to buy state-owned savings banks , the financial times deutschland reported , quoting an unpublished report by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- . commissioned by the finance ministry to investigate banking sector perspectives , diw wrote that the state-run savings banks should follow the example of cooperative banks .
diw financial market expert mechthild schrooten said that all credit institutes should by faced with the same rules by 2005 , when public assurances for the state-run banks are largely eliminated .
but that that did n't mean that privatization would necessarily by the result , she told dpa news agency . unfair competition ? german private banks complain that the banking sector is kept from much-needed consolidation and thus earning higher returns , since state-owned savings banks ca n't be privatized .
last year , the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- also said the german sparkasse banks should be privatized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt am main , germany 's banking center but the german savings banks association dsgv criticized the diw report , saying it equates the banking market 's performance and the high profits of private banking firms .
privatizing the savings banks would lead to limited competition and endanger financing for small and medium-sized companies , dsgv executive board member holger berndt said . the german finance ministry is expected to comment on the study in may .
deputy finance minister caio koch-weser is in favor of privatizing the savings banks , according to the financial times deutschland . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sale of state savings bank put on hold the possible sale of the sparkasse -lrb- savings bank -rrb- in the town of stralsund to a private commercial bank has been stopped .

italy 's distribution of former mafia-controlled land and assets to sicilian farmers has not just created jobs and revived the region , but also helped clean up sicily 's notorious gangster image . for most foreigners and even mainland italians , sicily is synonymous with the mafia .
but in recent years the island has been trying to shake off the image that everything is run by organized crime . sicilian authorities are keen to show that large areas of the island are run by honest cooperatives of young farmers and entrepreneurs .
these cooperatives have been allocated millions of dollars worth of land and property that used to be formerly controlled by the mafia . italy first adopted laws on the seizure of financial resources and property from imprisoned mafia bosses over two decades ago .
but it was n't until 1996 that new legislation allowed these confiscated assets to be used " for the good of society " . birthplace of feared mafia bosses nicolo nicolosi , the mayor of corleone , 60 kms south of palermo where land has been confiscated , said the mafia had acquired it illegally .
" these properties were the fruit of money laundering , violence and drug trafficking .
the mafia had taken over the best lands , but now these are being given back to the people . " corleone , a farming community is sicily 's most famous mafia town , largely thanks to a godfather movie trilogy directed by francis ford coppola .
but , nicolosi admitted that corleone 's association with the mafia is not just fiction . " there is no doubt that the most important mafia bosses in the past ten or twenty years were born here .
corleone was the birthplace of the ' boss of bosses ' , toto riina , arrested in 1993 , and of bernardo provenzano , who has been at large for 40 years and is believed to rule the mafia today . " large land holdings were confiscated from riina , now serving numerous life sentences .
the powerful mafia boss ordered the 1992 killings of two crusading anti-mafia judges , causing outrage in italy and abroad .
in corleone , riina was feared and respected by many . fear of retaliatory mafia action nicolosi said that when riina 's seized properties were handed over to a cooperative of farmers , locals were concerned there would be deadly repercussions for those entering what was considered to be " sacred territory " . " generally people were convinced that assets seized by the mafia should not be touched .
just like relatives of turncoats were killed by the mafia , people feared that those who did would pay for violating mafia territory . " this was certainly the case in the beginning .
the ' placido rizzotto ' cooperative was assigned 200 hectares of land , partly owned by mafia boss riina .
the members grow wheat which is then turned into what has been labeled " anti-mafia pasta " . francesca massimino , one of the members said the cooperative has had problems .
" the first year we could find no one to provide the machine to harvest the wheat .
the police had to intervene to find a harvester , " he said .
massimino believes the company that had agreed to provide the machine had been threatened . other cooperatives have also faced trouble including discovering that their vines had been cut or experiencing sudden fires .
in one case , two dobermans disappeared from a farm only to be found days later dead in trash cans . giuseppe randazzo , owner of the tempio del monte jato cooperative , which farms the land that once belonged to another infamous mafia boss romualdo agrigento , too said the going had n't been easy .
" the mafia had carried out acts of vandalism .
when we came here in 1998 we found it totally abandoned , destroyed , with walls torn down , vines cut down , pipelines severed , total destruction , " randazzo said . business interests outweigh mafia fear but the fear of the mafia has not cowed down the young sicilian recipients of formerly mafia-controlled land and property .
they have caught on to the business potential offered by the opportunity . the placido rizzotto cooperative will soon be inaugurating their first country-hotels in formerly mafia owned property and , francesca massimino said they have other plans as well . " there are two country-hotels , one is nearly ready .
then there will be a winery , a laboratory for herbs and a riding school , " he said . profits for the cooperative have been growing steadily .
now members can pay themselves a salary as well as workers , equipment and supplies .
whatever is left over gets reinvested . even giuseppe randazzo 's tempio del monte jato cooperative has just opened its first " anti-mafia restaurant . " the cooperative also markets a crispy white wine produced from the grapes of the large vineyard on the estate . " we made this wine and we decided to dedicate it to the child killed by the mafia , " randazzo said referring to a brutal retaliatory act by mafia boss giovanni brusca , when he dunked in a barrel of acid the son of a man who turned in evidence to the state . " the child looks at the tempio del monte jato with hope .
it is a message of hope for our land , " randazzo said . sicily benefiting from scheme dogged defiance of the mafia is now slowly paying off in sicily .
in areas where unemployment is notoriously high and averages 20 percent , dozens of new jobs have been created . mayor nicolosi said that in addition to greater work opportunities , a culture of legality is now spreading among the people .
the project of giving mafia lands to honest cooperatives has diminished people 's fear in the mafia .
" when people realize that the mafia can be beaten and is no longer invincible , then long-term results can be achieved , " nicolosi said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gangsters of the east pose new threats ahead of a new report into corruption in the european union accession countries , fears have been rekindled of the possible escalation of gangster activity infiltrating germany from former soviet states in the east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.04.2004 times may change , but " taz " here to stay großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humble beginnings .
when germany 's leftist daily newspaper " tageszeitung " was founded in april 1979 , skeptics said it would n't last a year .
now , 25 years on , the taz 's own brand of critical , sarcasm-laced journalism is still going strong . there 's no sign of any quarter-life crisis for the taz .
confident that this birthday will be just the first of many milestones , the paper has published its 25th anniversary edition with the date apr.17 , 2029 - the year when the taz would turn 50 .
instead of indulging in nostalgic reflection on the highs and lows of the past 25 years , the paper is keen to show it 's firmly focused on the future . and how does it imagine the world will look in 2029 ?
for one thing , prague will be the capital of europe .
and an 81-year old joschka fischer will have long traded in his post as german foreign minister to become the eu 's president . it 's perhaps typical of a paper that has built its reputation on the ability to provoke to look ahead to its 50th anniversary .
what better way to throw mud in the eyes of those who predicted a lifespan of less than a year when the taz set up shop in 1979 ? different beginnings founded as a collective - a structure that still exists today - the taz was born in a very different germany .
the berlin wall still cut the city in half , the red army faction terrorist organization was still active , and the leftist scene was hotbed of political and ideological debate . " the biggest miracle was the beginning phase , " said founding member hans-christian ströbele , now a member of parliament from the green party .
it was an " adventure , " putting out a daily paper with a dozen people who had no experience in the newspaper business and no idea about finances .
they astounded themselves when they managed to scrape together an edition each day , " often in the last minute , " ströbele said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an editor on the taz 's foreign desk , buried in paper . those were the " wild years , " when the paper was beset by countless strikes and sit-ins , when there was regular turn-over in the post of editor-in-chief , and when the taz established its irreverent style , with front pages designed for maximum shock value , and sarcastic comments surreptitiously inserted by its typesetters . unique voice author joseph von westfalen in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung described the taz 's voice as follows : " here prevails a dry tone , like in the good old crime novels that were always full of detectives who were chronically short on cash , but always had a good turn of phrase , who knew the score , knew when something stank , and would never let the wool be pulled over their eyes .
it does n't necessarily have to do with being socialist , or green , or leftist .
it 's about attitude , a lapidary style , and a perspective that has n't been clouded by too much contact with the powerful . " the taz has changed with the times , though .
some observers say it 's no longer the radical paper of yesteryear , that it 's gone mainstream in an effort to compete with germany 's other liberal dailies .
" too much so for my tastes , " said michael sontheimer , a former editor-in-chief .
but he acknowledged that the paper is " much more professionally produced today . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the front page of the " taz " on oct.1 , 2003 , reporting on chancellor gerhard schröder 's reforms .
the taz prints over 60,000 copies a day six days a week .
of those , 50,000 copies go to subscribers , who can choose from among three rates , according to how much they earn -lrb- no proof required -rrb- or how much they feel the paper is worth . to celebrate its 25th birthday , the taz is throwing a party in a top berlin venue .
and , true to form , it 's also holding a congress to discuss the paper 's future , inviting journalists , writers , politicians and researchers to get to the bottom of the most pertinent issues for taz readers over the next 10 years . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de me against the media : chancellor takes on a major tabloid -lrb- again -rrb- gerhard schröder is no stranger to taking on the press when its coverage of him does n't pass muster .

when germany 's leftist daily newspaper " tageszeitung " was founded in april 1979 , skeptics said it would n't last a year .
now , 25 years on , the taz 's own brand of critical , sarcasm-laced journalism is still going strong . there 's no sign of any quarter-life crisis for the taz .
confident that this birthday will be just the first of many milestones , the paper has published its 25th anniversary edition with the date apr.17 , 2029 - the year when the taz would turn 50 .
instead of indulging in nostalgic reflection on the highs and lows of the past 25 years , the paper is keen to show it 's firmly focused on the future . and how does it imagine the world will look in 2029 ?
for one thing , prague will be the capital of europe .
and an 81-year old joschka fischer will have long traded in his post as german foreign minister to become the eu 's president . it 's perhaps typical of a paper that has built its reputation on the ability to provoke to look ahead to its 50th anniversary .
what better way to throw mud in the eyes of those who predicted a lifespan of less than a year when the taz set up shop in 1979 ? different beginnings founded as a collective - a structure that still exists today - the taz was born in a very different germany .
the berlin wall still cut the city in half , the red army faction terrorist organization was still active , and the leftist scene was hotbed of political and ideological debate . " the biggest miracle was the beginning phase , " said founding member hans-christian ströbele , now a member of parliament from the green party .
it was an " adventure , " putting out a daily paper with a dozen people who had no experience in the newspaper business and no idea about finances .
they astounded themselves when they managed to scrape together an edition each day , " often in the last minute , " ströbele said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an editor on the taz 's foreign desk , buried in paper . those were the " wild years , " when the paper was beset by countless strikes and sit-ins , when there was regular turn-over in the post of editor-in-chief , and when the taz established its irreverent style , with front pages designed for maximum shock value , and sarcastic comments surreptitiously inserted by its typesetters . unique voice author joseph von westfalen in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung described the taz 's voice as follows : " here prevails a dry tone , like in the good old crime novels that were always full of detectives who were chronically short on cash , but always had a good turn of phrase , who knew the score , knew when something stank , and would never let the wool be pulled over their eyes .
it does n't necessarily have to do with being socialist , or green , or leftist .
it 's about attitude , a lapidary style , and a perspective that has n't been clouded by too much contact with the powerful . " the taz has changed with the times , though .
some observers say it 's no longer the radical paper of yesteryear , that it 's gone mainstream in an effort to compete with germany 's other liberal dailies .
" too much so for my tastes , " said michael sontheimer , a former editor-in-chief .
but he acknowledged that the paper is " much more professionally produced today . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the front page of the " taz " on oct.1 , 2003 , reporting on chancellor gerhard schröder 's reforms .

when germany 's leftist daily newspaper " tageszeitung " was founded in april 1979 , skeptics said it would n't last a year .
now , 25 years on , the taz 's own brand of critical , sarcasm-laced journalism is still going strong . there 's no sign of any quarter-life crisis for the taz .
confident that this birthday will be just the first of many milestones , the paper has published its 25th anniversary edition with the date apr.17 , 2029 - the year when the taz would turn 50 .
instead of indulging in nostalgic reflection on the highs and lows of the past 25 years , the paper is keen to show it 's firmly focused on the future . and how does it imagine the world will look in 2029 ?
for one thing , prague will be the capital of europe .
and an 81-year old joschka fischer will have long traded in his post as german foreign minister to become the eu 's president . it 's perhaps typical of a paper that has built its reputation on the ability to provoke to look ahead to its 50th anniversary .
what better way to throw mud in the eyes of those who predicted a lifespan of less than a year when the taz set up shop in 1979 ? different beginnings founded as a collective - a structure that still exists today - the taz was born in a very different germany .
the berlin wall still cut the city in half , the red army faction terrorist organization was still active , and the leftist scene was hotbed of political and ideological debate . " the biggest miracle was the beginning phase , " said founding member hans-christian ströbele , now a member of parliament from the green party .
it was an " adventure , " putting out a daily paper with a dozen people who had no experience in the newspaper business and no idea about finances .
they astounded themselves when they managed to scrape together an edition each day , " often in the last minute , " ströbele said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an editor on the taz 's foreign desk , buried in paper . those were the " wild years , " when the paper was beset by countless strikes and sit-ins , when there was regular turn-over in the post of editor-in-chief , and when the taz established its irreverent style , with front pages designed for maximum shock value , and sarcastic comments surreptitiously inserted by its typesetters . unique voice author joseph von westfalen in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung described the taz 's voice as follows : " here prevails a dry tone , like in the good old crime novels that were always full of detectives who were chronically short on cash , but always had a good turn of phrase , who knew the score , knew when something stank , and would never let the wool be pulled over their eyes .
it does n't necessarily have to do with being socialist , or green , or leftist .
it 's about attitude , a lapidary style , and a perspective that has n't been clouded by too much contact with the powerful . " the taz has changed with the times , though .
some observers say it 's no longer the radical paper of yesteryear , that it 's gone mainstream in an effort to compete with germany 's other liberal dailies .
" too much so for my tastes , " said michael sontheimer , a former editor-in-chief .
but he acknowledged that the paper is " much more professionally produced today . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the front page of the " taz " on oct.1 , 2003 , reporting on chancellor gerhard schröder 's reforms .

he outlined plans to fight terrorism , pursue liberal domestic reforms and a pro-european foreign policy and pull spanish troops out of iraq . a total of 183 lawmakers in the 350-seat congress of deputies voted for jose luis rodriguez zapatero , more than a month after his socialist party swept to a landslide victory in general elections just days after spain 's worst terrorist attack . zapatero 's party won 164 seats in the election , 12 short of a majority .
on friday , the socialist leader managed to close the gap with help from smaller , mainly regional parties holding a total of 19 votes . a day before his election as prime minister , zapatero lay out the direction the new government would take in the coming months .
speaking during a parliamentary debate , zapatero repeated his election promise to withdraw the 1,300 spanish troops currently deployed in iraq if the un does not take control by june 30 . " the situation in iraq is worsening from day to day , " he said .
“ if the united nations does not take over political control and the military command in that country , the spanish troops will come back to be with us , ” zapatero said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george bush , center , british prime minister tony blair , left , and spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar , right , the 43-year-old former lawyer from the castile region made no secret about his plans for an abrupt change in spain 's atlanticist policy , a stance which has won him admiration among the spanish populace .

zapatero also said he planned to visit morocco shortly , as one of his first overseas trips as prime minister .
" morocco demands and deserves preferential treatment and relations that are tailored to bringing about very close ties .
that is what i shall say to the moroccan authorities during my visit in the coming days , " he said .
several of the 18 people detained in connection with the madrid bomb attacks are of moroccan origin .
pro-european focus on the issue of european policy , zapatero indicated that he planned to pursue a strongly pro-european foreign policy and his government would " do everything possible " to reach agreement on the stalled european constitution by june of this year . zapatero added that the european constitution was the " the most stabilizing common element " between the 25 eu members .
" what 's good for europe , is also good for spain , " he said . no to violence against women , yes to gay marriage zapatero also announced far-reaching reforms on the home front .
he pledged to crack down on violence against women , a scourge which he called spain 's " greatest national disgrace " and to recognize gay marriage .

like the u.k. , france is one of the eu 's biggest melting pots .
the largest waves of immigrants in france originated from neighboring italy , portugal and spain as well as its former colonies , including morocco , algeria and tunisia .

it has also traditionally considered itself a country of immigration , and about 6.3 percent of the country 's 58 million population are immigrants .
in recent decades , the inward migration trend has shifted from its direct neighbors in europe to those of northern africa and turkey , significantly increasing france 's muslim population and making it easily the largest in europe with 5 million .
france has a tradition of welcoming immigrants , but the public also expects newcomers to assimilate into the customs and traditions of french society .
accordingly , france does not " recognize differences in culture or religion in the public sphere " as a recent council of europe report poignantly stated . the challenges that strategy poses became apparent in recent years with the painful national debate over the hijab , or muslim headscarf .
this september , headscarves , jewish skullcaps , sikh turbans and any other " overt religious symbols , " including large christian crosses , will be verboten in schools in the strictly secular nation .
foreigners in france face a number of discriminatory hurdles .
chief among them is their exclusion from almost 6 million jobs that non-eu immigrants are banned from holding , including civil service jobs -lrb- including the country 's postal service and railways -rrb- , management positions in the entertainment industry or french newspapers and magazines , many stock market-related jobs and an array of others .
on the other hand , immigrants can apply for naturalized citizenship after five years , and children born in france to immigrant parents may apply when they are 18 , provided they have lived there for at least five years .
the country also launched a green card program in 1998 aimed at drawing highly qualified workers to fill vacant hi-tech jobs .

like the u.k. , france is one of the eu 's biggest melting pots .
the largest waves of immigrants in france originated from neighboring italy , portugal and spain as well as its former colonies , including morocco , algeria and tunisia .
like britain , france shares a long history with muslims and other cultures for which french has also been the mother tongue .
it has also traditionally considered itself a country of immigration , and about 6.3 percent of the country 's 58 million population are immigrants .
in recent decades , the inward migration trend has shifted from its direct neighbors in europe to those of northern africa and turkey , significantly increasing france 's muslim population and making it easily the largest in europe with 5 million .
france has a tradition of welcoming immigrants , but the public also expects newcomers to assimilate into the customs and traditions of french society .
accordingly , france does not " recognize differences in culture or religion in the public sphere " as a recent council of europe report poignantly stated . the challenges that strategy poses became apparent in recent years with the painful national debate over the hijab , or muslim headscarf .
this september , headscarves , jewish skullcaps , sikh turbans and any other " overt religious symbols , " including large christian crosses , will be verboten in schools in the strictly secular nation .
foreigners in france face a number of discriminatory hurdles .
chief among them is their exclusion from almost 6 million jobs that non-eu immigrants are banned from holding , including civil service jobs -lrb- including the country 's postal service and railways -rrb- , management positions in the entertainment industry or french newspapers and magazines , many stock market-related jobs and an array of others .

the country , known as one of europe 's most tolerant , is highly attractive to foreigners : 12 percent of sweden 's population of 9 million are immigrants .

in recent years , foreigners in the country have suffered a disproportionately high rate of unemployment , and housing segregation has also proven problematic , according to the swedish institute . sweden is also home to the region 's largest muslim population , with an estimated 350,000 ethnic muslims .

but praise for kotti 's multiculturalism is increasingly coupled with concern that such neighborhoods have turned into parallel worlds that operate against the rules of western society .
in these shadow worlds , teenage daughters are kept under lock and key , waiting for the day their parents marry them off to strangers .

like the u.k. , france is one of the eu 's biggest melting pots .
the largest waves of immigrants in france originated from neighboring italy , portugal and spain as well as its former colonies , including morocco , algeria and tunisia .
like britain , france shares a long history with muslims and other cultures for which french has also been the mother tongue .
it has also traditionally considered itself a country of immigration , and about 6.3 percent of the country 's 58 million population are immigrants .
in recent decades , the inward migration trend has shifted from its direct neighbors in europe to those of northern africa and turkey , significantly increasing france 's muslim population and making it easily the largest in europe with 5 million .
france has a tradition of welcoming immigrants , but the public also expects newcomers to assimilate into the customs and traditions of french society .
accordingly , france does not " recognize differences in culture or religion in the public sphere " as a recent council of europe report poignantly stated . the challenges that strategy poses became apparent in recent years with the painful national debate over the hijab , or muslim headscarf .
this september , headscarves , jewish skullcaps , sikh turbans and any other " overt religious symbols , " including large christian crosses , will be verboten in schools in the strictly secular nation .
foreigners in france face a number of discriminatory hurdles .
chief among them is their exclusion from almost 6 million jobs that non-eu immigrants are banned from holding , including civil service jobs -lrb- including the country 's postal service and railways -rrb- , management positions in the entertainment industry or french newspapers and magazines , many stock market-related jobs and an array of others .
on the other hand , immigrants can apply for naturalized citizenship after five years , and children born in france to immigrant parents may apply when they are 18 , provided they have lived there for at least five years .
the country also launched a green card program in 1998 aimed at drawing highly qualified workers to fill vacant hi-tech jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " muslimaphobia " is on the rise after the 9/11 attacks , the country 's anti-discrimination hotline recorded an upsurge in xenophobic attitudes towards muslims . and beginning in april 2002 , a wave of vandalism and attacks were carried out at muslim mosques and prayer places .
open society researchers have cast some of the blame on the media for inciting " muslimaphobia . "
the media , it reported in 2002 , aids the trend of associating " islam with immigration , criminality , fanaticism and terrorism , thereby providing a justification for exclusion and religiously motivated discrimination .

11 attacks and madrid bombings have subject the muslim community to police raids and mistrust the united kingdom has long considered itself a nation of immigration and has one of the world 's most diverse populations .
about 2.34 million of its nearly 59 million residents are foreigners .
many of the country 's immigrant residents came from its former colonies , like india and pakistan .
in recent years , there has been large-scale immigration of muslims from the middle east as well as refugees from the balkans .
due to its former ties to the asian subcontinent , a high percentage of its muslim population speaks english .
britain has a comprehensive immigration policy and also bans discrimination - both religious and racial - in important areas like employment , education , housing and welfare .
according to a recent european commission report , britain is soon planning to open its doors to a new wave of immigrants needed to fill jobs in the blue collar labor market . anyone born in the u.k. is automatically a citizen , and naturalization for newcomers is possible after five years .

italy 's distribution of former mafia-controlled land and assets to sicilian farmers has not just created jobs and revived the region , but also helped clean up sicily 's notorious gangster image . for most foreigners and even mainland italians , sicily is synonymous with the mafia .
but in recent years the island has been trying to shake off the image that everything is run by organized crime . sicilian authorities are keen to show that large areas of the island are run by honest cooperatives of young farmers and entrepreneurs .
these cooperatives have been allocated millions of dollars worth of land and property that used to be formerly controlled by the mafia . italy first adopted laws on the seizure of financial resources and property from imprisoned mafia bosses over two decades ago .
but it was n't until 1996 that new legislation allowed these confiscated assets to be used " for the good of society " . birthplace of feared mafia bosses nicolo nicolosi , the mayor of corleone , 60 kms south of palermo where land has been confiscated , said the mafia had acquired it illegally .
" these properties were the fruit of money laundering , violence and drug trafficking .
the mafia had taken over the best lands , but now these are being given back to the people . " corleone , a farming community is sicily 's most famous mafia town , largely thanks to a godfather movie trilogy directed by francis ford coppola .
but , nicolosi admitted that corleone 's association with the mafia is not just fiction . " there is no doubt that the most important mafia bosses in the past ten or twenty years were born here .
corleone was the birthplace of the ' boss of bosses ' , toto riina , arrested in 1993 , and of bernardo provenzano , who has been at large for 40 years and is believed to rule the mafia today . " large land holdings were confiscated from riina , now serving numerous life sentences .
the powerful mafia boss ordered the 1992 killings of two crusading anti-mafia judges , causing outrage in italy and abroad .
in corleone , riina was feared and respected by many . fear of retaliatory mafia action nicolosi said that when riina 's seized properties were handed over to a cooperative of farmers , locals were concerned there would be deadly repercussions for those entering what was considered to be " sacred territory " . " generally people were convinced that assets seized by the mafia should not be touched .
just like relatives of turncoats were killed by the mafia , people feared that those who did would pay for violating mafia territory . " this was certainly the case in the beginning .
the ' placido rizzotto ' cooperative was assigned 200 hectares of land , partly owned by mafia boss riina .
the members grow wheat which is then turned into what has been labeled " anti-mafia pasta " . francesca massimino , one of the members said the cooperative has had problems .
" the first year we could find no one to provide the machine to harvest the wheat .
the police had to intervene to find a harvester , " he said .
massimino believes the company that had agreed to provide the machine had been threatened . other cooperatives have also faced trouble including discovering that their vines had been cut or experiencing sudden fires .
in one case , two dobermans disappeared from a farm only to be found days later dead in trash cans . giuseppe randazzo , owner of the tempio del monte jato cooperative , which farms the land that once belonged to another infamous mafia boss romualdo agrigento , too said the going had n't been easy .
" the mafia had carried out acts of vandalism .
when we came here in 1998 we found it totally abandoned , destroyed , with walls torn down , vines cut down , pipelines severed , total destruction , " randazzo said . business interests outweigh mafia fear but the fear of the mafia has not cowed down the young sicilian recipients of formerly mafia-controlled land and property .
they have caught on to the business potential offered by the opportunity . the placido rizzotto cooperative will soon be inaugurating their first country-hotels in formerly mafia owned property and , francesca massimino said they have other plans as well . " there are two country-hotels , one is nearly ready .
then there will be a winery , a laboratory for herbs and a riding school , " he said . profits for the cooperative have been growing steadily .
now members can pay themselves a salary as well as workers , equipment and supplies .
whatever is left over gets reinvested . even giuseppe randazzo 's tempio del monte jato cooperative has just opened its first " anti-mafia restaurant . " the cooperative also markets a crispy white wine produced from the grapes of the large vineyard on the estate . " we made this wine and we decided to dedicate it to the child killed by the mafia , " randazzo said referring to a brutal retaliatory act by mafia boss giovanni brusca , when he dunked in a barrel of acid the son of a man who turned in evidence to the state . " the child looks at the tempio del monte jato with hope .
it is a message of hope for our land , " randazzo said . sicily benefiting from scheme dogged defiance of the mafia is now slowly paying off in sicily .
in areas where unemployment is notoriously high and averages 20 percent , dozens of new jobs have been created . mayor nicolosi said that in addition to greater work opportunities , a culture of legality is now spreading among the people .
the project of giving mafia lands to honest cooperatives has diminished people 's fear in the mafia .
" when people realize that the mafia can be beaten and is no longer invincible , then long-term results can be achieved , " nicolosi said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gangsters of the east pose new threats ahead of a new report into corruption in the european union accession countries , fears have been rekindled of the possible escalation of gangster activity infiltrating germany from former soviet states in the east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.04.2004 german state-backed savings banks face uncertain future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's state-run sparkasse banks could be stopped by brussels .
eu officials are reportedly preparing to increase pressure on germany 's state-owned savings and cooperative banks by recommending that it should be easier for private investors to buy so-called sparkassen . the european commission charged a group of specialists with making suggestions for the eu 's banking sector several months ago .
according to a report by the süddeutsche zeitung this week , eu financial experts are concerned the state-backed banks present a hurdle to free competition in the bloc 's internal market . the newspaper said the 21-page study , which has not yet been made public , criticized that in some eu states banking takeovers were prevented by law or through government opposition .
the european commission should work to remove the barriers as soon as possible , the experts concluded .
the eu executive is set to recommend change to the bloc 's financial market in june . action on the part of the commission would be sure to affect germany , since the country 's banking sector is based on a three-pronged system of cooperative , savings and private banks .
the first two are often state backed and control around 60 percent of the market and are virtually impossible to buy by private sector investors . german state governments have to give permission for savings banks to be privatized .
sale of a bank in stralsund , in northern germany , was prevented earlier this year by the local government .
the financially-stricken frankfurt sparkasse is currently awaiting a decision on whether it can be privatized .
germany 's commerzbank is said to be interested in buying the fourth biggest savings bank . savings banks under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frits bolkestein , dutch eu commissioner the study 's finding have reportedly been well received by frits bolkestein -lrb- photo -rrb- , the eu commissioner responsible for the internal market .
bolkestein has already set his sights on the german savings banks in another matter .
in the rare cases that private investors are allowed to buy them , they are prevented from using the name sparkasse , which means " savings bank . "
bolkestein has said the rule hinders the common financial market and has initiated legal action against germany on the issue . the savings banks have also been under fire within germany this week .

eu officials are reportedly preparing to increase pressure on germany 's state-owned savings and cooperative banks by recommending that it should be easier for private investors to buy so-called sparkassen . the european commission charged a group of specialists with making suggestions for the eu 's banking sector several months ago .
according to a report by the süddeutsche zeitung this week , eu financial experts are concerned the state-backed banks present a hurdle to free competition in the bloc 's internal market . the newspaper said the 21-page study , which has not yet been made public , criticized that in some eu states banking takeovers were prevented by law or through government opposition .
the european commission should work to remove the barriers as soon as possible , the experts concluded .
the eu executive is set to recommend change to the bloc 's financial market in june . action on the part of the commission would be sure to affect germany , since the country 's banking sector is based on a three-pronged system of cooperative , savings and private banks .
the first two are often state backed and control around 60 percent of the market and are virtually impossible to buy by private sector investors . german state governments have to give permission for savings banks to be privatized .
sale of a bank in stralsund , in northern germany , was prevented earlier this year by the local government .

bolkestein has already set his sights on the german savings banks in another matter .
in the rare cases that private investors are allowed to buy them , they are prevented from using the name sparkasse , which means " savings bank . "
bolkestein has said the rule hinders the common financial market and has initiated legal action against germany on the issue . the savings banks have also been under fire within germany this week .

eu officials are reportedly preparing to increase pressure on germany 's state-owned savings and cooperative banks by recommending that it should be easier for private investors to buy so-called sparkassen . the european commission charged a group of specialists with making suggestions for the eu 's banking sector several months ago .
according to a report by the süddeutsche zeitung this week , eu financial experts are concerned the state-backed banks present a hurdle to free competition in the bloc 's internal market . the newspaper said the 21-page study , which has not yet been made public , criticized that in some eu states banking takeovers were prevented by law or through government opposition .
the european commission should work to remove the barriers as soon as possible , the experts concluded .
the eu executive is set to recommend change to the bloc 's financial market in june . action on the part of the commission would be sure to affect germany , since the country 's banking sector is based on a three-pronged system of cooperative , savings and private banks .
the first two are often state backed and control around 60 percent of the market and are virtually impossible to buy by private sector investors . german state governments have to give permission for savings banks to be privatized .
sale of a bank in stralsund , in northern germany , was prevented earlier this year by the local government .

when germany 's leftist daily newspaper " tageszeitung " was founded in april 1979 , skeptics said it would n't last a year .
now , 25 years on , the taz 's own brand of critical , sarcasm-laced journalism is still going strong . there 's no sign of any quarter-life crisis for the taz .
confident that this birthday will be just the first of many milestones , the paper has published its 25th anniversary edition with the date apr.17 , 2029 - the year when the taz would turn 50 .
instead of indulging in nostalgic reflection on the highs and lows of the past 25 years , the paper is keen to show it 's firmly focused on the future . and how does it imagine the world will look in 2029 ?
for one thing , prague will be the capital of europe .
and an 81-year old joschka fischer will have long traded in his post as german foreign minister to become the eu 's president . it 's perhaps typical of a paper that has built its reputation on the ability to provoke to look ahead to its 50th anniversary .
what better way to throw mud in the eyes of those who predicted a lifespan of less than a year when the taz set up shop in 1979 ? different beginnings founded as a collective - a structure that still exists today - the taz was born in a very different germany .
the berlin wall still cut the city in half , the red army faction terrorist organization was still active , and the leftist scene was hotbed of political and ideological debate . " the biggest miracle was the beginning phase , " said founding member hans-christian ströbele , now a member of parliament from the green party .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an editor on the taz 's foreign desk , buried in paper . those were the " wild years , " when the paper was beset by countless strikes and sit-ins , when there was regular turn-over in the post of editor-in-chief , and when the taz established its irreverent style , with front pages designed for maximum shock value , and sarcastic comments surreptitiously inserted by its typesetters . unique voice author joseph von westfalen in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung described the taz 's voice as follows : " here prevails a dry tone , like in the good old crime novels that were always full of detectives who were chronically short on cash , but always had a good turn of phrase , who knew the score , knew when something stank , and would never let the wool be pulled over their eyes .
it does n't necessarily have to do with being socialist , or green , or leftist .

some observers say it 's no longer the radical paper of yesteryear , that it 's gone mainstream in an effort to compete with germany 's other liberal dailies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.04.2004 -pipe- 17:00 utc think tank predicts eu expansion will help german economy the german economy will profit from the imminent eastward enlargement of the eu , according to a survey by the german economic institute -lrb- iw -rrb- in cologne .
the industry-financed think tank expects the entry of 10 new member states into the eu to add half a percentage point to german growth in both 2005 and 2006 .
that prediction is in stark contrast to widespread fears that germany will lose business due to competition from the lower wage countries joining the eu . the iw survey based its projections on an expected expansion of german companies ' trade with the accession countries as well as additional direct investments of german businesses in the new eu member states , resulting in more efficient production .
german direct investments in the accession states increased by a massive 430 percent to nearly € 30 billion between 1995 and 2001 .
the adoption of eu law by these countries will make their regulatory framework even more reliable for foreign investors , the survey claimed . more briefs 16.04.2004 -pipe- licorice addict sues german confectioner 15.04.2004 -pipe- financial concerns raised over germany 's world cup infrastructure 15.04.2004 -pipe- basf and bayer clash over insecticide deal 14.04.2004 -pipe- vw recalls 30,000 transporters 14.04.2004 -pipe- axel springer moves into russian market 14.04.2004 -pipe- poll : job protection blocks job creation 14.04.2004 -pipe- german economy still puttering 13.04.2004 -pipe- strong euro hurts german exports to u.s. radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.04.2004 -pipe- 09:00 utc germany flexible on number of commissioners in future eu speaking at rotterdam university on thursday , the chancellor said that germany could eventually accept not always having its own representative in the brussels executive .
schröder said the number of commissioners could be reduced so that all 25 member-states , including germany , would take turns at going without a representative on the commission .
" a compromise could be found in maintaining for a few years the principle where each member-state is represented in the commission with one commissioner " , said the chancellor .
he added that the principle of equal rotation would be introduced .
" that would mean that not only small member states but also the large ones would in the future have to regularly forgo a commissioner " .
the number of commissioners in a future eu is one of the big issues still to be resolved in the negotiations on europe 's constitution .
germany 's concession is important as smaller countries , particularly austria , which have been fighting tooth and nail for one commissioner per member state , have indicated they will only accept a smaller commission so long as rotation is done on an equal basis .
thursday also saw poland and spain , formerly renowned for blocking an advance on the treaty negotiations , reiterate their preparedness to compromise . -lrb- euobserver.com -rrb- www-links the latest on eu-related news more briefs 16.04.2004 -pipe- meps issue commission ultimatum on data transfer to u.s. 15.04.2004 -pipe- turkish cypriot pm rallies vote for un reunification plan 15.04.2004 -pipe- schröder calls for two-speed europe 14.04.2004 -pipe- center-right to dominate in european elections 14.04.2004 -pipe- prodi : prompt lifting of chinese arms embargo unlikely 14.04.2004 -pipe- u.s. urges quick deal on passenger data transfer 13.04.2004 -pipe- eu parliament quizzes new commissioners 13.04.2004 -pipe- threat of chemical attack in europe underestimated , french official says radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.04.2004 -pipe- 14:00 utc licorice addict sues german confectioner german candy manufacturer haribo has been sued by a woman who blames her addiction to licorice and consequent heart problems on the confectioner , according to a berlin court announcement .
the 48-year-old plaintiff from berlin is asking for € 6,000 -lrb- $ 7,148 -rrb- in damages from haribo because she developed heart problems after consuming 400 grams -lrb- 14 ounces -rrb- of the chewy candy every day for four months .
she collapsed after her last binge and said she was unable to work for several months .
the unnamed woman claims that haribo failed to warn of the potentially negative effects of excessive consumption of licorice , and in particular glycyrrhizin , an active compound in licorice root .
but the company denied any responsibility , saying there is no relationship between its product and the woman 's condition and that it had no legal obligation to list glycyrrhizin among the ingredients of the candy because it contained only a small amount of the compound , between 0.08 and 0.18 percent of the total ingredients .
germany 's federal institute for risk assessment has stated that products that contain more than 0.2 percent glycyrrhizin can induce side effects in people who eat more than 50 grams of them per day . more briefs 15.04.2004 -pipe- financial concerns raised over germany 's world cup infrastructure 15.04.2004 -pipe- basf and bayer clash over insecticide deal 14.04.2004 -pipe- vw recalls 30,000 transporters 14.04.2004 -pipe- axel springer moves into russian market 14.04.2004 -pipe- poll : job protection blocks job creation 14.04.2004 -pipe- german economy still puttering 13.04.2004 -pipe- strong euro hurts german exports to u.s. 13.04.2004 -pipe- bundesbank to establish new ethics code radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the 48-year-old plaintiff from berlin is asking for € 6,000 -lrb- $ 7,148 -rrb- in damages from haribo because she developed heart problems after consuming 400 grams -lrb- 14 ounces -rrb- of the chewy candy every day for four months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.04.2004 integration in germany every major city in europe has a place like kottbusser tor , where the dominant language is not the national tongue and where generations of foreigners have shaped the neighborhood to fit their own , exotic tastes . lives in the berlin district revolve around traditions and values brought from the old country , and germans often feel out of place .
but praise for kotti 's multiculturalism is increasingly coupled with concern that such neighborhoods have turned into parallel worlds that operate against the rules of western society .

italy 's distribution of former mafia-controlled land and assets to sicilian farmers has not just created jobs and revived the region , but also helped clean up sicily 's notorious gangster image . for most foreigners and even mainland italians , sicily is synonymous with the mafia .
but in recent years the island has been trying to shake off the image that everything is run by organized crime . sicilian authorities are keen to show that large areas of the island are run by honest cooperatives of young farmers and entrepreneurs .
these cooperatives have been allocated millions of dollars worth of land and property that used to be formerly controlled by the mafia . italy first adopted laws on the seizure of financial resources and property from imprisoned mafia bosses over two decades ago .
but it was n't until 1996 that new legislation allowed these confiscated assets to be used " for the good of society " . birthplace of feared mafia bosses nicolo nicolosi , the mayor of corleone , 60 kms south of palermo where land has been confiscated , said the mafia had acquired it illegally .
" these properties were the fruit of money laundering , violence and drug trafficking .
the mafia had taken over the best lands , but now these are being given back to the people . " corleone , a farming community is sicily 's most famous mafia town , largely thanks to a godfather movie trilogy directed by francis ford coppola .
but , nicolosi admitted that corleone 's association with the mafia is not just fiction . " there is no doubt that the most important mafia bosses in the past ten or twenty years were born here .
corleone was the birthplace of the ' boss of bosses ' , toto riina , arrested in 1993 , and of bernardo provenzano , who has been at large for 40 years and is believed to rule the mafia today . " large land holdings were confiscated from riina , now serving numerous life sentences .
the powerful mafia boss ordered the 1992 killings of two crusading anti-mafia judges , causing outrage in italy and abroad .
in corleone , riina was feared and respected by many . fear of retaliatory mafia action nicolosi said that when riina 's seized properties were handed over to a cooperative of farmers , locals were concerned there would be deadly repercussions for those entering what was considered to be " sacred territory " . " generally people were convinced that assets seized by the mafia should not be touched .
just like relatives of turncoats were killed by the mafia , people feared that those who did would pay for violating mafia territory . " this was certainly the case in the beginning .
the ' placido rizzotto ' cooperative was assigned 200 hectares of land , partly owned by mafia boss riina .
the members grow wheat which is then turned into what has been labeled " anti-mafia pasta " . francesca massimino , one of the members said the cooperative has had problems .
" the first year we could find no one to provide the machine to harvest the wheat .
the police had to intervene to find a harvester , " he said .
massimino believes the company that had agreed to provide the machine had been threatened . other cooperatives have also faced trouble including discovering that their vines had been cut or experiencing sudden fires .
in one case , two dobermans disappeared from a farm only to be found days later dead in trash cans . giuseppe randazzo , owner of the tempio del monte jato cooperative , which farms the land that once belonged to another infamous mafia boss romualdo agrigento , too said the going had n't been easy .
" the mafia had carried out acts of vandalism .
when we came here in 1998 we found it totally abandoned , destroyed , with walls torn down , vines cut down , pipelines severed , total destruction , " randazzo said . business interests outweigh mafia fear but the fear of the mafia has not cowed down the young sicilian recipients of formerly mafia-controlled land and property .
they have caught on to the business potential offered by the opportunity . the placido rizzotto cooperative will soon be inaugurating their first country-hotels in formerly mafia owned property and , francesca massimino said they have other plans as well . " there are two country-hotels , one is nearly ready .
then there will be a winery , a laboratory for herbs and a riding school , " he said . profits for the cooperative have been growing steadily .
now members can pay themselves a salary as well as workers , equipment and supplies .
whatever is left over gets reinvested . even giuseppe randazzo 's tempio del monte jato cooperative has just opened its first " anti-mafia restaurant . " the cooperative also markets a crispy white wine produced from the grapes of the large vineyard on the estate . " we made this wine and we decided to dedicate it to the child killed by the mafia , " randazzo said referring to a brutal retaliatory act by mafia boss giovanni brusca , when he dunked in a barrel of acid the son of a man who turned in evidence to the state . " the child looks at the tempio del monte jato with hope .
it is a message of hope for our land , " randazzo said . sicily benefiting from scheme dogged defiance of the mafia is now slowly paying off in sicily .
in areas where unemployment is notoriously high and averages 20 percent , dozens of new jobs have been created . mayor nicolosi said that in addition to greater work opportunities , a culture of legality is now spreading among the people .
the project of giving mafia lands to honest cooperatives has diminished people 's fear in the mafia .
" when people realize that the mafia can be beaten and is no longer invincible , then long-term results can be achieved , " nicolosi said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gangsters of the east pose new threats ahead of a new report into corruption in the european union accession countries , fears have been rekindled of the possible escalation of gangster activity infiltrating germany from former soviet states in the east .

today it is one of immigration .
as the economy began to grow in the 1950s , the country brought in labor immigrants , many coming from greece , italy , turkey and the former yugoslavia .
under the government of former prime minister olof palme , who led sweden several times between 1969 and 1986 , thousands of refugees arrived from chile , south africa and vietnam .
during the balkans crisis of the 1990s , 60,000 fled bosnia and herzegovina for the northern european land .
the country , known as one of europe 's most tolerant , is highly attractive to foreigners : 12 percent of sweden 's population of 9 million are immigrants .
in 1997 , the swedish government adopted an integration policy that focuses on mainstreaming foreign residents - with equal opportunities and civic responsibilities as the starting point .
like britain , the swedes encourage immigrants to preserve some of their cultural heritage in multicultural communities .
part of the effort to bring them into the swedish mainstream is a € 219 million annual budget for programs that include free language courses .
however , sweden 's shift to become an immigrant nation has n't gone without hitches .
in recent years , foreigners in the country have suffered a disproportionately high rate of unemployment , and housing segregation has also proven problematic , according to the swedish institute . sweden is also home to the region 's largest muslim population , with an estimated 350,000 ethnic muslims .
though the highly secular swedish government follows a policy of " colorblind " integration that encourages " equality , freedom of choice and cooperation , " this is often viewed through the lens of a lutheran-dominated society often fails to take into account the differing needs of muslims , a recent report by the european commission concluded .
sweden protects its residents against religious discrimination , but it offers these rights to the individual and not groups .
still , sweden has a very liberal policy of providing funding to private schools approved by the state , including muslim ones .
in the wake of sept .
11 , authorities recorded an increase in violent incidents against muslims and people of arab decent and an uptick in islamaphobic messages from the country 's far-right political parties .
the most-dramatic post-9/11 incident in the country occurred in the southern swedish city of malmö , where arsonists set fire to an islamic school and cultural center . daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

like the u.k. , france is one of the eu 's biggest melting pots .
the largest waves of immigrants in france originated from neighboring italy , portugal and spain as well as its former colonies , including morocco , algeria and tunisia .
like britain , france shares a long history with muslims and other cultures for which french has also been the mother tongue .
it has also traditionally considered itself a country of immigration , and about 6.3 percent of the country 's 58 million population are immigrants .
in recent decades , the inward migration trend has shifted from its direct neighbors in europe to those of northern africa and turkey , significantly increasing france 's muslim population and making it easily the largest in europe with 5 million .
france has a tradition of welcoming immigrants , but the public also expects newcomers to assimilate into the customs and traditions of french society .
accordingly , france does not " recognize differences in culture or religion in the public sphere " as a recent council of europe report poignantly stated . the challenges that strategy poses became apparent in recent years with the painful national debate over the hijab , or muslim headscarf .
this september , headscarves , jewish skullcaps , sikh turbans and any other " overt religious symbols , " including large christian crosses , will be verboten in schools in the strictly secular nation .
foreigners in france face a number of discriminatory hurdles .
chief among them is their exclusion from almost 6 million jobs that non-eu immigrants are banned from holding , including civil service jobs -lrb- including the country 's postal service and railways -rrb- , management positions in the entertainment industry or french newspapers and magazines , many stock market-related jobs and an array of others .
on the other hand , immigrants can apply for naturalized citizenship after five years , and children born in france to immigrant parents may apply when they are 18 , provided they have lived there for at least five years .
the country also launched a green card program in 1998 aimed at drawing highly qualified workers to fill vacant hi-tech jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " muslimaphobia " is on the rise after the 9/11 attacks , the country 's anti-discrimination hotline recorded an upsurge in xenophobic attitudes towards muslims . and beginning in april 2002 , a wave of vandalism and attacks were carried out at muslim mosques and prayer places .
open society researchers have cast some of the blame on the media for inciting " muslimaphobia . "
the media , it reported in 2002 , aids the trend of associating " islam with immigration , criminality , fanaticism and terrorism , thereby providing a justification for exclusion and religiously motivated discrimination .

italy 's distribution of former mafia-controlled land and assets to sicilian farmers has not just created jobs and revived the region , but also helped clean up sicily 's notorious gangster image . for most foreigners and even mainland italians , sicily is synonymous with the mafia .
but in recent years the island has been trying to shake off the image that everything is run by organized crime . sicilian authorities are keen to show that large areas of the island are run by honest cooperatives of young farmers and entrepreneurs .
these cooperatives have been allocated millions of dollars worth of land and property that used to be formerly controlled by the mafia . italy first adopted laws on the seizure of financial resources and property from imprisoned mafia bosses over two decades ago .
but it was n't until 1996 that new legislation allowed these confiscated assets to be used " for the good of society " . birthplace of feared mafia bosses nicolo nicolosi , the mayor of corleone , 60 kms south of palermo where land has been confiscated , said the mafia had acquired it illegally .
" these properties were the fruit of money laundering , violence and drug trafficking .
the mafia had taken over the best lands , but now these are being given back to the people . " corleone , a farming community is sicily 's most famous mafia town , largely thanks to a godfather movie trilogy directed by francis ford coppola .
but , nicolosi admitted that corleone 's association with the mafia is not just fiction . " there is no doubt that the most important mafia bosses in the past ten or twenty years were born here .
corleone was the birthplace of the ' boss of bosses ' , toto riina , arrested in 1993 , and of bernardo provenzano , who has been at large for 40 years and is believed to rule the mafia today . " large land holdings were confiscated from riina , now serving numerous life sentences .
the powerful mafia boss ordered the 1992 killings of two crusading anti-mafia judges , causing outrage in italy and abroad .
in corleone , riina was feared and respected by many . fear of retaliatory mafia action nicolosi said that when riina 's seized properties were handed over to a cooperative of farmers , locals were concerned there would be deadly repercussions for those entering what was considered to be " sacred territory " . " generally people were convinced that assets seized by the mafia should not be touched .
just like relatives of turncoats were killed by the mafia , people feared that those who did would pay for violating mafia territory . " this was certainly the case in the beginning .
the ' placido rizzotto ' cooperative was assigned 200 hectares of land , partly owned by mafia boss riina .
the members grow wheat which is then turned into what has been labeled " anti-mafia pasta " . francesca massimino , one of the members said the cooperative has had problems .
" the first year we could find no one to provide the machine to harvest the wheat .
the police had to intervene to find a harvester , " he said .
massimino believes the company that had agreed to provide the machine had been threatened . other cooperatives have also faced trouble including discovering that their vines had been cut or experiencing sudden fires .
in one case , two dobermans disappeared from a farm only to be found days later dead in trash cans . giuseppe randazzo , owner of the tempio del monte jato cooperative , which farms the land that once belonged to another infamous mafia boss romualdo agrigento , too said the going had n't been easy .
" the mafia had carried out acts of vandalism .
when we came here in 1998 we found it totally abandoned , destroyed , with walls torn down , vines cut down , pipelines severed , total destruction , " randazzo said . business interests outweigh mafia fear but the fear of the mafia has not cowed down the young sicilian recipients of formerly mafia-controlled land and property .
they have caught on to the business potential offered by the opportunity . the placido rizzotto cooperative will soon be inaugurating their first country-hotels in formerly mafia owned property and , francesca massimino said they have other plans as well . " there are two country-hotels , one is nearly ready .
then there will be a winery , a laboratory for herbs and a riding school , " he said . profits for the cooperative have been growing steadily .
now members can pay themselves a salary as well as workers , equipment and supplies .
whatever is left over gets reinvested . even giuseppe randazzo 's tempio del monte jato cooperative has just opened its first " anti-mafia restaurant . " the cooperative also markets a crispy white wine produced from the grapes of the large vineyard on the estate . " we made this wine and we decided to dedicate it to the child killed by the mafia , " randazzo said referring to a brutal retaliatory act by mafia boss giovanni brusca , when he dunked in a barrel of acid the son of a man who turned in evidence to the state . " the child looks at the tempio del monte jato with hope .
it is a message of hope for our land , " randazzo said . sicily benefiting from scheme dogged defiance of the mafia is now slowly paying off in sicily .
in areas where unemployment is notoriously high and averages 20 percent , dozens of new jobs have been created . mayor nicolosi said that in addition to greater work opportunities , a culture of legality is now spreading among the people .
the project of giving mafia lands to honest cooperatives has diminished people 's fear in the mafia .

italy 's distribution of former mafia-controlled land and assets to sicilian farmers has not just created jobs and revived the region , but also helped clean up sicily 's notorious gangster image . for most foreigners and even mainland italians , sicily is synonymous with the mafia .
but in recent years the island has been trying to shake off the image that everything is run by organized crime . sicilian authorities are keen to show that large areas of the island are run by honest cooperatives of young farmers and entrepreneurs .
these cooperatives have been allocated millions of dollars worth of land and property that used to be formerly controlled by the mafia . italy first adopted laws on the seizure of financial resources and property from imprisoned mafia bosses over two decades ago .
but it was n't until 1996 that new legislation allowed these confiscated assets to be used " for the good of society " . birthplace of feared mafia bosses nicolo nicolosi , the mayor of corleone , 60 kms south of palermo where land has been confiscated , said the mafia had acquired it illegally .

corleone was the birthplace of the ' boss of bosses ' , toto riina , arrested in 1993 , and of bernardo provenzano , who has been at large for 40 years and is believed to rule the mafia today . " large land holdings were confiscated from riina , now serving numerous life sentences .
the powerful mafia boss ordered the 1992 killings of two crusading anti-mafia judges , causing outrage in italy and abroad .
in corleone , riina was feared and respected by many . fear of retaliatory mafia action nicolosi said that when riina 's seized properties were handed over to a cooperative of farmers , locals were concerned there would be deadly repercussions for those entering what was considered to be " sacred territory " . " generally people were convinced that assets seized by the mafia should not be touched .
just like relatives of turncoats were killed by the mafia , people feared that those who did would pay for violating mafia territory . " this was certainly the case in the beginning .

eu officials are reportedly preparing to increase pressure on germany 's state-owned savings and cooperative banks by recommending that it should be easier for private investors to buy so-called sparkassen . the european commission charged a group of specialists with making suggestions for the eu 's banking sector several months ago .
according to a report by the süddeutsche zeitung this week , eu financial experts are concerned the state-backed banks present a hurdle to free competition in the bloc 's internal market . the newspaper said the 21-page study , which has not yet been made public , criticized that in some eu states banking takeovers were prevented by law or through government opposition .
the european commission should work to remove the barriers as soon as possible , the experts concluded .
the eu executive is set to recommend change to the bloc 's financial market in june . action on the part of the commission would be sure to affect germany , since the country 's banking sector is based on a three-pronged system of cooperative , savings and private banks .
the first two are often state backed and control around 60 percent of the market and are virtually impossible to buy by private sector investors . german state governments have to give permission for savings banks to be privatized .
sale of a bank in stralsund , in northern germany , was prevented earlier this year by the local government .
the financially-stricken frankfurt sparkasse is currently awaiting a decision on whether it can be privatized .
germany 's commerzbank is said to be interested in buying the fourth biggest savings bank . savings banks under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frits bolkestein , dutch eu commissioner the study 's finding have reportedly been well received by frits bolkestein -lrb- photo -rrb- , the eu commissioner responsible for the internal market .
bolkestein has already set his sights on the german savings banks in another matter .
in the rare cases that private investors are allowed to buy them , they are prevented from using the name sparkasse , which means " savings bank . "
bolkestein has said the rule hinders the common financial market and has initiated legal action against germany on the issue . the savings banks have also been under fire within germany this week .
one of the country 's leading economics institutes also determined that private investors should be able to buy state-owned savings banks , the financial times deutschland reported , quoting an unpublished report by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- . commissioned by the finance ministry to investigate banking sector perspectives , diw wrote that the state-run savings banks should follow the example of cooperative banks .
diw financial market expert mechthild schrooten said that all credit institutes should by faced with the same rules by 2005 , when public assurances for the state-run banks are largely eliminated .
but that that did n't mean that privatization would necessarily by the result , she told dpa news agency . unfair competition ? german private banks complain that the banking sector is kept from much-needed consolidation and thus earning higher returns , since state-owned savings banks ca n't be privatized .
last year , the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- also said the german sparkasse banks should be privatized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt am main , germany 's banking center but the german savings banks association dsgv criticized the diw report , saying it equates the banking market 's performance and the high profits of private banking firms .
privatizing the savings banks would lead to limited competition and endanger financing for small and medium-sized companies , dsgv executive board member holger berndt said . the german finance ministry is expected to comment on the study in may .
deputy finance minister caio koch-weser is in favor of privatizing the savings banks , according to the financial times deutschland . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sale of state savings bank put on hold the possible sale of the sparkasse -lrb- savings bank -rrb- in the town of stralsund to a private commercial bank has been stopped .

italy 's distribution of former mafia-controlled land and assets to sicilian farmers has not just created jobs and revived the region , but also helped clean up sicily 's notorious gangster image . for most foreigners and even mainland italians , sicily is synonymous with the mafia .
but in recent years the island has been trying to shake off the image that everything is run by organized crime . sicilian authorities are keen to show that large areas of the island are run by honest cooperatives of young farmers and entrepreneurs .
these cooperatives have been allocated millions of dollars worth of land and property that used to be formerly controlled by the mafia . italy first adopted laws on the seizure of financial resources and property from imprisoned mafia bosses over two decades ago .
but it was n't until 1996 that new legislation allowed these confiscated assets to be used " for the good of society " . birthplace of feared mafia bosses nicolo nicolosi , the mayor of corleone , 60 kms south of palermo where land has been confiscated , said the mafia had acquired it illegally .
" these properties were the fruit of money laundering , violence and drug trafficking .
the mafia had taken over the best lands , but now these are being given back to the people . " corleone , a farming community is sicily 's most famous mafia town , largely thanks to a godfather movie trilogy directed by francis ford coppola .
but , nicolosi admitted that corleone 's association with the mafia is not just fiction . " there is no doubt that the most important mafia bosses in the past ten or twenty years were born here .
corleone was the birthplace of the ' boss of bosses ' , toto riina , arrested in 1993 , and of bernardo provenzano , who has been at large for 40 years and is believed to rule the mafia today . " large land holdings were confiscated from riina , now serving numerous life sentences .

schröder said the number of commissioners could be reduced so that all 25 member-states , including germany , would take turns at going without a representative on the commission .
" a compromise could be found in maintaining for a few years the principle where each member-state is represented in the commission with one commissioner " , said the chancellor .
he added that the principle of equal rotation would be introduced .
" that would mean that not only small member states but also the large ones would in the future have to regularly forgo a commissioner " .
the number of commissioners in a future eu is one of the big issues still to be resolved in the negotiations on europe 's constitution .
germany 's concession is important as smaller countries , particularly austria , which have been fighting tooth and nail for one commissioner per member state , have indicated they will only accept a smaller commission so long as rotation is done on an equal basis .
thursday also saw poland and spain , formerly renowned for blocking an advance on the treaty negotiations , reiterate their preparedness to compromise . -lrb- euobserver.com -rrb- www-links the latest on eu-related news more briefs 16.04.2004 -pipe- meps issue commission ultimatum on data transfer to u.s. 15.04.2004 -pipe- turkish cypriot pm rallies vote for un reunification plan 15.04.2004 -pipe- schröder calls for two-speed europe 14.04.2004 -pipe- center-right to dominate in european elections 14.04.2004 -pipe- prodi : prompt lifting of chinese arms embargo unlikely 14.04.2004 -pipe- u.s. urges quick deal on passenger data transfer 13.04.2004 -pipe- eu parliament quizzes new commissioners 13.04.2004 -pipe- threat of chemical attack in europe underestimated , french official says radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

eu officials are reportedly preparing to increase pressure on germany 's state-owned savings and cooperative banks by recommending that it should be easier for private investors to buy so-called sparkassen . the european commission charged a group of specialists with making suggestions for the eu 's banking sector several months ago .
according to a report by the süddeutsche zeitung this week , eu financial experts are concerned the state-backed banks present a hurdle to free competition in the bloc 's internal market . the newspaper said the 21-page study , which has not yet been made public , criticized that in some eu states banking takeovers were prevented by law or through government opposition .
the european commission should work to remove the barriers as soon as possible , the experts concluded .
the eu executive is set to recommend change to the bloc 's financial market in june . action on the part of the commission would be sure to affect germany , since the country 's banking sector is based on a three-pronged system of cooperative , savings and private banks .
the first two are often state backed and control around 60 percent of the market and are virtually impossible to buy by private sector investors . german state governments have to give permission for savings banks to be privatized .
sale of a bank in stralsund , in northern germany , was prevented earlier this year by the local government .

bolkestein has already set his sights on the german savings banks in another matter .
in the rare cases that private investors are allowed to buy them , they are prevented from using the name sparkasse , which means " savings bank . "
bolkestein has said the rule hinders the common financial market and has initiated legal action against germany on the issue . the savings banks have also been under fire within germany this week .
one of the country 's leading economics institutes also determined that private investors should be able to buy state-owned savings banks , the financial times deutschland reported , quoting an unpublished report by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- . commissioned by the finance ministry to investigate banking sector perspectives , diw wrote that the state-run savings banks should follow the example of cooperative banks .
diw financial market expert mechthild schrooten said that all credit institutes should by faced with the same rules by 2005 , when public assurances for the state-run banks are largely eliminated .
but that that did n't mean that privatization would necessarily by the result , she told dpa news agency . unfair competition ? german private banks complain that the banking sector is kept from much-needed consolidation and thus earning higher returns , since state-owned savings banks ca n't be privatized .

italy 's distribution of former mafia-controlled land and assets to sicilian farmers has not just created jobs and revived the region , but also helped clean up sicily 's notorious gangster image . for most foreigners and even mainland italians , sicily is synonymous with the mafia .
but in recent years the island has been trying to shake off the image that everything is run by organized crime . sicilian authorities are keen to show that large areas of the island are run by honest cooperatives of young farmers and entrepreneurs .
these cooperatives have been allocated millions of dollars worth of land and property that used to be formerly controlled by the mafia . italy first adopted laws on the seizure of financial resources and property from imprisoned mafia bosses over two decades ago .
but it was n't until 1996 that new legislation allowed these confiscated assets to be used " for the good of society " . birthplace of feared mafia bosses nicolo nicolosi , the mayor of corleone , 60 kms south of palermo where land has been confiscated , said the mafia had acquired it illegally .
" these properties were the fruit of money laundering , violence and drug trafficking .
the mafia had taken over the best lands , but now these are being given back to the people . " corleone , a farming community is sicily 's most famous mafia town , largely thanks to a godfather movie trilogy directed by francis ford coppola .
but , nicolosi admitted that corleone 's association with the mafia is not just fiction . " there is no doubt that the most important mafia bosses in the past ten or twenty years were born here .
corleone was the birthplace of the ' boss of bosses ' , toto riina , arrested in 1993 , and of bernardo provenzano , who has been at large for 40 years and is believed to rule the mafia today . " large land holdings were confiscated from riina , now serving numerous life sentences .
the powerful mafia boss ordered the 1992 killings of two crusading anti-mafia judges , causing outrage in italy and abroad .
in corleone , riina was feared and respected by many . fear of retaliatory mafia action nicolosi said that when riina 's seized properties were handed over to a cooperative of farmers , locals were concerned there would be deadly repercussions for those entering what was considered to be " sacred territory " . " generally people were convinced that assets seized by the mafia should not be touched .
just like relatives of turncoats were killed by the mafia , people feared that those who did would pay for violating mafia territory . " this was certainly the case in the beginning .
the ' placido rizzotto ' cooperative was assigned 200 hectares of land , partly owned by mafia boss riina .
the members grow wheat which is then turned into what has been labeled " anti-mafia pasta " . francesca massimino , one of the members said the cooperative has had problems .
" the first year we could find no one to provide the machine to harvest the wheat .
the police had to intervene to find a harvester , " he said .
massimino believes the company that had agreed to provide the machine had been threatened . other cooperatives have also faced trouble including discovering that their vines had been cut or experiencing sudden fires .
in one case , two dobermans disappeared from a farm only to be found days later dead in trash cans . giuseppe randazzo , owner of the tempio del monte jato cooperative , which farms the land that once belonged to another infamous mafia boss romualdo agrigento , too said the going had n't been easy .
" the mafia had carried out acts of vandalism .
when we came here in 1998 we found it totally abandoned , destroyed , with walls torn down , vines cut down , pipelines severed , total destruction , " randazzo said . business interests outweigh mafia fear but the fear of the mafia has not cowed down the young sicilian recipients of formerly mafia-controlled land and property .
they have caught on to the business potential offered by the opportunity . the placido rizzotto cooperative will soon be inaugurating their first country-hotels in formerly mafia owned property and , francesca massimino said they have other plans as well . " there are two country-hotels , one is nearly ready .
then there will be a winery , a laboratory for herbs and a riding school , " he said . profits for the cooperative have been growing steadily .
now members can pay themselves a salary as well as workers , equipment and supplies .
whatever is left over gets reinvested . even giuseppe randazzo 's tempio del monte jato cooperative has just opened its first " anti-mafia restaurant . " the cooperative also markets a crispy white wine produced from the grapes of the large vineyard on the estate . " we made this wine and we decided to dedicate it to the child killed by the mafia , " randazzo said referring to a brutal retaliatory act by mafia boss giovanni brusca , when he dunked in a barrel of acid the son of a man who turned in evidence to the state . " the child looks at the tempio del monte jato with hope .
it is a message of hope for our land , " randazzo said . sicily benefiting from scheme dogged defiance of the mafia is now slowly paying off in sicily .
in areas where unemployment is notoriously high and averages 20 percent , dozens of new jobs have been created . mayor nicolosi said that in addition to greater work opportunities , a culture of legality is now spreading among the people .
the project of giving mafia lands to honest cooperatives has diminished people 's fear in the mafia .
" when people realize that the mafia can be beaten and is no longer invincible , then long-term results can be achieved , " nicolosi said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gangsters of the east pose new threats ahead of a new report into corruption in the european union accession countries , fears have been rekindled of the possible escalation of gangster activity infiltrating germany from former soviet states in the east .

but praise for kotti 's multiculturalism is increasingly coupled with concern that such neighborhoods have turned into parallel worlds that operate against the rules of western society .
in these shadow worlds , teenage daughters are kept under lock and key , waiting for the day their parents marry them off to strangers .
rather than attract natives with their unique cultural offerings , they scare them off , increasing mistrust and prejudice .

these cooperatives have been allocated millions of dollars worth of land and property that used to be formerly controlled by the mafia . italy first adopted laws on the seizure of financial resources and property from imprisoned mafia bosses over two decades ago .
but it was n't until 1996 that new legislation allowed these confiscated assets to be used " for the good of society " . birthplace of feared mafia bosses nicolo nicolosi , the mayor of corleone , 60 kms south of palermo where land has been confiscated , said the mafia had acquired it illegally .
" these properties were the fruit of money laundering , violence and drug trafficking .
the mafia had taken over the best lands , but now these are being given back to the people . " corleone , a farming community is sicily 's most famous mafia town , largely thanks to a godfather movie trilogy directed by francis ford coppola .
but , nicolosi admitted that corleone 's association with the mafia is not just fiction . " there is no doubt that the most important mafia bosses in the past ten or twenty years were born here .
corleone was the birthplace of the ' boss of bosses ' , toto riina , arrested in 1993 , and of bernardo provenzano , who has been at large for 40 years and is believed to rule the mafia today . " large land holdings were confiscated from riina , now serving numerous life sentences .
the powerful mafia boss ordered the 1992 killings of two crusading anti-mafia judges , causing outrage in italy and abroad .
in corleone , riina was feared and respected by many . fear of retaliatory mafia action nicolosi said that when riina 's seized properties were handed over to a cooperative of farmers , locals were concerned there would be deadly repercussions for those entering what was considered to be " sacred territory " . " generally people were convinced that assets seized by the mafia should not be touched .
just like relatives of turncoats were killed by the mafia , people feared that those who did would pay for violating mafia territory . " this was certainly the case in the beginning .
the ' placido rizzotto ' cooperative was assigned 200 hectares of land , partly owned by mafia boss riina .
the members grow wheat which is then turned into what has been labeled " anti-mafia pasta " . francesca massimino , one of the members said the cooperative has had problems .
" the first year we could find no one to provide the machine to harvest the wheat .
the police had to intervene to find a harvester , " he said .
massimino believes the company that had agreed to provide the machine had been threatened . other cooperatives have also faced trouble including discovering that their vines had been cut or experiencing sudden fires .
in one case , two dobermans disappeared from a farm only to be found days later dead in trash cans . giuseppe randazzo , owner of the tempio del monte jato cooperative , which farms the land that once belonged to another infamous mafia boss romualdo agrigento , too said the going had n't been easy .
" the mafia had carried out acts of vandalism .
when we came here in 1998 we found it totally abandoned , destroyed , with walls torn down , vines cut down , pipelines severed , total destruction , " randazzo said . business interests outweigh mafia fear but the fear of the mafia has not cowed down the young sicilian recipients of formerly mafia-controlled land and property .
they have caught on to the business potential offered by the opportunity . the placido rizzotto cooperative will soon be inaugurating their first country-hotels in formerly mafia owned property and , francesca massimino said they have other plans as well . " there are two country-hotels , one is nearly ready .

but praise for kotti 's multiculturalism is increasingly coupled with concern that such neighborhoods have turned into parallel worlds that operate against the rules of western society .
in these shadow worlds , teenage daughters are kept under lock and key , waiting for the day their parents marry them off to strangers .
rather than attract natives with their unique cultural offerings , they scare them off , increasing mistrust and prejudice .
dw-world looks at kottbusser tor and profiles a woman who suffered in a forced marriage until finally finding her freedom dw-world.de a wife bound by shame in europe 's closed-off immigrant communities , hundreds of women are forced to marry against their will .

today it is one of immigration .
as the economy began to grow in the 1950s , the country brought in labor immigrants , many coming from greece , italy , turkey and the former yugoslavia .
under the government of former prime minister olof palme , who led sweden several times between 1969 and 1986 , thousands of refugees arrived from chile , south africa and vietnam .
during the balkans crisis of the 1990s , 60,000 fled bosnia and herzegovina for the northern european land .
the country , known as one of europe 's most tolerant , is highly attractive to foreigners : 12 percent of sweden 's population of 9 million are immigrants .
in 1997 , the swedish government adopted an integration policy that focuses on mainstreaming foreign residents - with equal opportunities and civic responsibilities as the starting point .
like britain , the swedes encourage immigrants to preserve some of their cultural heritage in multicultural communities .
part of the effort to bring them into the swedish mainstream is a € 219 million annual budget for programs that include free language courses .
however , sweden 's shift to become an immigrant nation has n't gone without hitches .
in recent years , foreigners in the country have suffered a disproportionately high rate of unemployment , and housing segregation has also proven problematic , according to the swedish institute . sweden is also home to the region 's largest muslim population , with an estimated 350,000 ethnic muslims .
though the highly secular swedish government follows a policy of " colorblind " integration that encourages " equality , freedom of choice and cooperation , " this is often viewed through the lens of a lutheran-dominated society often fails to take into account the differing needs of muslims , a recent report by the european commission concluded .
sweden protects its residents against religious discrimination , but it offers these rights to the individual and not groups .
still , sweden has a very liberal policy of providing funding to private schools approved by the state , including muslim ones .
in the wake of sept .
11 , authorities recorded an increase in violent incidents against muslims and people of arab decent and an uptick in islamaphobic messages from the country 's far-right political parties .
the most-dramatic post-9/11 incident in the country occurred in the southern swedish city of malmö , where arsonists set fire to an islamic school and cultural center . daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

like the u.k. , france is one of the eu 's biggest melting pots .
the largest waves of immigrants in france originated from neighboring italy , portugal and spain as well as its former colonies , including morocco , algeria and tunisia .
like britain , france shares a long history with muslims and other cultures for which french has also been the mother tongue .
it has also traditionally considered itself a country of immigration , and about 6.3 percent of the country 's 58 million population are immigrants .
in recent decades , the inward migration trend has shifted from its direct neighbors in europe to those of northern africa and turkey , significantly increasing france 's muslim population and making it easily the largest in europe with 5 million .
france has a tradition of welcoming immigrants , but the public also expects newcomers to assimilate into the customs and traditions of french society .
accordingly , france does not " recognize differences in culture or religion in the public sphere " as a recent council of europe report poignantly stated . the challenges that strategy poses became apparent in recent years with the painful national debate over the hijab , or muslim headscarf .
this september , headscarves , jewish skullcaps , sikh turbans and any other " overt religious symbols , " including large christian crosses , will be verboten in schools in the strictly secular nation .
foreigners in france face a number of discriminatory hurdles .
chief among them is their exclusion from almost 6 million jobs that non-eu immigrants are banned from holding , including civil service jobs -lrb- including the country 's postal service and railways -rrb- , management positions in the entertainment industry or french newspapers and magazines , many stock market-related jobs and an array of others .
on the other hand , immigrants can apply for naturalized citizenship after five years , and children born in france to immigrant parents may apply when they are 18 , provided they have lived there for at least five years .
the country also launched a green card program in 1998 aimed at drawing highly qualified workers to fill vacant hi-tech jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " muslimaphobia " is on the rise after the 9/11 attacks , the country 's anti-discrimination hotline recorded an upsurge in xenophobic attitudes towards muslims . and beginning in april 2002 , a wave of vandalism and attacks were carried out at muslim mosques and prayer places .
open society researchers have cast some of the blame on the media for inciting " muslimaphobia . "

on friday , the socialist leader managed to close the gap with help from smaller , mainly regional parties holding a total of 19 votes . a day before his election as prime minister , zapatero lay out the direction the new government would take in the coming months .
speaking during a parliamentary debate , zapatero repeated his election promise to withdraw the 1,300 spanish troops currently deployed in iraq if the un does not take control by june 30 . " the situation in iraq is worsening from day to day , " he said .

zapatero also said he planned to visit morocco shortly , as one of his first overseas trips as prime minister .
" morocco demands and deserves preferential treatment and relations that are tailored to bringing about very close ties .
that is what i shall say to the moroccan authorities during my visit in the coming days , " he said .
several of the 18 people detained in connection with the madrid bomb attacks are of moroccan origin .
pro-european focus on the issue of european policy , zapatero indicated that he planned to pursue a strongly pro-european foreign policy and his government would " do everything possible " to reach agreement on the stalled european constitution by june of this year . zapatero added that the european constitution was the " the most stabilizing common element " between the 25 eu members .
" what 's good for europe , is also good for spain , " he said . no to violence against women , yes to gay marriage zapatero also announced far-reaching reforms on the home front .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.04.2004 german state-backed savings banks face uncertain future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's state-run sparkasse banks could be stopped by brussels .
eu officials are reportedly preparing to increase pressure on germany 's state-owned savings and cooperative banks by recommending that it should be easier for private investors to buy so-called sparkassen . the european commission charged a group of specialists with making suggestions for the eu 's banking sector several months ago .
according to a report by the süddeutsche zeitung this week , eu financial experts are concerned the state-backed banks present a hurdle to free competition in the bloc 's internal market . the newspaper said the 21-page study , which has not yet been made public , criticized that in some eu states banking takeovers were prevented by law or through government opposition .
the european commission should work to remove the barriers as soon as possible , the experts concluded .
the eu executive is set to recommend change to the bloc 's financial market in june . action on the part of the commission would be sure to affect germany , since the country 's banking sector is based on a three-pronged system of cooperative , savings and private banks .
the first two are often state backed and control around 60 percent of the market and are virtually impossible to buy by private sector investors . german state governments have to give permission for savings banks to be privatized .
sale of a bank in stralsund , in northern germany , was prevented earlier this year by the local government .
the financially-stricken frankfurt sparkasse is currently awaiting a decision on whether it can be privatized .
germany 's commerzbank is said to be interested in buying the fourth biggest savings bank . savings banks under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frits bolkestein , dutch eu commissioner the study 's finding have reportedly been well received by frits bolkestein -lrb- photo -rrb- , the eu commissioner responsible for the internal market .
bolkestein has already set his sights on the german savings banks in another matter .

according to a report by the süddeutsche zeitung this week , eu financial experts are concerned the state-backed banks present a hurdle to free competition in the bloc 's internal market . the newspaper said the 21-page study , which has not yet been made public , criticized that in some eu states banking takeovers were prevented by law or through government opposition .
the european commission should work to remove the barriers as soon as possible , the experts concluded .
the eu executive is set to recommend change to the bloc 's financial market in june . action on the part of the commission would be sure to affect germany , since the country 's banking sector is based on a three-pronged system of cooperative , savings and private banks .

like the u.k. , france is one of the eu 's biggest melting pots .
the largest waves of immigrants in france originated from neighboring italy , portugal and spain as well as its former colonies , including morocco , algeria and tunisia .
like britain , france shares a long history with muslims and other cultures for which french has also been the mother tongue .
it has also traditionally considered itself a country of immigration , and about 6.3 percent of the country 's 58 million population are immigrants .
in recent decades , the inward migration trend has shifted from its direct neighbors in europe to those of northern africa and turkey , significantly increasing france 's muslim population and making it easily the largest in europe with 5 million .
france has a tradition of welcoming immigrants , but the public also expects newcomers to assimilate into the customs and traditions of french society .
accordingly , france does not " recognize differences in culture or religion in the public sphere " as a recent council of europe report poignantly stated . the challenges that strategy poses became apparent in recent years with the painful national debate over the hijab , or muslim headscarf .
this september , headscarves , jewish skullcaps , sikh turbans and any other " overt religious symbols , " including large christian crosses , will be verboten in schools in the strictly secular nation .
foreigners in france face a number of discriminatory hurdles .
chief among them is their exclusion from almost 6 million jobs that non-eu immigrants are banned from holding , including civil service jobs -lrb- including the country 's postal service and railways -rrb- , management positions in the entertainment industry or french newspapers and magazines , many stock market-related jobs and an array of others .
on the other hand , immigrants can apply for naturalized citizenship after five years , and children born in france to immigrant parents may apply when they are 18 , provided they have lived there for at least five years .
the country also launched a green card program in 1998 aimed at drawing highly qualified workers to fill vacant hi-tech jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " muslimaphobia " is on the rise after the 9/11 attacks , the country 's anti-discrimination hotline recorded an upsurge in xenophobic attitudes towards muslims . and beginning in april 2002 , a wave of vandalism and attacks were carried out at muslim mosques and prayer places .
open society researchers have cast some of the blame on the media for inciting " muslimaphobia . "
the media , it reported in 2002 , aids the trend of associating " islam with immigration , criminality , fanaticism and terrorism , thereby providing a justification for exclusion and religiously motivated discrimination .

like the u.k. , france is one of the eu 's biggest melting pots .
the largest waves of immigrants in france originated from neighboring italy , portugal and spain as well as its former colonies , including morocco , algeria and tunisia .
like britain , france shares a long history with muslims and other cultures for which french has also been the mother tongue .
it has also traditionally considered itself a country of immigration , and about 6.3 percent of the country 's 58 million population are immigrants .
in recent decades , the inward migration trend has shifted from its direct neighbors in europe to those of northern africa and turkey , significantly increasing france 's muslim population and making it easily the largest in europe with 5 million .
france has a tradition of welcoming immigrants , but the public also expects newcomers to assimilate into the customs and traditions of french society .
accordingly , france does not " recognize differences in culture or religion in the public sphere " as a recent council of europe report poignantly stated . the challenges that strategy poses became apparent in recent years with the painful national debate over the hijab , or muslim headscarf .
this september , headscarves , jewish skullcaps , sikh turbans and any other " overt religious symbols , " including large christian crosses , will be verboten in schools in the strictly secular nation .
foreigners in france face a number of discriminatory hurdles .
chief among them is their exclusion from almost 6 million jobs that non-eu immigrants are banned from holding , including civil service jobs -lrb- including the country 's postal service and railways -rrb- , management positions in the entertainment industry or french newspapers and magazines , many stock market-related jobs and an array of others .
on the other hand , immigrants can apply for naturalized citizenship after five years , and children born in france to immigrant parents may apply when they are 18 , provided they have lived there for at least five years .
the country also launched a green card program in 1998 aimed at drawing highly qualified workers to fill vacant hi-tech jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " muslimaphobia " is on the rise after the 9/11 attacks , the country 's anti-discrimination hotline recorded an upsurge in xenophobic attitudes towards muslims . and beginning in april 2002 , a wave of vandalism and attacks were carried out at muslim mosques and prayer places .
open society researchers have cast some of the blame on the media for inciting " muslimaphobia . "
the media , it reported in 2002 , aids the trend of associating " islam with immigration , criminality , fanaticism and terrorism , thereby providing a justification for exclusion and religiously motivated discrimination .

when germany 's leftist daily newspaper " tageszeitung " was founded in april 1979 , skeptics said it would n't last a year .
now , 25 years on , the taz 's own brand of critical , sarcasm-laced journalism is still going strong . there 's no sign of any quarter-life crisis for the taz .
confident that this birthday will be just the first of many milestones , the paper has published its 25th anniversary edition with the date apr.17 , 2029 - the year when the taz would turn 50 .
instead of indulging in nostalgic reflection on the highs and lows of the past 25 years , the paper is keen to show it 's firmly focused on the future . and how does it imagine the world will look in 2029 ?
for one thing , prague will be the capital of europe .
and an 81-year old joschka fischer will have long traded in his post as german foreign minister to become the eu 's president . it 's perhaps typical of a paper that has built its reputation on the ability to provoke to look ahead to its 50th anniversary .
what better way to throw mud in the eyes of those who predicted a lifespan of less than a year when the taz set up shop in 1979 ? different beginnings founded as a collective - a structure that still exists today - the taz was born in a very different germany .
the berlin wall still cut the city in half , the red army faction terrorist organization was still active , and the leftist scene was hotbed of political and ideological debate .

it does n't necessarily have to do with being socialist , or green , or leftist .

some observers say it 's no longer the radical paper of yesteryear , that it 's gone mainstream in an effort to compete with germany 's other liberal dailies .

when germany 's leftist daily newspaper " tageszeitung " was founded in april 1979 , skeptics said it would n't last a year .
now , 25 years on , the taz 's own brand of critical , sarcasm-laced journalism is still going strong . there 's no sign of any quarter-life crisis for the taz .
confident that this birthday will be just the first of many milestones , the paper has published its 25th anniversary edition with the date apr.17 , 2029 - the year when the taz would turn 50 .
instead of indulging in nostalgic reflection on the highs and lows of the past 25 years , the paper is keen to show it 's firmly focused on the future . and how does it imagine the world will look in 2029 ?
for one thing , prague will be the capital of europe .
and an 81-year old joschka fischer will have long traded in his post as german foreign minister to become the eu 's president . it 's perhaps typical of a paper that has built its reputation on the ability to provoke to look ahead to its 50th anniversary .
what better way to throw mud in the eyes of those who predicted a lifespan of less than a year when the taz set up shop in 1979 ? different beginnings founded as a collective - a structure that still exists today - the taz was born in a very different germany .
the berlin wall still cut the city in half , the red army faction terrorist organization was still active , and the leftist scene was hotbed of political and ideological debate . " the biggest miracle was the beginning phase , " said founding member hans-christian ströbele , now a member of parliament from the green party .
it was an " adventure , " putting out a daily paper with a dozen people who had no experience in the newspaper business and no idea about finances .
they astounded themselves when they managed to scrape together an edition each day , " often in the last minute , " ströbele said .

jose luis zapatero was voted in as spain 's prime minister on friday .
he outlined plans to fight terrorism , pursue liberal domestic reforms and a pro-european foreign policy and pull spanish troops out of iraq . a total of 183 lawmakers in the 350-seat congress of deputies voted for jose luis rodriguez zapatero , more than a month after his socialist party swept to a landslide victory in general elections just days after spain 's worst terrorist attack . zapatero 's party won 164 seats in the election , 12 short of a majority .
on friday , the socialist leader managed to close the gap with help from smaller , mainly regional parties holding a total of 19 votes . a day before his election as prime minister , zapatero lay out the direction the new government would take in the coming months .
speaking during a parliamentary debate , zapatero repeated his election promise to withdraw the 1,300 spanish troops currently deployed in iraq if the un does not take control by june 30 . " the situation in iraq is worsening from day to day , " he said .
“ if the united nations does not take over political control and the military command in that country , the spanish troops will come back to be with us , ” zapatero said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george bush , center , british prime minister tony blair , left , and spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar , right , the 43-year-old former lawyer from the castile region made no secret about his plans for an abrupt change in spain 's atlanticist policy , a stance which has won him admiration among the spanish populace . " we must remove spain from the azores photo , " zapatero said , referring to the mid-atlantic summit in march 2003 -lrb- photo -rrb- that brought together u.s. president bush , british prime minister tony blair an spanish prime minister jose maria aznar on the eve of the iraq war . " we must remove spain from the illegal and unjust war it caused , " he stressed . intensifying the fight against terror zapatero , who takes over a country still reeling from the bloodiest terrorist attacks in recent history that killed 191 people in madrid last month -lrb- photo -rrb- , made the fight against terrorism the centerpiece of his speech in parliament on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madrid train bombings " the main objective of the government i preside over will be to wage an all-out war on terrorism , against any terrorism , against all terrorism , " zapatero said . he vowed to place the country 's intelligence and security services under a single , unified command to coordinate the terrorism fight . " our security forces will be better equipped , better coordinated and better informed , " zapatero said referring to the security failures that allowed the madrid train bombings to take place .
zapatero also said he planned to visit morocco shortly , as one of his first overseas trips as prime minister .
" morocco demands and deserves preferential treatment and relations that are tailored to bringing about very close ties .
that is what i shall say to the moroccan authorities during my visit in the coming days , " he said .
several of the 18 people detained in connection with the madrid bomb attacks are of moroccan origin .
pro-european focus on the issue of european policy , zapatero indicated that he planned to pursue a strongly pro-european foreign policy and his government would " do everything possible " to reach agreement on the stalled european constitution by june of this year . zapatero added that the european constitution was the " the most stabilizing common element " between the 25 eu members .
" what 's good for europe , is also good for spain , " he said . no to violence against women , yes to gay marriage zapatero also announced far-reaching reforms on the home front .
he pledged to crack down on violence against women , a scourge which he called spain 's " greatest national disgrace " and to recognize gay marriage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinz friedrich harre kisses his partner reinhard luechow in front of the registry office of hannover , on aug 1 , 2001 . " the moment has finally arrived to end once and for all the intolerable discrimination which many spaniards suffer because of their sexual preferences , " zapatero said .
" homosexuals and transsexuals deserve the same public consideration as heterosexuals , " he said .
" as a result we will modify the civil code to recognize their equal right to marriage with the resulting effects on inheritance , labor rights and social security protection . " the new prime minister also promised a 25 percent increase in government spending on education , research and development , affordable housing for low and middle-income families and a simplification of the tax system as part of program to modernize the economy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain 's socialists win elections anger over the government 's handling of a suspected al qaeda link in thursday 's bombings helped push the socialists back into power .

eu officials are reportedly preparing to increase pressure on germany 's state-owned savings and cooperative banks by recommending that it should be easier for private investors to buy so-called sparkassen . the european commission charged a group of specialists with making suggestions for the eu 's banking sector several months ago .
according to a report by the süddeutsche zeitung this week , eu financial experts are concerned the state-backed banks present a hurdle to free competition in the bloc 's internal market . the newspaper said the 21-page study , which has not yet been made public , criticized that in some eu states banking takeovers were prevented by law or through government opposition .
the european commission should work to remove the barriers as soon as possible , the experts concluded .
the eu executive is set to recommend change to the bloc 's financial market in june . action on the part of the commission would be sure to affect germany , since the country 's banking sector is based on a three-pronged system of cooperative , savings and private banks .
the first two are often state backed and control around 60 percent of the market and are virtually impossible to buy by private sector investors . german state governments have to give permission for savings banks to be privatized .
sale of a bank in stralsund , in northern germany , was prevented earlier this year by the local government .
the financially-stricken frankfurt sparkasse is currently awaiting a decision on whether it can be privatized .
germany 's commerzbank is said to be interested in buying the fourth biggest savings bank . savings banks under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frits bolkestein , dutch eu commissioner the study 's finding have reportedly been well received by frits bolkestein -lrb- photo -rrb- , the eu commissioner responsible for the internal market .
bolkestein has already set his sights on the german savings banks in another matter .
in the rare cases that private investors are allowed to buy them , they are prevented from using the name sparkasse , which means " savings bank . "
bolkestein has said the rule hinders the common financial market and has initiated legal action against germany on the issue . the savings banks have also been under fire within germany this week .
one of the country 's leading economics institutes also determined that private investors should be able to buy state-owned savings banks , the financial times deutschland reported , quoting an unpublished report by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- . commissioned by the finance ministry to investigate banking sector perspectives , diw wrote that the state-run savings banks should follow the example of cooperative banks .
diw financial market expert mechthild schrooten said that all credit institutes should by faced with the same rules by 2005 , when public assurances for the state-run banks are largely eliminated .
but that that did n't mean that privatization would necessarily by the result , she told dpa news agency . unfair competition ? german private banks complain that the banking sector is kept from much-needed consolidation and thus earning higher returns , since state-owned savings banks ca n't be privatized .
last year , the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- also said the german sparkasse banks should be privatized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt am main , germany 's banking center but the german savings banks association dsgv criticized the diw report , saying it equates the banking market 's performance and the high profits of private banking firms .
privatizing the savings banks would lead to limited competition and endanger financing for small and medium-sized companies , dsgv executive board member holger berndt said . the german finance ministry is expected to comment on the study in may .
deputy finance minister caio koch-weser is in favor of privatizing the savings banks , according to the financial times deutschland . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sale of state savings bank put on hold the possible sale of the sparkasse -lrb- savings bank -rrb- in the town of stralsund to a private commercial bank has been stopped .

confident that this birthday will be just the first of many milestones , the paper has published its 25th anniversary edition with the date apr.17 , 2029 - the year when the taz would turn 50 .
instead of indulging in nostalgic reflection on the highs and lows of the past 25 years , the paper is keen to show it 's firmly focused on the future . and how does it imagine the world will look in 2029 ?

like the u.k. , france is one of the eu 's biggest melting pots .
the largest waves of immigrants in france originated from neighboring italy , portugal and spain as well as its former colonies , including morocco , algeria and tunisia .
like britain , france shares a long history with muslims and other cultures for which french has also been the mother tongue .
it has also traditionally considered itself a country of immigration , and about 6.3 percent of the country 's 58 million population are immigrants .
in recent decades , the inward migration trend has shifted from its direct neighbors in europe to those of northern africa and turkey , significantly increasing france 's muslim population and making it easily the largest in europe with 5 million .
france has a tradition of welcoming immigrants , but the public also expects newcomers to assimilate into the customs and traditions of french society .
accordingly , france does not " recognize differences in culture or religion in the public sphere " as a recent council of europe report poignantly stated . the challenges that strategy poses became apparent in recent years with the painful national debate over the hijab , or muslim headscarf .
this september , headscarves , jewish skullcaps , sikh turbans and any other " overt religious symbols , " including large christian crosses , will be verboten in schools in the strictly secular nation .
foreigners in france face a number of discriminatory hurdles .
chief among them is their exclusion from almost 6 million jobs that non-eu immigrants are banned from holding , including civil service jobs -lrb- including the country 's postal service and railways -rrb- , management positions in the entertainment industry or french newspapers and magazines , many stock market-related jobs and an array of others .
on the other hand , immigrants can apply for naturalized citizenship after five years , and children born in france to immigrant parents may apply when they are 18 , provided they have lived there for at least five years .
the country also launched a green card program in 1998 aimed at drawing highly qualified workers to fill vacant hi-tech jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " muslimaphobia " is on the rise after the 9/11 attacks , the country 's anti-discrimination hotline recorded an upsurge in xenophobic attitudes towards muslims . and beginning in april 2002 , a wave of vandalism and attacks were carried out at muslim mosques and prayer places .
open society researchers have cast some of the blame on the media for inciting " muslimaphobia . "
the media , it reported in 2002 , aids the trend of associating " islam with immigration , criminality , fanaticism and terrorism , thereby providing a justification for exclusion and religiously motivated discrimination .

today it is one of immigration .
as the economy began to grow in the 1950s , the country brought in labor immigrants , many coming from greece , italy , turkey and the former yugoslavia .
under the government of former prime minister olof palme , who led sweden several times between 1969 and 1986 , thousands of refugees arrived from chile , south africa and vietnam .
during the balkans crisis of the 1990s , 60,000 fled bosnia and herzegovina for the northern european land .
the country , known as one of europe 's most tolerant , is highly attractive to foreigners : 12 percent of sweden 's population of 9 million are immigrants .
in 1997 , the swedish government adopted an integration policy that focuses on mainstreaming foreign residents - with equal opportunities and civic responsibilities as the starting point .
like britain , the swedes encourage immigrants to preserve some of their cultural heritage in multicultural communities .
part of the effort to bring them into the swedish mainstream is a € 219 million annual budget for programs that include free language courses .
however , sweden 's shift to become an immigrant nation has n't gone without hitches .
in recent years , foreigners in the country have suffered a disproportionately high rate of unemployment , and housing segregation has also proven problematic , according to the swedish institute . sweden is also home to the region 's largest muslim population , with an estimated 350,000 ethnic muslims .
though the highly secular swedish government follows a policy of " colorblind " integration that encourages " equality , freedom of choice and cooperation , " this is often viewed through the lens of a lutheran-dominated society often fails to take into account the differing needs of muslims , a recent report by the european commission concluded .
sweden protects its residents against religious discrimination , but it offers these rights to the individual and not groups .
still , sweden has a very liberal policy of providing funding to private schools approved by the state , including muslim ones .
in the wake of sept .
11 , authorities recorded an increase in violent incidents against muslims and people of arab decent and an uptick in islamaphobic messages from the country 's far-right political parties .
the most-dramatic post-9/11 incident in the country occurred in the southern swedish city of malmö , where arsonists set fire to an islamic school and cultural center . daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

about 2.34 million of its nearly 59 million residents are foreigners .
many of the country 's immigrant residents came from its former colonies , like india and pakistan .
in recent years , there has been large-scale immigration of muslims from the middle east as well as refugees from the balkans .
due to its former ties to the asian subcontinent , a high percentage of its muslim population speaks english .
britain has a comprehensive immigration policy and also bans discrimination - both religious and racial - in important areas like employment , education , housing and welfare .
according to a recent european commission report , britain is soon planning to open its doors to a new wave of immigrants needed to fill jobs in the blue collar labor market . anyone born in the u.k. is automatically a citizen , and naturalization for newcomers is possible after five years .

it has also traditionally considered itself a country of immigration , and about 6.3 percent of the country 's 58 million population are immigrants .
in recent decades , the inward migration trend has shifted from its direct neighbors in europe to those of northern africa and turkey , significantly increasing france 's muslim population and making it easily the largest in europe with 5 million .
france has a tradition of welcoming immigrants , but the public also expects newcomers to assimilate into the customs and traditions of french society .
accordingly , france does not " recognize differences in culture or religion in the public sphere " as a recent council of europe report poignantly stated . the challenges that strategy poses became apparent in recent years with the painful national debate over the hijab , or muslim headscarf .
this september , headscarves , jewish skullcaps , sikh turbans and any other " overt religious symbols , " including large christian crosses , will be verboten in schools in the strictly secular nation .
foreigners in france face a number of discriminatory hurdles .
chief among them is their exclusion from almost 6 million jobs that non-eu immigrants are banned from holding , including civil service jobs -lrb- including the country 's postal service and railways -rrb- , management positions in the entertainment industry or french newspapers and magazines , many stock market-related jobs and an array of others .
on the other hand , immigrants can apply for naturalized citizenship after five years , and children born in france to immigrant parents may apply when they are 18 , provided they have lived there for at least five years .
the country also launched a green card program in 1998 aimed at drawing highly qualified workers to fill vacant hi-tech jobs .

like the u.k. , france is one of the eu 's biggest melting pots .
the largest waves of immigrants in france originated from neighboring italy , portugal and spain as well as its former colonies , including morocco , algeria and tunisia .
like britain , france shares a long history with muslims and other cultures for which french has also been the mother tongue .
it has also traditionally considered itself a country of immigration , and about 6.3 percent of the country 's 58 million population are immigrants .
in recent decades , the inward migration trend has shifted from its direct neighbors in europe to those of northern africa and turkey , significantly increasing france 's muslim population and making it easily the largest in europe with 5 million .
france has a tradition of welcoming immigrants , but the public also expects newcomers to assimilate into the customs and traditions of french society .
accordingly , france does not " recognize differences in culture or religion in the public sphere " as a recent council of europe report poignantly stated . the challenges that strategy poses became apparent in recent years with the painful national debate over the hijab , or muslim headscarf .
this september , headscarves , jewish skullcaps , sikh turbans and any other " overt religious symbols , " including large christian crosses , will be verboten in schools in the strictly secular nation .
foreigners in france face a number of discriminatory hurdles .
chief among them is their exclusion from almost 6 million jobs that non-eu immigrants are banned from holding , including civil service jobs -lrb- including the country 's postal service and railways -rrb- , management positions in the entertainment industry or french newspapers and magazines , many stock market-related jobs and an array of others .
on the other hand , immigrants can apply for naturalized citizenship after five years , and children born in france to immigrant parents may apply when they are 18 , provided they have lived there for at least five years .
the country also launched a green card program in 1998 aimed at drawing highly qualified workers to fill vacant hi-tech jobs .

jose luis zapatero was voted in as spain 's prime minister on friday .
he outlined plans to fight terrorism , pursue liberal domestic reforms and a pro-european foreign policy and pull spanish troops out of iraq . a total of 183 lawmakers in the 350-seat congress of deputies voted for jose luis rodriguez zapatero , more than a month after his socialist party swept to a landslide victory in general elections just days after spain 's worst terrorist attack . zapatero 's party won 164 seats in the election , 12 short of a majority .
on friday , the socialist leader managed to close the gap with help from smaller , mainly regional parties holding a total of 19 votes . a day before his election as prime minister , zapatero lay out the direction the new government would take in the coming months .
speaking during a parliamentary debate , zapatero repeated his election promise to withdraw the 1,300 spanish troops currently deployed in iraq if the un does not take control by june 30 . " the situation in iraq is worsening from day to day , " he said .
“ if the united nations does not take over political control and the military command in that country , the spanish troops will come back to be with us , ” zapatero said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george bush , center , british prime minister tony blair , left , and spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar , right , the 43-year-old former lawyer from the castile region made no secret about his plans for an abrupt change in spain 's atlanticist policy , a stance which has won him admiration among the spanish populace . " we must remove spain from the azores photo , " zapatero said , referring to the mid-atlantic summit in march 2003 -lrb- photo -rrb- that brought together u.s. president bush , british prime minister tony blair an spanish prime minister jose maria aznar on the eve of the iraq war . " we must remove spain from the illegal and unjust war it caused , " he stressed . intensifying the fight against terror zapatero , who takes over a country still reeling from the bloodiest terrorist attacks in recent history that killed 191 people in madrid last month -lrb- photo -rrb- , made the fight against terrorism the centerpiece of his speech in parliament on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madrid train bombings " the main objective of the government i preside over will be to wage an all-out war on terrorism , against any terrorism , against all terrorism , " zapatero said . he vowed to place the country 's intelligence and security services under a single , unified command to coordinate the terrorism fight . " our security forces will be better equipped , better coordinated and better informed , " zapatero said referring to the security failures that allowed the madrid train bombings to take place .
zapatero also said he planned to visit morocco shortly , as one of his first overseas trips as prime minister .
" morocco demands and deserves preferential treatment and relations that are tailored to bringing about very close ties .
that is what i shall say to the moroccan authorities during my visit in the coming days , " he said .
several of the 18 people detained in connection with the madrid bomb attacks are of moroccan origin .
pro-european focus on the issue of european policy , zapatero indicated that he planned to pursue a strongly pro-european foreign policy and his government would " do everything possible " to reach agreement on the stalled european constitution by june of this year . zapatero added that the european constitution was the " the most stabilizing common element " between the 25 eu members .
" what 's good for europe , is also good for spain , " he said . no to violence against women , yes to gay marriage zapatero also announced far-reaching reforms on the home front .
he pledged to crack down on violence against women , a scourge which he called spain 's " greatest national disgrace " and to recognize gay marriage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinz friedrich harre kisses his partner reinhard luechow in front of the registry office of hannover , on aug 1 , 2001 . " the moment has finally arrived to end once and for all the intolerable discrimination which many spaniards suffer because of their sexual preferences , " zapatero said .
" homosexuals and transsexuals deserve the same public consideration as heterosexuals , " he said .
" as a result we will modify the civil code to recognize their equal right to marriage with the resulting effects on inheritance , labor rights and social security protection .

eu officials are reportedly preparing to increase pressure on germany 's state-owned savings and cooperative banks by recommending that it should be easier for private investors to buy so-called sparkassen . the european commission charged a group of specialists with making suggestions for the eu 's banking sector several months ago .
according to a report by the süddeutsche zeitung this week , eu financial experts are concerned the state-backed banks present a hurdle to free competition in the bloc 's internal market . the newspaper said the 21-page study , which has not yet been made public , criticized that in some eu states banking takeovers were prevented by law or through government opposition .
the european commission should work to remove the barriers as soon as possible , the experts concluded .
the eu executive is set to recommend change to the bloc 's financial market in june . action on the part of the commission would be sure to affect germany , since the country 's banking sector is based on a three-pronged system of cooperative , savings and private banks .
the first two are often state backed and control around 60 percent of the market and are virtually impossible to buy by private sector investors . german state governments have to give permission for savings banks to be privatized .

bolkestein has already set his sights on the german savings banks in another matter .
in the rare cases that private investors are allowed to buy them , they are prevented from using the name sparkasse , which means " savings bank . "
bolkestein has said the rule hinders the common financial market and has initiated legal action against germany on the issue . the savings banks have also been under fire within germany this week .
one of the country 's leading economics institutes also determined that private investors should be able to buy state-owned savings banks , the financial times deutschland reported , quoting an unpublished report by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- . commissioned by the finance ministry to investigate banking sector perspectives , diw wrote that the state-run savings banks should follow the example of cooperative banks .

italy 's distribution of former mafia-controlled land and assets to sicilian farmers has not just created jobs and revived the region , but also helped clean up sicily 's notorious gangster image . for most foreigners and even mainland italians , sicily is synonymous with the mafia .
but in recent years the island has been trying to shake off the image that everything is run by organized crime . sicilian authorities are keen to show that large areas of the island are run by honest cooperatives of young farmers and entrepreneurs .
these cooperatives have been allocated millions of dollars worth of land and property that used to be formerly controlled by the mafia . italy first adopted laws on the seizure of financial resources and property from imprisoned mafia bosses over two decades ago .
but it was n't until 1996 that new legislation allowed these confiscated assets to be used " for the good of society " . birthplace of feared mafia bosses nicolo nicolosi , the mayor of corleone , 60 kms south of palermo where land has been confiscated , said the mafia had acquired it illegally .
" these properties were the fruit of money laundering , violence and drug trafficking .
the mafia had taken over the best lands , but now these are being given back to the people . " corleone , a farming community is sicily 's most famous mafia town , largely thanks to a godfather movie trilogy directed by francis ford coppola .
but , nicolosi admitted that corleone 's association with the mafia is not just fiction . " there is no doubt that the most important mafia bosses in the past ten or twenty years were born here .
corleone was the birthplace of the ' boss of bosses ' , toto riina , arrested in 1993 , and of bernardo provenzano , who has been at large for 40 years and is believed to rule the mafia today . " large land holdings were confiscated from riina , now serving numerous life sentences .
the powerful mafia boss ordered the 1992 killings of two crusading anti-mafia judges , causing outrage in italy and abroad .
in corleone , riina was feared and respected by many . fear of retaliatory mafia action nicolosi said that when riina 's seized properties were handed over to a cooperative of farmers , locals were concerned there would be deadly repercussions for those entering what was considered to be " sacred territory " . " generally people were convinced that assets seized by the mafia should not be touched .
just like relatives of turncoats were killed by the mafia , people feared that those who did would pay for violating mafia territory . " this was certainly the case in the beginning .
the ' placido rizzotto ' cooperative was assigned 200 hectares of land , partly owned by mafia boss riina .
the members grow wheat which is then turned into what has been labeled " anti-mafia pasta " . francesca massimino , one of the members said the cooperative has had problems .
" the first year we could find no one to provide the machine to harvest the wheat .
the police had to intervene to find a harvester , " he said .
massimino believes the company that had agreed to provide the machine had been threatened . other cooperatives have also faced trouble including discovering that their vines had been cut or experiencing sudden fires .
in one case , two dobermans disappeared from a farm only to be found days later dead in trash cans . giuseppe randazzo , owner of the tempio del monte jato cooperative , which farms the land that once belonged to another infamous mafia boss romualdo agrigento , too said the going had n't been easy .
" the mafia had carried out acts of vandalism .
when we came here in 1998 we found it totally abandoned , destroyed , with walls torn down , vines cut down , pipelines severed , total destruction , " randazzo said . business interests outweigh mafia fear but the fear of the mafia has not cowed down the young sicilian recipients of formerly mafia-controlled land and property .
they have caught on to the business potential offered by the opportunity . the placido rizzotto cooperative will soon be inaugurating their first country-hotels in formerly mafia owned property and , francesca massimino said they have other plans as well . " there are two country-hotels , one is nearly ready .
then there will be a winery , a laboratory for herbs and a riding school , " he said . profits for the cooperative have been growing steadily .
now members can pay themselves a salary as well as workers , equipment and supplies .
whatever is left over gets reinvested . even giuseppe randazzo 's tempio del monte jato cooperative has just opened its first " anti-mafia restaurant . " the cooperative also markets a crispy white wine produced from the grapes of the large vineyard on the estate . " we made this wine and we decided to dedicate it to the child killed by the mafia , " randazzo said referring to a brutal retaliatory act by mafia boss giovanni brusca , when he dunked in a barrel of acid the son of a man who turned in evidence to the state . " the child looks at the tempio del monte jato with hope .
it is a message of hope for our land , " randazzo said . sicily benefiting from scheme dogged defiance of the mafia is now slowly paying off in sicily .
in areas where unemployment is notoriously high and averages 20 percent , dozens of new jobs have been created . mayor nicolosi said that in addition to greater work opportunities , a culture of legality is now spreading among the people .
the project of giving mafia lands to honest cooperatives has diminished people 's fear in the mafia .
" when people realize that the mafia can be beaten and is no longer invincible , then long-term results can be achieved , " nicolosi said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gangsters of the east pose new threats ahead of a new report into corruption in the european union accession countries , fears have been rekindled of the possible escalation of gangster activity infiltrating germany from former soviet states in the east .

italy 's distribution of former mafia-controlled land and assets to sicilian farmers has not just created jobs and revived the region , but also helped clean up sicily 's notorious gangster image . for most foreigners and even mainland italians , sicily is synonymous with the mafia .
but in recent years the island has been trying to shake off the image that everything is run by organized crime . sicilian authorities are keen to show that large areas of the island are run by honest cooperatives of young farmers and entrepreneurs .
these cooperatives have been allocated millions of dollars worth of land and property that used to be formerly controlled by the mafia . italy first adopted laws on the seizure of financial resources and property from imprisoned mafia bosses over two decades ago .
but it was n't until 1996 that new legislation allowed these confiscated assets to be used " for the good of society " . birthplace of feared mafia bosses nicolo nicolosi , the mayor of corleone , 60 kms south of palermo where land has been confiscated , said the mafia had acquired it illegally .
" these properties were the fruit of money laundering , violence and drug trafficking .
the mafia had taken over the best lands , but now these are being given back to the people . " corleone , a farming community is sicily 's most famous mafia town , largely thanks to a godfather movie trilogy directed by francis ford coppola .
but , nicolosi admitted that corleone 's association with the mafia is not just fiction . " there is no doubt that the most important mafia bosses in the past ten or twenty years were born here .
corleone was the birthplace of the ' boss of bosses ' , toto riina , arrested in 1993 , and of bernardo provenzano , who has been at large for 40 years and is believed to rule the mafia today . " large land holdings were confiscated from riina , now serving numerous life sentences .
the powerful mafia boss ordered the 1992 killings of two crusading anti-mafia judges , causing outrage in italy and abroad .
in corleone , riina was feared and respected by many . fear of retaliatory mafia action nicolosi said that when riina 's seized properties were handed over to a cooperative of farmers , locals were concerned there would be deadly repercussions for those entering what was considered to be " sacred territory " . " generally people were convinced that assets seized by the mafia should not be touched .
just like relatives of turncoats were killed by the mafia , people feared that those who did would pay for violating mafia territory . " this was certainly the case in the beginning .
the ' placido rizzotto ' cooperative was assigned 200 hectares of land , partly owned by mafia boss riina .
the members grow wheat which is then turned into what has been labeled " anti-mafia pasta " . francesca massimino , one of the members said the cooperative has had problems .
" the first year we could find no one to provide the machine to harvest the wheat .
the police had to intervene to find a harvester , " he said .
massimino believes the company that had agreed to provide the machine had been threatened . other cooperatives have also faced trouble including discovering that their vines had been cut or experiencing sudden fires .
in one case , two dobermans disappeared from a farm only to be found days later dead in trash cans . giuseppe randazzo , owner of the tempio del monte jato cooperative , which farms the land that once belonged to another infamous mafia boss romualdo agrigento , too said the going had n't been easy .
" the mafia had carried out acts of vandalism .
when we came here in 1998 we found it totally abandoned , destroyed , with walls torn down , vines cut down , pipelines severed , total destruction , " randazzo said . business interests outweigh mafia fear but the fear of the mafia has not cowed down the young sicilian recipients of formerly mafia-controlled land and property .
they have caught on to the business potential offered by the opportunity . the placido rizzotto cooperative will soon be inaugurating their first country-hotels in formerly mafia owned property and , francesca massimino said they have other plans as well . " there are two country-hotels , one is nearly ready .
then there will be a winery , a laboratory for herbs and a riding school , " he said . profits for the cooperative have been growing steadily .
now members can pay themselves a salary as well as workers , equipment and supplies .
whatever is left over gets reinvested . even giuseppe randazzo 's tempio del monte jato cooperative has just opened its first " anti-mafia restaurant . " the cooperative also markets a crispy white wine produced from the grapes of the large vineyard on the estate . " we made this wine and we decided to dedicate it to the child killed by the mafia , " randazzo said referring to a brutal retaliatory act by mafia boss giovanni brusca , when he dunked in a barrel of acid the son of a man who turned in evidence to the state . " the child looks at the tempio del monte jato with hope .
it is a message of hope for our land , " randazzo said . sicily benefiting from scheme dogged defiance of the mafia is now slowly paying off in sicily .
in areas where unemployment is notoriously high and averages 20 percent , dozens of new jobs have been created . mayor nicolosi said that in addition to greater work opportunities , a culture of legality is now spreading among the people .
the project of giving mafia lands to honest cooperatives has diminished people 's fear in the mafia .

italy 's distribution of former mafia-controlled land and assets to sicilian farmers has not just created jobs and revived the region , but also helped clean up sicily 's notorious gangster image . for most foreigners and even mainland italians , sicily is synonymous with the mafia .
but in recent years the island has been trying to shake off the image that everything is run by organized crime . sicilian authorities are keen to show that large areas of the island are run by honest cooperatives of young farmers and entrepreneurs .
these cooperatives have been allocated millions of dollars worth of land and property that used to be formerly controlled by the mafia . italy first adopted laws on the seizure of financial resources and property from imprisoned mafia bosses over two decades ago .
but it was n't until 1996 that new legislation allowed these confiscated assets to be used " for the good of society " . birthplace of feared mafia bosses nicolo nicolosi , the mayor of corleone , 60 kms south of palermo where land has been confiscated , said the mafia had acquired it illegally .
" these properties were the fruit of money laundering , violence and drug trafficking .
the mafia had taken over the best lands , but now these are being given back to the people . " corleone , a farming community is sicily 's most famous mafia town , largely thanks to a godfather movie trilogy directed by francis ford coppola .
but , nicolosi admitted that corleone 's association with the mafia is not just fiction . " there is no doubt that the most important mafia bosses in the past ten or twenty years were born here .
corleone was the birthplace of the ' boss of bosses ' , toto riina , arrested in 1993 , and of bernardo provenzano , who has been at large for 40 years and is believed to rule the mafia today . " large land holdings were confiscated from riina , now serving numerous life sentences .
the powerful mafia boss ordered the 1992 killings of two crusading anti-mafia judges , causing outrage in italy and abroad .
in corleone , riina was feared and respected by many . fear of retaliatory mafia action nicolosi said that when riina 's seized properties were handed over to a cooperative of farmers , locals were concerned there would be deadly repercussions for those entering what was considered to be " sacred territory " . " generally people were convinced that assets seized by the mafia should not be touched .
just like relatives of turncoats were killed by the mafia , people feared that those who did would pay for violating mafia territory . " this was certainly the case in the beginning .
the ' placido rizzotto ' cooperative was assigned 200 hectares of land , partly owned by mafia boss riina .
the members grow wheat which is then turned into what has been labeled " anti-mafia pasta " . francesca massimino , one of the members said the cooperative has had problems .
" the first year we could find no one to provide the machine to harvest the wheat .
the police had to intervene to find a harvester , " he said .
massimino believes the company that had agreed to provide the machine had been threatened . other cooperatives have also faced trouble including discovering that their vines had been cut or experiencing sudden fires .
in one case , two dobermans disappeared from a farm only to be found days later dead in trash cans . giuseppe randazzo , owner of the tempio del monte jato cooperative , which farms the land that once belonged to another infamous mafia boss romualdo agrigento , too said the going had n't been easy .
" the mafia had carried out acts of vandalism .
when we came here in 1998 we found it totally abandoned , destroyed , with walls torn down , vines cut down , pipelines severed , total destruction , " randazzo said . business interests outweigh mafia fear but the fear of the mafia has not cowed down the young sicilian recipients of formerly mafia-controlled land and property .
they have caught on to the business potential offered by the opportunity . the placido rizzotto cooperative will soon be inaugurating their first country-hotels in formerly mafia owned property and , francesca massimino said they have other plans as well . " there are two country-hotels , one is nearly ready .
then there will be a winery , a laboratory for herbs and a riding school , " he said . profits for the cooperative have been growing steadily .
now members can pay themselves a salary as well as workers , equipment and supplies .
whatever is left over gets reinvested . even giuseppe randazzo 's tempio del monte jato cooperative has just opened its first " anti-mafia restaurant . " the cooperative also markets a crispy white wine produced from the grapes of the large vineyard on the estate . " we made this wine and we decided to dedicate it to the child killed by the mafia , " randazzo said referring to a brutal retaliatory act by mafia boss giovanni brusca , when he dunked in a barrel of acid the son of a man who turned in evidence to the state . " the child looks at the tempio del monte jato with hope .
it is a message of hope for our land , " randazzo said . sicily benefiting from scheme dogged defiance of the mafia is now slowly paying off in sicily .
in areas where unemployment is notoriously high and averages 20 percent , dozens of new jobs have been created . mayor nicolosi said that in addition to greater work opportunities , a culture of legality is now spreading among the people .
the project of giving mafia lands to honest cooperatives has diminished people 's fear in the mafia .
" when people realize that the mafia can be beaten and is no longer invincible , then long-term results can be achieved , " nicolosi said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gangsters of the east pose new threats ahead of a new report into corruption in the european union accession countries , fears have been rekindled of the possible escalation of gangster activity infiltrating germany from former soviet states in the east .

eu officials are reportedly preparing to increase pressure on germany 's state-owned savings and cooperative banks by recommending that it should be easier for private investors to buy so-called sparkassen . the european commission charged a group of specialists with making suggestions for the eu 's banking sector several months ago .
according to a report by the süddeutsche zeitung this week , eu financial experts are concerned the state-backed banks present a hurdle to free competition in the bloc 's internal market . the newspaper said the 21-page study , which has not yet been made public , criticized that in some eu states banking takeovers were prevented by law or through government opposition .
the european commission should work to remove the barriers as soon as possible , the experts concluded .
the eu executive is set to recommend change to the bloc 's financial market in june . action on the part of the commission would be sure to affect germany , since the country 's banking sector is based on a three-pronged system of cooperative , savings and private banks .
the first two are often state backed and control around 60 percent of the market and are virtually impossible to buy by private sector investors . german state governments have to give permission for savings banks to be privatized .
sale of a bank in stralsund , in northern germany , was prevented earlier this year by the local government .
the financially-stricken frankfurt sparkasse is currently awaiting a decision on whether it can be privatized .
germany 's commerzbank is said to be interested in buying the fourth biggest savings bank . savings banks under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frits bolkestein , dutch eu commissioner the study 's finding have reportedly been well received by frits bolkestein -lrb- photo -rrb- , the eu commissioner responsible for the internal market .
bolkestein has already set his sights on the german savings banks in another matter .
in the rare cases that private investors are allowed to buy them , they are prevented from using the name sparkasse , which means " savings bank . "
bolkestein has said the rule hinders the common financial market and has initiated legal action against germany on the issue . the savings banks have also been under fire within germany this week .
one of the country 's leading economics institutes also determined that private investors should be able to buy state-owned savings banks , the financial times deutschland reported , quoting an unpublished report by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- . commissioned by the finance ministry to investigate banking sector perspectives , diw wrote that the state-run savings banks should follow the example of cooperative banks .
diw financial market expert mechthild schrooten said that all credit institutes should by faced with the same rules by 2005 , when public assurances for the state-run banks are largely eliminated .
but that that did n't mean that privatization would necessarily by the result , she told dpa news agency . unfair competition ? german private banks complain that the banking sector is kept from much-needed consolidation and thus earning higher returns , since state-owned savings banks ca n't be privatized .
last year , the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- also said the german sparkasse banks should be privatized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt am main , germany 's banking center but the german savings banks association dsgv criticized the diw report , saying it equates the banking market 's performance and the high profits of private banking firms .
privatizing the savings banks would lead to limited competition and endanger financing for small and medium-sized companies , dsgv executive board member holger berndt said . the german finance ministry is expected to comment on the study in may .

today it is one of immigration .
as the economy began to grow in the 1950s , the country brought in labor immigrants , many coming from greece , italy , turkey and the former yugoslavia .
under the government of former prime minister olof palme , who led sweden several times between 1969 and 1986 , thousands of refugees arrived from chile , south africa and vietnam .
during the balkans crisis of the 1990s , 60,000 fled bosnia and herzegovina for the northern european land .
the country , known as one of europe 's most tolerant , is highly attractive to foreigners : 12 percent of sweden 's population of 9 million are immigrants .
in 1997 , the swedish government adopted an integration policy that focuses on mainstreaming foreign residents - with equal opportunities and civic responsibilities as the starting point .
like britain , the swedes encourage immigrants to preserve some of their cultural heritage in multicultural communities .
part of the effort to bring them into the swedish mainstream is a € 219 million annual budget for programs that include free language courses .
however , sweden 's shift to become an immigrant nation has n't gone without hitches .
in recent years , foreigners in the country have suffered a disproportionately high rate of unemployment , and housing segregation has also proven problematic , according to the swedish institute . sweden is also home to the region 's largest muslim population , with an estimated 350,000 ethnic muslims .
though the highly secular swedish government follows a policy of " colorblind " integration that encourages " equality , freedom of choice and cooperation , " this is often viewed through the lens of a lutheran-dominated society often fails to take into account the differing needs of muslims , a recent report by the european commission concluded .
sweden protects its residents against religious discrimination , but it offers these rights to the individual and not groups .
still , sweden has a very liberal policy of providing funding to private schools approved by the state , including muslim ones .
in the wake of sept .
11 , authorities recorded an increase in violent incidents against muslims and people of arab decent and an uptick in islamaphobic messages from the country 's far-right political parties .
the most-dramatic post-9/11 incident in the country occurred in the southern swedish city of malmö , where arsonists set fire to an islamic school and cultural center . daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

today it is one of immigration .
as the economy began to grow in the 1950s , the country brought in labor immigrants , many coming from greece , italy , turkey and the former yugoslavia .
under the government of former prime minister olof palme , who led sweden several times between 1969 and 1986 , thousands of refugees arrived from chile , south africa and vietnam .
during the balkans crisis of the 1990s , 60,000 fled bosnia and herzegovina for the northern european land .
the country , known as one of europe 's most tolerant , is highly attractive to foreigners : 12 percent of sweden 's population of 9 million are immigrants .
in 1997 , the swedish government adopted an integration policy that focuses on mainstreaming foreign residents - with equal opportunities and civic responsibilities as the starting point .
like britain , the swedes encourage immigrants to preserve some of their cultural heritage in multicultural communities .
part of the effort to bring them into the swedish mainstream is a € 219 million annual budget for programs that include free language courses .
however , sweden 's shift to become an immigrant nation has n't gone without hitches .
in recent years , foreigners in the country have suffered a disproportionately high rate of unemployment , and housing segregation has also proven problematic , according to the swedish institute . sweden is also home to the region 's largest muslim population , with an estimated 350,000 ethnic muslims .
though the highly secular swedish government follows a policy of " colorblind " integration that encourages " equality , freedom of choice and cooperation , " this is often viewed through the lens of a lutheran-dominated society often fails to take into account the differing needs of muslims , a recent report by the european commission concluded .
sweden protects its residents against religious discrimination , but it offers these rights to the individual and not groups .
still , sweden has a very liberal policy of providing funding to private schools approved by the state , including muslim ones .
in the wake of sept .
11 , authorities recorded an increase in violent incidents against muslims and people of arab decent and an uptick in islamaphobic messages from the country 's far-right political parties .
the most-dramatic post-9/11 incident in the country occurred in the southern swedish city of malmö , where arsonists set fire to an islamic school and cultural center . daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

now , 25 years on , the taz 's own brand of critical , sarcasm-laced journalism is still going strong . there 's no sign of any quarter-life crisis for the taz .
confident that this birthday will be just the first of many milestones , the paper has published its 25th anniversary edition with the date apr.17 , 2029 - the year when the taz would turn 50 .
instead of indulging in nostalgic reflection on the highs and lows of the past 25 years , the paper is keen to show it 's firmly focused on the future . and how does it imagine the world will look in 2029 ?

when germany 's leftist daily newspaper " tageszeitung " was founded in april 1979 , skeptics said it would n't last a year .
now , 25 years on , the taz 's own brand of critical , sarcasm-laced journalism is still going strong . there 's no sign of any quarter-life crisis for the taz .
confident that this birthday will be just the first of many milestones , the paper has published its 25th anniversary edition with the date apr.17 , 2029 - the year when the taz would turn 50 .
instead of indulging in nostalgic reflection on the highs and lows of the past 25 years , the paper is keen to show it 's firmly focused on the future . and how does it imagine the world will look in 2029 ?
for one thing , prague will be the capital of europe .
and an 81-year old joschka fischer will have long traded in his post as german foreign minister to become the eu 's president . it 's perhaps typical of a paper that has built its reputation on the ability to provoke to look ahead to its 50th anniversary .
what better way to throw mud in the eyes of those who predicted a lifespan of less than a year when the taz set up shop in 1979 ? different beginnings founded as a collective - a structure that still exists today - the taz was born in a very different germany .
the berlin wall still cut the city in half , the red army faction terrorist organization was still active , and the leftist scene was hotbed of political and ideological debate . " the biggest miracle was the beginning phase , " said founding member hans-christian ströbele , now a member of parliament from the green party .

it does n't necessarily have to do with being socialist , or green , or leftist .

some observers say it 's no longer the radical paper of yesteryear , that it 's gone mainstream in an effort to compete with germany 's other liberal dailies .

like the u.k. , france is one of the eu 's biggest melting pots .
the largest waves of immigrants in france originated from neighboring italy , portugal and spain as well as its former colonies , including morocco , algeria and tunisia .
like britain , france shares a long history with muslims and other cultures for which french has also been the mother tongue .
it has also traditionally considered itself a country of immigration , and about 6.3 percent of the country 's 58 million population are immigrants .
in recent decades , the inward migration trend has shifted from its direct neighbors in europe to those of northern africa and turkey , significantly increasing france 's muslim population and making it easily the largest in europe with 5 million .
france has a tradition of welcoming immigrants , but the public also expects newcomers to assimilate into the customs and traditions of french society .
accordingly , france does not " recognize differences in culture or religion in the public sphere " as a recent council of europe report poignantly stated . the challenges that strategy poses became apparent in recent years with the painful national debate over the hijab , or muslim headscarf .
this september , headscarves , jewish skullcaps , sikh turbans and any other " overt religious symbols , " including large christian crosses , will be verboten in schools in the strictly secular nation .
foreigners in france face a number of discriminatory hurdles .
chief among them is their exclusion from almost 6 million jobs that non-eu immigrants are banned from holding , including civil service jobs -lrb- including the country 's postal service and railways -rrb- , management positions in the entertainment industry or french newspapers and magazines , many stock market-related jobs and an array of others .
on the other hand , immigrants can apply for naturalized citizenship after five years , and children born in france to immigrant parents may apply when they are 18 , provided they have lived there for at least five years .
the country also launched a green card program in 1998 aimed at drawing highly qualified workers to fill vacant hi-tech jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " muslimaphobia " is on the rise after the 9/11 attacks , the country 's anti-discrimination hotline recorded an upsurge in xenophobic attitudes towards muslims . and beginning in april 2002 , a wave of vandalism and attacks were carried out at muslim mosques and prayer places .
open society researchers have cast some of the blame on the media for inciting " muslimaphobia . "
the media , it reported in 2002 , aids the trend of associating " islam with immigration , criminality , fanaticism and terrorism , thereby providing a justification for exclusion and religiously motivated discrimination .

like the u.k. , france is one of the eu 's biggest melting pots .
the largest waves of immigrants in france originated from neighboring italy , portugal and spain as well as its former colonies , including morocco , algeria and tunisia .
like britain , france shares a long history with muslims and other cultures for which french has also been the mother tongue .
it has also traditionally considered itself a country of immigration , and about 6.3 percent of the country 's 58 million population are immigrants .
in recent decades , the inward migration trend has shifted from its direct neighbors in europe to those of northern africa and turkey , significantly increasing france 's muslim population and making it easily the largest in europe with 5 million .
france has a tradition of welcoming immigrants , but the public also expects newcomers to assimilate into the customs and traditions of french society .
accordingly , france does not " recognize differences in culture or religion in the public sphere " as a recent council of europe report poignantly stated . the challenges that strategy poses became apparent in recent years with the painful national debate over the hijab , or muslim headscarf .
this september , headscarves , jewish skullcaps , sikh turbans and any other " overt religious symbols , " including large christian crosses , will be verboten in schools in the strictly secular nation .
foreigners in france face a number of discriminatory hurdles .
chief among them is their exclusion from almost 6 million jobs that non-eu immigrants are banned from holding , including civil service jobs -lrb- including the country 's postal service and railways -rrb- , management positions in the entertainment industry or french newspapers and magazines , many stock market-related jobs and an array of others .
on the other hand , immigrants can apply for naturalized citizenship after five years , and children born in france to immigrant parents may apply when they are 18 , provided they have lived there for at least five years .
the country also launched a green card program in 1998 aimed at drawing highly qualified workers to fill vacant hi-tech jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " muslimaphobia " is on the rise after the 9/11 attacks , the country 's anti-discrimination hotline recorded an upsurge in xenophobic attitudes towards muslims . and beginning in april 2002 , a wave of vandalism and attacks were carried out at muslim mosques and prayer places .
open society researchers have cast some of the blame on the media for inciting " muslimaphobia . "
the media , it reported in 2002 , aids the trend of associating " islam with immigration , criminality , fanaticism and terrorism , thereby providing a justification for exclusion and religiously motivated discrimination .

today it is one of immigration .
as the economy began to grow in the 1950s , the country brought in labor immigrants , many coming from greece , italy , turkey and the former yugoslavia .
under the government of former prime minister olof palme , who led sweden several times between 1969 and 1986 , thousands of refugees arrived from chile , south africa and vietnam .
during the balkans crisis of the 1990s , 60,000 fled bosnia and herzegovina for the northern european land .
the country , known as one of europe 's most tolerant , is highly attractive to foreigners : 12 percent of sweden 's population of 9 million are immigrants .
in 1997 , the swedish government adopted an integration policy that focuses on mainstreaming foreign residents - with equal opportunities and civic responsibilities as the starting point .
like britain , the swedes encourage immigrants to preserve some of their cultural heritage in multicultural communities .
part of the effort to bring them into the swedish mainstream is a € 219 million annual budget for programs that include free language courses .
however , sweden 's shift to become an immigrant nation has n't gone without hitches .
in recent years , foreigners in the country have suffered a disproportionately high rate of unemployment , and housing segregation has also proven problematic , according to the swedish institute . sweden is also home to the region 's largest muslim population , with an estimated 350,000 ethnic muslims .
though the highly secular swedish government follows a policy of " colorblind " integration that encourages " equality , freedom of choice and cooperation , " this is often viewed through the lens of a lutheran-dominated society often fails to take into account the differing needs of muslims , a recent report by the european commission concluded .
sweden protects its residents against religious discrimination , but it offers these rights to the individual and not groups .
still , sweden has a very liberal policy of providing funding to private schools approved by the state , including muslim ones .

eu officials are reportedly preparing to increase pressure on germany 's state-owned savings and cooperative banks by recommending that it should be easier for private investors to buy so-called sparkassen . the european commission charged a group of specialists with making suggestions for the eu 's banking sector several months ago .
according to a report by the süddeutsche zeitung this week , eu financial experts are concerned the state-backed banks present a hurdle to free competition in the bloc 's internal market . the newspaper said the 21-page study , which has not yet been made public , criticized that in some eu states banking takeovers were prevented by law or through government opposition .
the european commission should work to remove the barriers as soon as possible , the experts concluded .
the eu executive is set to recommend change to the bloc 's financial market in june . action on the part of the commission would be sure to affect germany , since the country 's banking sector is based on a three-pronged system of cooperative , savings and private banks .

bolkestein has said the rule hinders the common financial market and has initiated legal action against germany on the issue . the savings banks have also been under fire within germany this week .
one of the country 's leading economics institutes also determined that private investors should be able to buy state-owned savings banks , the financial times deutschland reported , quoting an unpublished report by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- . commissioned by the finance ministry to investigate banking sector perspectives , diw wrote that the state-run savings banks should follow the example of cooperative banks .

eu officials are reportedly preparing to increase pressure on germany 's state-owned savings and cooperative banks by recommending that it should be easier for private investors to buy so-called sparkassen . the european commission charged a group of specialists with making suggestions for the eu 's banking sector several months ago .
according to a report by the süddeutsche zeitung this week , eu financial experts are concerned the state-backed banks present a hurdle to free competition in the bloc 's internal market . the newspaper said the 21-page study , which has not yet been made public , criticized that in some eu states banking takeovers were prevented by law or through government opposition .
the european commission should work to remove the barriers as soon as possible , the experts concluded .
the eu executive is set to recommend change to the bloc 's financial market in june . action on the part of the commission would be sure to affect germany , since the country 's banking sector is based on a three-pronged system of cooperative , savings and private banks .
the first two are often state backed and control around 60 percent of the market and are virtually impossible to buy by private sector investors . german state governments have to give permission for savings banks to be privatized .
sale of a bank in stralsund , in northern germany , was prevented earlier this year by the local government .
the financially-stricken frankfurt sparkasse is currently awaiting a decision on whether it can be privatized .
germany 's commerzbank is said to be interested in buying the fourth biggest savings bank . savings banks under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frits bolkestein , dutch eu commissioner the study 's finding have reportedly been well received by frits bolkestein -lrb- photo -rrb- , the eu commissioner responsible for the internal market .
bolkestein has already set his sights on the german savings banks in another matter .
in the rare cases that private investors are allowed to buy them , they are prevented from using the name sparkasse , which means " savings bank . "
bolkestein has said the rule hinders the common financial market and has initiated legal action against germany on the issue . the savings banks have also been under fire within germany this week .
one of the country 's leading economics institutes also determined that private investors should be able to buy state-owned savings banks , the financial times deutschland reported , quoting an unpublished report by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- . commissioned by the finance ministry to investigate banking sector perspectives , diw wrote that the state-run savings banks should follow the example of cooperative banks .
diw financial market expert mechthild schrooten said that all credit institutes should by faced with the same rules by 2005 , when public assurances for the state-run banks are largely eliminated .
but that that did n't mean that privatization would necessarily by the result , she told dpa news agency . unfair competition ? german private banks complain that the banking sector is kept from much-needed consolidation and thus earning higher returns , since state-owned savings banks ca n't be privatized .
last year , the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- also said the german sparkasse banks should be privatized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt am main , germany 's banking center but the german savings banks association dsgv criticized the diw report , saying it equates the banking market 's performance and the high profits of private banking firms .
privatizing the savings banks would lead to limited competition and endanger financing for small and medium-sized companies , dsgv executive board member holger berndt said . the german finance ministry is expected to comment on the study in may .
deputy finance minister caio koch-weser is in favor of privatizing the savings banks , according to the financial times deutschland . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sale of state savings bank put on hold the possible sale of the sparkasse -lrb- savings bank -rrb- in the town of stralsund to a private commercial bank has been stopped .

italy 's distribution of former mafia-controlled land and assets to sicilian farmers has not just created jobs and revived the region , but also helped clean up sicily 's notorious gangster image . for most foreigners and even mainland italians , sicily is synonymous with the mafia .
but in recent years the island has been trying to shake off the image that everything is run by organized crime . sicilian authorities are keen to show that large areas of the island are run by honest cooperatives of young farmers and entrepreneurs .
these cooperatives have been allocated millions of dollars worth of land and property that used to be formerly controlled by the mafia . italy first adopted laws on the seizure of financial resources and property from imprisoned mafia bosses over two decades ago .
but it was n't until 1996 that new legislation allowed these confiscated assets to be used " for the good of society " . birthplace of feared mafia bosses nicolo nicolosi , the mayor of corleone , 60 kms south of palermo where land has been confiscated , said the mafia had acquired it illegally .
" these properties were the fruit of money laundering , violence and drug trafficking .
the mafia had taken over the best lands , but now these are being given back to the people . " corleone , a farming community is sicily 's most famous mafia town , largely thanks to a godfather movie trilogy directed by francis ford coppola .
but , nicolosi admitted that corleone 's association with the mafia is not just fiction . " there is no doubt that the most important mafia bosses in the past ten or twenty years were born here .
corleone was the birthplace of the ' boss of bosses ' , toto riina , arrested in 1993 , and of bernardo provenzano , who has been at large for 40 years and is believed to rule the mafia today . " large land holdings were confiscated from riina , now serving numerous life sentences .
the powerful mafia boss ordered the 1992 killings of two crusading anti-mafia judges , causing outrage in italy and abroad .
in corleone , riina was feared and respected by many . fear of retaliatory mafia action nicolosi said that when riina 's seized properties were handed over to a cooperative of farmers , locals were concerned there would be deadly repercussions for those entering what was considered to be " sacred territory " . " generally people were convinced that assets seized by the mafia should not be touched .
just like relatives of turncoats were killed by the mafia , people feared that those who did would pay for violating mafia territory . " this was certainly the case in the beginning .
the ' placido rizzotto ' cooperative was assigned 200 hectares of land , partly owned by mafia boss riina .
the members grow wheat which is then turned into what has been labeled " anti-mafia pasta " . francesca massimino , one of the members said the cooperative has had problems .
" the first year we could find no one to provide the machine to harvest the wheat .
the police had to intervene to find a harvester , " he said .
massimino believes the company that had agreed to provide the machine had been threatened . other cooperatives have also faced trouble including discovering that their vines had been cut or experiencing sudden fires .
in one case , two dobermans disappeared from a farm only to be found days later dead in trash cans . giuseppe randazzo , owner of the tempio del monte jato cooperative , which farms the land that once belonged to another infamous mafia boss romualdo agrigento , too said the going had n't been easy .
" the mafia had carried out acts of vandalism .
when we came here in 1998 we found it totally abandoned , destroyed , with walls torn down , vines cut down , pipelines severed , total destruction , " randazzo said . business interests outweigh mafia fear but the fear of the mafia has not cowed down the young sicilian recipients of formerly mafia-controlled land and property .
they have caught on to the business potential offered by the opportunity . the placido rizzotto cooperative will soon be inaugurating their first country-hotels in formerly mafia owned property and , francesca massimino said they have other plans as well . " there are two country-hotels , one is nearly ready .
then there will be a winery , a laboratory for herbs and a riding school , " he said . profits for the cooperative have been growing steadily .
now members can pay themselves a salary as well as workers , equipment and supplies .
whatever is left over gets reinvested . even giuseppe randazzo 's tempio del monte jato cooperative has just opened its first " anti-mafia restaurant . " the cooperative also markets a crispy white wine produced from the grapes of the large vineyard on the estate . " we made this wine and we decided to dedicate it to the child killed by the mafia , " randazzo said referring to a brutal retaliatory act by mafia boss giovanni brusca , when he dunked in a barrel of acid the son of a man who turned in evidence to the state . " the child looks at the tempio del monte jato with hope .
it is a message of hope for our land , " randazzo said . sicily benefiting from scheme dogged defiance of the mafia is now slowly paying off in sicily .
in areas where unemployment is notoriously high and averages 20 percent , dozens of new jobs have been created . mayor nicolosi said that in addition to greater work opportunities , a culture of legality is now spreading among the people .
the project of giving mafia lands to honest cooperatives has diminished people 's fear in the mafia .

italy 's distribution of former mafia-controlled land and assets to sicilian farmers has not just created jobs and revived the region , but also helped clean up sicily 's notorious gangster image . for most foreigners and even mainland italians , sicily is synonymous with the mafia .
but in recent years the island has been trying to shake off the image that everything is run by organized crime . sicilian authorities are keen to show that large areas of the island are run by honest cooperatives of young farmers and entrepreneurs .
these cooperatives have been allocated millions of dollars worth of land and property that used to be formerly controlled by the mafia . italy first adopted laws on the seizure of financial resources and property from imprisoned mafia bosses over two decades ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.04.2004 german state-backed savings banks face uncertain future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's state-run sparkasse banks could be stopped by brussels .
eu officials are reportedly preparing to increase pressure on germany 's state-owned savings and cooperative banks by recommending that it should be easier for private investors to buy so-called sparkassen . the european commission charged a group of specialists with making suggestions for the eu 's banking sector several months ago .
according to a report by the süddeutsche zeitung this week , eu financial experts are concerned the state-backed banks present a hurdle to free competition in the bloc 's internal market . the newspaper said the 21-page study , which has not yet been made public , criticized that in some eu states banking takeovers were prevented by law or through government opposition .
the european commission should work to remove the barriers as soon as possible , the experts concluded .
the eu executive is set to recommend change to the bloc 's financial market in june . action on the part of the commission would be sure to affect germany , since the country 's banking sector is based on a three-pronged system of cooperative , savings and private banks .
the first two are often state backed and control around 60 percent of the market and are virtually impossible to buy by private sector investors . german state governments have to give permission for savings banks to be privatized .
sale of a bank in stralsund , in northern germany , was prevented earlier this year by the local government .
the financially-stricken frankfurt sparkasse is currently awaiting a decision on whether it can be privatized .
germany 's commerzbank is said to be interested in buying the fourth biggest savings bank . savings banks under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frits bolkestein , dutch eu commissioner the study 's finding have reportedly been well received by frits bolkestein -lrb- photo -rrb- , the eu commissioner responsible for the internal market .
bolkestein has already set his sights on the german savings banks in another matter .
in the rare cases that private investors are allowed to buy them , they are prevented from using the name sparkasse , which means " savings bank . "
bolkestein has said the rule hinders the common financial market and has initiated legal action against germany on the issue . the savings banks have also been under fire within germany this week .
one of the country 's leading economics institutes also determined that private investors should be able to buy state-owned savings banks , the financial times deutschland reported , quoting an unpublished report by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- . commissioned by the finance ministry to investigate banking sector perspectives , diw wrote that the state-run savings banks should follow the example of cooperative banks .

eu officials are reportedly preparing to increase pressure on germany 's state-owned savings and cooperative banks by recommending that it should be easier for private investors to buy so-called sparkassen . the european commission charged a group of specialists with making suggestions for the eu 's banking sector several months ago .
according to a report by the süddeutsche zeitung this week , eu financial experts are concerned the state-backed banks present a hurdle to free competition in the bloc 's internal market . the newspaper said the 21-page study , which has not yet been made public , criticized that in some eu states banking takeovers were prevented by law or through government opposition .
the european commission should work to remove the barriers as soon as possible , the experts concluded .
the eu executive is set to recommend change to the bloc 's financial market in june . action on the part of the commission would be sure to affect germany , since the country 's banking sector is based on a three-pronged system of cooperative , savings and private banks .
the first two are often state backed and control around 60 percent of the market and are virtually impossible to buy by private sector investors . german state governments have to give permission for savings banks to be privatized .
sale of a bank in stralsund , in northern germany , was prevented earlier this year by the local government .

bolkestein has already set his sights on the german savings banks in another matter .
in the rare cases that private investors are allowed to buy them , they are prevented from using the name sparkasse , which means " savings bank . "
bolkestein has said the rule hinders the common financial market and has initiated legal action against germany on the issue . the savings banks have also been under fire within germany this week .
one of the country 's leading economics institutes also determined that private investors should be able to buy state-owned savings banks , the financial times deutschland reported , quoting an unpublished report by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- . commissioned by the finance ministry to investigate banking sector perspectives , diw wrote that the state-run savings banks should follow the example of cooperative banks .

italy 's distribution of former mafia-controlled land and assets to sicilian farmers has not just created jobs and revived the region , but also helped clean up sicily 's notorious gangster image . for most foreigners and even mainland italians , sicily is synonymous with the mafia .
but in recent years the island has been trying to shake off the image that everything is run by organized crime . sicilian authorities are keen to show that large areas of the island are run by honest cooperatives of young farmers and entrepreneurs .
these cooperatives have been allocated millions of dollars worth of land and property that used to be formerly controlled by the mafia . italy first adopted laws on the seizure of financial resources and property from imprisoned mafia bosses over two decades ago .
but it was n't until 1996 that new legislation allowed these confiscated assets to be used " for the good of society " . birthplace of feared mafia bosses nicolo nicolosi , the mayor of corleone , 60 kms south of palermo where land has been confiscated , said the mafia had acquired it illegally .
" these properties were the fruit of money laundering , violence and drug trafficking .
the mafia had taken over the best lands , but now these are being given back to the people . " corleone , a farming community is sicily 's most famous mafia town , largely thanks to a godfather movie trilogy directed by francis ford coppola .
but , nicolosi admitted that corleone 's association with the mafia is not just fiction . " there is no doubt that the most important mafia bosses in the past ten or twenty years were born here .
corleone was the birthplace of the ' boss of bosses ' , toto riina , arrested in 1993 , and of bernardo provenzano , who has been at large for 40 years and is believed to rule the mafia today . " large land holdings were confiscated from riina , now serving numerous life sentences .
the powerful mafia boss ordered the 1992 killings of two crusading anti-mafia judges , causing outrage in italy and abroad .
in corleone , riina was feared and respected by many . fear of retaliatory mafia action nicolosi said that when riina 's seized properties were handed over to a cooperative of farmers , locals were concerned there would be deadly repercussions for those entering what was considered to be " sacred territory " . " generally people were convinced that assets seized by the mafia should not be touched .

italy 's distribution of former mafia-controlled land and assets to sicilian farmers has not just created jobs and revived the region , but also helped clean up sicily 's notorious gangster image . for most foreigners and even mainland italians , sicily is synonymous with the mafia .
but in recent years the island has been trying to shake off the image that everything is run by organized crime . sicilian authorities are keen to show that large areas of the island are run by honest cooperatives of young farmers and entrepreneurs .
these cooperatives have been allocated millions of dollars worth of land and property that used to be formerly controlled by the mafia . italy first adopted laws on the seizure of financial resources and property from imprisoned mafia bosses over two decades ago .
but it was n't until 1996 that new legislation allowed these confiscated assets to be used " for the good of society " . birthplace of feared mafia bosses nicolo nicolosi , the mayor of corleone , 60 kms south of palermo where land has been confiscated , said the mafia had acquired it illegally .
" these properties were the fruit of money laundering , violence and drug trafficking .
the mafia had taken over the best lands , but now these are being given back to the people . " corleone , a farming community is sicily 's most famous mafia town , largely thanks to a godfather movie trilogy directed by francis ford coppola .
but , nicolosi admitted that corleone 's association with the mafia is not just fiction . " there is no doubt that the most important mafia bosses in the past ten or twenty years were born here .
corleone was the birthplace of the ' boss of bosses ' , toto riina , arrested in 1993 , and of bernardo provenzano , who has been at large for 40 years and is believed to rule the mafia today . " large land holdings were confiscated from riina , now serving numerous life sentences .
the powerful mafia boss ordered the 1992 killings of two crusading anti-mafia judges , causing outrage in italy and abroad .
in corleone , riina was feared and respected by many . fear of retaliatory mafia action nicolosi said that when riina 's seized properties were handed over to a cooperative of farmers , locals were concerned there would be deadly repercussions for those entering what was considered to be " sacred territory " . " generally people were convinced that assets seized by the mafia should not be touched .

on friday , the socialist leader managed to close the gap with help from smaller , mainly regional parties holding a total of 19 votes . a day before his election as prime minister , zapatero lay out the direction the new government would take in the coming months .
speaking during a parliamentary debate , zapatero repeated his election promise to withdraw the 1,300 spanish troops currently deployed in iraq if the un does not take control by june 30 . " the situation in iraq is worsening from day to day , " he said .

that is what i shall say to the moroccan authorities during my visit in the coming days , " he said .
several of the 18 people detained in connection with the madrid bomb attacks are of moroccan origin .
pro-european focus on the issue of european policy , zapatero indicated that he planned to pursue a strongly pro-european foreign policy and his government would " do everything possible " to reach agreement on the stalled european constitution by june of this year . zapatero added that the european constitution was the " the most stabilizing common element " between the 25 eu members .
" what 's good for europe , is also good for spain , " he said . no to violence against women , yes to gay marriage zapatero also announced far-reaching reforms on the home front .

like the u.k. , france is one of the eu 's biggest melting pots .
the largest waves of immigrants in france originated from neighboring italy , portugal and spain as well as its former colonies , including morocco , algeria and tunisia .
like britain , france shares a long history with muslims and other cultures for which french has also been the mother tongue .
it has also traditionally considered itself a country of immigration , and about 6.3 percent of the country 's 58 million population are immigrants .
in recent decades , the inward migration trend has shifted from its direct neighbors in europe to those of northern africa and turkey , significantly increasing france 's muslim population and making it easily the largest in europe with 5 million .
france has a tradition of welcoming immigrants , but the public also expects newcomers to assimilate into the customs and traditions of french society .
accordingly , france does not " recognize differences in culture or religion in the public sphere " as a recent council of europe report poignantly stated . the challenges that strategy poses became apparent in recent years with the painful national debate over the hijab , or muslim headscarf .
this september , headscarves , jewish skullcaps , sikh turbans and any other " overt religious symbols , " including large christian crosses , will be verboten in schools in the strictly secular nation .
foreigners in france face a number of discriminatory hurdles .
chief among them is their exclusion from almost 6 million jobs that non-eu immigrants are banned from holding , including civil service jobs -lrb- including the country 's postal service and railways -rrb- , management positions in the entertainment industry or french newspapers and magazines , many stock market-related jobs and an array of others .
on the other hand , immigrants can apply for naturalized citizenship after five years , and children born in france to immigrant parents may apply when they are 18 , provided they have lived there for at least five years .
the country also launched a green card program in 1998 aimed at drawing highly qualified workers to fill vacant hi-tech jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " muslimaphobia " is on the rise after the 9/11 attacks , the country 's anti-discrimination hotline recorded an upsurge in xenophobic attitudes towards muslims . and beginning in april 2002 , a wave of vandalism and attacks were carried out at muslim mosques and prayer places .
open society researchers have cast some of the blame on the media for inciting " muslimaphobia . "
the media , it reported in 2002 , aids the trend of associating " islam with immigration , criminality , fanaticism and terrorism , thereby providing a justification for exclusion and religiously motivated discrimination .

like the u.k. , france is one of the eu 's biggest melting pots .
the largest waves of immigrants in france originated from neighboring italy , portugal and spain as well as its former colonies , including morocco , algeria and tunisia .
like britain , france shares a long history with muslims and other cultures for which french has also been the mother tongue .
it has also traditionally considered itself a country of immigration , and about 6.3 percent of the country 's 58 million population are immigrants .
in recent decades , the inward migration trend has shifted from its direct neighbors in europe to those of northern africa and turkey , significantly increasing france 's muslim population and making it easily the largest in europe with 5 million .
france has a tradition of welcoming immigrants , but the public also expects newcomers to assimilate into the customs and traditions of french society .
accordingly , france does not " recognize differences in culture or religion in the public sphere " as a recent council of europe report poignantly stated . the challenges that strategy poses became apparent in recent years with the painful national debate over the hijab , or muslim headscarf .
this september , headscarves , jewish skullcaps , sikh turbans and any other " overt religious symbols , " including large christian crosses , will be verboten in schools in the strictly secular nation .
foreigners in france face a number of discriminatory hurdles .
chief among them is their exclusion from almost 6 million jobs that non-eu immigrants are banned from holding , including civil service jobs -lrb- including the country 's postal service and railways -rrb- , management positions in the entertainment industry or french newspapers and magazines , many stock market-related jobs and an array of others .
on the other hand , immigrants can apply for naturalized citizenship after five years , and children born in france to immigrant parents may apply when they are 18 , provided they have lived there for at least five years .
the country also launched a green card program in 1998 aimed at drawing highly qualified workers to fill vacant hi-tech jobs .

in the third of a series of reports from poland and lithuania , bbc news online looks at how it will keep that promise .
lithuania 's ignalina nuclear plant is keen to play up its environmental credentials .
a video for visitors cuts between workers on the reactor-room floor and cows grazing in nearby fields .
the sky is streaked by a rainbow .
get closer to the reactor buildings , however , and it becomes more evident why the european union wants to shut down the plant that recently celebrated its 20th birthday .
the concrete is showing its age and the ruins of a planned third reactor are still visible after russia 's chernobyl nuclear disaster brought construction to a premature halt .
controversial some environmentalists have called ignalina a disaster waiting to happen because it is based on the same design as the russian plant that exploded in 1986 , belching radioactivity and turning the countryside into a dead zone .
had lithuania not agreed to pull the plug , it probably would not be among the 10 countries joining the eu on 1 may .
according to the timetable agreed with brussels , the first reactor will shut at the end of this year , with the second scheduled for closure by 2010 .
shutting down will cost the best part of 1bn euros and the decision to do so is proving controversial .
fear lithuania relies on ignalina for about 80 % of its power and many of the population see it as a key part of economic independence .
even one reactor can produce enough electricity for domestic use , plus a healthy surplus for export .
viktor sevaldin is ignalina 's russian-born director .
he has worked at the plant since it started and sees himself as a pioneer of the technology that helped build it .
speaking in his cavernous office , his unwillingness to close is evident .
he talks about the safety record and of the dedicated workers who keep a vigilant eye on every dial and counter .
and although he understands why people are worried , he reckons that it is due to fear and ignorance rather than sound science .
employment mr sevaldin is at pains to explain that since the collapse of the soviet union , security and safety have been constantly upgraded with the help of the eu and sweden .
" the irony is that the power plant is at the peak of its safety , " he says .
" for sure , you will not get a repeat of chernobyl here . "
his biggest concern is the fate of the plant 's 3,600 workers , most of whom live in nearby visaginas .
the importance of ignalina on the local economy is evident at the end of the day shift as a convoy of cars and buses head back into the town of almost 35,000 .
it has been like that since the construction of the town was started in 1975 , well into the cold war .
the site , in a dense pine forest , was chosen for its proximity to the railway line that ran from st petersburg and would bring nuclear fuel .
today , visaginas trumpets its green and leafy streets , but as a visitor it is difficult to shake the idea that the trees were originally left more to hide the place than to decorate it .
devastation in a 2001 report , the eu said that there were three possible future scenarios for visaginas .
the first one they called " regeneration , " the second was named " green field " and the third got the chilling title of " town-zombie " .
locals , many of whom came from russia to work at the plant , are convinced that closing it down would kill the city .
there is little other industry in a region that the eu calls underdeveloped even by lithuanian standards .
rising prices and the effects may reach further afield .
according to the same report , the " decommissioning of ignalina will have a direct impact on the whole social-economic situation of the country . "
two hours drive to the south in the lithuanian capital of vilnius , 30-year-old mother of two viktoria valickowa is certain of what it will mean .
" prices will rise and that is a problem , " she says from behind her market stall of amber necklaces and jewellery .
" pay is not very high here . "
bright future the concern among some environmentalists is that lithuania 's politicians may not press too hard to close down ignalina when faced with the stark choice of alienating voters or the eu .
either that , or they will push to replace the aging soviet reactors with a more modern and supposedly safer plant .
that is the outcome that makes most sense to mr sevaldin , and he visibly perks up when explaining the benefits of fission over fossil fuels .
" nuclear power is a very young form of electricity generation , but it has made very great achievements to date , " he says .
" it is something for the future . "
the question facing the eu and lithuania today is how bright they want that future to be .

this week , david cresswell , head of communications at the financial ombudsman service , helps your money reader mark bullivant .
mr bullivant says he has spent months trying to pursue a claim for compensation over an endowment mortgage he purchased in 1985 .
he believes he was mis-sold his policy , which is now also facing a shortfall of up to £ 6,000 .
the bad news for mr bullivant is that his policy was bought through an independent financial adviser -lrb- ifa -rrb- before their sales were regulated .
is there any chance of redress ?
david cresswell writes : unfortunately , mr bullivant took out his policy before the legislation came into effect that required anyone giving financial advice to be authorised to do so .
the date of this legislation - the financial services act - was 29 april 1988 .
do you have a question ?

mr bullivant says he has spent months trying to pursue a claim for compensation over an endowment mortgage he purchased in 1985 .
he believes he was mis-sold his policy , which is now also facing a shortfall of up to £ 6,000 .
the bad news for mr bullivant is that his policy was bought through an independent financial adviser -lrb- ifa -rrb- before their sales were regulated .

david cresswell writes : unfortunately , mr bullivant took out his policy before the legislation came into effect that required anyone giving financial advice to be authorised to do so .

in the third of a series of reports from poland and lithuania , bbc news online looks at how it will keep that promise .
no smoke from a chain reaction lithuania 's ignalina nuclear plant is keen to play up its environmental credentials .
a video for visitors cuts between workers on the reactor-room floor and cows grazing in nearby fields .
the sky is streaked by a rainbow .
get closer to the reactor buildings , however , and it becomes more evident why the european union wants to shut down the plant that recently celebrated its 20th birthday .
the concrete is showing its age and the ruins of a planned third reactor are still visible after russia 's chernobyl nuclear disaster brought construction to a premature halt .
controversial some environmentalists have called ignalina a disaster waiting to happen because it is based on the same design as the russian plant that exploded in 1986 , belching radioactivity and turning the countryside into a dead zone .
had lithuania not agreed to pull the plug , it probably would not be among the 10 countries joining the eu on 1 may .
according to the timetable agreed with brussels , the first reactor will shut at the end of this year , with the second scheduled for closure by 2010 .
shutting down will cost the best part of 1bn euros and the decision to do so is proving controversial .
fear lithuania relies on ignalina for about 80 % of its power and many of the population see it as a key part of economic independence .
even one reactor can produce enough electricity for domestic use , plus a healthy surplus for export .
mr sevaldin wants people to see nuclear power as clean and safe viktor sevaldin is ignalina 's russian-born director .
he has worked at the plant since it started and sees himself as a pioneer of the technology that helped build it .
speaking in his cavernous office , his unwillingness to close is evident .
he talks about the safety record and of the dedicated workers who keep a vigilant eye on every dial and counter .
and although he understands why people are worried , he reckons that it is due to fear and ignorance rather than sound science .
employment mr sevaldin is at pains to explain that since the collapse of the soviet union , security and safety have been constantly upgraded with the help of the eu and sweden .
" the irony is that the power plant is at the peak of its safety , " he says .
" for sure , you will not get a repeat of chernobyl here . "
visaginas is trying to attract investment as well as tourists his biggest concern is the fate of the plant 's 3,600 workers , most of whom live in nearby visaginas .
the importance of ignalina on the local economy is evident at the end of the day shift as a convoy of cars and buses head back into the town of almost 35,000 .
it has been like that since the construction of the town was started in 1975 , well into the cold war .
the site , in a dense pine forest , was chosen for its proximity to the railway line that ran from st petersburg and would bring nuclear fuel .
today , visaginas trumpets its green and leafy streets , but as a visitor it is difficult to shake the idea that the trees were originally left more to hide the place than to decorate it .
devastation in a 2001 report , the eu said that there were three possible future scenarios for visaginas .
the clock is ticking for visaginas the first one they called " regeneration , " the second was named " green field " and the third got the chilling title of " town-zombie " .
locals , many of whom came from russia to work at the plant , are convinced that closing it down would kill the city .
there is little other industry in a region that the eu calls underdeveloped even by lithuanian standards .
rising prices and the effects may reach further afield .
according to the same report , the " decommissioning of ignalina will have a direct impact on the whole social-economic situation of the country . "
two hours drive to the south in the lithuanian capital of vilnius , 30-year-old mother of two viktoria valickowa is certain of what it will mean .
" prices will rise and that is a problem , " she says from behind her market stall of amber necklaces and jewellery .
" pay is not very high here . "
bright future a model of safety and efficiency ?
the concern among some environmentalists is that lithuania 's politicians may not press too hard to close down ignalina when faced with the stark choice of alienating voters or the eu .
either that , or they will push to replace the aging soviet reactors with a more modern and supposedly safer plant .
that is the outcome that makes most sense to mr sevaldin , and he visibly perks up when explaining the benefits of fission over fossil fuels .
" nuclear power is a very young form of electricity generation , but it has made very great achievements to date , " he says .
" it is something for the future . "
the question facing the eu and lithuania today is how bright they want that future to be .

in the third of a series of reports from poland and lithuania , bbc news online looks at how it will keep that promise .
no smoke from a chain reaction lithuania 's ignalina nuclear plant is keen to play up its environmental credentials .
a video for visitors cuts between workers on the reactor-room floor and cows grazing in nearby fields .
the sky is streaked by a rainbow .
get closer to the reactor buildings , however , and it becomes more evident why the european union wants to shut down the plant that recently celebrated its 20th birthday .
the concrete is showing its age and the ruins of a planned third reactor are still visible after russia 's chernobyl nuclear disaster brought construction to a premature halt .
controversial some environmentalists have called ignalina a disaster waiting to happen because it is based on the same design as the russian plant that exploded in 1986 , belching radioactivity and turning the countryside into a dead zone .
had lithuania not agreed to pull the plug , it probably would not be among the 10 countries joining the eu on 1 may .
according to the timetable agreed with brussels , the first reactor will shut at the end of this year , with the second scheduled for closure by 2010 .
shutting down will cost the best part of 1bn euros and the decision to do so is proving controversial .
fear lithuania relies on ignalina for about 80 % of its power and many of the population see it as a key part of economic independence .
even one reactor can produce enough electricity for domestic use , plus a healthy surplus for export .
mr sevaldin wants people to see nuclear power as clean and safe viktor sevaldin is ignalina 's russian-born director .
he has worked at the plant since it started and sees himself as a pioneer of the technology that helped build it .
speaking in his cavernous office , his unwillingness to close is evident .
he talks about the safety record and of the dedicated workers who keep a vigilant eye on every dial and counter .
and although he understands why people are worried , he reckons that it is due to fear and ignorance rather than sound science .
employment mr sevaldin is at pains to explain that since the collapse of the soviet union , security and safety have been constantly upgraded with the help of the eu and sweden .
" the irony is that the power plant is at the peak of its safety , " he says .
" for sure , you will not get a repeat of chernobyl here . "
visaginas is trying to attract investment as well as tourists his biggest concern is the fate of the plant 's 3,600 workers , most of whom live in nearby visaginas .
the importance of ignalina on the local economy is evident at the end of the day shift as a convoy of cars and buses head back into the town of almost 35,000 .
it has been like that since the construction of the town was started in 1975 , well into the cold war .
the site , in a dense pine forest , was chosen for its proximity to the railway line that ran from st petersburg and would bring nuclear fuel .
today , visaginas trumpets its green and leafy streets , but as a visitor it is difficult to shake the idea that the trees were originally left more to hide the place than to decorate it .
devastation in a 2001 report , the eu said that there were three possible future scenarios for visaginas .
the clock is ticking for visaginas the first one they called " regeneration , " the second was named " green field " and the third got the chilling title of " town-zombie " .
locals , many of whom came from russia to work at the plant , are convinced that closing it down would kill the city .
there is little other industry in a region that the eu calls underdeveloped even by lithuanian standards .
rising prices and the effects may reach further afield .
according to the same report , the " decommissioning of ignalina will have a direct impact on the whole social-economic situation of the country . "
two hours drive to the south in the lithuanian capital of vilnius , 30-year-old mother of two viktoria valickowa is certain of what it will mean .
" prices will rise and that is a problem , " she says from behind her market stall of amber necklaces and jewellery .
" pay is not very high here . "
bright future a model of safety and efficiency ?
the concern among some environmentalists is that lithuania 's politicians may not press too hard to close down ignalina when faced with the stark choice of alienating voters or the eu .
either that , or they will push to replace the aging soviet reactors with a more modern and supposedly safer plant .
that is the outcome that makes most sense to mr sevaldin , and he visibly perks up when explaining the benefits of fission over fossil fuels .
" nuclear power is a very young form of electricity generation , but it has made very great achievements to date , " he says .
" it is something for the future . "
the question facing the eu and lithuania today is how bright they want that future to be .

this week , david cresswell , head of communications at the financial ombudsman service , helps your money reader mark bullivant .
mr bullivant says he has spent months trying to pursue a claim for compensation over an endowment mortgage he purchased in 1985 .
he believes he was mis-sold his policy , which is now also facing a shortfall of up to £ 6,000 .
the bad news for mr bullivant is that his policy was bought through an independent financial adviser -lrb- ifa -rrb- before their sales were regulated .
is there any chance of redress ?
david cresswell writes : unfortunately , mr bullivant took out his policy before the legislation came into effect that required anyone giving financial advice to be authorised to do so .
the date of this legislation - the financial services act - was 29 april 1988 .
do you have a question ?
send your questions to our experts the independent service that resolves disputes between consumers and financial firms - the financial ombudsman service - can generally only look at complaints if the event complained about took place after 29 april 1988 .
it can sometimes look at complaints about events that took place before that date , but only if the firm involved formerly belonged to one of the voluntary ombudsman schemes - such as the insurance ombudsman scheme - that the financial ombudsman service has now replaced .
if , as it appears , mr bullivant took advice from an independent adviser before april 1988 , then there are no grounds on which we can help him , as there was no voluntary ombudsman scheme for independent advisers before 29 april 1988 .
ray of hope however , mr bullivant says that the sales commission went to the insurer .
i am unclear what he means by this - but it could be important .
the normal procedure is that the commission goes to the adviser who sold the policy .
endowments : who can help ?
financial ombudsman service -lrb- fos -rrb- : fact sheets on its website -lrb- see link on right -rrb- , or contact its helpline -lrb- 0845 080 1800 -rrb- financial services authority -lrb- fsa -rrb- : fact sheet " your endowment - have you acted yet ? " available on its website -lrb- see link on right -rrb- , or by calling 0845 456 1555 financial services compensation scheme -lrb- fscs -rrb- : information on making a claim and q & as on website -lrb- see link on right -rrb- q & a : endowment shortfalls if , in this case , the commission went to a firm , and not to the individual adviser , then it is possible that the adviser may not have been " independent " after all , but either employed by the insurance company or " tied " to it .
and if the firm was a member of one of the old ombudsman schemes , then we can look at the complaint .
mr bullivant should check the paperwork he received when he bought the policy and see if it makes any reference to the adviser 's relationship to the insurer -lrb- such as " tied agent -lrb- or appointed representative -rrb- of the insurance company " -rrb- .
if he finds such a reference he should contact our consumer helpline - 0845 0801800 - to see if we can help .
if it turns out , after all , that the adviser was completely independent , then i 'm sorry to say that there really is n't any other source of help i can suggest .
in certain cases the financial services compensation scheme can pay out if an authorised firm is unable to meet claims against it , usually because the firm has gone out of business .
however , the financial services compensation scheme would not be able to assist mr bullivant , as the scheme can only look at claims involving firms which were authorised and events which took place after august 1988 .

getting k & r cover depends on satisfying insurers about security arrangements , and training staff in survival skills , which can cost of thousands of pounds for a week-long course .
pay for security guards is climbing amid " increasing competition " for a shrinking pool of ex-soldiers with the right skills , according to a spokesman for special contingency risks , a k & r broker and security consultant .

it seems the bulk of any extra costs on iraq contracts will eventually be shouldered by taxpayers , though companies may suffer financial constraints on the way .

wipro had revenues of $ 1.4bn -lrb- £ 750m -rrb- in the year to march , a 49 % jump on the previous year .
the company attributed the jump not merely to increasing volumes , but to higher prices - a sign that indian tech firms no longer compete only on value .
wipro is one of the most successful firms in the outsourcing sector .
like infosys , it has benefited from a boom in back-office services such as handling customer calls for companies abroad , and has done work for more than half of the companies on the fortune 500 list .
on the up things were not all rosy for wipro in 2003 , however .
the company bemoaned the fall in the us dollar , the currency in which most of its revenue is calculated .
the 49 % jump in dollar revenues translated into only a one-third increase in rupee terms .
but analysts said the wipro figures helped dispel lingering concerns that the indian hi-tech sector could be slowing down .
" five it companies have declared results and given strong forecasts on growth prospects , " said kaushik poddar of kb capital markets .
" this clearly heralds a better future for the sector . "
india 's software exporters are forecast to achieve a revenue total of $ 13bn for 2003 .
india 's national association of software and service companies has predicted exports to grow by 30 % annually .

the ground breaking superwasp initiative is being launched by a team of astronomers at an observatory in the canary islands on friday .
the programme , which involves a network of cameras around the world , will measure the brightness of 50 million stars every night .
the prototype wasp camera was developed at queen 's university , belfast .
dr don pollacco of the university 's astorphysics and planetary science division built the £ 400,000 camera .
" while the construction and initial commissioning phases of the facility have taken only nine months , superwasp represents the culmination of many years work from astronomers within the wasp consortium , " said dr pollacco .
superwasp is the most ambitious project of its kind anywhere in the world dr don pollacco queen 's university belfast one of the main features of the project is its ccd cameras which were produced in belfast and can operate in conditions of very low light .
the instrument , which is now entering its operational phase , will eventually be capable of running under robotic control .
it is currently being stored in a customised building at roque de los muchachos observatory on la palma , and is operated by the canary islands institute of astrophysics .
" superwasp has a novel optical design comprising up to eight scientific cameras , each resembling in operation a household digital camera , and collectively attached to a conventional telescope mount , " said dr pollacco .
" its field of view is some 2,000 times greater than a conventional astronomical telescope .
" data from superwasp will lead to exciting progress in many areas of astronomy , ranging from the discovery of planets around nearby stars to the early detection of other classes of variable objects such as supernovae in distant galaxies .
" only about 100 extra-solar planets are currently known , and many questions about their formation and evolution remain unanswered due to the lack of observational data .
this situation is expected to improve dramatically as superwasp produces scientific results .
" superwasp is the most ambitious project of its kind anywhere in the world .
" its extremely wide field of view , combined with its ability to measure brightness very precisely , allows it to view large areas of the sky and accurately monitor the brightness of hundreds of thousands of stars . "
the project has received funding from queen 's university , the particle physics and astronomy research council - the uk 's strategic science investment agency - and the open university .

" its field of view is some 2,000 times greater than a conventional astronomical telescope .
" data from superwasp will lead to exciting progress in many areas of astronomy , ranging from the discovery of planets around nearby stars to the early detection of other classes of variable objects such as supernovae in distant galaxies .
" only about 100 extra-solar planets are currently known , and many questions about their formation and evolution remain unanswered due to the lack of observational data .
this situation is expected to improve dramatically as superwasp produces scientific results .
" superwasp is the most ambitious project of its kind anywhere in the world .
" its extremely wide field of view , combined with its ability to measure brightness very precisely , allows it to view large areas of the sky and accurately monitor the brightness of hundreds of thousands of stars . "
the project has received funding from queen 's university , the particle physics and astronomy research council - the uk 's strategic science investment agency - and the open university .
