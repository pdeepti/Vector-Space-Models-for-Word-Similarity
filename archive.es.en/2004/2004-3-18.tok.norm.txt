a day after serbs and ethnic albanians clashed in kosovo , the united states and britain revealed they would send reinforcements to bolster the nato force struggling to restore calm in the region . the united states and britain are sending extra troops to kosovo as part of the nato effort to quell unrest in the mainly ethnic albanian serbian province , where violence has killed 22 people in the past 24 hours . " we are continuing to monitor the situation closely .
we are working with nato to deploy additional forces as a precaution .
one u.s. company is en route as part of a 350-strong nato force , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan told reporters traveling to kentucky with u.s. president george w. bush .
" we continue to call on all groups to end the violence and refrain from violence . " britain also dispatched a force of 750 rapid reaction troops to kosovo as nato officials revealed that up to 1,000 extra soldiers could be dispatched to kosovo to bolster its 17,000 strong force after it emerged that 35 nato troops had been injured in the violence . nato 's top military commander in europe , u.s. general james jones , expressed concern about the flare-up .
" i call on the leaders of both sides of the conflict to take decisive action to control immediately their citizens and return to the rule of law , " he said , describing the extra troop deployments as a " prudent reinforcement . "
violence flared on wednesday as the un-administered serbian province of kosovo became embroiled in some of the worst outpourings of violence between ethnic albanians and serbs in three years .
the conflict broke out early wednesday morning amid reports that serbs in a village near kosovska mitrovica set a dog on a group of ethnic albanian boys , forcing them to flee into an icy river where they drowned .
after authorities recovered the bodies , kosovo-albanians and serbs faced off against each other near a bridge over the ibar river that divides the city - long a flashpoint of ethnic tensions - and traded insults , threw rocks and charged at each other several times before gunfire broke out .
nato-led peacekeepers and rumanian special police units in riot gear moved in , firing tear gas , rubber bullets and stun grenades to stop ethnic albanians from rushing across the bridge toward the serb side of the city .
official reports said six ethnic albanians and two serbs were killed in the clash in kosovska mitrovica .
seven police officers and 11 french kfor soldiers were also injured .
flashpoint of ethnic tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kosovo police officer stands guard near damaged cars and apartments in a mainly serb neighborhood in the kosovo capital pristina .
with emotions running high in the volatile region , the conflict quickly fanned out , spilling over into other towns where serb homes , churches and cars were set on fire as ethnic albanians sought revenge .
in the central kosovo town of lipljan , four serbs were killed late wednesday and three others died in the eastern town of gnjilane as nato and un troops struggled to stop the violence .
but during the course of the day , events became too much for the international peacekeepers to contain as ethnic albanians rushed kfor checkpoints established to protect serb enclaves , and un vehicles were reportedly torched in the capital pristina , according to beta news agency .
several medieval serb orthodox churches and monasteries were also allegedly set ablaze in central and eastern kosovo .
serbs demand retaliation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters celebrate in front of a burning mosque after a fire set by protesters took hold in the southern serbian town of nis .
meanwhile in belgrade , the capital of serbia-montenegro , demonstrators set the city 's 17th century mosque on fire after clashing with police trying to guard the building .
the angry mob demanded that the serbian government act to protect their orthodox christian kin from attacks by the primarily muslim kosovo-albanians .
a second mosque was torched in the southern serbian town of nis .
news reports from belgrade said more than 10,000 people rallied outside the serbian government building blocking main streets in the city center .
chanting , " we 'll go to kosovo " and " serbia rise up , " they demanded their leadership take action .
prime minister vojislav kostunica of serbia , to which kosovo belongs , appealed to his countrymen for an end to the violence and condemned what he called albanian terrorism .
" the events ... demonstrate the true nature of albanian separatism , its violent and terrorist character , " he said after an emergency cabinet meeting .
nato and un respond in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer called on both serbs and ethnic albanians to remain calm .
" i urge all ethnic communities in kosovska mitrovica and in the rest of kosovo to avoid further escalation , to act with calm and to refrain from demonstrations and roadblocks , " he said in a statement .
un secretary general kofi annan urged all parties to halt the violence , " which jeopardizes the stability of kosovo and the security of all its people . "
international troops have been in the region since 1999 when 78 days of nato bombing forced serbia to end its crackdown on separatists from kosovo 's ethnic albanians and brought an end to the conflict .
there are currently 17,000 kfor troops and 10,000 un and local police patrolling the province .
despite their significant presence , ethnic violence has repeatedly erupted , but wednesday 's outpouring was the bloodiest in the last three years and demonstrated the failure of international efforts to squelch ethnic hatreds and set the province on the path of reconciliation . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : damage control in kosovo at least 17 people were killed in riots in kosovo on wednesday .
serbs and albanians have yet again spiralled into conflict , raising the question of what has really changed since the nato-led war against serbia in 1999 .

a day after serbs and ethnic albanians clashed in kosovo , the united states and britain revealed they would send reinforcements to bolster the nato force struggling to restore calm in the region . the united states and britain are sending extra troops to kosovo as part of the nato effort to quell unrest in the mainly ethnic albanian serbian province , where violence has killed 22 people in the past 24 hours . " we are continuing to monitor the situation closely .
we are working with nato to deploy additional forces as a precaution .
one u.s. company is en route as part of a 350-strong nato force , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan told reporters traveling to kentucky with u.s. president george w. bush .
" we continue to call on all groups to end the violence and refrain from violence . " britain also dispatched a force of 750 rapid reaction troops to kosovo as nato officials revealed that up to 1,000 extra soldiers could be dispatched to kosovo to bolster its 17,000 strong force after it emerged that 35 nato troops had been injured in the violence . nato 's top military commander in europe , u.s. general james jones , expressed concern about the flare-up .
" i call on the leaders of both sides of the conflict to take decisive action to control immediately their citizens and return to the rule of law , " he said , describing the extra troop deployments as a " prudent reinforcement . "
violence flared on wednesday as the un-administered serbian province of kosovo became embroiled in some of the worst outpourings of violence between ethnic albanians and serbs in three years .
the conflict broke out early wednesday morning amid reports that serbs in a village near kosovska mitrovica set a dog on a group of ethnic albanian boys , forcing them to flee into an icy river where they drowned .
after authorities recovered the bodies , kosovo-albanians and serbs faced off against each other near a bridge over the ibar river that divides the city - long a flashpoint of ethnic tensions - and traded insults , threw rocks and charged at each other several times before gunfire broke out .
nato-led peacekeepers and rumanian special police units in riot gear moved in , firing tear gas , rubber bullets and stun grenades to stop ethnic albanians from rushing across the bridge toward the serb side of the city .
official reports said six ethnic albanians and two serbs were killed in the clash in kosovska mitrovica .
seven police officers and 11 french kfor soldiers were also injured .
flashpoint of ethnic tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kosovo police officer stands guard near damaged cars and apartments in a mainly serb neighborhood in the kosovo capital pristina .
with emotions running high in the volatile region , the conflict quickly fanned out , spilling over into other towns where serb homes , churches and cars were set on fire as ethnic albanians sought revenge .
in the central kosovo town of lipljan , four serbs were killed late wednesday and three others died in the eastern town of gnjilane as nato and un troops struggled to stop the violence .
but during the course of the day , events became too much for the international peacekeepers to contain as ethnic albanians rushed kfor checkpoints established to protect serb enclaves , and un vehicles were reportedly torched in the capital pristina , according to beta news agency .
several medieval serb orthodox churches and monasteries were also allegedly set ablaze in central and eastern kosovo .

meanwhile in belgrade , the capital of serbia-montenegro , demonstrators set the city 's 17th century mosque on fire after clashing with police trying to guard the building .
the angry mob demanded that the serbian government act to protect their orthodox christian kin from attacks by the primarily muslim kosovo-albanians .
a second mosque was torched in the southern serbian town of nis .
news reports from belgrade said more than 10,000 people rallied outside the serbian government building blocking main streets in the city center .
chanting , " we 'll go to kosovo " and " serbia rise up , " they demanded their leadership take action .
prime minister vojislav kostunica of serbia , to which kosovo belongs , appealed to his countrymen for an end to the violence and condemned what he called albanian terrorism .
" the events ... demonstrate the true nature of albanian separatism , its violent and terrorist character , " he said after an emergency cabinet meeting .
nato and un respond in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer called on both serbs and ethnic albanians to remain calm .
" i urge all ethnic communities in kosovska mitrovica and in the rest of kosovo to avoid further escalation , to act with calm and to refrain from demonstrations and roadblocks , " he said in a statement .
un secretary general kofi annan urged all parties to halt the violence , " which jeopardizes the stability of kosovo and the security of all its people . "
international troops have been in the region since 1999 when 78 days of nato bombing forced serbia to end its crackdown on separatists from kosovo 's ethnic albanians and brought an end to the conflict .
there are currently 17,000 kfor troops and 10,000 un and local police patrolling the province .
despite their significant presence , ethnic violence has repeatedly erupted , but wednesday 's outpouring was the bloodiest in the last three years and demonstrated the failure of international efforts to squelch ethnic hatreds and set the province on the path of reconciliation . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : damage control in kosovo at least 17 people were killed in riots in kosovo on wednesday .
serbs and albanians have yet again spiralled into conflict , raising the question of what has really changed since the nato-led war against serbia in 1999 .

the proposals , drawn up by france , germany , the uk , sweden , austria and the netherlands , would limit eu funds for 2007 to 2013 to one percent of gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- , rather than 1.27 percent of gni .
but budget commissioner michaele schreyer on thursday described the idea as " completely untenable . "
speaking before the budget committee in the european parliament , she warned that the proposals would mean an actual spending cut of ten percent and said , " we could n't continue with european integration " in this scenario .
" you would have less europe " , she continued , " and the commission is of the opinion that we have to say ' absolutely no ' to less europe . "
together with five other commissioners , schreyer defends plans to increase the money made available b eu members states for further union projects from 133 billion euro in 2007 to 158 billion in 2013 .
pointing to sharp rises in spending on justice and home affairs issues , the commissioner for this area , antonio vitorino said , " i believe this brings europe closer to its citizens ... it is quite clear that this is an area where operational responses will be needed after 2007 . "
trade commissioner pascal lamy justified the spending on external relations by saying , " the eu is only important if it can act outside the union . "
but the european commission 's proposals need to be agreed unanimously by member states and bitter fights are in the offing .
with the commission standing firm on their proposals and the powerful " group of six " equally unshakeable , the debate is already off on a difficult start .

speaking before the budget committee in the european parliament , she warned that the proposals would mean an actual spending cut of ten percent and said , " we could n't continue with european integration " in this scenario .
" you would have less europe " , she continued , " and the commission is of the opinion that we have to say ' absolutely no ' to less europe . "
together with five other commissioners , schreyer defends plans to increase the money made available b eu members states for further union projects from 133 billion euro in 2007 to 158 billion in 2013 .
pointing to sharp rises in spending on justice and home affairs issues , the commissioner for this area , antonio vitorino said , " i believe this brings europe closer to its citizens ... it is quite clear that this is an area where operational responses will be needed after 2007 . "
trade commissioner pascal lamy justified the spending on external relations by saying , " the eu is only important if it can act outside the union . "
but the european commission 's proposals need to be agreed unanimously by member states and bitter fights are in the offing .
with the commission standing firm on their proposals and the powerful " group of six " equally unshakeable , the debate is already off on a difficult start .

federal and regional german politicians are working on plans to overhaul the country 's domestic intelligence service to be better able to combat terrorism and avoid attacks similar to the madrid bombings last week . presently , germany 's domestic intelligence agency , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , is split among 16 different bureaus in each of the country 's federal states .
long considered by some security experts as inefficient and unwieldy , the deadly terrorist attacks in spain have increased pressure to overhaul its structure . " there is more openness than before regarding the question whether the smaller state offices could find new ways to cooperate , " chancellery official frank-walter steinmeier told the financial times deutschland on wednesday .
" if the states are prepared to give up competencies then its a suggestion that can be discussed . " although some conservative politicians are calling for completely abolishing the state offices in favor of a centralized federal authority , it 's more likely that they will be folded into four or more regional departments .
there are also proposals to merge germany 's federal police -lrb- bka -rrb- with border control and customs services . " germany 's fragmented system dates back to the cold war when fighting domestic militants was the priority , " said frank umbach from the german council on foreign relations , according to the reuters news agency .
" now we have to deal with international terrorism . " affordable experts some of the largest states like north-rhine-westphalia and bavaria remain keen to keep their bfv bureaus in tact , but many smaller and poorer states hope greater cooperation would make it easier to afford expensive equipment or specialized personnel such as arabic experts . although germany opposed the u.s.-led war in iraq , few security experts doubt that the country is a target for islamic extremists .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.03.2004 opinion : damage control in kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke billows from serbian orthodox church at least 17 people were killed in riots in kosovo on wednesday .
serbs and albanians have yet again spiralled into conflict , raising the question of what has really changed since the nato-led war against serbia in 1999 . overnight , the situation in kosovo has escalated , evoking memories of 1999 .
back then , nato decided to put an end to the persistent violence through air strikes .
an international peacekeeping force was deployed and kosovo was placed under a united nations mandate .
five years on , the question of the future status of kosovo remains unresolved .
in the eyes of albanians , kosovo should be made independent ; and in the view of serbs , it should remain part of a federation with serbia and montenegro .
the first important talks between the two sides have gotten underway in recent days to discuss important questions of principle , like the fate of missing people and how to ensure steady energy supplies in the region .
the international military presence , u.n. police and local security forces have ensured a certain level of peace .
but the latest violence is n't isolated to the disputed city of kosovska mitrovica , but has spread simultaneously to a number of places across kosovo following the circulation of unconfirmed reports about the violent deaths of albanian children .
additionally , serb extremists also set fire to mosques in belgrade and nis .
conflict also erupted between albanians and serbs during protests across the country .
kfor soldiers and un police were also attacked as the chaos spread .
since the end of the 1999 war , such incidents have happened with increasing regularity .
but this time the violence was loaded with such intensity that it should have sounded a sharp alarm in the international community - for this time the turbulence is escalating almost simultaneously in many places in kosovo and it is encroaching on serbia and montenegro .
an even worse suspicion is now arising : was this a directed escalation of violence ?
was it orchestrated by extremist groups on both sides who have been waiting for the right pretext to fuel the conflict with all of their power just days before the anniversary of the kosovo war ?
kosovo no longer dominates the headlines in the international press , but that does n't mean things have changed for the better . democratic structures and a culture of dialog have not yet developed .
and the cause of the current conflict - the political battle over the future of kosovo - has been put off .
the international community is hoping that the situation will simmer down further so that a solution to the political issues can be settled more easily .
but the contrary appears to be the case : the postponement of the status question is engendering bitterness on all sides of the debate . the political environment has also changed .
serbia now has a new nationalist conservative government that is being tolerated by milosevic 's socialists .
it has left no doubt that it is unwilling to compromise on the status question .
meanwhile , the confidence of albanians in kosovo has increased and the un administration has transferred to them some competencies .
the kosovars have stood firm on their position for some time now , too : the future of kosovo lies in independence and there wo n't and ca n't be any compromise with belgrade .
an agreement on the future of kosovo remains elusive even now , five years after the last bombs were dropped .
the latest problems show that even a mere spark is enough to set barricades and houses of worship ablaze .
that 's how it was in 1999 and that 's how it is again today .
kosovo is still far away from a peaceful future .
and if the serbs and albanians are unwilling to compromise , then there 's little more the international community can do than merely control the damage .
thus , sovereignty remains a pipe dream for serbs and albanians . bernd johann -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato sends reinforcements to kosovo a day after serbs and ethnic albanians clashed in kosovo , the united states and britain revealed that they would send reinforcements to bolster the nato force struggling to return the region to calm .

serbs and albanians have yet again spiralled into conflict , raising the question of what has really changed since the nato-led war against serbia in 1999 . overnight , the situation in kosovo has escalated , evoking memories of 1999 .
back then , nato decided to put an end to the persistent violence through air strikes .
an international peacekeeping force was deployed and kosovo was placed under a united nations mandate .
five years on , the question of the future status of kosovo remains unresolved .
in the eyes of albanians , kosovo should be made independent ; and in the view of serbs , it should remain part of a federation with serbia and montenegro .
the first important talks between the two sides have gotten underway in recent days to discuss important questions of principle , like the fate of missing people and how to ensure steady energy supplies in the region .
the international military presence , u.n. police and local security forces have ensured a certain level of peace .
but the latest violence is n't isolated to the disputed city of kosovska mitrovica , but has spread simultaneously to a number of places across kosovo following the circulation of unconfirmed reports about the violent deaths of albanian children .
additionally , serb extremists also set fire to mosques in belgrade and nis .
conflict also erupted between albanians and serbs during protests across the country .
kfor soldiers and un police were also attacked as the chaos spread .
since the end of the 1999 war , such incidents have happened with increasing regularity .
but this time the violence was loaded with such intensity that it should have sounded a sharp alarm in the international community - for this time the turbulence is escalating almost simultaneously in many places in kosovo and it is encroaching on serbia and montenegro .
an even worse suspicion is now arising : was this a directed escalation of violence ?
was it orchestrated by extremist groups on both sides who have been waiting for the right pretext to fuel the conflict with all of their power just days before the anniversary of the kosovo war ?
kosovo no longer dominates the headlines in the international press , but that does n't mean things have changed for the better . democratic structures and a culture of dialog have not yet developed .
and the cause of the current conflict - the political battle over the future of kosovo - has been put off .
the international community is hoping that the situation will simmer down further so that a solution to the political issues can be settled more easily .
but the contrary appears to be the case : the postponement of the status question is engendering bitterness on all sides of the debate . the political environment has also changed .
serbia now has a new nationalist conservative government that is being tolerated by milosevic 's socialists .
it has left no doubt that it is unwilling to compromise on the status question .
meanwhile , the confidence of albanians in kosovo has increased and the un administration has transferred to them some competencies .
the kosovars have stood firm on their position for some time now , too : the future of kosovo lies in independence and there wo n't and ca n't be any compromise with belgrade .
an agreement on the future of kosovo remains elusive even now , five years after the last bombs were dropped .
the latest problems show that even a mere spark is enough to set barricades and houses of worship ablaze .
that 's how it was in 1999 and that 's how it is again today .
kosovo is still far away from a peaceful future .
and if the serbs and albanians are unwilling to compromise , then there 's little more the international community can do than merely control the damage .

madrid 's cosmopolitan lavapies neighborhood has long been a melting pot for arabs and other immigrants .
it was also home to the main suspect in thursday 's terrorist attacks - the deadliest in years . lavapies is a multicultural neighborhood located in the heart of madrid .
the people here still have n't escaped the shock of last thursday 's terrorist attacks on the city .
for days now , police have been combing entire blocks of homes , questioning one neighbor after the other in the search for clues behind last week 's train bombings .
news cameras from al over the world have been snapping and shooting the small , non-descript telephone store here non-stop .
police arrested the moroccan-born jamal zougam at the " nuevo siglo " -lrb- new century -rrb- shop just after the attacks .
the investigation has brought unwanted attention to the immigrant neighborhood , and many are struggling to come to terms with what has happened .
just across the street from the telephone shop where zougam was arrested , there 's an arab greengrocer run by a moroccan .
the owner , who asked not to be identified by name , said he still could n't believe that his neighbor and fellow countryman had been a part of the terrible attacks , which left 200 dead and 1,500 injured in bombings of commuter trains at several of the city 's congested stations .
trusted by neighbors " jamal and his co-workers were totally normal and very sympathetic people , " the store owner explained .
" to me , they rise above all doubt .
and even now nothing has been confirmed .
we can only pray that it was n't them .
i hope it will all be cleared up and , in the end , they will not have had anything to do with it . "
even spaniards in the neighborhood had something good to say about zougam 's telephone shop , which was widely-respected and frequented by local residents .
the bar owner two doors down first learned of zougam 's arrest on television .
" i was petrified when i heard it , " the bar owner said .
" i was n't a friend of his , but we always said ' hello ' and ' goodbye ' to each other .
but i always had him repair my mobile phones .
i revered the people in the store and thought they did good work .
but if it 's true that they 're responsible for the attack , i will wring their necks . "
the neighborhood has long been a magnet for people from other countries .
immigrants have been coming here and coexisting peacefully for years .
but some spaniards , especially older generations , express concerns about the growing influx of foreigners to the neighborhood .
some even feel threatened and express a kind of populist thinking not uncommon in other parts of europe where immigration is an issue of heated debate .
" it used to be a wonderful neighborhood , " one spanish neighbor said .
" but today people are afraid to go out on the streets of lavapies .
there 's a lot of theft - and that 's not all .
i do n't want to say all arab 's are killers - for heaven 's sake , no .
but it is true that these people are causing a lot of damage here . "
growing distrust there 's a muslim butcher located adjacent to the telephone shop .
its owner , a 40-year algerian who has lived in spain for 12 years , was also angered by the terrorist attack .
he said he felt less welcome in other parts of madrid in the wake of the attacks .
" in other districts of madrid people have looked at me distrustfully as soon as they heard me speaking in arabic , " he said .
" when they stare , i can sometimes feel the anger and the desire for revenge .
i can only hope that these people know they ca n't lump all of us together , " he said , referring to the possible islamic extremists behind the attacks .
another arab then jumped into the butcher 's conversation .
the moroccan has lived in spain for a number of years , has a family and feels at home here .
he hopes the suspicions toward radical islamic terrorists does n't transform into a blanket rejection of people of muslim faith .
" we have lived here in spain for so long that we 're more or less a part of this country , " he said .
" those who did this are terrorists .
that has nothing to do with religion or geographical origin .

federal and regional german politicians are working on plans to overhaul the country 's domestic intelligence service to be better able to combat terrorism and avoid attacks similar to the madrid bombings last week . presently , germany 's domestic intelligence agency , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , is split among 16 different bureaus in each of the country 's federal states .
long considered by some security experts as inefficient and unwieldy , the deadly terrorist attacks in spain have increased pressure to overhaul its structure . " there is more openness than before regarding the question whether the smaller state offices could find new ways to cooperate , " chancellery official frank-walter steinmeier told the financial times deutschland on wednesday .
" if the states are prepared to give up competencies then its a suggestion that can be discussed . " although some conservative politicians are calling for completely abolishing the state offices in favor of a centralized federal authority , it 's more likely that they will be folded into four or more regional departments .
there are also proposals to merge germany 's federal police -lrb- bka -rrb- with border control and customs services . " germany 's fragmented system dates back to the cold war when fighting domestic militants was the priority , " said frank umbach from the german council on foreign relations , according to the reuters news agency .
" now we have to deal with international terrorism . " affordable experts some of the largest states like north-rhine-westphalia and bavaria remain keen to keep their bfv bureaus in tact , but many smaller and poorer states hope greater cooperation would make it easier to afford expensive equipment or specialized personnel such as arabic experts . although germany opposed the u.s.-led war in iraq , few security experts doubt that the country is a target for islamic extremists .
in particular , germany 's role in stabilizing afghanistan angers the al qaeda terror network of osama bin laden .
and several of the terrorists involved in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states were part of a terror cell based in the northern german city of hamburg . besides considering a revamp of its own domestic intelligence agency , germany is pushing for greater cooperation at the european level .
after the bombings in madrid , german interior minister otto schily called for a ministerial summit on security in brussels that will be held on friday . steinmeier from the chancellery told the ftd that berlin supported the idea of creating an eu collection point for information collected by domestic intelligence agency , underscoring plans announced on tuesday by french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder to step up joint efforts to combat terrorism . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security discussions rage across europe european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.03.2004 spain 's muslims : living on society 's edge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cordoba 's la mezquita cathedral was actually a muslim mosque until 1492 .
though islam is woven into the fabric of the country 's history , moroccans and other arabs living there today are struggling to find their place in society as well as their role in the muslim world . mustafa bougrine is a moroccan who has lived in spain for 19 years .
he 's married to a spanish woman and runs a restaurant .
he fears that a new feeling of islamophobia may be growing in the spanish population .
" when people hear the word ' islam ' , they think about bin laden , saddam hussein or gaddafi , but that 's not islam , " he says .
" i 'm against every form of fanaticism , suicide bombers and everything that is referred to as ' jihad ' .
muslims here in spain believe in democracy and peaceful coexistence between christians , jews and muslims . "
change is definitely brewing among madrid 's muslims .
the city 's lavapies neighborhood -lrb- see related link below -rrb- , where many immigrants live and the suspected culprits of the march 11 terrorist attacks ran a telephone shop , has practically come to a standstill .
the mosque on the m30 highway beltway is the largest in madrid .
but these days it 's conspicuously empty .
before last thursday 's terrorist attacks on the city , as many as 1,000 would come at a single time to pray here .
now it 's difficult to find more than 50 people who have come here to pray in the direction of mecca .
many muslims are staying home and out of the public eye as spanish investigators shift their focus from basque separatists toward the attack 's suspected moroccan culprits .
spanish newspapers are reporting sources alleging links between thursday 's terrorist attacks and bombings in casablanca last may that also killed dozens of spaniards .
the developments have sent shockwaves through spain 's muslim community , which is struggling to establish its own identity in a staunchly catholic country .
an influx of economic refugees close to 600,000 muslims live in spain , with the majority originating from northern africa 's maghreb countries , mostly morocco which is located just kilometers across the straight of gibraltar .
islam is not a new religion in spain .
no other european country has as many traces of the religion in its history .
for several hundred years , right up till the end of the 15th century , islam was a dominant presence on the iberian peninsula .
most of those living here today came during the 1980s .
their numbers grew in the 1990s as they took jobs in spain 's growing agricultural , construction , hospitality and service industry .
they are the silent majority of spain 's muslims .
many of the dominant voices heard in spain are those of spanish islam converts or leaders of islamic cultural centers financed by the saudi arabian government - groups that play a prominent role in negotiating the rights and duties of muslims within the spanish state .
finding their place but for most moroccans , eking out a living is the most important aspect of daily life .
through countless grassroots associations , moroccans in spain are fighting for their economic survival as well as the construction of mosques in their neighborhoods .
muhammad chouirdi works for the association of moroccan workers and immigrants .
he finds alarming the miserable circumstances under which his fellow countrymen are forced to fulfill their religious obligations .
strapped for cash , the temptation to take money from other arab groups is tempting , but the political dangers are considerable .
moroccan muslim leaders like chouidiri are also wary of other branches of islam , which they fear are being accepted uncritically by moroccan immigrants .
" we suspect that small moroccan living-room mosques on the outskirts of madrid are already receiving saudi arabian money , " chouirdi explains .
" by doing so , saudi arabia is trying to spread its form of islam and practices - primarily wahhabi muslim .
the probelm is that moroccan immigrants have a low level of education and there 's a danger that they will not recognize the danger of these religious practices .
for them , practicing islam means praying give times a day and following many rules .
what we get from the outside world - in this case from saudi arabia - is accepted with out critical discussion . "
islam from saudi arabia , with its fundamentalist characteristics , has spread in spain in recent years .
all the big representative mosques in spain were built with saudi money .
and frequently the saudis have also sent imams who interpret the quran according to the wahhabis .
wahhabism rejects all modernity , any dialogue between religions , any opening up to other cultures .
the breeding ground for last week 's attacks could have been here .
for both the culprits in the casablanca bombing in 2003 and the alleged perpetrators of the madrid attacks belong to terrorist groups that have been influenced by wahhabi ideologists .
a religious border now people are asking themselves how a minority in the muslim community could have become susceptible to islamist propaganda .
the disparities between spain 's catholic and muslim societies could provide some clues .
a look at ceuta , one of the two spanish cities on the moroccan mediterranean coast , is revealing .
ceuta is the gateway to europe .
the border between africa and europe , between islamic morocco and catholic spain , is here .
half of ceuta 's 72,000 residents are christian , while the other half are muslim , mainly of moroccan origin .
the chairman of islamic community of ceuta , abselam hamadi , says that many muslims still feel like second-class citizens , that they do n't have the same opportunities christians have .
" only few muslims get jobs in ceuta 's state administration .
the response is always the same : professional qualifications lacking .
that 's not the truth , of course .
but if more muslims were accepted , there would be more muslims than christians in the administration one day , and that scares the christians . "
the fact is , ceuta 's muslim residents have dramatically lower standards of living and levels of education than christian residents .

federal and regional german politicians are working on plans to overhaul the country 's domestic intelligence service to be better able to combat terrorism and avoid attacks similar to the madrid bombings last week . presently , germany 's domestic intelligence agency , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , is split among 16 different bureaus in each of the country 's federal states .
long considered by some security experts as inefficient and unwieldy , the deadly terrorist attacks in spain have increased pressure to overhaul its structure . " there is more openness than before regarding the question whether the smaller state offices could find new ways to cooperate , " chancellery official frank-walter steinmeier told the financial times deutschland on wednesday .
" if the states are prepared to give up competencies then its a suggestion that can be discussed . " although some conservative politicians are calling for completely abolishing the state offices in favor of a centralized federal authority , it 's more likely that they will be folded into four or more regional departments .
there are also proposals to merge germany 's federal police -lrb- bka -rrb- with border control and customs services . " germany 's fragmented system dates back to the cold war when fighting domestic militants was the priority , " said frank umbach from the german council on foreign relations , according to the reuters news agency .
" now we have to deal with international terrorism . " affordable experts some of the largest states like north-rhine-westphalia and bavaria remain keen to keep their bfv bureaus in tact , but many smaller and poorer states hope greater cooperation would make it easier to afford expensive equipment or specialized personnel such as arabic experts . although germany opposed the u.s.-led war in iraq , few security experts doubt that the country is a target for islamic extremists .

after the bombings in madrid , german interior minister otto schily called for a ministerial summit on security in brussels that will be held on friday . steinmeier from the chancellery told the ftd that berlin supported the idea of creating an eu collection point for information collected by domestic intelligence agency , underscoring plans announced on tuesday by french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder to step up joint efforts to combat terrorism . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security discussions rage across europe european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil .

federal and regional german politicians are working on plans to overhaul the country 's domestic intelligence service to be better able to combat terrorism and avoid attacks similar to the madrid bombings last week . presently , germany 's domestic intelligence agency , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , is split among 16 different bureaus in each of the country 's federal states .
long considered by some security experts as inefficient and unwieldy , the deadly terrorist attacks in spain have increased pressure to overhaul its structure . " there is more openness than before regarding the question whether the smaller state offices could find new ways to cooperate , " chancellery official frank-walter steinmeier told the financial times deutschland on wednesday .
" if the states are prepared to give up competencies then its a suggestion that can be discussed . " although some conservative politicians are calling for completely abolishing the state offices in favor of a centralized federal authority , it 's more likely that they will be folded into four or more regional departments .
there are also proposals to merge germany 's federal police -lrb- bka -rrb- with border control and customs services . " germany 's fragmented system dates back to the cold war when fighting domestic militants was the priority , " said frank umbach from the german council on foreign relations , according to the reuters news agency .
" now we have to deal with international terrorism . " affordable experts some of the largest states like north-rhine-westphalia and bavaria remain keen to keep their bfv bureaus in tact , but many smaller and poorer states hope greater cooperation would make it easier to afford expensive equipment or specialized personnel such as arabic experts . although germany opposed the u.s.-led war in iraq , few security experts doubt that the country is a target for islamic extremists .

federal and regional german politicians are working on plans to overhaul the country 's domestic intelligence service to be better able to combat terrorism and avoid attacks similar to the madrid bombings last week . presently , germany 's domestic intelligence agency , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , is split among 16 different bureaus in each of the country 's federal states .
long considered by some security experts as inefficient and unwieldy , the deadly terrorist attacks in spain have increased pressure to overhaul its structure . " there is more openness than before regarding the question whether the smaller state offices could find new ways to cooperate , " chancellery official frank-walter steinmeier told the financial times deutschland on wednesday .
" if the states are prepared to give up competencies then its a suggestion that can be discussed . " although some conservative politicians are calling for completely abolishing the state offices in favor of a centralized federal authority , it 's more likely that they will be folded into four or more regional departments .
there are also proposals to merge germany 's federal police -lrb- bka -rrb- with border control and customs services . " germany 's fragmented system dates back to the cold war when fighting domestic militants was the priority , " said frank umbach from the german council on foreign relations , according to the reuters news agency .
" now we have to deal with international terrorism . " affordable experts some of the largest states like north-rhine-westphalia and bavaria remain keen to keep their bfv bureaus in tact , but many smaller and poorer states hope greater cooperation would make it easier to afford expensive equipment or specialized personnel such as arabic experts . although germany opposed the u.s.-led war in iraq , few security experts doubt that the country is a target for islamic extremists .

a day after serbs and ethnic albanians clashed in kosovo , the united states and britain revealed they would send reinforcements to bolster the nato force struggling to restore calm in the region . the united states and britain are sending extra troops to kosovo as part of the nato effort to quell unrest in the mainly ethnic albanian serbian province , where violence has killed 22 people in the past 24 hours . " we are continuing to monitor the situation closely .
we are working with nato to deploy additional forces as a precaution .
one u.s. company is en route as part of a 350-strong nato force , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan told reporters traveling to kentucky with u.s. president george w. bush .
" we continue to call on all groups to end the violence and refrain from violence . " britain also dispatched a force of 750 rapid reaction troops to kosovo as nato officials revealed that up to 1,000 extra soldiers could be dispatched to kosovo to bolster its 17,000 strong force after it emerged that 35 nato troops had been injured in the violence . nato 's top military commander in europe , u.s. general james jones , expressed concern about the flare-up .
" i call on the leaders of both sides of the conflict to take decisive action to control immediately their citizens and return to the rule of law , " he said , describing the extra troop deployments as a " prudent reinforcement . "
violence flared on wednesday as the un-administered serbian province of kosovo became embroiled in some of the worst outpourings of violence between ethnic albanians and serbs in three years .
the conflict broke out early wednesday morning amid reports that serbs in a village near kosovska mitrovica set a dog on a group of ethnic albanian boys , forcing them to flee into an icy river where they drowned .
after authorities recovered the bodies , kosovo-albanians and serbs faced off against each other near a bridge over the ibar river that divides the city - long a flashpoint of ethnic tensions - and traded insults , threw rocks and charged at each other several times before gunfire broke out .
nato-led peacekeepers and rumanian special police units in riot gear moved in , firing tear gas , rubber bullets and stun grenades to stop ethnic albanians from rushing across the bridge toward the serb side of the city .
official reports said six ethnic albanians and two serbs were killed in the clash in kosovska mitrovica .
seven police officers and 11 french kfor soldiers were also injured .
flashpoint of ethnic tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kosovo police officer stands guard near damaged cars and apartments in a mainly serb neighborhood in the kosovo capital pristina .
with emotions running high in the volatile region , the conflict quickly fanned out , spilling over into other towns where serb homes , churches and cars were set on fire as ethnic albanians sought revenge .
in the central kosovo town of lipljan , four serbs were killed late wednesday and three others died in the eastern town of gnjilane as nato and un troops struggled to stop the violence .
but during the course of the day , events became too much for the international peacekeepers to contain as ethnic albanians rushed kfor checkpoints established to protect serb enclaves , and un vehicles were reportedly torched in the capital pristina , according to beta news agency .
several medieval serb orthodox churches and monasteries were also allegedly set ablaze in central and eastern kosovo .
serbs demand retaliation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters celebrate in front of a burning mosque after a fire set by protesters took hold in the southern serbian town of nis .
meanwhile in belgrade , the capital of serbia-montenegro , demonstrators set the city 's 17th century mosque on fire after clashing with police trying to guard the building .
the angry mob demanded that the serbian government act to protect their orthodox christian kin from attacks by the primarily muslim kosovo-albanians .
a second mosque was torched in the southern serbian town of nis .
news reports from belgrade said more than 10,000 people rallied outside the serbian government building blocking main streets in the city center .
chanting , " we 'll go to kosovo " and " serbia rise up , " they demanded their leadership take action .
prime minister vojislav kostunica of serbia , to which kosovo belongs , appealed to his countrymen for an end to the violence and condemned what he called albanian terrorism .
" the events ... demonstrate the true nature of albanian separatism , its violent and terrorist character , " he said after an emergency cabinet meeting .
nato and un respond in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer called on both serbs and ethnic albanians to remain calm .
" i urge all ethnic communities in kosovska mitrovica and in the rest of kosovo to avoid further escalation , to act with calm and to refrain from demonstrations and roadblocks , " he said in a statement .
un secretary general kofi annan urged all parties to halt the violence , " which jeopardizes the stability of kosovo and the security of all its people . "
international troops have been in the region since 1999 when 78 days of nato bombing forced serbia to end its crackdown on separatists from kosovo 's ethnic albanians and brought an end to the conflict .
there are currently 17,000 kfor troops and 10,000 un and local police patrolling the province .
despite their significant presence , ethnic violence has repeatedly erupted , but wednesday 's outpouring was the bloodiest in the last three years and demonstrated the failure of international efforts to squelch ethnic hatreds and set the province on the path of reconciliation . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : damage control in kosovo at least 17 people were killed in riots in kosovo on wednesday .
serbs and albanians have yet again spiralled into conflict , raising the question of what has really changed since the nato-led war against serbia in 1999 .

a day after serbs and ethnic albanians clashed in kosovo , the united states and britain revealed they would send reinforcements to bolster the nato force struggling to restore calm in the region . the united states and britain are sending extra troops to kosovo as part of the nato effort to quell unrest in the mainly ethnic albanian serbian province , where violence has killed 22 people in the past 24 hours . " we are continuing to monitor the situation closely .
we are working with nato to deploy additional forces as a precaution .
one u.s. company is en route as part of a 350-strong nato force , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan told reporters traveling to kentucky with u.s. president george w. bush .
" we continue to call on all groups to end the violence and refrain from violence . " britain also dispatched a force of 750 rapid reaction troops to kosovo as nato officials revealed that up to 1,000 extra soldiers could be dispatched to kosovo to bolster its 17,000 strong force after it emerged that 35 nato troops had been injured in the violence . nato 's top military commander in europe , u.s. general james jones , expressed concern about the flare-up .
" i call on the leaders of both sides of the conflict to take decisive action to control immediately their citizens and return to the rule of law , " he said , describing the extra troop deployments as a " prudent reinforcement . "
violence flared on wednesday as the un-administered serbian province of kosovo became embroiled in some of the worst outpourings of violence between ethnic albanians and serbs in three years .
the conflict broke out early wednesday morning amid reports that serbs in a village near kosovska mitrovica set a dog on a group of ethnic albanian boys , forcing them to flee into an icy river where they drowned .
after authorities recovered the bodies , kosovo-albanians and serbs faced off against each other near a bridge over the ibar river that divides the city - long a flashpoint of ethnic tensions - and traded insults , threw rocks and charged at each other several times before gunfire broke out .
nato-led peacekeepers and rumanian special police units in riot gear moved in , firing tear gas , rubber bullets and stun grenades to stop ethnic albanians from rushing across the bridge toward the serb side of the city .
official reports said six ethnic albanians and two serbs were killed in the clash in kosovska mitrovica .
seven police officers and 11 french kfor soldiers were also injured .

with emotions running high in the volatile region , the conflict quickly fanned out , spilling over into other towns where serb homes , churches and cars were set on fire as ethnic albanians sought revenge .
in the central kosovo town of lipljan , four serbs were killed late wednesday and three others died in the eastern town of gnjilane as nato and un troops struggled to stop the violence .
but during the course of the day , events became too much for the international peacekeepers to contain as ethnic albanians rushed kfor checkpoints established to protect serb enclaves , and un vehicles were reportedly torched in the capital pristina , according to beta news agency .

the angry mob demanded that the serbian government act to protect their orthodox christian kin from attacks by the primarily muslim kosovo-albanians .
a second mosque was torched in the southern serbian town of nis .
news reports from belgrade said more than 10,000 people rallied outside the serbian government building blocking main streets in the city center .
chanting , " we 'll go to kosovo " and " serbia rise up , " they demanded their leadership take action .
prime minister vojislav kostunica of serbia , to which kosovo belongs , appealed to his countrymen for an end to the violence and condemned what he called albanian terrorism .
" the events ... demonstrate the true nature of albanian separatism , its violent and terrorist character , " he said after an emergency cabinet meeting .
nato and un respond in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer called on both serbs and ethnic albanians to remain calm .
" i urge all ethnic communities in kosovska mitrovica and in the rest of kosovo to avoid further escalation , to act with calm and to refrain from demonstrations and roadblocks , " he said in a statement .

the proposals , drawn up by france , germany , the uk , sweden , austria and the netherlands , would limit eu funds for 2007 to 2013 to one percent of gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- , rather than 1.27 percent of gni .
but budget commissioner michaele schreyer on thursday described the idea as " completely untenable . "
speaking before the budget committee in the european parliament , she warned that the proposals would mean an actual spending cut of ten percent and said , " we could n't continue with european integration " in this scenario .
" you would have less europe " , she continued , " and the commission is of the opinion that we have to say ' absolutely no ' to less europe . "
together with five other commissioners , schreyer defends plans to increase the money made available b eu members states for further union projects from 133 billion euro in 2007 to 158 billion in 2013 .
pointing to sharp rises in spending on justice and home affairs issues , the commissioner for this area , antonio vitorino said , " i believe this brings europe closer to its citizens ... it is quite clear that this is an area where operational responses will be needed after 2007 . "
trade commissioner pascal lamy justified the spending on external relations by saying , " the eu is only important if it can act outside the union . "
but the european commission 's proposals need to be agreed unanimously by member states and bitter fights are in the offing .
with the commission standing firm on their proposals and the powerful " group of six " equally unshakeable , the debate is already off on a difficult start .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.03.2004 opinion : damage control in kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke billows from serbian orthodox church at least 17 people were killed in riots in kosovo on wednesday .
serbs and albanians have yet again spiralled into conflict , raising the question of what has really changed since the nato-led war against serbia in 1999 . overnight , the situation in kosovo has escalated , evoking memories of 1999 .
back then , nato decided to put an end to the persistent violence through air strikes .
an international peacekeeping force was deployed and kosovo was placed under a united nations mandate .
five years on , the question of the future status of kosovo remains unresolved .
in the eyes of albanians , kosovo should be made independent ; and in the view of serbs , it should remain part of a federation with serbia and montenegro .
the first important talks between the two sides have gotten underway in recent days to discuss important questions of principle , like the fate of missing people and how to ensure steady energy supplies in the region .
the international military presence , u.n. police and local security forces have ensured a certain level of peace .
but the latest violence is n't isolated to the disputed city of kosovska mitrovica , but has spread simultaneously to a number of places across kosovo following the circulation of unconfirmed reports about the violent deaths of albanian children .
additionally , serb extremists also set fire to mosques in belgrade and nis .
conflict also erupted between albanians and serbs during protests across the country .
kfor soldiers and un police were also attacked as the chaos spread .
since the end of the 1999 war , such incidents have happened with increasing regularity .
but this time the violence was loaded with such intensity that it should have sounded a sharp alarm in the international community - for this time the turbulence is escalating almost simultaneously in many places in kosovo and it is encroaching on serbia and montenegro .
an even worse suspicion is now arising : was this a directed escalation of violence ?
was it orchestrated by extremist groups on both sides who have been waiting for the right pretext to fuel the conflict with all of their power just days before the anniversary of the kosovo war ?
kosovo no longer dominates the headlines in the international press , but that does n't mean things have changed for the better . democratic structures and a culture of dialog have not yet developed .
and the cause of the current conflict - the political battle over the future of kosovo - has been put off .
the international community is hoping that the situation will simmer down further so that a solution to the political issues can be settled more easily .
but the contrary appears to be the case : the postponement of the status question is engendering bitterness on all sides of the debate . the political environment has also changed .
serbia now has a new nationalist conservative government that is being tolerated by milosevic 's socialists .
it has left no doubt that it is unwilling to compromise on the status question .
meanwhile , the confidence of albanians in kosovo has increased and the un administration has transferred to them some competencies .
the kosovars have stood firm on their position for some time now , too : the future of kosovo lies in independence and there wo n't and ca n't be any compromise with belgrade .
an agreement on the future of kosovo remains elusive even now , five years after the last bombs were dropped .
the latest problems show that even a mere spark is enough to set barricades and houses of worship ablaze .
that 's how it was in 1999 and that 's how it is again today .
kosovo is still far away from a peaceful future .
and if the serbs and albanians are unwilling to compromise , then there 's little more the international community can do than merely control the damage .
thus , sovereignty remains a pipe dream for serbs and albanians . bernd johann -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato sends reinforcements to kosovo a day after serbs and ethnic albanians clashed in kosovo , the united states and britain revealed that they would send reinforcements to bolster the nato force struggling to return the region to calm .

the body 's chairman , nadeem elyas , told the berliner zeitung newspaper that legislation sanctioning or discriminating against muslims was rapidly passing through parliament .
he said suggestions that mosques be put under video surveillance were excessive and effectively made the majority of muslims feel hostile toward the state .
politicians ' failure to take confidence-building measures could cause muslims to lose faith in the state , elyas warned .
he said the muslim way of life should be accepted as long as it complies with the law , but he said he experienced the opposite in regard to recent legal decisions restricting the wearing headscarves and the ritual slaughter of livestock .
in an interview with german public broadcaster deutschlandradio on wednesday , elyas said the police had recently searched more than 80 mosques and thousands of offices and private homes but had found nothing .
they had only managed to alienate the muslim community .
nonetheless , elyas said " we must indeed try to exclude fringe groups and to win over the majority of german muslims as partners . "
elyas also sought to distance muslims living in germany from the recent wave of islamic fundamentalist violence . more briefs 18.03.2004 -pipe- liberals reject new anti-terror law 18.03.2004 -pipe- minister blames industry for emissions dispute 17.03.2004 -pipe- clement puts brakes on emissions compromise 17.03.2004 -pipe- german conservatives in disarray over köhler nomination 17.03.2004 -pipe- " florida rolf " to draw pension instead of dole 17.03.2004 -pipe- court : immigrants not allowed to move 16.03.2004 -pipe- german school bans belly-baring tops 16.03.2004 -pipe- two germans killed in iraq radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

according to a report by the financial times deutschland , representatives of top businesses such as deutsche telekom , munich re , sap , allianz , siemens and daimlerchrysler , have written to chancellor gerhard schröder voicing their concerns and urging that the bank remain in german hands .
the company leaders argued germany needed a " national champion " bank able to conduct international business from home .
the newspaper quoted government sources as saying berlin was essentially in favor of a consolidation of the banking sector , even on a european level , but was opposed to hostile takeovers .
deutsche bank president josef ackermann said he thought it improbable that his institution would become the target of a rival bank and stressed that it was also not currently available for a friendly takeover .
deutsche bank recently held merger talks with u.s. giant citigroup and press reports suggest that hsbc or jp morgan could also come courting . dw-world.de bank merger calls meet resistance press reports that germany ’ s finance minister hans eichel is planning to push for mergers of the country ’ s big banks have been rejected by official sources as untrue .

therefore i wo n't go to switzerland , " denktash said on turkish state television on wednesday .
however , the turkish cypriot leader promised that other members of his team would still take part at the meeting and make an effort to find an agreement .
the announcement deals a blow to united nations efforts to reunify cyprus before it joins the eu on the may 1 .
if agreement is not reached by that time , only the southern part of the island will join the eu .
a meeting between greek cypriot and turkish cypriot representatives , as well as greece and turkey is scheduled to take place next week in switzerland .
if the deadlock continues , u.n. secretary general kofi annan will settle all the remaining issues in a bid to submit the final plan to referendums in both communities on april 20 .

the proposals , drawn up by france , germany , the uk , sweden , austria and the netherlands , would limit eu funds for 2007 to 2013 to one percent of gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- , rather than 1.27 percent of gni .
but budget commissioner michaele schreyer on thursday described the idea as " completely untenable . "
speaking before the budget committee in the european parliament , she warned that the proposals would mean an actual spending cut of ten percent and said , " we could n't continue with european integration " in this scenario .
" you would have less europe " , she continued , " and the commission is of the opinion that we have to say ' absolutely no ' to less europe . "
together with five other commissioners , schreyer defends plans to increase the money made available b eu members states for further union projects from 133 billion euro in 2007 to 158 billion in 2013 .
pointing to sharp rises in spending on justice and home affairs issues , the commissioner for this area , antonio vitorino said , " i believe this brings europe closer to its citizens ... it is quite clear that this is an area where operational responses will be needed after 2007 . "
trade commissioner pascal lamy justified the spending on external relations by saying , " the eu is only important if it can act outside the union . "
but the european commission 's proposals need to be agreed unanimously by member states and bitter fights are in the offing .
with the commission standing firm on their proposals and the powerful " group of six " equally unshakeable , the debate is already off on a difficult start .

the proposals , drawn up by france , germany , the uk , sweden , austria and the netherlands , would limit eu funds for 2007 to 2013 to one percent of gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- , rather than 1.27 percent of gni .
but budget commissioner michaele schreyer on thursday described the idea as " completely untenable . "
speaking before the budget committee in the european parliament , she warned that the proposals would mean an actual spending cut of ten percent and said , " we could n't continue with european integration " in this scenario .
" you would have less europe " , she continued , " and the commission is of the opinion that we have to say ' absolutely no ' to less europe . "
together with five other commissioners , schreyer defends plans to increase the money made available b eu members states for further union projects from 133 billion euro in 2007 to 158 billion in 2013 .
pointing to sharp rises in spending on justice and home affairs issues , the commissioner for this area , antonio vitorino said , " i believe this brings europe closer to its citizens ... it is quite clear that this is an area where operational responses will be needed after 2007 . "
trade commissioner pascal lamy justified the spending on external relations by saying , " the eu is only important if it can act outside the union . "
but the european commission 's proposals need to be agreed unanimously by member states and bitter fights are in the offing .
with the commission standing firm on their proposals and the powerful " group of six " equally unshakeable , the debate is already off on a difficult start .

" wolfgang clement and i will be able to come to an agreement , " trittin told die welt newspaper .
" the real problem is with industry . "
he said that germany 's firms demanded higher carbon emissions rights than the government could allow and still uphold the kyoto protocol aims to cut such pollutants .
clement was branded an industry stooge by green party environment spokesman winfried hermann after the minister on wednesday rejected a paper drawn up by experts that was meant to resolve green party and industry differences over emission levels .
clement dismissed the accusation , saying that the balance between economy and ecology must be compatible with industry 's needs to be able to compete internationally . more briefs 17.03.2004 -pipe- clement puts brakes on emissions compromise 17.03.2004 -pipe- german conservatives in disarray over köhler nomination 17.03.2004 -pipe- " florida rolf " to draw pension instead of dole 17.03.2004 -pipe- court : immigrants not allowed to move 16.03.2004 -pipe- german school bans belly-baring tops 16.03.2004 -pipe- two germans killed in iraq 16.03.2004 -pipe- spd threatens to bar new leftist party supporters 15.03.2004 -pipe- german libraries lag behind radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the body 's chairman , nadeem elyas , told the berliner zeitung newspaper that legislation sanctioning or discriminating against muslims was rapidly passing through parliament .
he said suggestions that mosques be put under video surveillance were excessive and effectively made the majority of muslims feel hostile toward the state .
politicians ' failure to take confidence-building measures could cause muslims to lose faith in the state , elyas warned .
he said the muslim way of life should be accepted as long as it complies with the law , but he said he experienced the opposite in regard to recent legal decisions restricting the wearing headscarves and the ritual slaughter of livestock .
in an interview with german public broadcaster deutschlandradio on wednesday , elyas said the police had recently searched more than 80 mosques and thousands of offices and private homes but had found nothing .
they had only managed to alienate the muslim community .
nonetheless , elyas said " we must indeed try to exclude fringe groups and to win over the majority of german muslims as partners . "

a day after serbs and ethnic albanians clashed in kosovo , the united states and britain revealed they would send reinforcements to bolster the nato force struggling to restore calm in the region . the united states and britain are sending extra troops to kosovo as part of the nato effort to quell unrest in the mainly ethnic albanian serbian province , where violence has killed 22 people in the past 24 hours . " we are continuing to monitor the situation closely .
we are working with nato to deploy additional forces as a precaution .
one u.s. company is en route as part of a 350-strong nato force , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan told reporters traveling to kentucky with u.s. president george w. bush .
" we continue to call on all groups to end the violence and refrain from violence . " britain also dispatched a force of 750 rapid reaction troops to kosovo as nato officials revealed that up to 1,000 extra soldiers could be dispatched to kosovo to bolster its 17,000 strong force after it emerged that 35 nato troops had been injured in the violence . nato 's top military commander in europe , u.s. general james jones , expressed concern about the flare-up .
" i call on the leaders of both sides of the conflict to take decisive action to control immediately their citizens and return to the rule of law , " he said , describing the extra troop deployments as a " prudent reinforcement . "
violence flared on wednesday as the un-administered serbian province of kosovo became embroiled in some of the worst outpourings of violence between ethnic albanians and serbs in three years .
the conflict broke out early wednesday morning amid reports that serbs in a village near kosovska mitrovica set a dog on a group of ethnic albanian boys , forcing them to flee into an icy river where they drowned .
after authorities recovered the bodies , kosovo-albanians and serbs faced off against each other near a bridge over the ibar river that divides the city - long a flashpoint of ethnic tensions - and traded insults , threw rocks and charged at each other several times before gunfire broke out .
nato-led peacekeepers and rumanian special police units in riot gear moved in , firing tear gas , rubber bullets and stun grenades to stop ethnic albanians from rushing across the bridge toward the serb side of the city .
official reports said six ethnic albanians and two serbs were killed in the clash in kosovska mitrovica .
seven police officers and 11 french kfor soldiers were also injured .
flashpoint of ethnic tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kosovo police officer stands guard near damaged cars and apartments in a mainly serb neighborhood in the kosovo capital pristina .
with emotions running high in the volatile region , the conflict quickly fanned out , spilling over into other towns where serb homes , churches and cars were set on fire as ethnic albanians sought revenge .
in the central kosovo town of lipljan , four serbs were killed late wednesday and three others died in the eastern town of gnjilane as nato and un troops struggled to stop the violence .
but during the course of the day , events became too much for the international peacekeepers to contain as ethnic albanians rushed kfor checkpoints established to protect serb enclaves , and un vehicles were reportedly torched in the capital pristina , according to beta news agency .
several medieval serb orthodox churches and monasteries were also allegedly set ablaze in central and eastern kosovo .

meanwhile in belgrade , the capital of serbia-montenegro , demonstrators set the city 's 17th century mosque on fire after clashing with police trying to guard the building .
the angry mob demanded that the serbian government act to protect their orthodox christian kin from attacks by the primarily muslim kosovo-albanians .
a second mosque was torched in the southern serbian town of nis .
news reports from belgrade said more than 10,000 people rallied outside the serbian government building blocking main streets in the city center .
chanting , " we 'll go to kosovo " and " serbia rise up , " they demanded their leadership take action .
prime minister vojislav kostunica of serbia , to which kosovo belongs , appealed to his countrymen for an end to the violence and condemned what he called albanian terrorism .
" the events ... demonstrate the true nature of albanian separatism , its violent and terrorist character , " he said after an emergency cabinet meeting .
nato and un respond in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer called on both serbs and ethnic albanians to remain calm .
" i urge all ethnic communities in kosovska mitrovica and in the rest of kosovo to avoid further escalation , to act with calm and to refrain from demonstrations and roadblocks , " he said in a statement .
un secretary general kofi annan urged all parties to halt the violence , " which jeopardizes the stability of kosovo and the security of all its people . "
international troops have been in the region since 1999 when 78 days of nato bombing forced serbia to end its crackdown on separatists from kosovo 's ethnic albanians and brought an end to the conflict .
there are currently 17,000 kfor troops and 10,000 un and local police patrolling the province .
despite their significant presence , ethnic violence has repeatedly erupted , but wednesday 's outpouring was the bloodiest in the last three years and demonstrated the failure of international efforts to squelch ethnic hatreds and set the province on the path of reconciliation . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : damage control in kosovo at least 17 people were killed in riots in kosovo on wednesday .

madrid 's cosmopolitan lavapies neighborhood has long been a melting pot for arabs and other immigrants .
it was also home to the main suspect in thursday 's terrorist attacks - the deadliest in years . lavapies is a multicultural neighborhood located in the heart of madrid .
the people here still have n't escaped the shock of last thursday 's terrorist attacks on the city .
for days now , police have been combing entire blocks of homes , questioning one neighbor after the other in the search for clues behind last week 's train bombings .
news cameras from al over the world have been snapping and shooting the small , non-descript telephone store here non-stop .
police arrested the moroccan-born jamal zougam at the " nuevo siglo " -lrb- new century -rrb- shop just after the attacks .
the investigation has brought unwanted attention to the immigrant neighborhood , and many are struggling to come to terms with what has happened .
just across the street from the telephone shop where zougam was arrested , there 's an arab greengrocer run by a moroccan .
the owner , who asked not to be identified by name , said he still could n't believe that his neighbor and fellow countryman had been a part of the terrible attacks , which left 200 dead and 1,500 injured in bombings of commuter trains at several of the city 's congested stations .
trusted by neighbors " jamal and his co-workers were totally normal and very sympathetic people , " the store owner explained .
" to me , they rise above all doubt .
and even now nothing has been confirmed .
we can only pray that it was n't them .
i hope it will all be cleared up and , in the end , they will not have had anything to do with it . "
even spaniards in the neighborhood had something good to say about zougam 's telephone shop , which was widely-respected and frequented by local residents .
the bar owner two doors down first learned of zougam 's arrest on television .
" i was petrified when i heard it , " the bar owner said .
" i was n't a friend of his , but we always said ' hello ' and ' goodbye ' to each other .
but i always had him repair my mobile phones .
i revered the people in the store and thought they did good work .
but if it 's true that they 're responsible for the attack , i will wring their necks . "
the neighborhood has long been a magnet for people from other countries .
immigrants have been coming here and coexisting peacefully for years .
but some spaniards , especially older generations , express concerns about the growing influx of foreigners to the neighborhood .
some even feel threatened and express a kind of populist thinking not uncommon in other parts of europe where immigration is an issue of heated debate .
" it used to be a wonderful neighborhood , " one spanish neighbor said .
" but today people are afraid to go out on the streets of lavapies .
there 's a lot of theft - and that 's not all .
i do n't want to say all arab 's are killers - for heaven 's sake , no .
but it is true that these people are causing a lot of damage here . "
growing distrust there 's a muslim butcher located adjacent to the telephone shop .
its owner , a 40-year algerian who has lived in spain for 12 years , was also angered by the terrorist attack .
he said he felt less welcome in other parts of madrid in the wake of the attacks .
" in other districts of madrid people have looked at me distrustfully as soon as they heard me speaking in arabic , " he said .
" when they stare , i can sometimes feel the anger and the desire for revenge .
i can only hope that these people know they ca n't lump all of us together , " he said , referring to the possible islamic extremists behind the attacks .
another arab then jumped into the butcher 's conversation .
the moroccan has lived in spain for a number of years , has a family and feels at home here .
he hopes the suspicions toward radical islamic terrorists does n't transform into a blanket rejection of people of muslim faith .
" we have lived here in spain for so long that we 're more or less a part of this country , " he said .
" those who did this are terrorists .
that has nothing to do with religion or geographical origin .

madrid 's cosmopolitan lavapies neighborhood has long been a melting pot for arabs and other immigrants .
it was also home to the main suspect in thursday 's terrorist attacks - the deadliest in years . lavapies is a multicultural neighborhood located in the heart of madrid .
the people here still have n't escaped the shock of last thursday 's terrorist attacks on the city .
for days now , police have been combing entire blocks of homes , questioning one neighbor after the other in the search for clues behind last week 's train bombings .
news cameras from al over the world have been snapping and shooting the small , non-descript telephone store here non-stop .
police arrested the moroccan-born jamal zougam at the " nuevo siglo " -lrb- new century -rrb- shop just after the attacks .
the investigation has brought unwanted attention to the immigrant neighborhood , and many are struggling to come to terms with what has happened .
just across the street from the telephone shop where zougam was arrested , there 's an arab greengrocer run by a moroccan .
the owner , who asked not to be identified by name , said he still could n't believe that his neighbor and fellow countryman had been a part of the terrible attacks , which left 200 dead and 1,500 injured in bombings of commuter trains at several of the city 's congested stations .
trusted by neighbors " jamal and his co-workers were totally normal and very sympathetic people , " the store owner explained .
" to me , they rise above all doubt .
and even now nothing has been confirmed .
we can only pray that it was n't them .
i hope it will all be cleared up and , in the end , they will not have had anything to do with it . "
even spaniards in the neighborhood had something good to say about zougam 's telephone shop , which was widely-respected and frequented by local residents .
the bar owner two doors down first learned of zougam 's arrest on television .
" i was petrified when i heard it , " the bar owner said .
" i was n't a friend of his , but we always said ' hello ' and ' goodbye ' to each other .
but i always had him repair my mobile phones .
i revered the people in the store and thought they did good work .
but if it 's true that they 're responsible for the attack , i will wring their necks . "
the neighborhood has long been a magnet for people from other countries .
immigrants have been coming here and coexisting peacefully for years .
but some spaniards , especially older generations , express concerns about the growing influx of foreigners to the neighborhood .
some even feel threatened and express a kind of populist thinking not uncommon in other parts of europe where immigration is an issue of heated debate .
" it used to be a wonderful neighborhood , " one spanish neighbor said .
" but today people are afraid to go out on the streets of lavapies .
there 's a lot of theft - and that 's not all .
i do n't want to say all arab 's are killers - for heaven 's sake , no .
but it is true that these people are causing a lot of damage here . "
growing distrust there 's a muslim butcher located adjacent to the telephone shop .
its owner , a 40-year algerian who has lived in spain for 12 years , was also angered by the terrorist attack .
he said he felt less welcome in other parts of madrid in the wake of the attacks .
" in other districts of madrid people have looked at me distrustfully as soon as they heard me speaking in arabic , " he said .
" when they stare , i can sometimes feel the anger and the desire for revenge .
i can only hope that these people know they ca n't lump all of us together , " he said , referring to the possible islamic extremists behind the attacks .
another arab then jumped into the butcher 's conversation .
the moroccan has lived in spain for a number of years , has a family and feels at home here .
he hopes the suspicions toward radical islamic terrorists does n't transform into a blanket rejection of people of muslim faith .
" we have lived here in spain for so long that we 're more or less a part of this country , " he said .
" those who did this are terrorists .
that has nothing to do with religion or geographical origin .

a day after serbs and ethnic albanians clashed in kosovo , the united states and britain revealed they would send reinforcements to bolster the nato force struggling to restore calm in the region . the united states and britain are sending extra troops to kosovo as part of the nato effort to quell unrest in the mainly ethnic albanian serbian province , where violence has killed 22 people in the past 24 hours . " we are continuing to monitor the situation closely .
we are working with nato to deploy additional forces as a precaution .
one u.s. company is en route as part of a 350-strong nato force , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan told reporters traveling to kentucky with u.s. president george w. bush .
" we continue to call on all groups to end the violence and refrain from violence . " britain also dispatched a force of 750 rapid reaction troops to kosovo as nato officials revealed that up to 1,000 extra soldiers could be dispatched to kosovo to bolster its 17,000 strong force after it emerged that 35 nato troops had been injured in the violence . nato 's top military commander in europe , u.s. general james jones , expressed concern about the flare-up .
" i call on the leaders of both sides of the conflict to take decisive action to control immediately their citizens and return to the rule of law , " he said , describing the extra troop deployments as a " prudent reinforcement . "
violence flared on wednesday as the un-administered serbian province of kosovo became embroiled in some of the worst outpourings of violence between ethnic albanians and serbs in three years .
the conflict broke out early wednesday morning amid reports that serbs in a village near kosovska mitrovica set a dog on a group of ethnic albanian boys , forcing them to flee into an icy river where they drowned .
after authorities recovered the bodies , kosovo-albanians and serbs faced off against each other near a bridge over the ibar river that divides the city - long a flashpoint of ethnic tensions - and traded insults , threw rocks and charged at each other several times before gunfire broke out .
nato-led peacekeepers and rumanian special police units in riot gear moved in , firing tear gas , rubber bullets and stun grenades to stop ethnic albanians from rushing across the bridge toward the serb side of the city .
official reports said six ethnic albanians and two serbs were killed in the clash in kosovska mitrovica .
seven police officers and 11 french kfor soldiers were also injured .

with emotions running high in the volatile region , the conflict quickly fanned out , spilling over into other towns where serb homes , churches and cars were set on fire as ethnic albanians sought revenge .
in the central kosovo town of lipljan , four serbs were killed late wednesday and three others died in the eastern town of gnjilane as nato and un troops struggled to stop the violence .
but during the course of the day , events became too much for the international peacekeepers to contain as ethnic albanians rushed kfor checkpoints established to protect serb enclaves , and un vehicles were reportedly torched in the capital pristina , according to beta news agency .
several medieval serb orthodox churches and monasteries were also allegedly set ablaze in central and eastern kosovo .

meanwhile in belgrade , the capital of serbia-montenegro , demonstrators set the city 's 17th century mosque on fire after clashing with police trying to guard the building .
the angry mob demanded that the serbian government act to protect their orthodox christian kin from attacks by the primarily muslim kosovo-albanians .
a second mosque was torched in the southern serbian town of nis .
news reports from belgrade said more than 10,000 people rallied outside the serbian government building blocking main streets in the city center .
chanting , " we 'll go to kosovo " and " serbia rise up , " they demanded their leadership take action .
prime minister vojislav kostunica of serbia , to which kosovo belongs , appealed to his countrymen for an end to the violence and condemned what he called albanian terrorism .
" the events ... demonstrate the true nature of albanian separatism , its violent and terrorist character , " he said after an emergency cabinet meeting .
nato and un respond in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer called on both serbs and ethnic albanians to remain calm .
" i urge all ethnic communities in kosovska mitrovica and in the rest of kosovo to avoid further escalation , to act with calm and to refrain from demonstrations and roadblocks , " he said in a statement .
un secretary general kofi annan urged all parties to halt the violence , " which jeopardizes the stability of kosovo and the security of all its people . "
international troops have been in the region since 1999 when 78 days of nato bombing forced serbia to end its crackdown on separatists from kosovo 's ethnic albanians and brought an end to the conflict .
there are currently 17,000 kfor troops and 10,000 un and local police patrolling the province .
despite their significant presence , ethnic violence has repeatedly erupted , but wednesday 's outpouring was the bloodiest in the last three years and demonstrated the failure of international efforts to squelch ethnic hatreds and set the province on the path of reconciliation . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : damage control in kosovo at least 17 people were killed in riots in kosovo on wednesday .

a day after serbs and ethnic albanians clashed in kosovo , the united states and britain revealed they would send reinforcements to bolster the nato force struggling to restore calm in the region . the united states and britain are sending extra troops to kosovo as part of the nato effort to quell unrest in the mainly ethnic albanian serbian province , where violence has killed 22 people in the past 24 hours . " we are continuing to monitor the situation closely .
we are working with nato to deploy additional forces as a precaution .
one u.s. company is en route as part of a 350-strong nato force , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan told reporters traveling to kentucky with u.s. president george w. bush .
" we continue to call on all groups to end the violence and refrain from violence . " britain also dispatched a force of 750 rapid reaction troops to kosovo as nato officials revealed that up to 1,000 extra soldiers could be dispatched to kosovo to bolster its 17,000 strong force after it emerged that 35 nato troops had been injured in the violence . nato 's top military commander in europe , u.s. general james jones , expressed concern about the flare-up .
" i call on the leaders of both sides of the conflict to take decisive action to control immediately their citizens and return to the rule of law , " he said , describing the extra troop deployments as a " prudent reinforcement . "
violence flared on wednesday as the un-administered serbian province of kosovo became embroiled in some of the worst outpourings of violence between ethnic albanians and serbs in three years .
the conflict broke out early wednesday morning amid reports that serbs in a village near kosovska mitrovica set a dog on a group of ethnic albanian boys , forcing them to flee into an icy river where they drowned .
after authorities recovered the bodies , kosovo-albanians and serbs faced off against each other near a bridge over the ibar river that divides the city - long a flashpoint of ethnic tensions - and traded insults , threw rocks and charged at each other several times before gunfire broke out .
nato-led peacekeepers and rumanian special police units in riot gear moved in , firing tear gas , rubber bullets and stun grenades to stop ethnic albanians from rushing across the bridge toward the serb side of the city .
official reports said six ethnic albanians and two serbs were killed in the clash in kosovska mitrovica .
seven police officers and 11 french kfor soldiers were also injured .
flashpoint of ethnic tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kosovo police officer stands guard near damaged cars and apartments in a mainly serb neighborhood in the kosovo capital pristina .
with emotions running high in the volatile region , the conflict quickly fanned out , spilling over into other towns where serb homes , churches and cars were set on fire as ethnic albanians sought revenge .
in the central kosovo town of lipljan , four serbs were killed late wednesday and three others died in the eastern town of gnjilane as nato and un troops struggled to stop the violence .
but during the course of the day , events became too much for the international peacekeepers to contain as ethnic albanians rushed kfor checkpoints established to protect serb enclaves , and un vehicles were reportedly torched in the capital pristina , according to beta news agency .
several medieval serb orthodox churches and monasteries were also allegedly set ablaze in central and eastern kosovo .
serbs demand retaliation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters celebrate in front of a burning mosque after a fire set by protesters took hold in the southern serbian town of nis .
meanwhile in belgrade , the capital of serbia-montenegro , demonstrators set the city 's 17th century mosque on fire after clashing with police trying to guard the building .
the angry mob demanded that the serbian government act to protect their orthodox christian kin from attacks by the primarily muslim kosovo-albanians .
a second mosque was torched in the southern serbian town of nis .
news reports from belgrade said more than 10,000 people rallied outside the serbian government building blocking main streets in the city center .
chanting , " we 'll go to kosovo " and " serbia rise up , " they demanded their leadership take action .
prime minister vojislav kostunica of serbia , to which kosovo belongs , appealed to his countrymen for an end to the violence and condemned what he called albanian terrorism .
" the events ... demonstrate the true nature of albanian separatism , its violent and terrorist character , " he said after an emergency cabinet meeting .
nato and un respond in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer called on both serbs and ethnic albanians to remain calm .
" i urge all ethnic communities in kosovska mitrovica and in the rest of kosovo to avoid further escalation , to act with calm and to refrain from demonstrations and roadblocks , " he said in a statement .
un secretary general kofi annan urged all parties to halt the violence , " which jeopardizes the stability of kosovo and the security of all its people . "
international troops have been in the region since 1999 when 78 days of nato bombing forced serbia to end its crackdown on separatists from kosovo 's ethnic albanians and brought an end to the conflict .
there are currently 17,000 kfor troops and 10,000 un and local police patrolling the province .
despite their significant presence , ethnic violence has repeatedly erupted , but wednesday 's outpouring was the bloodiest in the last three years and demonstrated the failure of international efforts to squelch ethnic hatreds and set the province on the path of reconciliation . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : damage control in kosovo at least 17 people were killed in riots in kosovo on wednesday .

the body 's chairman , nadeem elyas , told the berliner zeitung newspaper that legislation sanctioning or discriminating against muslims was rapidly passing through parliament .
he said suggestions that mosques be put under video surveillance were excessive and effectively made the majority of muslims feel hostile toward the state .
politicians ' failure to take confidence-building measures could cause muslims to lose faith in the state , elyas warned .
he said the muslim way of life should be accepted as long as it complies with the law , but he said he experienced the opposite in regard to recent legal decisions restricting the wearing headscarves and the ritual slaughter of livestock .
in an interview with german public broadcaster deutschlandradio on wednesday , elyas said the police had recently searched more than 80 mosques and thousands of offices and private homes but had found nothing .
they had only managed to alienate the muslim community .
nonetheless , elyas said " we must indeed try to exclude fringe groups and to win over the majority of german muslims as partners . "
elyas also sought to distance muslims living in germany from the recent wave of islamic fundamentalist violence . more briefs 18.03.2004 -pipe- liberals reject new anti-terror law 18.03.2004 -pipe- minister blames industry for emissions dispute 17.03.2004 -pipe- clement puts brakes on emissions compromise 17.03.2004 -pipe- german conservatives in disarray over köhler nomination 17.03.2004 -pipe- " florida rolf " to draw pension instead of dole 17.03.2004 -pipe- court : immigrants not allowed to move 16.03.2004 -pipe- german school bans belly-baring tops 16.03.2004 -pipe- two germans killed in iraq radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.03.2004 spain 's muslims : living on society 's edge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cordoba 's la mezquita cathedral was actually a muslim mosque until 1492 .
though islam is woven into the fabric of the country 's history , moroccans and other arabs living there today are struggling to find their place in society as well as their role in the muslim world . mustafa bougrine is a moroccan who has lived in spain for 19 years .
he 's married to a spanish woman and runs a restaurant .
he fears that a new feeling of islamophobia may be growing in the spanish population .
" when people hear the word ' islam ' , they think about bin laden , saddam hussein or gaddafi , but that 's not islam , " he says .
" i 'm against every form of fanaticism , suicide bombers and everything that is referred to as ' jihad ' .
muslims here in spain believe in democracy and peaceful coexistence between christians , jews and muslims . "
change is definitely brewing among madrid 's muslims .
the city 's lavapies neighborhood -lrb- see related link below -rrb- , where many immigrants live and the suspected culprits of the march 11 terrorist attacks ran a telephone shop , has practically come to a standstill .
the mosque on the m30 highway beltway is the largest in madrid .
but these days it 's conspicuously empty .
before last thursday 's terrorist attacks on the city , as many as 1,000 would come at a single time to pray here .
now it 's difficult to find more than 50 people who have come here to pray in the direction of mecca .
many muslims are staying home and out of the public eye as spanish investigators shift their focus from basque separatists toward the attack 's suspected moroccan culprits .
spanish newspapers are reporting sources alleging links between thursday 's terrorist attacks and bombings in casablanca last may that also killed dozens of spaniards .
the developments have sent shockwaves through spain 's muslim community , which is struggling to establish its own identity in a staunchly catholic country .
an influx of economic refugees close to 600,000 muslims live in spain , with the majority originating from northern africa 's maghreb countries , mostly morocco which is located just kilometers across the straight of gibraltar .
islam is not a new religion in spain .
no other european country has as many traces of the religion in its history .
for several hundred years , right up till the end of the 15th century , islam was a dominant presence on the iberian peninsula .
most of those living here today came during the 1980s .
their numbers grew in the 1990s as they took jobs in spain 's growing agricultural , construction , hospitality and service industry .
they are the silent majority of spain 's muslims .
many of the dominant voices heard in spain are those of spanish islam converts or leaders of islamic cultural centers financed by the saudi arabian government - groups that play a prominent role in negotiating the rights and duties of muslims within the spanish state .
finding their place but for most moroccans , eking out a living is the most important aspect of daily life .
through countless grassroots associations , moroccans in spain are fighting for their economic survival as well as the construction of mosques in their neighborhoods .
muhammad chouirdi works for the association of moroccan workers and immigrants .
he finds alarming the miserable circumstances under which his fellow countrymen are forced to fulfill their religious obligations .
strapped for cash , the temptation to take money from other arab groups is tempting , but the political dangers are considerable .
moroccan muslim leaders like chouidiri are also wary of other branches of islam , which they fear are being accepted uncritically by moroccan immigrants .
" we suspect that small moroccan living-room mosques on the outskirts of madrid are already receiving saudi arabian money , " chouirdi explains .
" by doing so , saudi arabia is trying to spread its form of islam and practices - primarily wahhabi muslim .
the probelm is that moroccan immigrants have a low level of education and there 's a danger that they will not recognize the danger of these religious practices .
for them , practicing islam means praying give times a day and following many rules .
what we get from the outside world - in this case from saudi arabia - is accepted with out critical discussion . "
islam from saudi arabia , with its fundamentalist characteristics , has spread in spain in recent years .
all the big representative mosques in spain were built with saudi money .
and frequently the saudis have also sent imams who interpret the quran according to the wahhabis .
wahhabism rejects all modernity , any dialogue between religions , any opening up to other cultures .
the breeding ground for last week 's attacks could have been here .
for both the culprits in the casablanca bombing in 2003 and the alleged perpetrators of the madrid attacks belong to terrorist groups that have been influenced by wahhabi ideologists .
a religious border now people are asking themselves how a minority in the muslim community could have become susceptible to islamist propaganda .
the disparities between spain 's catholic and muslim societies could provide some clues .
a look at ceuta , one of the two spanish cities on the moroccan mediterranean coast , is revealing .
ceuta is the gateway to europe .
the border between africa and europe , between islamic morocco and catholic spain , is here .
half of ceuta 's 72,000 residents are christian , while the other half are muslim , mainly of moroccan origin .
the chairman of islamic community of ceuta , abselam hamadi , says that many muslims still feel like second-class citizens , that they do n't have the same opportunities christians have .
" only few muslims get jobs in ceuta 's state administration .
the response is always the same : professional qualifications lacking .
that 's not the truth , of course .
but if more muslims were accepted , there would be more muslims than christians in the administration one day , and that scares the christians . "
the fact is , ceuta 's muslim residents have dramatically lower standards of living and levels of education than christian residents .
they mainly live in the el principe district , a poor , entirely muslim neighborhood right on the border to morocco , where integration does n't exist .
young muslims born in spain to moroccan parents live here .
they do n't feel moroccan , but they are n't fully accepted by spanish society either .
many fear the promises of the " real islamic message " may be received with open arms in communities like ceuta , creating the kind of dangerous backdrop that could breed future terrorism . bettina ambach -lrb- dsl / ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we can only pray it was n't them " madrid 's cosmopolitan lavapies neighborhood has long been a melting pot for arabs and other immigrants .
it was also home to the main suspect in thursday 's terrorist attacks - the deadliest in years .
-lrb- march 18 , 2004 -rrb- spain allegedly misled germany over bombings spanish authorities intentionally withheld information and misled german officials into believing the basque separatists eta were responsible for the madrid bombings , according to germany 's federal criminal bureau .
-lrb- march 17 , 2004 -rrb- spain 's socialists win elections anger over the government 's handling of a suspected al qaeda link in thursday 's bombings helped push the socialists back into power .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.03.2004 opinion : damage control in kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke billows from serbian orthodox church at least 17 people were killed in riots in kosovo on wednesday .
serbs and albanians have yet again spiralled into conflict , raising the question of what has really changed since the nato-led war against serbia in 1999 . overnight , the situation in kosovo has escalated , evoking memories of 1999 .
back then , nato decided to put an end to the persistent violence through air strikes .
an international peacekeeping force was deployed and kosovo was placed under a united nations mandate .
five years on , the question of the future status of kosovo remains unresolved .
in the eyes of albanians , kosovo should be made independent ; and in the view of serbs , it should remain part of a federation with serbia and montenegro .
the first important talks between the two sides have gotten underway in recent days to discuss important questions of principle , like the fate of missing people and how to ensure steady energy supplies in the region .
the international military presence , u.n. police and local security forces have ensured a certain level of peace .
but the latest violence is n't isolated to the disputed city of kosovska mitrovica , but has spread simultaneously to a number of places across kosovo following the circulation of unconfirmed reports about the violent deaths of albanian children .
additionally , serb extremists also set fire to mosques in belgrade and nis .
conflict also erupted between albanians and serbs during protests across the country .
kfor soldiers and un police were also attacked as the chaos spread .
since the end of the 1999 war , such incidents have happened with increasing regularity .
but this time the violence was loaded with such intensity that it should have sounded a sharp alarm in the international community - for this time the turbulence is escalating almost simultaneously in many places in kosovo and it is encroaching on serbia and montenegro .
an even worse suspicion is now arising : was this a directed escalation of violence ?
was it orchestrated by extremist groups on both sides who have been waiting for the right pretext to fuel the conflict with all of their power just days before the anniversary of the kosovo war ?
kosovo no longer dominates the headlines in the international press , but that does n't mean things have changed for the better . democratic structures and a culture of dialog have not yet developed .
and the cause of the current conflict - the political battle over the future of kosovo - has been put off .
the international community is hoping that the situation will simmer down further so that a solution to the political issues can be settled more easily .
but the contrary appears to be the case : the postponement of the status question is engendering bitterness on all sides of the debate . the political environment has also changed .
serbia now has a new nationalist conservative government that is being tolerated by milosevic 's socialists .
it has left no doubt that it is unwilling to compromise on the status question .
meanwhile , the confidence of albanians in kosovo has increased and the un administration has transferred to them some competencies .
the kosovars have stood firm on their position for some time now , too : the future of kosovo lies in independence and there wo n't and ca n't be any compromise with belgrade .
an agreement on the future of kosovo remains elusive even now , five years after the last bombs were dropped .
the latest problems show that even a mere spark is enough to set barricades and houses of worship ablaze .
that 's how it was in 1999 and that 's how it is again today .
kosovo is still far away from a peaceful future .
and if the serbs and albanians are unwilling to compromise , then there 's little more the international community can do than merely control the damage .
thus , sovereignty remains a pipe dream for serbs and albanians . bernd johann -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato sends reinforcements to kosovo a day after serbs and ethnic albanians clashed in kosovo , the united states and britain revealed that they would send reinforcements to bolster the nato force struggling to return the region to calm .

serbs and albanians have yet again spiralled into conflict , raising the question of what has really changed since the nato-led war against serbia in 1999 . overnight , the situation in kosovo has escalated , evoking memories of 1999 .
back then , nato decided to put an end to the persistent violence through air strikes .
an international peacekeeping force was deployed and kosovo was placed under a united nations mandate .
five years on , the question of the future status of kosovo remains unresolved .
in the eyes of albanians , kosovo should be made independent ; and in the view of serbs , it should remain part of a federation with serbia and montenegro .
the first important talks between the two sides have gotten underway in recent days to discuss important questions of principle , like the fate of missing people and how to ensure steady energy supplies in the region .
the international military presence , u.n. police and local security forces have ensured a certain level of peace .
but the latest violence is n't isolated to the disputed city of kosovska mitrovica , but has spread simultaneously to a number of places across kosovo following the circulation of unconfirmed reports about the violent deaths of albanian children .
additionally , serb extremists also set fire to mosques in belgrade and nis .
conflict also erupted between albanians and serbs during protests across the country .
kfor soldiers and un police were also attacked as the chaos spread .
since the end of the 1999 war , such incidents have happened with increasing regularity .
but this time the violence was loaded with such intensity that it should have sounded a sharp alarm in the international community - for this time the turbulence is escalating almost simultaneously in many places in kosovo and it is encroaching on serbia and montenegro .
an even worse suspicion is now arising : was this a directed escalation of violence ?
was it orchestrated by extremist groups on both sides who have been waiting for the right pretext to fuel the conflict with all of their power just days before the anniversary of the kosovo war ?
kosovo no longer dominates the headlines in the international press , but that does n't mean things have changed for the better . democratic structures and a culture of dialog have not yet developed .
and the cause of the current conflict - the political battle over the future of kosovo - has been put off .
the international community is hoping that the situation will simmer down further so that a solution to the political issues can be settled more easily .
but the contrary appears to be the case : the postponement of the status question is engendering bitterness on all sides of the debate . the political environment has also changed .
serbia now has a new nationalist conservative government that is being tolerated by milosevic 's socialists .
it has left no doubt that it is unwilling to compromise on the status question .
meanwhile , the confidence of albanians in kosovo has increased and the un administration has transferred to them some competencies .
the kosovars have stood firm on their position for some time now , too : the future of kosovo lies in independence and there wo n't and ca n't be any compromise with belgrade .
an agreement on the future of kosovo remains elusive even now , five years after the last bombs were dropped .
the latest problems show that even a mere spark is enough to set barricades and houses of worship ablaze .
that 's how it was in 1999 and that 's how it is again today .
kosovo is still far away from a peaceful future .
and if the serbs and albanians are unwilling to compromise , then there 's little more the international community can do than merely control the damage .
thus , sovereignty remains a pipe dream for serbs and albanians . bernd johann -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato sends reinforcements to kosovo a day after serbs and ethnic albanians clashed in kosovo , the united states and britain revealed that they would send reinforcements to bolster the nato force struggling to return the region to calm .

the first important talks between the two sides have gotten underway in recent days to discuss important questions of principle , like the fate of missing people and how to ensure steady energy supplies in the region .
the international military presence , u.n. police and local security forces have ensured a certain level of peace .
but the latest violence is n't isolated to the disputed city of kosovska mitrovica , but has spread simultaneously to a number of places across kosovo following the circulation of unconfirmed reports about the violent deaths of albanian children .
additionally , serb extremists also set fire to mosques in belgrade and nis .
conflict also erupted between albanians and serbs during protests across the country .
kfor soldiers and un police were also attacked as the chaos spread .
since the end of the 1999 war , such incidents have happened with increasing regularity .
but this time the violence was loaded with such intensity that it should have sounded a sharp alarm in the international community - for this time the turbulence is escalating almost simultaneously in many places in kosovo and it is encroaching on serbia and montenegro .
an even worse suspicion is now arising : was this a directed escalation of violence ?
was it orchestrated by extremist groups on both sides who have been waiting for the right pretext to fuel the conflict with all of their power just days before the anniversary of the kosovo war ?
kosovo no longer dominates the headlines in the international press , but that does n't mean things have changed for the better . democratic structures and a culture of dialog have not yet developed .
and the cause of the current conflict - the political battle over the future of kosovo - has been put off .
the international community is hoping that the situation will simmer down further so that a solution to the political issues can be settled more easily .
but the contrary appears to be the case : the postponement of the status question is engendering bitterness on all sides of the debate . the political environment has also changed .
serbia now has a new nationalist conservative government that is being tolerated by milosevic 's socialists .
it has left no doubt that it is unwilling to compromise on the status question .
meanwhile , the confidence of albanians in kosovo has increased and the un administration has transferred to them some competencies .
the kosovars have stood firm on their position for some time now , too : the future of kosovo lies in independence and there wo n't and ca n't be any compromise with belgrade .
an agreement on the future of kosovo remains elusive even now , five years after the last bombs were dropped .
the latest problems show that even a mere spark is enough to set barricades and houses of worship ablaze .
that 's how it was in 1999 and that 's how it is again today .
kosovo is still far away from a peaceful future .

kosovo no longer dominates the headlines in the international press , but that does n't mean things have changed for the better . democratic structures and a culture of dialog have not yet developed .
and the cause of the current conflict - the political battle over the future of kosovo - has been put off .
the international community is hoping that the situation will simmer down further so that a solution to the political issues can be settled more easily .
but the contrary appears to be the case : the postponement of the status question is engendering bitterness on all sides of the debate . the political environment has also changed .
serbia now has a new nationalist conservative government that is being tolerated by milosevic 's socialists .
it has left no doubt that it is unwilling to compromise on the status question .
meanwhile , the confidence of albanians in kosovo has increased and the un administration has transferred to them some competencies .
the kosovars have stood firm on their position for some time now , too : the future of kosovo lies in independence and there wo n't and ca n't be any compromise with belgrade .
an agreement on the future of kosovo remains elusive even now , five years after the last bombs were dropped .
the latest problems show that even a mere spark is enough to set barricades and houses of worship ablaze .
that 's how it was in 1999 and that 's how it is again today .
kosovo is still far away from a peaceful future .
and if the serbs and albanians are unwilling to compromise , then there 's little more the international community can do than merely control the damage .
thus , sovereignty remains a pipe dream for serbs and albanians . bernd johann -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato sends reinforcements to kosovo a day after serbs and ethnic albanians clashed in kosovo , the united states and britain revealed that they would send reinforcements to bolster the nato force struggling to return the region to calm .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.03.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc brussels defends controversial budget plans the european commission on wednesday hit back furiously at proposals by six member states to cap the eu budget .
the proposals , drawn up by france , germany , the uk , sweden , austria and the netherlands , would limit eu funds for 2007 to 2013 to one percent of gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- , rather than 1.27 percent of gni .
but budget commissioner michaele schreyer on thursday described the idea as " completely untenable . "
speaking before the budget committee in the european parliament , she warned that the proposals would mean an actual spending cut of ten percent and said , " we could n't continue with european integration " in this scenario .
" you would have less europe " , she continued , " and the commission is of the opinion that we have to say ' absolutely no ' to less europe . "
together with five other commissioners , schreyer defends plans to increase the money made available b eu members states for further union projects from 133 billion euro in 2007 to 158 billion in 2013 .
pointing to sharp rises in spending on justice and home affairs issues , the commissioner for this area , antonio vitorino said , " i believe this brings europe closer to its citizens ... it is quite clear that this is an area where operational responses will be needed after 2007 . "
trade commissioner pascal lamy justified the spending on external relations by saying , " the eu is only important if it can act outside the union . "
but the european commission 's proposals need to be agreed unanimously by member states and bitter fights are in the offing .
with the commission standing firm on their proposals and the powerful " group of six " equally unshakeable , the debate is already off on a difficult start .

a day after serbs and ethnic albanians clashed in kosovo , the united states and britain revealed they would send reinforcements to bolster the nato force struggling to restore calm in the region . the united states and britain are sending extra troops to kosovo as part of the nato effort to quell unrest in the mainly ethnic albanian serbian province , where violence has killed 22 people in the past 24 hours . " we are continuing to monitor the situation closely .
we are working with nato to deploy additional forces as a precaution .
one u.s. company is en route as part of a 350-strong nato force , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan told reporters traveling to kentucky with u.s. president george w. bush .
" we continue to call on all groups to end the violence and refrain from violence . " britain also dispatched a force of 750 rapid reaction troops to kosovo as nato officials revealed that up to 1,000 extra soldiers could be dispatched to kosovo to bolster its 17,000 strong force after it emerged that 35 nato troops had been injured in the violence . nato 's top military commander in europe , u.s. general james jones , expressed concern about the flare-up .
" i call on the leaders of both sides of the conflict to take decisive action to control immediately their citizens and return to the rule of law , " he said , describing the extra troop deployments as a " prudent reinforcement . "
violence flared on wednesday as the un-administered serbian province of kosovo became embroiled in some of the worst outpourings of violence between ethnic albanians and serbs in three years .
the conflict broke out early wednesday morning amid reports that serbs in a village near kosovska mitrovica set a dog on a group of ethnic albanian boys , forcing them to flee into an icy river where they drowned .
after authorities recovered the bodies , kosovo-albanians and serbs faced off against each other near a bridge over the ibar river that divides the city - long a flashpoint of ethnic tensions - and traded insults , threw rocks and charged at each other several times before gunfire broke out .
nato-led peacekeepers and rumanian special police units in riot gear moved in , firing tear gas , rubber bullets and stun grenades to stop ethnic albanians from rushing across the bridge toward the serb side of the city .
official reports said six ethnic albanians and two serbs were killed in the clash in kosovska mitrovica .
seven police officers and 11 french kfor soldiers were also injured .
flashpoint of ethnic tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kosovo police officer stands guard near damaged cars and apartments in a mainly serb neighborhood in the kosovo capital pristina .
with emotions running high in the volatile region , the conflict quickly fanned out , spilling over into other towns where serb homes , churches and cars were set on fire as ethnic albanians sought revenge .
in the central kosovo town of lipljan , four serbs were killed late wednesday and three others died in the eastern town of gnjilane as nato and un troops struggled to stop the violence .
but during the course of the day , events became too much for the international peacekeepers to contain as ethnic albanians rushed kfor checkpoints established to protect serb enclaves , and un vehicles were reportedly torched in the capital pristina , according to beta news agency .

meanwhile in belgrade , the capital of serbia-montenegro , demonstrators set the city 's 17th century mosque on fire after clashing with police trying to guard the building .
the angry mob demanded that the serbian government act to protect their orthodox christian kin from attacks by the primarily muslim kosovo-albanians .
a second mosque was torched in the southern serbian town of nis .
news reports from belgrade said more than 10,000 people rallied outside the serbian government building blocking main streets in the city center .
chanting , " we 'll go to kosovo " and " serbia rise up , " they demanded their leadership take action .
prime minister vojislav kostunica of serbia , to which kosovo belongs , appealed to his countrymen for an end to the violence and condemned what he called albanian terrorism .
" the events ... demonstrate the true nature of albanian separatism , its violent and terrorist character , " he said after an emergency cabinet meeting .
nato and un respond in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer called on both serbs and ethnic albanians to remain calm .
" i urge all ethnic communities in kosovska mitrovica and in the rest of kosovo to avoid further escalation , to act with calm and to refrain from demonstrations and roadblocks , " he said in a statement .
un secretary general kofi annan urged all parties to halt the violence , " which jeopardizes the stability of kosovo and the security of all its people . "
international troops have been in the region since 1999 when 78 days of nato bombing forced serbia to end its crackdown on separatists from kosovo 's ethnic albanians and brought an end to the conflict .
there are currently 17,000 kfor troops and 10,000 un and local police patrolling the province .
despite their significant presence , ethnic violence has repeatedly erupted , but wednesday 's outpouring was the bloodiest in the last three years and demonstrated the failure of international efforts to squelch ethnic hatreds and set the province on the path of reconciliation . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : damage control in kosovo at least 17 people were killed in riots in kosovo on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.03.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc brussels defends controversial budget plans the european commission on wednesday hit back furiously at proposals by six member states to cap the eu budget .
the proposals , drawn up by france , germany , the uk , sweden , austria and the netherlands , would limit eu funds for 2007 to 2013 to one percent of gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- , rather than 1.27 percent of gni .
but budget commissioner michaele schreyer on thursday described the idea as " completely untenable . "
speaking before the budget committee in the european parliament , she warned that the proposals would mean an actual spending cut of ten percent and said , " we could n't continue with european integration " in this scenario .
" you would have less europe " , she continued , " and the commission is of the opinion that we have to say ' absolutely no ' to less europe . "
together with five other commissioners , schreyer defends plans to increase the money made available b eu members states for further union projects from 133 billion euro in 2007 to 158 billion in 2013 .
pointing to sharp rises in spending on justice and home affairs issues , the commissioner for this area , antonio vitorino said , " i believe this brings europe closer to its citizens ... it is quite clear that this is an area where operational responses will be needed after 2007 . "
trade commissioner pascal lamy justified the spending on external relations by saying , " the eu is only important if it can act outside the union . "
but the european commission 's proposals need to be agreed unanimously by member states and bitter fights are in the offing .
with the commission standing firm on their proposals and the powerful " group of six " equally unshakeable , the debate is already off on a difficult start .

a day after serbs and ethnic albanians clashed in kosovo , the united states and britain revealed they would send reinforcements to bolster the nato force struggling to restore calm in the region . the united states and britain are sending extra troops to kosovo as part of the nato effort to quell unrest in the mainly ethnic albanian serbian province , where violence has killed 22 people in the past 24 hours . " we are continuing to monitor the situation closely .
we are working with nato to deploy additional forces as a precaution .
one u.s. company is en route as part of a 350-strong nato force , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan told reporters traveling to kentucky with u.s. president george w. bush .
" we continue to call on all groups to end the violence and refrain from violence . " britain also dispatched a force of 750 rapid reaction troops to kosovo as nato officials revealed that up to 1,000 extra soldiers could be dispatched to kosovo to bolster its 17,000 strong force after it emerged that 35 nato troops had been injured in the violence . nato 's top military commander in europe , u.s. general james jones , expressed concern about the flare-up .
" i call on the leaders of both sides of the conflict to take decisive action to control immediately their citizens and return to the rule of law , " he said , describing the extra troop deployments as a " prudent reinforcement . "
violence flared on wednesday as the un-administered serbian province of kosovo became embroiled in some of the worst outpourings of violence between ethnic albanians and serbs in three years .
the conflict broke out early wednesday morning amid reports that serbs in a village near kosovska mitrovica set a dog on a group of ethnic albanian boys , forcing them to flee into an icy river where they drowned .
after authorities recovered the bodies , kosovo-albanians and serbs faced off against each other near a bridge over the ibar river that divides the city - long a flashpoint of ethnic tensions - and traded insults , threw rocks and charged at each other several times before gunfire broke out .
nato-led peacekeepers and rumanian special police units in riot gear moved in , firing tear gas , rubber bullets and stun grenades to stop ethnic albanians from rushing across the bridge toward the serb side of the city .
official reports said six ethnic albanians and two serbs were killed in the clash in kosovska mitrovica .
seven police officers and 11 french kfor soldiers were also injured .
flashpoint of ethnic tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kosovo police officer stands guard near damaged cars and apartments in a mainly serb neighborhood in the kosovo capital pristina .
with emotions running high in the volatile region , the conflict quickly fanned out , spilling over into other towns where serb homes , churches and cars were set on fire as ethnic albanians sought revenge .
in the central kosovo town of lipljan , four serbs were killed late wednesday and three others died in the eastern town of gnjilane as nato and un troops struggled to stop the violence .
but during the course of the day , events became too much for the international peacekeepers to contain as ethnic albanians rushed kfor checkpoints established to protect serb enclaves , and un vehicles were reportedly torched in the capital pristina , according to beta news agency .
several medieval serb orthodox churches and monasteries were also allegedly set ablaze in central and eastern kosovo .
serbs demand retaliation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters celebrate in front of a burning mosque after a fire set by protesters took hold in the southern serbian town of nis .
meanwhile in belgrade , the capital of serbia-montenegro , demonstrators set the city 's 17th century mosque on fire after clashing with police trying to guard the building .
the angry mob demanded that the serbian government act to protect their orthodox christian kin from attacks by the primarily muslim kosovo-albanians .
a second mosque was torched in the southern serbian town of nis .
news reports from belgrade said more than 10,000 people rallied outside the serbian government building blocking main streets in the city center .
chanting , " we 'll go to kosovo " and " serbia rise up , " they demanded their leadership take action .
prime minister vojislav kostunica of serbia , to which kosovo belongs , appealed to his countrymen for an end to the violence and condemned what he called albanian terrorism .
" the events ... demonstrate the true nature of albanian separatism , its violent and terrorist character , " he said after an emergency cabinet meeting .
nato and un respond in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer called on both serbs and ethnic albanians to remain calm .
" i urge all ethnic communities in kosovska mitrovica and in the rest of kosovo to avoid further escalation , to act with calm and to refrain from demonstrations and roadblocks , " he said in a statement .
un secretary general kofi annan urged all parties to halt the violence , " which jeopardizes the stability of kosovo and the security of all its people . "
international troops have been in the region since 1999 when 78 days of nato bombing forced serbia to end its crackdown on separatists from kosovo 's ethnic albanians and brought an end to the conflict .
there are currently 17,000 kfor troops and 10,000 un and local police patrolling the province .
despite their significant presence , ethnic violence has repeatedly erupted , but wednesday 's outpouring was the bloodiest in the last three years and demonstrated the failure of international efforts to squelch ethnic hatreds and set the province on the path of reconciliation . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : damage control in kosovo at least 17 people were killed in riots in kosovo on wednesday .

a day after serbs and ethnic albanians clashed in kosovo , the united states and britain revealed they would send reinforcements to bolster the nato force struggling to restore calm in the region . the united states and britain are sending extra troops to kosovo as part of the nato effort to quell unrest in the mainly ethnic albanian serbian province , where violence has killed 22 people in the past 24 hours . " we are continuing to monitor the situation closely .
we are working with nato to deploy additional forces as a precaution .
one u.s. company is en route as part of a 350-strong nato force , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan told reporters traveling to kentucky with u.s. president george w. bush .
" we continue to call on all groups to end the violence and refrain from violence . " britain also dispatched a force of 750 rapid reaction troops to kosovo as nato officials revealed that up to 1,000 extra soldiers could be dispatched to kosovo to bolster its 17,000 strong force after it emerged that 35 nato troops had been injured in the violence . nato 's top military commander in europe , u.s. general james jones , expressed concern about the flare-up .
" i call on the leaders of both sides of the conflict to take decisive action to control immediately their citizens and return to the rule of law , " he said , describing the extra troop deployments as a " prudent reinforcement . "
violence flared on wednesday as the un-administered serbian province of kosovo became embroiled in some of the worst outpourings of violence between ethnic albanians and serbs in three years .
the conflict broke out early wednesday morning amid reports that serbs in a village near kosovska mitrovica set a dog on a group of ethnic albanian boys , forcing them to flee into an icy river where they drowned .
after authorities recovered the bodies , kosovo-albanians and serbs faced off against each other near a bridge over the ibar river that divides the city - long a flashpoint of ethnic tensions - and traded insults , threw rocks and charged at each other several times before gunfire broke out .
nato-led peacekeepers and rumanian special police units in riot gear moved in , firing tear gas , rubber bullets and stun grenades to stop ethnic albanians from rushing across the bridge toward the serb side of the city .
official reports said six ethnic albanians and two serbs were killed in the clash in kosovska mitrovica .
seven police officers and 11 french kfor soldiers were also injured .
flashpoint of ethnic tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kosovo police officer stands guard near damaged cars and apartments in a mainly serb neighborhood in the kosovo capital pristina .
with emotions running high in the volatile region , the conflict quickly fanned out , spilling over into other towns where serb homes , churches and cars were set on fire as ethnic albanians sought revenge .
in the central kosovo town of lipljan , four serbs were killed late wednesday and three others died in the eastern town of gnjilane as nato and un troops struggled to stop the violence .
but during the course of the day , events became too much for the international peacekeepers to contain as ethnic albanians rushed kfor checkpoints established to protect serb enclaves , and un vehicles were reportedly torched in the capital pristina , according to beta news agency .
several medieval serb orthodox churches and monasteries were also allegedly set ablaze in central and eastern kosovo .
serbs demand retaliation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters celebrate in front of a burning mosque after a fire set by protesters took hold in the southern serbian town of nis .
meanwhile in belgrade , the capital of serbia-montenegro , demonstrators set the city 's 17th century mosque on fire after clashing with police trying to guard the building .
the angry mob demanded that the serbian government act to protect their orthodox christian kin from attacks by the primarily muslim kosovo-albanians .
a second mosque was torched in the southern serbian town of nis .
news reports from belgrade said more than 10,000 people rallied outside the serbian government building blocking main streets in the city center .
chanting , " we 'll go to kosovo " and " serbia rise up , " they demanded their leadership take action .
prime minister vojislav kostunica of serbia , to which kosovo belongs , appealed to his countrymen for an end to the violence and condemned what he called albanian terrorism .
" the events ... demonstrate the true nature of albanian separatism , its violent and terrorist character , " he said after an emergency cabinet meeting .
nato and un respond in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer called on both serbs and ethnic albanians to remain calm .
" i urge all ethnic communities in kosovska mitrovica and in the rest of kosovo to avoid further escalation , to act with calm and to refrain from demonstrations and roadblocks , " he said in a statement .
un secretary general kofi annan urged all parties to halt the violence , " which jeopardizes the stability of kosovo and the security of all its people . "
international troops have been in the region since 1999 when 78 days of nato bombing forced serbia to end its crackdown on separatists from kosovo 's ethnic albanians and brought an end to the conflict .
there are currently 17,000 kfor troops and 10,000 un and local police patrolling the province .
despite their significant presence , ethnic violence has repeatedly erupted , but wednesday 's outpouring was the bloodiest in the last three years and demonstrated the failure of international efforts to squelch ethnic hatreds and set the province on the path of reconciliation . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : damage control in kosovo at least 17 people were killed in riots in kosovo on wednesday .
serbs and albanians have yet again spiralled into conflict , raising the question of what has really changed since the nato-led war against serbia in 1999 .

the proposals , drawn up by france , germany , the uk , sweden , austria and the netherlands , would limit eu funds for 2007 to 2013 to one percent of gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- , rather than 1.27 percent of gni .
but budget commissioner michaele schreyer on thursday described the idea as " completely untenable . "
speaking before the budget committee in the european parliament , she warned that the proposals would mean an actual spending cut of ten percent and said , " we could n't continue with european integration " in this scenario .
" you would have less europe " , she continued , " and the commission is of the opinion that we have to say ' absolutely no ' to less europe . "
together with five other commissioners , schreyer defends plans to increase the money made available b eu members states for further union projects from 133 billion euro in 2007 to 158 billion in 2013 .
pointing to sharp rises in spending on justice and home affairs issues , the commissioner for this area , antonio vitorino said , " i believe this brings europe closer to its citizens ... it is quite clear that this is an area where operational responses will be needed after 2007 . "
trade commissioner pascal lamy justified the spending on external relations by saying , " the eu is only important if it can act outside the union . "
but the european commission 's proposals need to be agreed unanimously by member states and bitter fights are in the offing .
with the commission standing firm on their proposals and the powerful " group of six " equally unshakeable , the debate is already off on a difficult start .

federal and regional german politicians are working on plans to overhaul the country 's domestic intelligence service to be better able to combat terrorism and avoid attacks similar to the madrid bombings last week . presently , germany 's domestic intelligence agency , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , is split among 16 different bureaus in each of the country 's federal states .
long considered by some security experts as inefficient and unwieldy , the deadly terrorist attacks in spain have increased pressure to overhaul its structure . " there is more openness than before regarding the question whether the smaller state offices could find new ways to cooperate , " chancellery official frank-walter steinmeier told the financial times deutschland on wednesday .
" if the states are prepared to give up competencies then its a suggestion that can be discussed . " although some conservative politicians are calling for completely abolishing the state offices in favor of a centralized federal authority , it 's more likely that they will be folded into four or more regional departments .
there are also proposals to merge germany 's federal police -lrb- bka -rrb- with border control and customs services . " germany 's fragmented system dates back to the cold war when fighting domestic militants was the priority , " said frank umbach from the german council on foreign relations , according to the reuters news agency .
" now we have to deal with international terrorism . " affordable experts some of the largest states like north-rhine-westphalia and bavaria remain keen to keep their bfv bureaus in tact , but many smaller and poorer states hope greater cooperation would make it easier to afford expensive equipment or specialized personnel such as arabic experts . although germany opposed the u.s.-led war in iraq , few security experts doubt that the country is a target for islamic extremists .
in particular , germany 's role in stabilizing afghanistan angers the al qaeda terror network of osama bin laden .
and several of the terrorists involved in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states were part of a terror cell based in the northern german city of hamburg . besides considering a revamp of its own domestic intelligence agency , germany is pushing for greater cooperation at the european level .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.03.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc brussels defends controversial budget plans the european commission on wednesday hit back furiously at proposals by six member states to cap the eu budget .
the proposals , drawn up by france , germany , the uk , sweden , austria and the netherlands , would limit eu funds for 2007 to 2013 to one percent of gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- , rather than 1.27 percent of gni .
but budget commissioner michaele schreyer on thursday described the idea as " completely untenable . "
speaking before the budget committee in the european parliament , she warned that the proposals would mean an actual spending cut of ten percent and said , " we could n't continue with european integration " in this scenario .
" you would have less europe " , she continued , " and the commission is of the opinion that we have to say ' absolutely no ' to less europe . "
together with five other commissioners , schreyer defends plans to increase the money made available b eu members states for further union projects from 133 billion euro in 2007 to 158 billion in 2013 .
pointing to sharp rises in spending on justice and home affairs issues , the commissioner for this area , antonio vitorino said , " i believe this brings europe closer to its citizens ... it is quite clear that this is an area where operational responses will be needed after 2007 . "
trade commissioner pascal lamy justified the spending on external relations by saying , " the eu is only important if it can act outside the union . "
but the european commission 's proposals need to be agreed unanimously by member states and bitter fights are in the offing .
with the commission standing firm on their proposals and the powerful " group of six " equally unshakeable , the debate is already off on a difficult start .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.03.2004 germany to revamp domestic intelligence service großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily supports the move .
federal and regional german politicians are working on plans to overhaul the country 's domestic intelligence service to be better able to combat terrorism and avoid attacks similar to the madrid bombings last week . presently , germany 's domestic intelligence agency , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , is split among 16 different bureaus in each of the country 's federal states .
long considered by some security experts as inefficient and unwieldy , the deadly terrorist attacks in spain have increased pressure to overhaul its structure . " there is more openness than before regarding the question whether the smaller state offices could find new ways to cooperate , " chancellery official frank-walter steinmeier told the financial times deutschland on wednesday .
" if the states are prepared to give up competencies then its a suggestion that can be discussed . " although some conservative politicians are calling for completely abolishing the state offices in favor of a centralized federal authority , it 's more likely that they will be folded into four or more regional departments .
there are also proposals to merge germany 's federal police -lrb- bka -rrb- with border control and customs services . " germany 's fragmented system dates back to the cold war when fighting domestic militants was the priority , " said frank umbach from the german council on foreign relations , according to the reuters news agency .
" now we have to deal with international terrorism . " affordable experts some of the largest states like north-rhine-westphalia and bavaria remain keen to keep their bfv bureaus in tact , but many smaller and poorer states hope greater cooperation would make it easier to afford expensive equipment or specialized personnel such as arabic experts . although germany opposed the u.s.-led war in iraq , few security experts doubt that the country is a target for islamic extremists .
in particular , germany 's role in stabilizing afghanistan angers the al qaeda terror network of osama bin laden .
and several of the terrorists involved in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states were part of a terror cell based in the northern german city of hamburg . besides considering a revamp of its own domestic intelligence agency , germany is pushing for greater cooperation at the european level .
after the bombings in madrid , german interior minister otto schily called for a ministerial summit on security in brussels that will be held on friday . steinmeier from the chancellery told the ftd that berlin supported the idea of creating an eu collection point for information collected by domestic intelligence agency , underscoring plans announced on tuesday by french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder to step up joint efforts to combat terrorism . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security discussions rage across europe european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil .
-lrb- march 17 , 2004 -rrb- security dominates franco-german talks in the wake of the madrid bombings , germany 's gerhard schröder and france 's jacques chirac have vowed to increase anti-terror measures and pledged to stamp out the root causes - including poverty and underdevelopment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.03.2004 opinion : damage control in kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke billows from serbian orthodox church at least 17 people were killed in riots in kosovo on wednesday .
serbs and albanians have yet again spiralled into conflict , raising the question of what has really changed since the nato-led war against serbia in 1999 . overnight , the situation in kosovo has escalated , evoking memories of 1999 .
back then , nato decided to put an end to the persistent violence through air strikes .
an international peacekeeping force was deployed and kosovo was placed under a united nations mandate .
five years on , the question of the future status of kosovo remains unresolved .
in the eyes of albanians , kosovo should be made independent ; and in the view of serbs , it should remain part of a federation with serbia and montenegro .
the first important talks between the two sides have gotten underway in recent days to discuss important questions of principle , like the fate of missing people and how to ensure steady energy supplies in the region .
the international military presence , u.n. police and local security forces have ensured a certain level of peace .
but the latest violence is n't isolated to the disputed city of kosovska mitrovica , but has spread simultaneously to a number of places across kosovo following the circulation of unconfirmed reports about the violent deaths of albanian children .
additionally , serb extremists also set fire to mosques in belgrade and nis .
conflict also erupted between albanians and serbs during protests across the country .
kfor soldiers and un police were also attacked as the chaos spread .
since the end of the 1999 war , such incidents have happened with increasing regularity .
but this time the violence was loaded with such intensity that it should have sounded a sharp alarm in the international community - for this time the turbulence is escalating almost simultaneously in many places in kosovo and it is encroaching on serbia and montenegro .
an even worse suspicion is now arising : was this a directed escalation of violence ?
was it orchestrated by extremist groups on both sides who have been waiting for the right pretext to fuel the conflict with all of their power just days before the anniversary of the kosovo war ?
kosovo no longer dominates the headlines in the international press , but that does n't mean things have changed for the better . democratic structures and a culture of dialog have not yet developed .
and the cause of the current conflict - the political battle over the future of kosovo - has been put off .
the international community is hoping that the situation will simmer down further so that a solution to the political issues can be settled more easily .
but the contrary appears to be the case : the postponement of the status question is engendering bitterness on all sides of the debate . the political environment has also changed .
serbia now has a new nationalist conservative government that is being tolerated by milosevic 's socialists .
it has left no doubt that it is unwilling to compromise on the status question .
meanwhile , the confidence of albanians in kosovo has increased and the un administration has transferred to them some competencies .
the kosovars have stood firm on their position for some time now , too : the future of kosovo lies in independence and there wo n't and ca n't be any compromise with belgrade .
an agreement on the future of kosovo remains elusive even now , five years after the last bombs were dropped .
the latest problems show that even a mere spark is enough to set barricades and houses of worship ablaze .
that 's how it was in 1999 and that 's how it is again today .
kosovo is still far away from a peaceful future .
and if the serbs and albanians are unwilling to compromise , then there 's little more the international community can do than merely control the damage .
thus , sovereignty remains a pipe dream for serbs and albanians . bernd johann -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato sends reinforcements to kosovo a day after serbs and ethnic albanians clashed in kosovo , the united states and britain revealed that they would send reinforcements to bolster the nato force struggling to return the region to calm .

serbs and albanians have yet again spiralled into conflict , raising the question of what has really changed since the nato-led war against serbia in 1999 . overnight , the situation in kosovo has escalated , evoking memories of 1999 .
back then , nato decided to put an end to the persistent violence through air strikes .
an international peacekeeping force was deployed and kosovo was placed under a united nations mandate .
five years on , the question of the future status of kosovo remains unresolved .
in the eyes of albanians , kosovo should be made independent ; and in the view of serbs , it should remain part of a federation with serbia and montenegro .
the first important talks between the two sides have gotten underway in recent days to discuss important questions of principle , like the fate of missing people and how to ensure steady energy supplies in the region .
the international military presence , u.n. police and local security forces have ensured a certain level of peace .
but the latest violence is n't isolated to the disputed city of kosovska mitrovica , but has spread simultaneously to a number of places across kosovo following the circulation of unconfirmed reports about the violent deaths of albanian children .
additionally , serb extremists also set fire to mosques in belgrade and nis .
conflict also erupted between albanians and serbs during protests across the country .
kfor soldiers and un police were also attacked as the chaos spread .
since the end of the 1999 war , such incidents have happened with increasing regularity .
but this time the violence was loaded with such intensity that it should have sounded a sharp alarm in the international community - for this time the turbulence is escalating almost simultaneously in many places in kosovo and it is encroaching on serbia and montenegro .
an even worse suspicion is now arising : was this a directed escalation of violence ?
was it orchestrated by extremist groups on both sides who have been waiting for the right pretext to fuel the conflict with all of their power just days before the anniversary of the kosovo war ?
kosovo no longer dominates the headlines in the international press , but that does n't mean things have changed for the better . democratic structures and a culture of dialog have not yet developed .
and the cause of the current conflict - the political battle over the future of kosovo - has been put off .
the international community is hoping that the situation will simmer down further so that a solution to the political issues can be settled more easily .
but the contrary appears to be the case : the postponement of the status question is engendering bitterness on all sides of the debate . the political environment has also changed .
serbia now has a new nationalist conservative government that is being tolerated by milosevic 's socialists .
it has left no doubt that it is unwilling to compromise on the status question .
meanwhile , the confidence of albanians in kosovo has increased and the un administration has transferred to them some competencies .
the kosovars have stood firm on their position for some time now , too : the future of kosovo lies in independence and there wo n't and ca n't be any compromise with belgrade .
an agreement on the future of kosovo remains elusive even now , five years after the last bombs were dropped .
the latest problems show that even a mere spark is enough to set barricades and houses of worship ablaze .
that 's how it was in 1999 and that 's how it is again today .
kosovo is still far away from a peaceful future .
and if the serbs and albanians are unwilling to compromise , then there 's little more the international community can do than merely control the damage .

federal and regional german politicians are working on plans to overhaul the country 's domestic intelligence service to be better able to combat terrorism and avoid attacks similar to the madrid bombings last week . presently , germany 's domestic intelligence agency , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , is split among 16 different bureaus in each of the country 's federal states .
long considered by some security experts as inefficient and unwieldy , the deadly terrorist attacks in spain have increased pressure to overhaul its structure .

" now we have to deal with international terrorism .

a day after serbs and ethnic albanians clashed in kosovo , the united states and britain revealed they would send reinforcements to bolster the nato force struggling to restore calm in the region . the united states and britain are sending extra troops to kosovo as part of the nato effort to quell unrest in the mainly ethnic albanian serbian province , where violence has killed 22 people in the past 24 hours . " we are continuing to monitor the situation closely .
we are working with nato to deploy additional forces as a precaution .
one u.s. company is en route as part of a 350-strong nato force , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan told reporters traveling to kentucky with u.s. president george w. bush .
" we continue to call on all groups to end the violence and refrain from violence . " britain also dispatched a force of 750 rapid reaction troops to kosovo as nato officials revealed that up to 1,000 extra soldiers could be dispatched to kosovo to bolster its 17,000 strong force after it emerged that 35 nato troops had been injured in the violence . nato 's top military commander in europe , u.s. general james jones , expressed concern about the flare-up .
" i call on the leaders of both sides of the conflict to take decisive action to control immediately their citizens and return to the rule of law , " he said , describing the extra troop deployments as a " prudent reinforcement . "
violence flared on wednesday as the un-administered serbian province of kosovo became embroiled in some of the worst outpourings of violence between ethnic albanians and serbs in three years .
the conflict broke out early wednesday morning amid reports that serbs in a village near kosovska mitrovica set a dog on a group of ethnic albanian boys , forcing them to flee into an icy river where they drowned .
after authorities recovered the bodies , kosovo-albanians and serbs faced off against each other near a bridge over the ibar river that divides the city - long a flashpoint of ethnic tensions - and traded insults , threw rocks and charged at each other several times before gunfire broke out .
nato-led peacekeepers and rumanian special police units in riot gear moved in , firing tear gas , rubber bullets and stun grenades to stop ethnic albanians from rushing across the bridge toward the serb side of the city .
official reports said six ethnic albanians and two serbs were killed in the clash in kosovska mitrovica .
seven police officers and 11 french kfor soldiers were also injured .
flashpoint of ethnic tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kosovo police officer stands guard near damaged cars and apartments in a mainly serb neighborhood in the kosovo capital pristina .
with emotions running high in the volatile region , the conflict quickly fanned out , spilling over into other towns where serb homes , churches and cars were set on fire as ethnic albanians sought revenge .
in the central kosovo town of lipljan , four serbs were killed late wednesday and three others died in the eastern town of gnjilane as nato and un troops struggled to stop the violence .
but during the course of the day , events became too much for the international peacekeepers to contain as ethnic albanians rushed kfor checkpoints established to protect serb enclaves , and un vehicles were reportedly torched in the capital pristina , according to beta news agency .
several medieval serb orthodox churches and monasteries were also allegedly set ablaze in central and eastern kosovo .
serbs demand retaliation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters celebrate in front of a burning mosque after a fire set by protesters took hold in the southern serbian town of nis .
meanwhile in belgrade , the capital of serbia-montenegro , demonstrators set the city 's 17th century mosque on fire after clashing with police trying to guard the building .
the angry mob demanded that the serbian government act to protect their orthodox christian kin from attacks by the primarily muslim kosovo-albanians .
a second mosque was torched in the southern serbian town of nis .
news reports from belgrade said more than 10,000 people rallied outside the serbian government building blocking main streets in the city center .
chanting , " we 'll go to kosovo " and " serbia rise up , " they demanded their leadership take action .
prime minister vojislav kostunica of serbia , to which kosovo belongs , appealed to his countrymen for an end to the violence and condemned what he called albanian terrorism .
" the events ... demonstrate the true nature of albanian separatism , its violent and terrorist character , " he said after an emergency cabinet meeting .
nato and un respond in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer called on both serbs and ethnic albanians to remain calm .
" i urge all ethnic communities in kosovska mitrovica and in the rest of kosovo to avoid further escalation , to act with calm and to refrain from demonstrations and roadblocks , " he said in a statement .
un secretary general kofi annan urged all parties to halt the violence , " which jeopardizes the stability of kosovo and the security of all its people . "
international troops have been in the region since 1999 when 78 days of nato bombing forced serbia to end its crackdown on separatists from kosovo 's ethnic albanians and brought an end to the conflict .
there are currently 17,000 kfor troops and 10,000 un and local police patrolling the province .
despite their significant presence , ethnic violence has repeatedly erupted , but wednesday 's outpouring was the bloodiest in the last three years and demonstrated the failure of international efforts to squelch ethnic hatreds and set the province on the path of reconciliation . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : damage control in kosovo at least 17 people were killed in riots in kosovo on wednesday .

though islam is woven into the fabric of the country 's history , moroccans and other arabs living there today are struggling to find their place in society as well as their role in the muslim world . mustafa bougrine is a moroccan who has lived in spain for 19 years .
he 's married to a spanish woman and runs a restaurant .
he fears that a new feeling of islamophobia may be growing in the spanish population .
" when people hear the word ' islam ' , they think about bin laden , saddam hussein or gaddafi , but that 's not islam , " he says .
" i 'm against every form of fanaticism , suicide bombers and everything that is referred to as ' jihad ' .
muslims here in spain believe in democracy and peaceful coexistence between christians , jews and muslims . "
change is definitely brewing among madrid 's muslims .
the city 's lavapies neighborhood -lrb- see related link below -rrb- , where many immigrants live and the suspected culprits of the march 11 terrorist attacks ran a telephone shop , has practically come to a standstill .
the mosque on the m30 highway beltway is the largest in madrid .
but these days it 's conspicuously empty .
before last thursday 's terrorist attacks on the city , as many as 1,000 would come at a single time to pray here .
now it 's difficult to find more than 50 people who have come here to pray in the direction of mecca .
many muslims are staying home and out of the public eye as spanish investigators shift their focus from basque separatists toward the attack 's suspected moroccan culprits .
spanish newspapers are reporting sources alleging links between thursday 's terrorist attacks and bombings in casablanca last may that also killed dozens of spaniards .
the developments have sent shockwaves through spain 's muslim community , which is struggling to establish its own identity in a staunchly catholic country .
an influx of economic refugees close to 600,000 muslims live in spain , with the majority originating from northern africa 's maghreb countries , mostly morocco which is located just kilometers across the straight of gibraltar .
islam is not a new religion in spain .
no other european country has as many traces of the religion in its history .
for several hundred years , right up till the end of the 15th century , islam was a dominant presence on the iberian peninsula .
most of those living here today came during the 1980s .
their numbers grew in the 1990s as they took jobs in spain 's growing agricultural , construction , hospitality and service industry .
they are the silent majority of spain 's muslims .
many of the dominant voices heard in spain are those of spanish islam converts or leaders of islamic cultural centers financed by the saudi arabian government - groups that play a prominent role in negotiating the rights and duties of muslims within the spanish state .
finding their place but for most moroccans , eking out a living is the most important aspect of daily life .
through countless grassroots associations , moroccans in spain are fighting for their economic survival as well as the construction of mosques in their neighborhoods .
muhammad chouirdi works for the association of moroccan workers and immigrants .
he finds alarming the miserable circumstances under which his fellow countrymen are forced to fulfill their religious obligations .
strapped for cash , the temptation to take money from other arab groups is tempting , but the political dangers are considerable .
moroccan muslim leaders like chouidiri are also wary of other branches of islam , which they fear are being accepted uncritically by moroccan immigrants .
" we suspect that small moroccan living-room mosques on the outskirts of madrid are already receiving saudi arabian money , " chouirdi explains .
" by doing so , saudi arabia is trying to spread its form of islam and practices - primarily wahhabi muslim .
the probelm is that moroccan immigrants have a low level of education and there 's a danger that they will not recognize the danger of these religious practices .
for them , practicing islam means praying give times a day and following many rules .
what we get from the outside world - in this case from saudi arabia - is accepted with out critical discussion . "
islam from saudi arabia , with its fundamentalist characteristics , has spread in spain in recent years .
all the big representative mosques in spain were built with saudi money .
and frequently the saudis have also sent imams who interpret the quran according to the wahhabis .
wahhabism rejects all modernity , any dialogue between religions , any opening up to other cultures .
the breeding ground for last week 's attacks could have been here .
for both the culprits in the casablanca bombing in 2003 and the alleged perpetrators of the madrid attacks belong to terrorist groups that have been influenced by wahhabi ideologists .
a religious border now people are asking themselves how a minority in the muslim community could have become susceptible to islamist propaganda .
the disparities between spain 's catholic and muslim societies could provide some clues .
a look at ceuta , one of the two spanish cities on the moroccan mediterranean coast , is revealing .
ceuta is the gateway to europe .
the border between africa and europe , between islamic morocco and catholic spain , is here .
half of ceuta 's 72,000 residents are christian , while the other half are muslim , mainly of moroccan origin .
the chairman of islamic community of ceuta , abselam hamadi , says that many muslims still feel like second-class citizens , that they do n't have the same opportunities christians have .
" only few muslims get jobs in ceuta 's state administration .
the response is always the same : professional qualifications lacking .
that 's not the truth , of course .
but if more muslims were accepted , there would be more muslims than christians in the administration one day , and that scares the christians . "
the fact is , ceuta 's muslim residents have dramatically lower standards of living and levels of education than christian residents .
they mainly live in the el principe district , a poor , entirely muslim neighborhood right on the border to morocco , where integration does n't exist .
young muslims born in spain to moroccan parents live here .
they do n't feel moroccan , but they are n't fully accepted by spanish society either .
many fear the promises of the " real islamic message " may be received with open arms in communities like ceuta , creating the kind of dangerous backdrop that could breed future terrorism . bettina ambach -lrb- dsl / ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we can only pray it was n't them " madrid 's cosmopolitan lavapies neighborhood has long been a melting pot for arabs and other immigrants .

madrid 's cosmopolitan lavapies neighborhood has long been a melting pot for arabs and other immigrants .
it was also home to the main suspect in thursday 's terrorist attacks - the deadliest in years . lavapies is a multicultural neighborhood located in the heart of madrid .
the people here still have n't escaped the shock of last thursday 's terrorist attacks on the city .
for days now , police have been combing entire blocks of homes , questioning one neighbor after the other in the search for clues behind last week 's train bombings .
news cameras from al over the world have been snapping and shooting the small , non-descript telephone store here non-stop .
police arrested the moroccan-born jamal zougam at the " nuevo siglo " -lrb- new century -rrb- shop just after the attacks .
the investigation has brought unwanted attention to the immigrant neighborhood , and many are struggling to come to terms with what has happened .
just across the street from the telephone shop where zougam was arrested , there 's an arab greengrocer run by a moroccan .
the owner , who asked not to be identified by name , said he still could n't believe that his neighbor and fellow countryman had been a part of the terrible attacks , which left 200 dead and 1,500 injured in bombings of commuter trains at several of the city 's congested stations .
trusted by neighbors " jamal and his co-workers were totally normal and very sympathetic people , " the store owner explained .
" to me , they rise above all doubt .
and even now nothing has been confirmed .
we can only pray that it was n't them .
i hope it will all be cleared up and , in the end , they will not have had anything to do with it . "
even spaniards in the neighborhood had something good to say about zougam 's telephone shop , which was widely-respected and frequented by local residents .
the bar owner two doors down first learned of zougam 's arrest on television .
" i was petrified when i heard it , " the bar owner said .
" i was n't a friend of his , but we always said ' hello ' and ' goodbye ' to each other .
but i always had him repair my mobile phones .
i revered the people in the store and thought they did good work .
but if it 's true that they 're responsible for the attack , i will wring their necks . "
the neighborhood has long been a magnet for people from other countries .
immigrants have been coming here and coexisting peacefully for years .
but some spaniards , especially older generations , express concerns about the growing influx of foreigners to the neighborhood .
some even feel threatened and express a kind of populist thinking not uncommon in other parts of europe where immigration is an issue of heated debate .
" it used to be a wonderful neighborhood , " one spanish neighbor said .
" but today people are afraid to go out on the streets of lavapies .
there 's a lot of theft - and that 's not all .
i do n't want to say all arab 's are killers - for heaven 's sake , no .
but it is true that these people are causing a lot of damage here . "
growing distrust there 's a muslim butcher located adjacent to the telephone shop .
its owner , a 40-year algerian who has lived in spain for 12 years , was also angered by the terrorist attack .
he said he felt less welcome in other parts of madrid in the wake of the attacks .
" in other districts of madrid people have looked at me distrustfully as soon as they heard me speaking in arabic , " he said .
" when they stare , i can sometimes feel the anger and the desire for revenge .
i can only hope that these people know they ca n't lump all of us together , " he said , referring to the possible islamic extremists behind the attacks .
another arab then jumped into the butcher 's conversation .
the moroccan has lived in spain for a number of years , has a family and feels at home here .
he hopes the suspicions toward radical islamic terrorists does n't transform into a blanket rejection of people of muslim faith .
" we have lived here in spain for so long that we 're more or less a part of this country , " he said .
" those who did this are terrorists .
that has nothing to do with religion or geographical origin .

serbs and albanians have yet again spiralled into conflict , raising the question of what has really changed since the nato-led war against serbia in 1999 . overnight , the situation in kosovo has escalated , evoking memories of 1999 .
back then , nato decided to put an end to the persistent violence through air strikes .
an international peacekeeping force was deployed and kosovo was placed under a united nations mandate .
five years on , the question of the future status of kosovo remains unresolved .
in the eyes of albanians , kosovo should be made independent ; and in the view of serbs , it should remain part of a federation with serbia and montenegro .
the first important talks between the two sides have gotten underway in recent days to discuss important questions of principle , like the fate of missing people and how to ensure steady energy supplies in the region .
the international military presence , u.n. police and local security forces have ensured a certain level of peace .
but the latest violence is n't isolated to the disputed city of kosovska mitrovica , but has spread simultaneously to a number of places across kosovo following the circulation of unconfirmed reports about the violent deaths of albanian children .
additionally , serb extremists also set fire to mosques in belgrade and nis .
conflict also erupted between albanians and serbs during protests across the country .
kfor soldiers and un police were also attacked as the chaos spread .
since the end of the 1999 war , such incidents have happened with increasing regularity .
but this time the violence was loaded with such intensity that it should have sounded a sharp alarm in the international community - for this time the turbulence is escalating almost simultaneously in many places in kosovo and it is encroaching on serbia and montenegro .
an even worse suspicion is now arising : was this a directed escalation of violence ?
was it orchestrated by extremist groups on both sides who have been waiting for the right pretext to fuel the conflict with all of their power just days before the anniversary of the kosovo war ?
kosovo no longer dominates the headlines in the international press , but that does n't mean things have changed for the better . democratic structures and a culture of dialog have not yet developed .
and the cause of the current conflict - the political battle over the future of kosovo - has been put off .
the international community is hoping that the situation will simmer down further so that a solution to the political issues can be settled more easily .
but the contrary appears to be the case : the postponement of the status question is engendering bitterness on all sides of the debate . the political environment has also changed .
serbia now has a new nationalist conservative government that is being tolerated by milosevic 's socialists .
it has left no doubt that it is unwilling to compromise on the status question .
meanwhile , the confidence of albanians in kosovo has increased and the un administration has transferred to them some competencies .
the kosovars have stood firm on their position for some time now , too : the future of kosovo lies in independence and there wo n't and ca n't be any compromise with belgrade .
an agreement on the future of kosovo remains elusive even now , five years after the last bombs were dropped .
the latest problems show that even a mere spark is enough to set barricades and houses of worship ablaze .
that 's how it was in 1999 and that 's how it is again today .
kosovo is still far away from a peaceful future .
and if the serbs and albanians are unwilling to compromise , then there 's little more the international community can do than merely control the damage .

the proposals , drawn up by france , germany , the uk , sweden , austria and the netherlands , would limit eu funds for 2007 to 2013 to one percent of gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- , rather than 1.27 percent of gni .
but budget commissioner michaele schreyer on thursday described the idea as " completely untenable . "
speaking before the budget committee in the european parliament , she warned that the proposals would mean an actual spending cut of ten percent and said , " we could n't continue with european integration " in this scenario .
" you would have less europe " , she continued , " and the commission is of the opinion that we have to say ' absolutely no ' to less europe . "
together with five other commissioners , schreyer defends plans to increase the money made available b eu members states for further union projects from 133 billion euro in 2007 to 158 billion in 2013 .
pointing to sharp rises in spending on justice and home affairs issues , the commissioner for this area , antonio vitorino said , " i believe this brings europe closer to its citizens ... it is quite clear that this is an area where operational responses will be needed after 2007 . "
trade commissioner pascal lamy justified the spending on external relations by saying , " the eu is only important if it can act outside the union . "
but the european commission 's proposals need to be agreed unanimously by member states and bitter fights are in the offing .
with the commission standing firm on their proposals and the powerful " group of six " equally unshakeable , the debate is already off on a difficult start .

the proposals , drawn up by france , germany , the uk , sweden , austria and the netherlands , would limit eu funds for 2007 to 2013 to one percent of gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- , rather than 1.27 percent of gni .
but budget commissioner michaele schreyer on thursday described the idea as " completely untenable . "
speaking before the budget committee in the european parliament , she warned that the proposals would mean an actual spending cut of ten percent and said , " we could n't continue with european integration " in this scenario .
" you would have less europe " , she continued , " and the commission is of the opinion that we have to say ' absolutely no ' to less europe . "
together with five other commissioners , schreyer defends plans to increase the money made available b eu members states for further union projects from 133 billion euro in 2007 to 158 billion in 2013 .
pointing to sharp rises in spending on justice and home affairs issues , the commissioner for this area , antonio vitorino said , " i believe this brings europe closer to its citizens ... it is quite clear that this is an area where operational responses will be needed after 2007 . "
trade commissioner pascal lamy justified the spending on external relations by saying , " the eu is only important if it can act outside the union . "
but the european commission 's proposals need to be agreed unanimously by member states and bitter fights are in the offing .
with the commission standing firm on their proposals and the powerful " group of six " equally unshakeable , the debate is already off on a difficult start .

federal and regional german politicians are working on plans to overhaul the country 's domestic intelligence service to be better able to combat terrorism and avoid attacks similar to the madrid bombings last week . presently , germany 's domestic intelligence agency , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , is split among 16 different bureaus in each of the country 's federal states .
long considered by some security experts as inefficient and unwieldy , the deadly terrorist attacks in spain have increased pressure to overhaul its structure . " there is more openness than before regarding the question whether the smaller state offices could find new ways to cooperate , " chancellery official frank-walter steinmeier told the financial times deutschland on wednesday .
" if the states are prepared to give up competencies then its a suggestion that can be discussed . " although some conservative politicians are calling for completely abolishing the state offices in favor of a centralized federal authority , it 's more likely that they will be folded into four or more regional departments .
there are also proposals to merge germany 's federal police -lrb- bka -rrb- with border control and customs services . " germany 's fragmented system dates back to the cold war when fighting domestic militants was the priority , " said frank umbach from the german council on foreign relations , according to the reuters news agency .
" now we have to deal with international terrorism . " affordable experts some of the largest states like north-rhine-westphalia and bavaria remain keen to keep their bfv bureaus in tact , but many smaller and poorer states hope greater cooperation would make it easier to afford expensive equipment or specialized personnel such as arabic experts . although germany opposed the u.s.-led war in iraq , few security experts doubt that the country is a target for islamic extremists .
in particular , germany 's role in stabilizing afghanistan angers the al qaeda terror network of osama bin laden .
and several of the terrorists involved in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states were part of a terror cell based in the northern german city of hamburg . besides considering a revamp of its own domestic intelligence agency , germany is pushing for greater cooperation at the european level .
after the bombings in madrid , german interior minister otto schily called for a ministerial summit on security in brussels that will be held on friday . steinmeier from the chancellery told the ftd that berlin supported the idea of creating an eu collection point for information collected by domestic intelligence agency , underscoring plans announced on tuesday by french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder to step up joint efforts to combat terrorism . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security discussions rage across europe european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.03.2004 nato sends reinforcements to kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. forces are on their way to bolster the kfor contingent in kosovo after wednesday 's violence .
a day after serbs and ethnic albanians clashed in kosovo , the united states and britain revealed they would send reinforcements to bolster the nato force struggling to restore calm in the region . the united states and britain are sending extra troops to kosovo as part of the nato effort to quell unrest in the mainly ethnic albanian serbian province , where violence has killed 22 people in the past 24 hours . " we are continuing to monitor the situation closely .
we are working with nato to deploy additional forces as a precaution .
one u.s. company is en route as part of a 350-strong nato force , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan told reporters traveling to kentucky with u.s. president george w. bush .
" we continue to call on all groups to end the violence and refrain from violence . " britain also dispatched a force of 750 rapid reaction troops to kosovo as nato officials revealed that up to 1,000 extra soldiers could be dispatched to kosovo to bolster its 17,000 strong force after it emerged that 35 nato troops had been injured in the violence . nato 's top military commander in europe , u.s. general james jones , expressed concern about the flare-up .
" i call on the leaders of both sides of the conflict to take decisive action to control immediately their citizens and return to the rule of law , " he said , describing the extra troop deployments as a " prudent reinforcement . "
violence flared on wednesday as the un-administered serbian province of kosovo became embroiled in some of the worst outpourings of violence between ethnic albanians and serbs in three years .
the conflict broke out early wednesday morning amid reports that serbs in a village near kosovska mitrovica set a dog on a group of ethnic albanian boys , forcing them to flee into an icy river where they drowned .
after authorities recovered the bodies , kosovo-albanians and serbs faced off against each other near a bridge over the ibar river that divides the city - long a flashpoint of ethnic tensions - and traded insults , threw rocks and charged at each other several times before gunfire broke out .

a day after serbs and ethnic albanians clashed in kosovo , the united states and britain revealed they would send reinforcements to bolster the nato force struggling to restore calm in the region . the united states and britain are sending extra troops to kosovo as part of the nato effort to quell unrest in the mainly ethnic albanian serbian province , where violence has killed 22 people in the past 24 hours . " we are continuing to monitor the situation closely .
we are working with nato to deploy additional forces as a precaution .

" we continue to call on all groups to end the violence and refrain from violence . " britain also dispatched a force of 750 rapid reaction troops to kosovo as nato officials revealed that up to 1,000 extra soldiers could be dispatched to kosovo to bolster its 17,000 strong force after it emerged that 35 nato troops had been injured in the violence . nato 's top military commander in europe , u.s. general james jones , expressed concern about the flare-up .
" i call on the leaders of both sides of the conflict to take decisive action to control immediately their citizens and return to the rule of law , " he said , describing the extra troop deployments as a " prudent reinforcement . "
violence flared on wednesday as the un-administered serbian province of kosovo became embroiled in some of the worst outpourings of violence between ethnic albanians and serbs in three years .
the conflict broke out early wednesday morning amid reports that serbs in a village near kosovska mitrovica set a dog on a group of ethnic albanian boys , forcing them to flee into an icy river where they drowned .
after authorities recovered the bodies , kosovo-albanians and serbs faced off against each other near a bridge over the ibar river that divides the city - long a flashpoint of ethnic tensions - and traded insults , threw rocks and charged at each other several times before gunfire broke out .

nato-led peacekeepers and rumanian special police units in riot gear moved in , firing tear gas , rubber bullets and stun grenades to stop ethnic albanians from rushing across the bridge toward the serb side of the city .
official reports said six ethnic albanians and two serbs were killed in the clash in kosovska mitrovica .
seven police officers and 11 french kfor soldiers were also injured .

news reports from belgrade said more than 10,000 people rallied outside the serbian government building blocking main streets in the city center .
chanting , " we 'll go to kosovo " and " serbia rise up , " they demanded their leadership take action .
prime minister vojislav kostunica of serbia , to which kosovo belongs , appealed to his countrymen for an end to the violence and condemned what he called albanian terrorism .

un secretary general kofi annan urged all parties to halt the violence , " which jeopardizes the stability of kosovo and the security of all its people . "
international troops have been in the region since 1999 when 78 days of nato bombing forced serbia to end its crackdown on separatists from kosovo 's ethnic albanians and brought an end to the conflict .
there are currently 17,000 kfor troops and 10,000 un and local police patrolling the province .

a day after serbs and ethnic albanians clashed in kosovo , the united states and britain revealed they would send reinforcements to bolster the nato force struggling to restore calm in the region . the united states and britain are sending extra troops to kosovo as part of the nato effort to quell unrest in the mainly ethnic albanian serbian province , where violence has killed 22 people in the past 24 hours . " we are continuing to monitor the situation closely .
we are working with nato to deploy additional forces as a precaution .
one u.s. company is en route as part of a 350-strong nato force , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan told reporters traveling to kentucky with u.s. president george w. bush .
" we continue to call on all groups to end the violence and refrain from violence . " britain also dispatched a force of 750 rapid reaction troops to kosovo as nato officials revealed that up to 1,000 extra soldiers could be dispatched to kosovo to bolster its 17,000 strong force after it emerged that 35 nato troops had been injured in the violence . nato 's top military commander in europe , u.s. general james jones , expressed concern about the flare-up .
" i call on the leaders of both sides of the conflict to take decisive action to control immediately their citizens and return to the rule of law , " he said , describing the extra troop deployments as a " prudent reinforcement . "
violence flared on wednesday as the un-administered serbian province of kosovo became embroiled in some of the worst outpourings of violence between ethnic albanians and serbs in three years .
the conflict broke out early wednesday morning amid reports that serbs in a village near kosovska mitrovica set a dog on a group of ethnic albanian boys , forcing them to flee into an icy river where they drowned .

federal and regional german politicians are working on plans to overhaul the country 's domestic intelligence service to be better able to combat terrorism and avoid attacks similar to the madrid bombings last week . presently , germany 's domestic intelligence agency , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , is split among 16 different bureaus in each of the country 's federal states .
long considered by some security experts as inefficient and unwieldy , the deadly terrorist attacks in spain have increased pressure to overhaul its structure . " there is more openness than before regarding the question whether the smaller state offices could find new ways to cooperate , " chancellery official frank-walter steinmeier told the financial times deutschland on wednesday .
" if the states are prepared to give up competencies then its a suggestion that can be discussed . " although some conservative politicians are calling for completely abolishing the state offices in favor of a centralized federal authority , it 's more likely that they will be folded into four or more regional departments .
there are also proposals to merge germany 's federal police -lrb- bka -rrb- with border control and customs services . " germany 's fragmented system dates back to the cold war when fighting domestic militants was the priority , " said frank umbach from the german council on foreign relations , according to the reuters news agency .
" now we have to deal with international terrorism . " affordable experts some of the largest states like north-rhine-westphalia and bavaria remain keen to keep their bfv bureaus in tact , but many smaller and poorer states hope greater cooperation would make it easier to afford expensive equipment or specialized personnel such as arabic experts . although germany opposed the u.s.-led war in iraq , few security experts doubt that the country is a target for islamic extremists .

serbs and albanians have yet again spiralled into conflict , raising the question of what has really changed since the nato-led war against serbia in 1999 . overnight , the situation in kosovo has escalated , evoking memories of 1999 .
back then , nato decided to put an end to the persistent violence through air strikes .
an international peacekeeping force was deployed and kosovo was placed under a united nations mandate .
five years on , the question of the future status of kosovo remains unresolved .
in the eyes of albanians , kosovo should be made independent ; and in the view of serbs , it should remain part of a federation with serbia and montenegro .
the first important talks between the two sides have gotten underway in recent days to discuss important questions of principle , like the fate of missing people and how to ensure steady energy supplies in the region .
the international military presence , u.n. police and local security forces have ensured a certain level of peace .
but the latest violence is n't isolated to the disputed city of kosovska mitrovica , but has spread simultaneously to a number of places across kosovo following the circulation of unconfirmed reports about the violent deaths of albanian children .
additionally , serb extremists also set fire to mosques in belgrade and nis .
conflict also erupted between albanians and serbs during protests across the country .
kfor soldiers and un police were also attacked as the chaos spread .
since the end of the 1999 war , such incidents have happened with increasing regularity .
but this time the violence was loaded with such intensity that it should have sounded a sharp alarm in the international community - for this time the turbulence is escalating almost simultaneously in many places in kosovo and it is encroaching on serbia and montenegro .
an even worse suspicion is now arising : was this a directed escalation of violence ?
was it orchestrated by extremist groups on both sides who have been waiting for the right pretext to fuel the conflict with all of their power just days before the anniversary of the kosovo war ?
kosovo no longer dominates the headlines in the international press , but that does n't mean things have changed for the better . democratic structures and a culture of dialog have not yet developed .
and the cause of the current conflict - the political battle over the future of kosovo - has been put off .
the international community is hoping that the situation will simmer down further so that a solution to the political issues can be settled more easily .
but the contrary appears to be the case : the postponement of the status question is engendering bitterness on all sides of the debate . the political environment has also changed .
serbia now has a new nationalist conservative government that is being tolerated by milosevic 's socialists .
it has left no doubt that it is unwilling to compromise on the status question .
meanwhile , the confidence of albanians in kosovo has increased and the un administration has transferred to them some competencies .
the kosovars have stood firm on their position for some time now , too : the future of kosovo lies in independence and there wo n't and ca n't be any compromise with belgrade .
an agreement on the future of kosovo remains elusive even now , five years after the last bombs were dropped .
the latest problems show that even a mere spark is enough to set barricades and houses of worship ablaze .
that 's how it was in 1999 and that 's how it is again today .
kosovo is still far away from a peaceful future .
and if the serbs and albanians are unwilling to compromise , then there 's little more the international community can do than merely control the damage .
thus , sovereignty remains a pipe dream for serbs and albanians . bernd johann -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato sends reinforcements to kosovo a day after serbs and ethnic albanians clashed in kosovo , the united states and britain revealed that they would send reinforcements to bolster the nato force struggling to return the region to calm .

the proposals , drawn up by france , germany , the uk , sweden , austria and the netherlands , would limit eu funds for 2007 to 2013 to one percent of gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- , rather than 1.27 percent of gni .
but budget commissioner michaele schreyer on thursday described the idea as " completely untenable . "
speaking before the budget committee in the european parliament , she warned that the proposals would mean an actual spending cut of ten percent and said , " we could n't continue with european integration " in this scenario .
" you would have less europe " , she continued , " and the commission is of the opinion that we have to say ' absolutely no ' to less europe . "
together with five other commissioners , schreyer defends plans to increase the money made available b eu members states for further union projects from 133 billion euro in 2007 to 158 billion in 2013 .
pointing to sharp rises in spending on justice and home affairs issues , the commissioner for this area , antonio vitorino said , " i believe this brings europe closer to its citizens ... it is quite clear that this is an area where operational responses will be needed after 2007 . "
trade commissioner pascal lamy justified the spending on external relations by saying , " the eu is only important if it can act outside the union . "
but the european commission 's proposals need to be agreed unanimously by member states and bitter fights are in the offing .
with the commission standing firm on their proposals and the powerful " group of six " equally unshakeable , the debate is already off on a difficult start .

federal and regional german politicians are working on plans to overhaul the country 's domestic intelligence service to be better able to combat terrorism and avoid attacks similar to the madrid bombings last week . presently , germany 's domestic intelligence agency , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , is split among 16 different bureaus in each of the country 's federal states .
long considered by some security experts as inefficient and unwieldy , the deadly terrorist attacks in spain have increased pressure to overhaul its structure . " there is more openness than before regarding the question whether the smaller state offices could find new ways to cooperate , " chancellery official frank-walter steinmeier told the financial times deutschland on wednesday .
" if the states are prepared to give up competencies then its a suggestion that can be discussed . " although some conservative politicians are calling for completely abolishing the state offices in favor of a centralized federal authority , it 's more likely that they will be folded into four or more regional departments .
there are also proposals to merge germany 's federal police -lrb- bka -rrb- with border control and customs services . " germany 's fragmented system dates back to the cold war when fighting domestic militants was the priority , " said frank umbach from the german council on foreign relations , according to the reuters news agency .
" now we have to deal with international terrorism . " affordable experts some of the largest states like north-rhine-westphalia and bavaria remain keen to keep their bfv bureaus in tact , but many smaller and poorer states hope greater cooperation would make it easier to afford expensive equipment or specialized personnel such as arabic experts . although germany opposed the u.s.-led war in iraq , few security experts doubt that the country is a target for islamic extremists .
in particular , germany 's role in stabilizing afghanistan angers the al qaeda terror network of osama bin laden .
and several of the terrorists involved in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states were part of a terror cell based in the northern german city of hamburg . besides considering a revamp of its own domestic intelligence agency , germany is pushing for greater cooperation at the european level .

kosovo no longer dominates the headlines in the international press , but that does n't mean things have changed for the better . democratic structures and a culture of dialog have not yet developed .
and the cause of the current conflict - the political battle over the future of kosovo - has been put off .
the international community is hoping that the situation will simmer down further so that a solution to the political issues can be settled more easily .
but the contrary appears to be the case : the postponement of the status question is engendering bitterness on all sides of the debate . the political environment has also changed .
serbia now has a new nationalist conservative government that is being tolerated by milosevic 's socialists .
it has left no doubt that it is unwilling to compromise on the status question .
meanwhile , the confidence of albanians in kosovo has increased and the un administration has transferred to them some competencies .
the kosovars have stood firm on their position for some time now , too : the future of kosovo lies in independence and there wo n't and ca n't be any compromise with belgrade .
an agreement on the future of kosovo remains elusive even now , five years after the last bombs were dropped .
the latest problems show that even a mere spark is enough to set barricades and houses of worship ablaze .
that 's how it was in 1999 and that 's how it is again today .
kosovo is still far away from a peaceful future .
and if the serbs and albanians are unwilling to compromise , then there 's little more the international community can do than merely control the damage .
thus , sovereignty remains a pipe dream for serbs and albanians . bernd johann -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato sends reinforcements to kosovo a day after serbs and ethnic albanians clashed in kosovo , the united states and britain revealed that they would send reinforcements to bolster the nato force struggling to return the region to calm .

a day after serbs and ethnic albanians clashed in kosovo , the united states and britain revealed they would send reinforcements to bolster the nato force struggling to restore calm in the region . the united states and britain are sending extra troops to kosovo as part of the nato effort to quell unrest in the mainly ethnic albanian serbian province , where violence has killed 22 people in the past 24 hours .

" britain also dispatched a force of 750 rapid reaction troops to kosovo as nato officials revealed that up to 1,000 extra soldiers could be dispatched to kosovo to bolster its 17,000 strong force after it emerged that 35 nato troops had been injured in the violence . nato 's top military commander in europe , u.s. general james jones , expressed concern about the flare-up .
" i call on the leaders of both sides of the conflict to take decisive action to control immediately their citizens and return to the rule of law , " he said , describing the extra troop deployments as a " prudent reinforcement . "
violence flared on wednesday as the un-administered serbian province of kosovo became embroiled in some of the worst outpourings of violence between ethnic albanians and serbs in three years .
the conflict broke out early wednesday morning amid reports that serbs in a village near kosovska mitrovica set a dog on a group of ethnic albanian boys , forcing them to flee into an icy river where they drowned .
after authorities recovered the bodies , kosovo-albanians and serbs faced off against each other near a bridge over the ibar river that divides the city - long a flashpoint of ethnic tensions - and traded insults , threw rocks and charged at each other several times before gunfire broke out .
nato-led peacekeepers and rumanian special police units in riot gear moved in , firing tear gas , rubber bullets and stun grenades to stop ethnic albanians from rushing across the bridge toward the serb side of the city .
official reports said six ethnic albanians and two serbs were killed in the clash in kosovska mitrovica .
seven police officers and 11 french kfor soldiers were also injured .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.03.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc brussels defends controversial budget plans the european commission on wednesday hit back furiously at proposals by six member states to cap the eu budget .
the proposals , drawn up by france , germany , the uk , sweden , austria and the netherlands , would limit eu funds for 2007 to 2013 to one percent of gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- , rather than 1.27 percent of gni .
but budget commissioner michaele schreyer on thursday described the idea as " completely untenable . "
speaking before the budget committee in the european parliament , she warned that the proposals would mean an actual spending cut of ten percent and said , " we could n't continue with european integration " in this scenario .
" you would have less europe " , she continued , " and the commission is of the opinion that we have to say ' absolutely no ' to less europe . "
together with five other commissioners , schreyer defends plans to increase the money made available b eu members states for further union projects from 133 billion euro in 2007 to 158 billion in 2013 .
pointing to sharp rises in spending on justice and home affairs issues , the commissioner for this area , antonio vitorino said , " i believe this brings europe closer to its citizens ... it is quite clear that this is an area where operational responses will be needed after 2007 . "
trade commissioner pascal lamy justified the spending on external relations by saying , " the eu is only important if it can act outside the union . "
but the european commission 's proposals need to be agreed unanimously by member states and bitter fights are in the offing .
with the commission standing firm on their proposals and the powerful " group of six " equally unshakeable , the debate is already off on a difficult start .

a day after serbs and ethnic albanians clashed in kosovo , the united states and britain revealed they would send reinforcements to bolster the nato force struggling to restore calm in the region . the united states and britain are sending extra troops to kosovo as part of the nato effort to quell unrest in the mainly ethnic albanian serbian province , where violence has killed 22 people in the past 24 hours . " we are continuing to monitor the situation closely .
we are working with nato to deploy additional forces as a precaution .
one u.s. company is en route as part of a 350-strong nato force , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan told reporters traveling to kentucky with u.s. president george w. bush .
" we continue to call on all groups to end the violence and refrain from violence . " britain also dispatched a force of 750 rapid reaction troops to kosovo as nato officials revealed that up to 1,000 extra soldiers could be dispatched to kosovo to bolster its 17,000 strong force after it emerged that 35 nato troops had been injured in the violence . nato 's top military commander in europe , u.s. general james jones , expressed concern about the flare-up .
" i call on the leaders of both sides of the conflict to take decisive action to control immediately their citizens and return to the rule of law , " he said , describing the extra troop deployments as a " prudent reinforcement . "
violence flared on wednesday as the un-administered serbian province of kosovo became embroiled in some of the worst outpourings of violence between ethnic albanians and serbs in three years .
the conflict broke out early wednesday morning amid reports that serbs in a village near kosovska mitrovica set a dog on a group of ethnic albanian boys , forcing them to flee into an icy river where they drowned .
after authorities recovered the bodies , kosovo-albanians and serbs faced off against each other near a bridge over the ibar river that divides the city - long a flashpoint of ethnic tensions - and traded insults , threw rocks and charged at each other several times before gunfire broke out .
nato-led peacekeepers and rumanian special police units in riot gear moved in , firing tear gas , rubber bullets and stun grenades to stop ethnic albanians from rushing across the bridge toward the serb side of the city .
official reports said six ethnic albanians and two serbs were killed in the clash in kosovska mitrovica .
seven police officers and 11 french kfor soldiers were also injured .
flashpoint of ethnic tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kosovo police officer stands guard near damaged cars and apartments in a mainly serb neighborhood in the kosovo capital pristina .
with emotions running high in the volatile region , the conflict quickly fanned out , spilling over into other towns where serb homes , churches and cars were set on fire as ethnic albanians sought revenge .
in the central kosovo town of lipljan , four serbs were killed late wednesday and three others died in the eastern town of gnjilane as nato and un troops struggled to stop the violence .
but during the course of the day , events became too much for the international peacekeepers to contain as ethnic albanians rushed kfor checkpoints established to protect serb enclaves , and un vehicles were reportedly torched in the capital pristina , according to beta news agency .
several medieval serb orthodox churches and monasteries were also allegedly set ablaze in central and eastern kosovo .
serbs demand retaliation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters celebrate in front of a burning mosque after a fire set by protesters took hold in the southern serbian town of nis .
meanwhile in belgrade , the capital of serbia-montenegro , demonstrators set the city 's 17th century mosque on fire after clashing with police trying to guard the building .
the angry mob demanded that the serbian government act to protect their orthodox christian kin from attacks by the primarily muslim kosovo-albanians .
a second mosque was torched in the southern serbian town of nis .
news reports from belgrade said more than 10,000 people rallied outside the serbian government building blocking main streets in the city center .
chanting , " we 'll go to kosovo " and " serbia rise up , " they demanded their leadership take action .
prime minister vojislav kostunica of serbia , to which kosovo belongs , appealed to his countrymen for an end to the violence and condemned what he called albanian terrorism .
" the events ... demonstrate the true nature of albanian separatism , its violent and terrorist character , " he said after an emergency cabinet meeting .
nato and un respond in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer called on both serbs and ethnic albanians to remain calm .
" i urge all ethnic communities in kosovska mitrovica and in the rest of kosovo to avoid further escalation , to act with calm and to refrain from demonstrations and roadblocks , " he said in a statement .
un secretary general kofi annan urged all parties to halt the violence , " which jeopardizes the stability of kosovo and the security of all its people . "
international troops have been in the region since 1999 when 78 days of nato bombing forced serbia to end its crackdown on separatists from kosovo 's ethnic albanians and brought an end to the conflict .
there are currently 17,000 kfor troops and 10,000 un and local police patrolling the province .
despite their significant presence , ethnic violence has repeatedly erupted , but wednesday 's outpouring was the bloodiest in the last three years and demonstrated the failure of international efforts to squelch ethnic hatreds and set the province on the path of reconciliation . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : damage control in kosovo at least 17 people were killed in riots in kosovo on wednesday .
serbs and albanians have yet again spiralled into conflict , raising the question of what has really changed since the nato-led war against serbia in 1999 .

the proposals , drawn up by france , germany , the uk , sweden , austria and the netherlands , would limit eu funds for 2007 to 2013 to one percent of gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- , rather than 1.27 percent of gni .
but budget commissioner michaele schreyer on thursday described the idea as " completely untenable . "
speaking before the budget committee in the european parliament , she warned that the proposals would mean an actual spending cut of ten percent and said , " we could n't continue with european integration " in this scenario .
" you would have less europe " , she continued , " and the commission is of the opinion that we have to say ' absolutely no ' to less europe . "
together with five other commissioners , schreyer defends plans to increase the money made available b eu members states for further union projects from 133 billion euro in 2007 to 158 billion in 2013 .
pointing to sharp rises in spending on justice and home affairs issues , the commissioner for this area , antonio vitorino said , " i believe this brings europe closer to its citizens ... it is quite clear that this is an area where operational responses will be needed after 2007 . "
trade commissioner pascal lamy justified the spending on external relations by saying , " the eu is only important if it can act outside the union . "
but the european commission 's proposals need to be agreed unanimously by member states and bitter fights are in the offing .
with the commission standing firm on their proposals and the powerful " group of six " equally unshakeable , the debate is already off on a difficult start .

federal and regional german politicians are working on plans to overhaul the country 's domestic intelligence service to be better able to combat terrorism and avoid attacks similar to the madrid bombings last week . presently , germany 's domestic intelligence agency , the office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , is split among 16 different bureaus in each of the country 's federal states .
long considered by some security experts as inefficient and unwieldy , the deadly terrorist attacks in spain have increased pressure to overhaul its structure .

though islam is woven into the fabric of the country 's history , moroccans and other arabs living there today are struggling to find their place in society as well as their role in the muslim world . mustafa bougrine is a moroccan who has lived in spain for 19 years .
he 's married to a spanish woman and runs a restaurant .
he fears that a new feeling of islamophobia may be growing in the spanish population .
" when people hear the word ' islam ' , they think about bin laden , saddam hussein or gaddafi , but that 's not islam , " he says .
" i 'm against every form of fanaticism , suicide bombers and everything that is referred to as ' jihad ' .
muslims here in spain believe in democracy and peaceful coexistence between christians , jews and muslims . "
change is definitely brewing among madrid 's muslims .
the city 's lavapies neighborhood -lrb- see related link below -rrb- , where many immigrants live and the suspected culprits of the march 11 terrorist attacks ran a telephone shop , has practically come to a standstill .
the mosque on the m30 highway beltway is the largest in madrid .
but these days it 's conspicuously empty .
before last thursday 's terrorist attacks on the city , as many as 1,000 would come at a single time to pray here .
now it 's difficult to find more than 50 people who have come here to pray in the direction of mecca .
many muslims are staying home and out of the public eye as spanish investigators shift their focus from basque separatists toward the attack 's suspected moroccan culprits .
spanish newspapers are reporting sources alleging links between thursday 's terrorist attacks and bombings in casablanca last may that also killed dozens of spaniards .
the developments have sent shockwaves through spain 's muslim community , which is struggling to establish its own identity in a staunchly catholic country .
an influx of economic refugees close to 600,000 muslims live in spain , with the majority originating from northern africa 's maghreb countries , mostly morocco which is located just kilometers across the straight of gibraltar .
islam is not a new religion in spain .
no other european country has as many traces of the religion in its history .
for several hundred years , right up till the end of the 15th century , islam was a dominant presence on the iberian peninsula .
most of those living here today came during the 1980s .
their numbers grew in the 1990s as they took jobs in spain 's growing agricultural , construction , hospitality and service industry .
they are the silent majority of spain 's muslims .
many of the dominant voices heard in spain are those of spanish islam converts or leaders of islamic cultural centers financed by the saudi arabian government - groups that play a prominent role in negotiating the rights and duties of muslims within the spanish state .
finding their place but for most moroccans , eking out a living is the most important aspect of daily life .
through countless grassroots associations , moroccans in spain are fighting for their economic survival as well as the construction of mosques in their neighborhoods .
muhammad chouirdi works for the association of moroccan workers and immigrants .
he finds alarming the miserable circumstances under which his fellow countrymen are forced to fulfill their religious obligations .
strapped for cash , the temptation to take money from other arab groups is tempting , but the political dangers are considerable .
moroccan muslim leaders like chouidiri are also wary of other branches of islam , which they fear are being accepted uncritically by moroccan immigrants .
" we suspect that small moroccan living-room mosques on the outskirts of madrid are already receiving saudi arabian money , " chouirdi explains .
" by doing so , saudi arabia is trying to spread its form of islam and practices - primarily wahhabi muslim .
the probelm is that moroccan immigrants have a low level of education and there 's a danger that they will not recognize the danger of these religious practices .
for them , practicing islam means praying give times a day and following many rules .
what we get from the outside world - in this case from saudi arabia - is accepted with out critical discussion . "
islam from saudi arabia , with its fundamentalist characteristics , has spread in spain in recent years .
all the big representative mosques in spain were built with saudi money .
and frequently the saudis have also sent imams who interpret the quran according to the wahhabis .
wahhabism rejects all modernity , any dialogue between religions , any opening up to other cultures .
the breeding ground for last week 's attacks could have been here .
for both the culprits in the casablanca bombing in 2003 and the alleged perpetrators of the madrid attacks belong to terrorist groups that have been influenced by wahhabi ideologists .
a religious border now people are asking themselves how a minority in the muslim community could have become susceptible to islamist propaganda .
the disparities between spain 's catholic and muslim societies could provide some clues .
a look at ceuta , one of the two spanish cities on the moroccan mediterranean coast , is revealing .
ceuta is the gateway to europe .
the border between africa and europe , between islamic morocco and catholic spain , is here .
half of ceuta 's 72,000 residents are christian , while the other half are muslim , mainly of moroccan origin .
the chairman of islamic community of ceuta , abselam hamadi , says that many muslims still feel like second-class citizens , that they do n't have the same opportunities christians have .
" only few muslims get jobs in ceuta 's state administration .
the response is always the same : professional qualifications lacking .
that 's not the truth , of course .
but if more muslims were accepted , there would be more muslims than christians in the administration one day , and that scares the christians . "
the fact is , ceuta 's muslim residents have dramatically lower standards of living and levels of education than christian residents .
they mainly live in the el principe district , a poor , entirely muslim neighborhood right on the border to morocco , where integration does n't exist .
young muslims born in spain to moroccan parents live here .
they do n't feel moroccan , but they are n't fully accepted by spanish society either .
many fear the promises of the " real islamic message " may be received with open arms in communities like ceuta , creating the kind of dangerous backdrop that could breed future terrorism . bettina ambach -lrb- dsl / ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we can only pray it was n't them " madrid 's cosmopolitan lavapies neighborhood has long been a melting pot for arabs and other immigrants .
it was also home to the main suspect in thursday 's terrorist attacks - the deadliest in years .
-lrb- march 18 , 2004 -rrb- spain allegedly misled germany over bombings spanish authorities intentionally withheld information and misled german officials into believing the basque separatists eta were responsible for the madrid bombings , according to germany 's federal criminal bureau .
-lrb- march 17 , 2004 -rrb- spain 's socialists win elections anger over the government 's handling of a suspected al qaeda link in thursday 's bombings helped push the socialists back into power .

madrid 's cosmopolitan lavapies neighborhood has long been a melting pot for arabs and other immigrants .
it was also home to the main suspect in thursday 's terrorist attacks - the deadliest in years . lavapies is a multicultural neighborhood located in the heart of madrid .
the people here still have n't escaped the shock of last thursday 's terrorist attacks on the city .
for days now , police have been combing entire blocks of homes , questioning one neighbor after the other in the search for clues behind last week 's train bombings .
news cameras from al over the world have been snapping and shooting the small , non-descript telephone store here non-stop .
police arrested the moroccan-born jamal zougam at the " nuevo siglo " -lrb- new century -rrb- shop just after the attacks .
the investigation has brought unwanted attention to the immigrant neighborhood , and many are struggling to come to terms with what has happened .
just across the street from the telephone shop where zougam was arrested , there 's an arab greengrocer run by a moroccan .
the owner , who asked not to be identified by name , said he still could n't believe that his neighbor and fellow countryman had been a part of the terrible attacks , which left 200 dead and 1,500 injured in bombings of commuter trains at several of the city 's congested stations .
trusted by neighbors " jamal and his co-workers were totally normal and very sympathetic people , " the store owner explained .
" to me , they rise above all doubt .
and even now nothing has been confirmed .
we can only pray that it was n't them .
i hope it will all be cleared up and , in the end , they will not have had anything to do with it . "
even spaniards in the neighborhood had something good to say about zougam 's telephone shop , which was widely-respected and frequented by local residents .
the bar owner two doors down first learned of zougam 's arrest on television .
" i was petrified when i heard it , " the bar owner said .
" i was n't a friend of his , but we always said ' hello ' and ' goodbye ' to each other .
but i always had him repair my mobile phones .
i revered the people in the store and thought they did good work .
but if it 's true that they 're responsible for the attack , i will wring their necks . "
the neighborhood has long been a magnet for people from other countries .
immigrants have been coming here and coexisting peacefully for years .
but some spaniards , especially older generations , express concerns about the growing influx of foreigners to the neighborhood .
some even feel threatened and express a kind of populist thinking not uncommon in other parts of europe where immigration is an issue of heated debate .
" it used to be a wonderful neighborhood , " one spanish neighbor said .
" but today people are afraid to go out on the streets of lavapies .
there 's a lot of theft - and that 's not all .
i do n't want to say all arab 's are killers - for heaven 's sake , no .
but it is true that these people are causing a lot of damage here . "
growing distrust there 's a muslim butcher located adjacent to the telephone shop .
its owner , a 40-year algerian who has lived in spain for 12 years , was also angered by the terrorist attack .
he said he felt less welcome in other parts of madrid in the wake of the attacks .
" in other districts of madrid people have looked at me distrustfully as soon as they heard me speaking in arabic , " he said .
" when they stare , i can sometimes feel the anger and the desire for revenge .
i can only hope that these people know they ca n't lump all of us together , " he said , referring to the possible islamic extremists behind the attacks .
another arab then jumped into the butcher 's conversation .
the moroccan has lived in spain for a number of years , has a family and feels at home here .
he hopes the suspicions toward radical islamic terrorists does n't transform into a blanket rejection of people of muslim faith .
" we have lived here in spain for so long that we 're more or less a part of this country , " he said .
" those who did this are terrorists .
that has nothing to do with religion or geographical origin .

serbs and albanians have yet again spiralled into conflict , raising the question of what has really changed since the nato-led war against serbia in 1999 . overnight , the situation in kosovo has escalated , evoking memories of 1999 .
back then , nato decided to put an end to the persistent violence through air strikes .
an international peacekeeping force was deployed and kosovo was placed under a united nations mandate .
five years on , the question of the future status of kosovo remains unresolved .
in the eyes of albanians , kosovo should be made independent ; and in the view of serbs , it should remain part of a federation with serbia and montenegro .
the first important talks between the two sides have gotten underway in recent days to discuss important questions of principle , like the fate of missing people and how to ensure steady energy supplies in the region .
the international military presence , u.n. police and local security forces have ensured a certain level of peace .
but the latest violence is n't isolated to the disputed city of kosovska mitrovica , but has spread simultaneously to a number of places across kosovo following the circulation of unconfirmed reports about the violent deaths of albanian children .
additionally , serb extremists also set fire to mosques in belgrade and nis .
conflict also erupted between albanians and serbs during protests across the country .
kfor soldiers and un police were also attacked as the chaos spread .
since the end of the 1999 war , such incidents have happened with increasing regularity .
but this time the violence was loaded with such intensity that it should have sounded a sharp alarm in the international community - for this time the turbulence is escalating almost simultaneously in many places in kosovo and it is encroaching on serbia and montenegro .
an even worse suspicion is now arising : was this a directed escalation of violence ?
was it orchestrated by extremist groups on both sides who have been waiting for the right pretext to fuel the conflict with all of their power just days before the anniversary of the kosovo war ?
kosovo no longer dominates the headlines in the international press , but that does n't mean things have changed for the better . democratic structures and a culture of dialog have not yet developed .
and the cause of the current conflict - the political battle over the future of kosovo - has been put off .
the international community is hoping that the situation will simmer down further so that a solution to the political issues can be settled more easily .
but the contrary appears to be the case : the postponement of the status question is engendering bitterness on all sides of the debate . the political environment has also changed .
serbia now has a new nationalist conservative government that is being tolerated by milosevic 's socialists .
it has left no doubt that it is unwilling to compromise on the status question .
meanwhile , the confidence of albanians in kosovo has increased and the un administration has transferred to them some competencies .
the kosovars have stood firm on their position for some time now , too : the future of kosovo lies in independence and there wo n't and ca n't be any compromise with belgrade .

that 's how it was in 1999 and that 's how it is again today .
kosovo is still far away from a peaceful future .

a day after serbs and ethnic albanians clashed in kosovo , the united states and britain revealed they would send reinforcements to bolster the nato force struggling to restore calm in the region . the united states and britain are sending extra troops to kosovo as part of the nato effort to quell unrest in the mainly ethnic albanian serbian province , where violence has killed 22 people in the past 24 hours . " we are continuing to monitor the situation closely .
we are working with nato to deploy additional forces as a precaution .
one u.s. company is en route as part of a 350-strong nato force , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan told reporters traveling to kentucky with u.s. president george w. bush .
" we continue to call on all groups to end the violence and refrain from violence . " britain also dispatched a force of 750 rapid reaction troops to kosovo as nato officials revealed that up to 1,000 extra soldiers could be dispatched to kosovo to bolster its 17,000 strong force after it emerged that 35 nato troops had been injured in the violence . nato 's top military commander in europe , u.s. general james jones , expressed concern about the flare-up .
" i call on the leaders of both sides of the conflict to take decisive action to control immediately their citizens and return to the rule of law , " he said , describing the extra troop deployments as a " prudent reinforcement . "
violence flared on wednesday as the un-administered serbian province of kosovo became embroiled in some of the worst outpourings of violence between ethnic albanians and serbs in three years .
the conflict broke out early wednesday morning amid reports that serbs in a village near kosovska mitrovica set a dog on a group of ethnic albanian boys , forcing them to flee into an icy river where they drowned .
after authorities recovered the bodies , kosovo-albanians and serbs faced off against each other near a bridge over the ibar river that divides the city - long a flashpoint of ethnic tensions - and traded insults , threw rocks and charged at each other several times before gunfire broke out .
nato-led peacekeepers and rumanian special police units in riot gear moved in , firing tear gas , rubber bullets and stun grenades to stop ethnic albanians from rushing across the bridge toward the serb side of the city .
official reports said six ethnic albanians and two serbs were killed in the clash in kosovska mitrovica .
seven police officers and 11 french kfor soldiers were also injured .
flashpoint of ethnic tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kosovo police officer stands guard near damaged cars and apartments in a mainly serb neighborhood in the kosovo capital pristina .
with emotions running high in the volatile region , the conflict quickly fanned out , spilling over into other towns where serb homes , churches and cars were set on fire as ethnic albanians sought revenge .
in the central kosovo town of lipljan , four serbs were killed late wednesday and three others died in the eastern town of gnjilane as nato and un troops struggled to stop the violence .
but during the course of the day , events became too much for the international peacekeepers to contain as ethnic albanians rushed kfor checkpoints established to protect serb enclaves , and un vehicles were reportedly torched in the capital pristina , according to beta news agency .
several medieval serb orthodox churches and monasteries were also allegedly set ablaze in central and eastern kosovo .
serbs demand retaliation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters celebrate in front of a burning mosque after a fire set by protesters took hold in the southern serbian town of nis .
meanwhile in belgrade , the capital of serbia-montenegro , demonstrators set the city 's 17th century mosque on fire after clashing with police trying to guard the building .
the angry mob demanded that the serbian government act to protect their orthodox christian kin from attacks by the primarily muslim kosovo-albanians .
a second mosque was torched in the southern serbian town of nis .
news reports from belgrade said more than 10,000 people rallied outside the serbian government building blocking main streets in the city center .
chanting , " we 'll go to kosovo " and " serbia rise up , " they demanded their leadership take action .
prime minister vojislav kostunica of serbia , to which kosovo belongs , appealed to his countrymen for an end to the violence and condemned what he called albanian terrorism .
" the events ... demonstrate the true nature of albanian separatism , its violent and terrorist character , " he said after an emergency cabinet meeting .
nato and un respond in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer called on both serbs and ethnic albanians to remain calm .
" i urge all ethnic communities in kosovska mitrovica and in the rest of kosovo to avoid further escalation , to act with calm and to refrain from demonstrations and roadblocks , " he said in a statement .
un secretary general kofi annan urged all parties to halt the violence , " which jeopardizes the stability of kosovo and the security of all its people . "
international troops have been in the region since 1999 when 78 days of nato bombing forced serbia to end its crackdown on separatists from kosovo 's ethnic albanians and brought an end to the conflict .
there are currently 17,000 kfor troops and 10,000 un and local police patrolling the province .
despite their significant presence , ethnic violence has repeatedly erupted , but wednesday 's outpouring was the bloodiest in the last three years and demonstrated the failure of international efforts to squelch ethnic hatreds and set the province on the path of reconciliation . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : damage control in kosovo at least 17 people were killed in riots in kosovo on wednesday .

the ruling african national congress carries the cachet of former liberation movement and will continue to attract widespread support , regardless of what mistakes the government might make .
also its members span the ideological spectrum from communists to free marketeers , leaving the opposition parties no clear line of attack .
the democratic alliance new national party inkatha freedom party pan-africanist congress united democratic movement freedom front african christian democratic party independent democrats the result is a collection of opposition parties which are often distinguishable more by the personality and style of their leaders rather than by any clear ideological differences .
fighting crime , creating jobs , and better health and education services are among the promises of all the opposition parties , as well as the anc .
a feature of south african politics over the past decade has been the shifting pattern of sometimes unlikely alliances between the various groups .
the new national party has entered an agreement with its old adversary the anc , after its earlier relationship with the democratic alliance -lrb- da -rrb- broke down .
the da has formed a coalition government in kwazulu-natal with the inkatha freedom party -lrb- ifp -rrb- , and intends to do so again if the two parties can between them secure a majority in that province .
democratic alliance the democratic alliance is the old opposition party from the pre-1994 white parliament .
once shunned by most white south africans because of its opposition to racist government , it has now , after a few realignments and name changes , become the biggest opposition party to the anc , and the favourite choice of whites .
leon has raised the da 's media profile the da avoids talking in racial terms , but these days , its biggest public relations headache is shaking off the accusations by the anc and nnp that it is the guardian of white privilege .
a party that was distinctly neo-liberal in 1994 has now announced a number of policies more attractive to the poor and has more black candidates on its electoral list .
previous elections 1994 -lrb- as democratic party -rrb- - 1.7 % 1999 -lrb- as democratic party -rrb- - 9.56 % it has by far the highest media profile of any opposition party , due in large measure to its tough-talking leader tony leon .
mr leon 's critics accuse him of knee-jerk negativity towards anything the government says or does - yet his party 's spectacular growth between 1994 and 1999 suggests that his tactics have been the right way to make voters sit up and take notice .
the da has the white vote in the bag - taking the party beyond its current support levels means winning black votes , and this election will be a test of how effectively it can do that .
click here to return the united democratic movement the united democratic movement started life as an unlikely political marriage between two south african politicians .
leader bantu holomisa first made his mark as prime minister of the transkei , one of the nominally independent black puppet-states that were shunned by the liberation movements .
previous elections 1994 - n / a 1999 - 3.42 % he later threw in his lot with the anc and served in nelson mandela 's cabinet , before forming the udm in time for the 1999 elections , along with prominent national party dissident roelf meyer .
mr meyer subsequently left the party and the udm 's ranks in parliament were badly hit by defections .
but much of the party 's original support came from mr holomisa 's personal following in the former transkei -lrb- now part of eastern cape province -rrb- .
as he tries to expand support in other areas , the udm manifesto puts a strong emphasis on trustworthy government and opposing corruption , alongside the usual issues of jobs , education and security .
mr holomisa has also spoken of a need for greater state intervention in the economy , thus making himself one of the few opposition leaders to take on the anc from the left flank .
click here to return new national party just as the opposition in the old south africa has returned as the opposition in the new , so the old party of government , the new national party , is seeking a role at the side of the anc in the post-apartheid government .
in the dying days of apartheid , the then national party staged a political coup in attracting the support of most coloured -lrb- mixed race -rrb- voters , taking control of the coloured-majority western cape province .
it did so by exploiting racial tensions between coloureds and blacks .
by 1999 it had lost most of its old white support to the democratic party and the election result yielded no outright majority in the western cape .
previous elections 1994 -lrb- as national party -rrb- - 20.3 % 1999 - 6.87 % an alliance with the da ended acrimoniously , and the province is now run by an nnp-anc coalition .
the nnp wants to continue that relationship and is emphasising its closeness to the anc .
yet anc officials have warned that if they get a clear majority in the western cape , the anc will run the province alone .
the nnp is concentrating its electoral efforts on the western cape , determined to keep at least a share in government in the one region where it stands a chance .
click here to return freedom front the freedom front came into being before the 1994 elections , at a time when the lack of a political voice for right-wing whites had prompted fears of an armed rebellion against a future democratic government .
afrikaners and other minorities have been confronted with new crises by the anc during the past 10 years freedom front manifesto the sharp decline in support in 1999 indicates that white fears about a post-apartheid south africa had largely been appeased .
the ff is however honest about the fact that it is a party representing the interests of afrikaners and other minorities .
previous elections 1994 - 2.17 % 1999 - 0.8 % " whereas the transfer of 10 years ago meant ' freedom ' to the majority , the tables have been turned inasmuch as that afrikaners and other minorities have been confronted with new crises by the anc during the past 10 years , " its manifesto argues .
it mentions issues like the murder of white farmers , the emigration of whites prompted by affirmative action , and the decline in the official use of the afrikaans language .
despite the setback of the 1999 election , some commentators have speculated whether this year 's poll could see the ff attract the support of some young white first-time voters with little previous interest in politics .

the ruling african national congress carries the cachet of former liberation movement and will continue to attract widespread support , regardless of what mistakes the government might make .
also its members span the ideological spectrum from communists to free marketeers , leaving the opposition parties no clear line of attack .
the democratic alliance new national party inkatha freedom party pan-africanist congress united democratic movement freedom front african christian democratic party independent democrats the result is a collection of opposition parties which are often distinguishable more by the personality and style of their leaders rather than by any clear ideological differences .
fighting crime , creating jobs , and better health and education services are among the promises of all the opposition parties , as well as the anc .
a feature of south african politics over the past decade has been the shifting pattern of sometimes unlikely alliances between the various groups .
the new national party has entered an agreement with its old adversary the anc , after its earlier relationship with the democratic alliance -lrb- da -rrb- broke down .
the da has formed a coalition government in kwazulu-natal with the inkatha freedom party -lrb- ifp -rrb- , and intends to do so again if the two parties can between them secure a majority in that province .
democratic alliance the democratic alliance is the old opposition party from the pre-1994 white parliament .
once shunned by most white south africans because of its opposition to racist government , it has now , after a few realignments and name changes , become the biggest opposition party to the anc , and the favourite choice of whites .
leon has raised the da 's media profile the da avoids talking in racial terms , but these days , its biggest public relations headache is shaking off the accusations by the anc and nnp that it is the guardian of white privilege .
a party that was distinctly neo-liberal in 1994 has now announced a number of policies more attractive to the poor and has more black candidates on its electoral list .
previous elections 1994 -lrb- as democratic party -rrb- - 1.7 % 1999 -lrb- as democratic party -rrb- - 9.56 % it has by far the highest media profile of any opposition party , due in large measure to its tough-talking leader tony leon .
mr leon 's critics accuse him of knee-jerk negativity towards anything the government says or does - yet his party 's spectacular growth between 1994 and 1999 suggests that his tactics have been the right way to make voters sit up and take notice .
the da has the white vote in the bag - taking the party beyond its current support levels means winning black votes , and this election will be a test of how effectively it can do that .
click here to return the united democratic movement the united democratic movement started life as an unlikely political marriage between two south african politicians .
leader bantu holomisa first made his mark as prime minister of the transkei , one of the nominally independent black puppet-states that were shunned by the liberation movements .
previous elections 1994 - n / a 1999 - 3.42 % he later threw in his lot with the anc and served in nelson mandela 's cabinet , before forming the udm in time for the 1999 elections , along with prominent national party dissident roelf meyer .
mr meyer subsequently left the party and the udm 's ranks in parliament were badly hit by defections .
but much of the party 's original support came from mr holomisa 's personal following in the former transkei -lrb- now part of eastern cape province -rrb- .
as he tries to expand support in other areas , the udm manifesto puts a strong emphasis on trustworthy government and opposing corruption , alongside the usual issues of jobs , education and security .
mr holomisa has also spoken of a need for greater state intervention in the economy , thus making himself one of the few opposition leaders to take on the anc from the left flank .
click here to return new national party just as the opposition in the old south africa has returned as the opposition in the new , so the old party of government , the new national party , is seeking a role at the side of the anc in the post-apartheid government .
in the dying days of apartheid , the then national party staged a political coup in attracting the support of most coloured -lrb- mixed race -rrb- voters , taking control of the coloured-majority western cape province .
it did so by exploiting racial tensions between coloureds and blacks .
by 1999 it had lost most of its old white support to the democratic party and the election result yielded no outright majority in the western cape .
previous elections 1994 -lrb- as national party -rrb- - 20.3 % 1999 - 6.87 % an alliance with the da ended acrimoniously , and the province is now run by an nnp-anc coalition .
the nnp wants to continue that relationship and is emphasising its closeness to the anc .
yet anc officials have warned that if they get a clear majority in the western cape , the anc will run the province alone .
the nnp is concentrating its electoral efforts on the western cape , determined to keep at least a share in government in the one region where it stands a chance .
click here to return freedom front the freedom front came into being before the 1994 elections , at a time when the lack of a political voice for right-wing whites had prompted fears of an armed rebellion against a future democratic government .
afrikaners and other minorities have been confronted with new crises by the anc during the past 10 years freedom front manifesto the sharp decline in support in 1999 indicates that white fears about a post-apartheid south africa had largely been appeased .
the ff is however honest about the fact that it is a party representing the interests of afrikaners and other minorities .

it mentions issues like the murder of white farmers , the emigration of whites prompted by affirmative action , and the decline in the official use of the afrikaans language .
despite the setback of the 1999 election , some commentators have speculated whether this year 's poll could see the ff attract the support of some young white first-time voters with little previous interest in politics .

last week the opposition-controlled parliament voted to unseat mr roh - just one year into his five-year term in office - for breaking election law .
the court has 180 days to rule on whether the move was constitutional .
the president has been suspended until a decision is reached .
acting president goh kun has urged the judges to rule as quickly as possible .
the impeachment was initiated by south korea 's conservative opposition .
what happens next ?
president roh 's powers suspended case decided by constitutional court , could take six months pm goh kun becomes acting head of state 15 april national assembly elections to go ahead they will need the support of at least six of the court 's nine judges for the impeachment to go forward .
if they uphold the impeachment decision , mr roh will be stripped of his office and a new presidential election held within 60 days of the court 's verdict .
the court 's first meeting was held to decide on procedure for the hearings .
it arranged to hold the first public hearing on 30 march .
it is not clear whether mr roh himself will attend but he must be represented there .
meanwhile the government has warned north korea to stay out of its internal affairs .
it said relations could be damaged if the north continued to make unfounded comments about the impeachment .
north korea said it had proved the political backwardness of the south and accused the us of involvement .
north korean officials failed to turn up for talks on economic co-operation this week citing political instability as the reason .
' coup ' opposition mps will argue that the president should be removed for illegally backing the minority uri party in upcoming elections , and also accuse him of corruption and incompetence .
but the president 's legal team will say the charges are politically motivated .
some of the president 's supporters are describing the vote in the national assembly as a coup d 'etat .
polls show 70 % believe the main charge of violating electoral law is not serious enough to warrant such a move .

it is thought gioia minghella 's six-month-old bengal kitten , cesare , was shot with an airgun .
ms minghella , of havenstreet , on the isle of wight , said : " i can not begin to imagine what was going through the head of the person who did this .
" that someone , a person , could do such a thing to an innocent creature just shocks me to the core . "
i 'm so proud of the isle of wight - we live in a very privileged community but this has shaken my belief in the place where we live gioia minghella inquiries into the incident are still ongoing and chief inspector paul clark said police on the island were prepared to use new powers to arrest anyone carrying even an unloaded air weapon in public without permission .
he said : " people carrying imitation firearms or air weapons in public have become a real problem to the police . "
cesare was shot some time on the morning of sunday , 7 march , after wandering out of the home of ms minghella , sister of award-winning film director anthony minghella .
the animal has since undergone an operation to remove a pellet and to reset the bone .
body ' caved in ' ms minghella said : " we were playing with him before he went out .
he was so full of life and vitality .
" but the next time we saw him , he literally looked crushed .
he looked as though his body had caved in on itself .
" at first we were n't sure what was wrong , but during the day i realised that something really serious had happened to him .
" he just got sicker and sicker and looked as if he was withering in front of me . "
bengal cats were originally bred in the us from asian leopard cats and a domestic breed .
kittens can cost from a few hundred pounds to thousands for a top show cat .

the family run group said its annual pre-tax profits rose 13.2 % to £ 319.9m -lrb- $ 583.8m -rrb- .
the combined morrisons / safeway group is now britain 's fourth largest supermarket chain .
chairman sir ken morrison said : " a solid team performance delivered the goods once again . "
takeover victor morrisons ' £ 3bn acquisition of safeway brought to an end one of the most keenly-contested uk takeover struggles in recent years .
the bradford-based group sparked a bid battle for safeway last year after launching a £ 2.9bn offer for the firm .
it claimed victory after the government ruled against rival supermarket groups ' bids on competition concerns .

britain 's big three supermarket chains - tesco , asda and sainsbury 's - all made counter-offers for safeway , along with billionaire retail entrepreneur philip green .
the group is also considering converting nearly 180 medium size safeway stores into a " morrisons compact " brand , to challenge the likes of tesco and sainsburys which operate smaller branded town centre outlets .

the combined morrisons / safeway group is now britain 's fourth largest supermarket chain .
chairman sir ken morrison said : " a solid team performance delivered the goods once again . "
takeover victor morrisons ' £ 3bn acquisition of safeway brought to an end one of the most keenly-contested uk takeover struggles in recent years .
the bradford-based group sparked a bid battle for safeway last year after launching a £ 2.9bn offer for the firm .
it claimed victory after the government ruled against rival supermarket groups ' bids on competition concerns .
morrisons said it had received " great interest " in the 52 safeway stores the uk market regulator has required it to sell as a result of the takeover .

aid flows are shrinking , and rich governments are keener than ever for foreign investment by companies large and small to take up the slack .
but an increasingly important slice of the money heading for the developing world does not come from boardrooms and stock exchanges , let alone from government departments .
instead it is coming from the cleaner who vacuums your office late in the evening , the undocumented worker who picks the fruit you eat , or cleans the dishes at the restaurant you dined in last night .
more and more often , a sizable slice of whatever they earn will be heading through official means or otherwise back to their home country - sometimes to put food on their families ' tables and sometimes to underwrite investment in housing or a small business .
growing numbers the significance of this flow of remittances is only now becoming apparent .
the big change came in 2002-3 , when - according to world bank senior economist dilip ratha - a re-examination of how the flow of money from migrant workers was calculated showed that differences in definition from country to country were keeping much of the funds out of the headline numbers .
previous international monetary fund figures suggested a total for the philippines , for example , of $ 125m in 2001 .
the redesigned formula upped that 50-fold to $ 6bn . "
poor countries ca n't earn decent revenues by exporting coffee and cocoa , so they export people instead " ann pettifor , new economics foundation on a global basis , the reworking of the numbers came up with a total of as much as $ 80bn for 2002 .
that could well still be a sizable underestimate , partly because much of the money flows through informal channels rather than banks and officially-sanctioned money transfer firms .
for 2003 , some studies put the figure at $ 140bn .
the official market alone may have amounted to $ 150bn -lrb- admittedly not a figure limited to money sent to developing countries -rrb- in 2003 , according to studies quoted by money transfer giant western union , which itself performed 81 million person-to-person transfers last year .
spread in terms of the overall flows of funds to and from the developing world , even the 2002 number puts remittances in second place behind the $ 86bn in net foreign direct investment -lrb- fdi -rrb- , well above government and other aid -lrb- $ 33bn -rrb- .
given net payments on debt of almost $ 100bn , that makes it the main factor in keeping the overall net flow heading from north to south , rather than in the opposite direction .
indeed , the world bank 's figures indicate that in some places - particularly south asia - remittances dwarf all other forms of funding .
foreign direct investment -lrb- fdi -rrb- into south asia was close to $ 5bn in 2002 , for instance ; remittances in the same year topped $ 16bn .

figures for 2001 and while fdi tends to be concentrated on a tiny number of particularly good prospects - the lion 's share goes to just 10 countries - remittances are spread much more widely among countries in need .
costs it is also seen as significant that the money goes straight to people on the ground , rather than being mediated by governments , ngos or foreign businesses .
the only obvious cost is getting the money from one place to the other - which can vary from a couple of percentage points , in the case of informal -lrb- and usually illegal -rrb- money transfer agents , to 15 % or more for licensed dealers , according to world bank statistics .
on the face of it , then , remittances would seem a win-win situation both for poorer countries and the richer host nations .
one gets the money it so badly needs .
the other gets workers who are prepared to do many of the jobs that their hosts ' citizens are less willing to perform .
helping hand in some ways , mr ratha says , that presents a perfect opportunity to assist with development - as long as it is realised that remittance money is not a replacement for development funding .
for instance , measures to reduce the cost of sending money could inflate remittance flows significantly , while easing the tight currency restrictions prevalent in many developing nations would also narrow the price gap between informal and formal avenues for transfer .
" finance ministers from the g7 -lrb- group of rich nations -rrb- have gone on record to say that one of their goals should be to reduce remittance costs , " he says .
the resource requirements for reducing poverty are " humongous " - and the cost to the developed world of easing the flow of what he calls " money earned the hard way " to friends and relatives back home is minimal .
" it 's tiny compared to the size and wealth of the host country , but huge for the home country , " he says .
people exports but not everyone is so positive about what remittance flows really mean .
some of the money might come home , says ann pettifor , former head of the jubilee 2000 anti-debt campaign and now a director at the new economics foundation in london .

figures for 2001 but the cost is the outrush of people who end up contributing , first and foremost , to another country 's bottom line - not least by earning the hard currency their homeland needs to pay off the massive debts with which much of the developing world is saddled .
" poor countries ca n't earn decent revenues by exporting coffee and cocoa , so they export people instead , " she says .
the supply of servants and cleaners , many of whom could be skilled workers back home , destabilises the home country 's labour market - a sign , she says , not of development but of desperation .
and the immigration restrictions imposed increasingly by rich countries - whether because of job fears or as part of tightened security against perceived terror threats - therefore act as a trade barrier , just as farm subsidies do against wheat or cotton .
more to come ?
still , for the foreseeable future it seems clear that remittances will play an increasing role in the finances of poorer states .
the sums transmitted are growing fast , while richer countries - whatever the rhetoric about jobs for those at home - will continue to suck in migrants .
and the cleaner , the waiter , the farm labourer and the building site worker will - unnoticed by most - continue to displace businessmen and ministers as the main underwriters of setting their home country on the path to development .

the new face of development funding ?
aid flows are shrinking , and rich governments are keener than ever for foreign investment by companies large and small to take up the slack .
but an increasingly important slice of the money heading for the developing world does not come from boardrooms and stock exchanges , let alone from government departments .
instead it is coming from the cleaner who vacuums your office late in the evening , the undocumented worker who picks the fruit you eat , or cleans the dishes at the restaurant you dined in last night .
more and more often , a sizable slice of whatever they earn will be heading through official means or otherwise back to their home country - sometimes to put food on their families ' tables and sometimes to underwrite investment in housing or a small business .
growing numbers the significance of this flow of remittances is only now becoming apparent .
the big change came in 2002-3 , when - according to world bank senior economist dilip ratha - a re-examination of how the flow of money from migrant workers was calculated showed that differences in definition from country to country were keeping much of the funds out of the headline numbers .
previous international monetary fund figures suggested a total for the philippines , for example , of $ 125m in 2001 .
the redesigned formula upped that 50-fold to $ 6bn .

given net payments on debt of almost $ 100bn , that makes it the main factor in keeping the overall net flow heading from north to south , rather than in the opposite direction .

the only obvious cost is getting the money from one place to the other - which can vary from a couple of percentage points , in the case of informal -lrb- and usually illegal -rrb- money transfer agents , to 15 % or more for licensed dealers , according to world bank statistics .
on the face of it , then , remittances would seem a win-win situation both for poorer countries and the richer host nations .

mr zougam has not been charged with anything and much of the information about him is emerging from spanish newspaper reports rather than official police information .
mr zougam grew up in the moroccan port city of tangiers spanish media say passengers who survived the attacks told police they saw mr zougam leaning against a carriage of one of the trains bombed on 11 march .
mr zougam , who ran a mobile phone shop in madrid , was arrested two days later , along with two other moroccans and two indian nationals .
he is said to have been under spanish police surveillance since the bombings in casablanca last may that killed 45 people .
moroccan police believe he has links with the salafia jihadia group blamed for those attacks .
spanish newspaper el pais said mr zougam is thought to have shared a house with abdelaziz beyaich , who is in custody in spain in connection with the casablanca attacks .
flat searched mr zougam is also alleged to be a follower of abu dahdah , the suspected leader of an al-qaeda cell in madrid .

it is not clear whether it is the same jamal zougam .
mr zougam was born in the moroccan port city of tangiers on 5 october 1973 .
a friend in madrid described him as a " modern muslim " and by no means a fanatic .
" he was good looking , he did n't have a beard ... he joked around a lot .
he was religious ; we 're all religious , " a 28-year-old man called abdul told reuters .
" he 's the kind of guy who would walk around in a lacoste t-shirt in summer .

" for the people of iraq , democracy is against the law , " says teacher abdul-razak hameed .
he fears it will take a long time to undo years of living under corruption and violence .
iraqis take lessons in democracy to help move the process along , the uk department for international development -lrb- dfid -rrb- is running democracy workshops in basra .
they range from highly developed discussions with lawyers and law students about the country 's embryonic constitution , to town hall meetings .
" people 's ideas here of democracy can be very sophisticated , " said coalition provisional authority -lrb- cpa -rrb- political advisor nikesh mehta .
" however they have no experience of putting them into practice . "
farkhanda chaudhry , one of the organisers , said participation in the workshops had been enthusiastic .
" they 've never had an opportunity to discuss publicly what democracy means and what it means for iraq .
" we 're giving them the opportunity to discuss it from different viewpoints , including from an islamic one . "
religious differences of the five or six biggest emerging political parties , two have religious bases , including shia muslim group sciri .
people in the workshops have expressed concerns that democracy may open up iraq to religious fundamentalism .
the workshops consider democracy from an islamic viewpoint " it 's a fear for women , especially over the hijab issue , " said mrs chaudhry .
she said some people had argued that iraq did not need a constitutional law because it had islamic law .
thirty iraqis , mostly teachers , have been trained to run the workshops as part of the dfid project and the training has included how to deal with the islamic law question .
however , evidence from local elections is that people are not electing religious people but educated technical people , according to dfid .
of the estimated 150 political parties in the country - which includes small ones - some are religious , and others attract their supporters from tribal groups , backed up by militia .
in addition , others prove popular among the estimated 20,000 refugees who have returned to iraq .
many fled either because of the iran-iraq war , or due to the clearing of the marshlands and saddam hussein 's brutalisation of the south .
in the latest meeting with the electricity directors they were really taking charge - they were telling us what to do patrick nixon , coalition governor of the four southern provinces they have returned without identity papers so can not get access to rations , housing , education or healthcare .
the political parties provide them with social welfare in return for their vote .
the first national elections will not be held until december 2005 but there is evidence that democratic ideals are already taking hold .
in the past , all civil institutions , like hospitals , schools and electricity companies , were run on direct orders from baghdad and the directors did not have to think for themselves .
patrick nixon , the coalition governor for the four southern provinces , said they were now embracing the chance to make decisions .
" in the latest meeting with the electricity directors they were really taking charge .
they were telling us what to do .
it was the same thing with the health directors . "
workers ' rights and there is evidence trade unions are being formed .
under saddam hussein there was one national trade union , the iraqi federation , run by the baath party , with every union president appointed by saddam .
now , the transitional authority law allows for freedom of association and groups are springing up , particularly in the professions .
it is not clear how much influence workers ' trade unions - which used to be part of the iraq federation - will have on pay negotiations , for example , but anecdotal evidence suggests they are already going through significant readjustment to their new freedom .
in nasiriya province in the south of the country , the first local elections have already been held .
governor sabir roumagahal said it was a " source of pride " that they had taken a " unique step " in iraq 's path to democracy .

jackson and his fellow oscar winners were presented with glass goblets after winning 11 oscars for the lord of the rings : the return of the king .
" if there was an oscar for the best city to make a movie in , it would be wellington , " jackson told 2,500 fans .
the event was low-key compared to the film 's world premiere in december .
the ceremony was held in an indoor sports hall due to poor weather .
the celebrations were delayed until this week because jackson was busy preparing the dvd version of the lord of the rings and making plans for his re-make of king kong .
jackson is known for his dishevelled look jackson said his " second proudest moment " after winning the oscars was being named as one of the worst-dressed participants .
" i thought that was pretty cool , " he said .
local cartoonist tom scott introduced jackson by saying city mayor kerry prendergast had rung him asking what they could give the director that he did not already have .
" i said , how about an iron , " scott said .
jackson revealed how the lord of the rings team had been told off for making too much noise on oscars night by hotel staff , who also refused to sell them champagne after two in the morning .
the lord of the rings : the return of the king won 11 prizes out of a possible 11 at the academy awards .
it became the first fantasy film to win best picture - and equalled the record trophy tally at the hollywood ceremony .
jackson snubbed hollywood by filming and post-producing the three rings films in wellington .
the films have had a huge effect on new zealand 's tourism trade , according to figures released earlier this month .

by anita rice bbc current affairs interactive do gated communities help , or hinder , local safety and social cohesion ?
the uk home secretary has called for a debate on how they improve security , while the deputy commissioner of the met is wholly opposed to them .
security guards patrol around the clock at bow quarter " i know more people living here than i would do in a normal street , " says 45-year-old terry nicholls , resident of bow quarter , a gated community in east london .
and bow quarter does not feel like a normal street at all .
like most gated communities , the complex of around 700 apartments is walled off from the surrounding area , employs security guards round the clock and is peppered by dozens of infra-red surveillance cameras .
once you 've been signed in and got past the gates and the security guards , you 're in a totally different world to the streets you 've just left behind .
bow quarter is peaceful , quiet , litter and graffiti-free and , of course , feels totally safe .
it stands in stark contrast to the noise , bustle and social mix found on the bow road at the end of the street .
behind the gates , the complex has its own gym -lrb- complete with swimming pool , whirlpool bath and sauna -rrb- , supermarket , bar , restaurant , postal box and decked communal areas .
and therein lies the rub .
separate lives as mr nicholls acknowledges , the residents do n't need to mix with the locals outside the gates : " it can make you very insular ... we do n't need to leave the building at all . "
gated communities walled or fenced housing developments to which public access is restricted , often guarded using cctv and / or security personnel .
often have legal agreements in place which tie residents to a common code of conduct .
there are 1000 in england alone today .
and , as he says , he may know more people than he would on an average inner-city street but he 's mixing with people inside the complex , not other locals .
so while gated communities may entice some middle and upper income groups into inner cities who may have refused to live there because of fear of crime , they may not actually promote social cohesion and respect for law and order .
rather , there are fears that gating merely serves to highlight inequality in highly polarised areas like london .
a report on gated communities by sheffield hallam and glasgow university for the office of the deputy prime minister quotes figures indicating stark differences between the two populations inside and outside the gates and suggesting that the two rarely come into contact .
terry nicholls says living in a gated community can make you " insular " .
for example , it states 73 % of adults inside the gates are economically active as opposed to 57 % outside .
the majority of adults within the gates are in social classes 1 and 2 , whereas the residents outside are overwhelmingly from classes 3 and 4 .
the report also found that 48 % of residents inside the gates are owner-occupiers , compared to only 3 % outside .
open society ?
however , earlier this year home secretary david blunkett called for the possible expansion of gated communities , beyond just wealthier people , as a means of improving security and social cohesion .
he said : " as part of the ' big conversation ' that the labour party has engaged in , we want to hear how we can make available to the many what is currently only available to the few .
" take the example of gated and secure communities .
not just in london but primarily in london , there are communities of the wealthy ... where people contribute towards the security and order within the enclave in which they live . "
but deputy commissioner of the metropolitan police , sir ian blair , disagrees with the home secretary entirely .
bow quarter has its own leisure , shopping and postal facilities he told the makers of the television programme if ... things do n't get better , a drama-documentary examining the increasing gap between rich and poor , that he is " entirely opposed to the idea that we should have any kind of gated communities ... because they are invidious for social cohesion . "
" if someone can not walk along what should be a public street because it 's blocked off , then it seems to me we are likely to find that the people being excluded are from particular groups , and i think that 's an extraordinarily dangerous idea .
" we want an open society , which is cohesive , which is at ease with itself .
not one from which groups of people withdraw . "
back in bow quarter i asked mr nicholls if he thought living in a gated community could increase people 's fear of crime and , consequently , their poorer neighbours outside the gate .
he pauses for a while then says he sought out a gated development because of the fear of being burgled rather than anything else but acknowledges this may be the case for some .
he told me : " many of the women say they love living here but hate having to walk down from the tube because they are afraid of getting mugged , and there have been spates of muggings .
bow quarter is walled off from the surrounding area " as soon as they get past the gates you can almost see a weight come off people 's shoulders , you can almost see them breathe a sigh of relief . "
it 's a thought echoed by fellow resident , 34-year-old julie hicklin .
ms hicklin , while saying she is n't afraid or unduly worried by her neighbourhood beyond the gates , also acknowledges the feeling of relief and safety once through the gates .
" you leave the tube station knowing that in 10 minutes time you 'll be through the gates , you can breathe , you 're home , " she says .
haves and have-nots ?
both residents claim another reason for living in secure , gated communities is that they fear the police are not resourced well enough to adequately police areas .
while sir ian blair may lament that sections of the community could be effectively buying their own security and so fragmenting society and undermining law and order , the rise of the gated community may continue until the public confidence is restored in policing .
as mr nicholls puts it : " i understand the deputy commissioner 's concerns about patrolling and policing , but the truth is he does n't have the resources to do the patrols etc .
" of course , gated communities will lead to a haves and have-nots divide , but we need to be able to look out for ourselves and , perhaps places like bow quarter are allowing the police to concentrate their resources where they are needed . "

it stands in stark contrast to the noise , bustle and social mix found on the bow road at the end of the street .
behind the gates , the complex has its own gym -lrb- complete with swimming pool , whirlpool bath and sauna -rrb- , supermarket , bar , restaurant , postal box and decked communal areas .
and therein lies the rub .
separate lives as mr nicholls acknowledges , the residents do n't need to mix with the locals outside the gates : " it can make you very insular ... we do n't need to leave the building at all . "
gated communities walled or fenced housing developments to which public access is restricted , often guarded using cctv and / or security personnel .
often have legal agreements in place which tie residents to a common code of conduct .
there are 1000 in england alone today .
and , as he says , he may know more people than he would on an average inner-city street but he 's mixing with people inside the complex , not other locals .
so while gated communities may entice some middle and upper income groups into inner cities who may have refused to live there because of fear of crime , they may not actually promote social cohesion and respect for law and order .
rather , there are fears that gating merely serves to highlight inequality in highly polarised areas like london .
a report on gated communities by sheffield hallam and glasgow university for the office of the deputy prime minister quotes figures indicating stark differences between the two populations inside and outside the gates and suggesting that the two rarely come into contact .
terry nicholls says living in a gated community can make you " insular " .
for example , it states 73 % of adults inside the gates are economically active as opposed to 57 % outside .
the majority of adults within the gates are in social classes 1 and 2 , whereas the residents outside are overwhelmingly from classes 3 and 4 .
the report also found that 48 % of residents inside the gates are owner-occupiers , compared to only 3 % outside .
open society ?
however , earlier this year home secretary david blunkett called for the possible expansion of gated communities , beyond just wealthier people , as a means of improving security and social cohesion .
he said : " as part of the ' big conversation ' that the labour party has engaged in , we want to hear how we can make available to the many what is currently only available to the few .
" take the example of gated and secure communities .
not just in london but primarily in london , there are communities of the wealthy ... where people contribute towards the security and order within the enclave in which they live . "
but deputy commissioner of the metropolitan police , sir ian blair , disagrees with the home secretary entirely .
bow quarter has its own leisure , shopping and postal facilities he told the makers of the television programme if ... things do n't get better , a drama-documentary examining the increasing gap between rich and poor , that he is " entirely opposed to the idea that we should have any kind of gated communities ... because they are invidious for social cohesion . "
" if someone can not walk along what should be a public street because it 's blocked off , then it seems to me we are likely to find that the people being excluded are from particular groups , and i think that 's an extraordinarily dangerous idea .
" we want an open society , which is cohesive , which is at ease with itself .
not one from which groups of people withdraw . "
back in bow quarter i asked mr nicholls if he thought living in a gated community could increase people 's fear of crime and , consequently , their poorer neighbours outside the gate .
he pauses for a while then says he sought out a gated development because of the fear of being burgled rather than anything else but acknowledges this may be the case for some .
he told me : " many of the women say they love living here but hate having to walk down from the tube because they are afraid of getting mugged , and there have been spates of muggings .
bow quarter is walled off from the surrounding area " as soon as they get past the gates you can almost see a weight come off people 's shoulders , you can almost see them breathe a sigh of relief . "
it 's a thought echoed by fellow resident , 34-year-old julie hicklin .
ms hicklin , while saying she is n't afraid or unduly worried by her neighbourhood beyond the gates , also acknowledges the feeling of relief and safety once through the gates .
" you leave the tube station knowing that in 10 minutes time you 'll be through the gates , you can breathe , you 're home , " she says .
haves and have-nots ?
both residents claim another reason for living in secure , gated communities is that they fear the police are not resourced well enough to adequately police areas .
while sir ian blair may lament that sections of the community could be effectively buying their own security and so fragmenting society and undermining law and order , the rise of the gated community may continue until the public confidence is restored in policing .
as mr nicholls puts it : " i understand the deputy commissioner 's concerns about patrolling and policing , but the truth is he does n't have the resources to do the patrols etc .
" of course , gated communities will lead to a haves and have-nots divide , but we need to be able to look out for ourselves and , perhaps places like bow quarter are allowing the police to concentrate their resources where they are needed . "

by anita rice bbc current affairs interactive do gated communities help , or hinder , local safety and social cohesion ?
the uk home secretary has called for a debate on how they improve security , while the deputy commissioner of the met is wholly opposed to them .
security guards patrol around the clock at bow quarter " i know more people living here than i would do in a normal street , " says 45-year-old terry nicholls , resident of bow quarter , a gated community in east london .
and bow quarter does not feel like a normal street at all .
like most gated communities , the complex of around 700 apartments is walled off from the surrounding area , employs security guards round the clock and is peppered by dozens of infra-red surveillance cameras .

that is recommended in a report on their future for the welsh assembly government .
the three parks , brecon beacons , pembrokeshire and snowdonia , cover more than 20 % of wales .
they are governed by independent authorities with members appointed by the assembly or nominated by local county councils .
but the review says that system should change .
the report looked at the role of the parks and considered their contribution to sustainable development . "
the importance of the national parks as national assets can not be overstated " john lloyd jones , countryside council it also examined how the parks could influence the communities within its boundaries and beyond .
despite their size , the parks are home to just 2.9 % of the population .
john lloyd jones , countryside council for wales chairman , said : " the importance of the national parks as national assets can not be overstated .
" the environment contributes nearly £ 9bn to the welsh economy each year .
" the environment is seen at its very best in our national parks , supporting many rural services and communities . "
one of the main issues arising from the report was the selection of candidates to the national park authorities .
the method of inviting and selecting people for appointment by the assembly government was seen to deliver a " high calibre of competence " .
however , the system where by members of the local authorities were nominated to the national park authorities was criticised .
the report found members were often selected on the basis of availability rather than on an " interest in the national parks or a willingness to work within the guiding principals " .
the authors of the report say they favour direct elections in future .
but that is a move which would require a change in the law and a lot of discussion before it happens .
in pembrokeshire recently county council members have been accused of following council policy rather than the interests of the park by supporting the bluestone holiday village development .
