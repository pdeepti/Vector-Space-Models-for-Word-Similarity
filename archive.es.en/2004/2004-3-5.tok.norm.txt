11 terror cell in hamburg behind bars , a higher court on thursday struck down the decision . in its decision , the five-judge panel of the federal court of justice said that hamburg judges did not have enough evidence to convict mounir el motassadeq on charges of accessory to commit murder in 3,066 cases and membership in a terrorist organization in february 2003 . lawyers for the 30-year-old moroccan national , currently serving a 15-year prison term , said they would apply for the immediate release of their defendant pending the retrial in hamburg . observers say motassadeq 's retrial and possible release is a blow to germany 's reputation as an effective terrorism-fighting country .

they attribute this to the rise in the cost of german health care and a general increase in expenses .
the poll , which was published in the financial times deutschland , said three fifths of those polled said they had not noticed an increase in their income compared to the same time last year , and almost half said they had been expecting their new income to be higher than it is .
the new tax rates have reduced the highest bracket by 3.5 percent to 45 percent , and cut the lowest rate from 19.9 to 16 percent . more briefs 05.03.2004 -pipe- industry calls for tax reductions 05.03.2004 -pipe- chancellor defends apprenticeship penalty plan 05.03.2004 -pipe- deutsche bahn to slash jobs 04.03.2004 -pipe- court denies settlement rumors in mannesmann trial 04.03.2004 -pipe- german unemployment rises , factory orders slump 04.03.2004 -pipe- new adidas logo kicks it like beckham 04.03.2004 -pipe- german car market showing signs of recovery 03.03.2004 -pipe- buying cars abroad can save germans money radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a german court 's decision to grant the only person convicted in connection to the sept .
11 terrorist attacks a retrial illustrates the difficulty western courts are having in putting suspected terrorists behind bars . more than year after a german court put the first - and only - suspect connected with the sept .
11 terror cell in hamburg behind bars , a higher court on thursday struck down the decision . in its decision , the five-judge panel of the federal court of justice said that hamburg judges did not have enough evidence to convict mounir el motassadeq on charges of accessory to commit murder in 3,066 cases and membership in a terrorist organization in february 2003 . lawyers for the 30-year-old moroccan national , currently serving a 15-year prison term , said they would apply for the immediate release of their defendant pending the retrial in hamburg . observers say motassadeq 's retrial and possible release is a blow to germany 's reputation as an effective terrorism-fighting country .
interior minister otto schily , who has referred to motassadeq 's conviction as evidence of germany 's commitment in rooting out terrorists , called the decision " regrettable . "
the news follows a decision by bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi a different hamburg a few weeks ago to acquit another suspected accomplice to the hamburg terror cell , abdelghani mzoudi -lrb- photo -rrb- . " a picture emerges that shows that something is n't quite right in the way we 're fighting or prosecuting terrorism , " said kai hirschmann , co-director of the institute for terrorism research and policy in a dw-world interview .
" internationally , people are looking at the decisions in the german courts - and we could make ourselves laughable . " exploiting every loophole to free suspects hirschmann and other legal experts say the cases against mzoudi and motassadeq demonstrate the difficulty western courts are having in prosecuting suspected islamic terrorists .
for more than a year , federal prosecutors in the united states have been presenting what many say is a porous case against zacarias moussaoui , a french national and the alleged 20th hijacker that never joined the suicide missions on washington d.c. and new york city . moussaoui has frustrated prosecutors by demanding access to suspected al qaeda power brokers , like alleged sept .
11 planners ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed , currently in us military custody .
an appeals court is currently deciding whether moussaoui should have that access . " if you look at the moussaoui defense , then you see that they 've built it up along similar lines , " said hirschmann .
" they use every loophole the democratic state allows them . " motassadeq 's lawyers asked for similar access to either binalshibh or transcripts of his testimony , which is allegedly in the hands of germany 's federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
when a bnd officer testified in court that releasing the information would damage germany 's reputation in the intelligence community , the judges accepted the explanation .
the appeals judges on thursday did not . " the high regional court in hamburg should … have acknowledged these events in weighing the evidence , " the five-judge panel wrote in its decision . treating a terrorist like a murderer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people run from the collapse of world trade center tower tuesday , sept .

in a horrific sequence of destruction , terrorists crashed two planes into the world trade center and the twin 110-story towers collapsed .
explosions also rocked the pentagon and the state department and spread fear across the nation .
-lrb- ap photo / suzanne plunkett -rrb- for many , the decision proves that the shadow of the terrorist attacks no longer hovers over the judicial process .
with the horror and trauma of the terrorist attacks no longer fresh in everyone 's minds , legal reason is beginning to set in . " the courts are starting to realize they ca n't on principal treat terrorism any differently , " said michael byers , a duke university specialist in international law , in a dw-world interview .

interior minister otto schily , who has referred to motassadeq 's conviction as evidence of germany 's commitment in rooting out terrorists , called the decision " regrettable . "
the news follows a decision by bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi a different hamburg a few weeks ago to acquit another suspected accomplice to the hamburg terror cell , abdelghani mzoudi -lrb- photo -rrb- .

" internationally , people are looking at the decisions in the german courts - and we could make ourselves laughable . " exploiting every loophole to free suspects hirschmann and other legal experts say the cases against mzoudi and motassadeq demonstrate the difficulty western courts are having in prosecuting suspected islamic terrorists .
for more than a year , federal prosecutors in the united states have been presenting what many say is a porous case against zacarias moussaoui , a french national and the alleged 20th hijacker that never joined the suicide missions on washington d.c. and new york city . moussaoui has frustrated prosecutors by demanding access to suspected al qaeda power brokers , like alleged sept .

an appeals court is currently deciding whether moussaoui should have that access . " if you look at the moussaoui defense , then you see that they 've built it up along similar lines , " said hirschmann .
" they use every loophole the democratic state allows them . " motassadeq 's lawyers asked for similar access to either binalshibh or transcripts of his testimony , which is allegedly in the hands of germany 's federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- .

but in the end , his wish to set the record straight forced him to change his mind , he told reporters as he presented the first of a two-volume autobiography entitled " memories : 1930 - 1982 . "
kohl said he did n't agree with the way he and his government were described in the memoirs of some of his peers .
" i lived during the same time , i was there and it was completely different , " said kohl .
readers hoping to finally discover the truth about who was involved in the 1999 slush funds scandal that has tainted kohl 's reputation will be disappointed : kohl said he will still not disclose the names of those who donated some € 1 million -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- in illegal campaign contributions .
" i will write about the overall spending question , " said kohl .
" about people , i have given a definitive answer . "
kohl dedicated his memoirs to his late wife , hannelore , who committed suicide in 2001 after suffering for years from an incurable allergy to sunlight . more briefs 05.03.2004 -pipe- germany refuses to foot bill for brothel visits 05.03.2004 -pipe- schröder , prodi voice optimism on eu constitution 04.03.2004 -pipe- german sportswear manufacturers under fire 04.03.2004 -pipe- cannabis still germans ' drug of choice 04.03.2004 -pipe- health insurers say no to homeopathy 04.03.2004 -pipe- u.s. does n't plan major troop withdrawal in germany 04.03.2004 -pipe- tv show investigated for cruelty to animals 03.03.2004 -pipe- schröder snubs germany 's top tabloid radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the european commission wants more competition on international rail services and regulated compensation rights for customers , as part of its plan to liberalize the rail sector . it 's good news for travelers , but could mean extra bureaucratic hurdles for european railway operators .
eu transport commissioner loyola de palacio 's new proposals for the future of european train travel stress customer service , enshrined by eu-wide regulations on compensation for delays and poor service .
according to de palacio , voluntary passenger rights agreements do n't work . " these companies are hundreds of years old and they have to be brought into line with the new market demand , " de palacio told a news conference this week .
" losses are not incurred because railways are biblically cursed , it 's because they 're poorly managed . " refunds for delays under the proposals in her draft bill , if a passenger on a two-hour cross-border train journey is delayed for more than an hour , he or she would be entitled to full compensation of the ticket price .
the proposals also include laws on how freight operators should compensate customers for delays or damaged goods . the community of european railways -lrb- cer -rrb- heaped criticism on the draft bill .
" creating a uniform , eu-wide legislative approach to define quality could create an extra administrative burden on the rail system , further threatening the competitiveness of rail , " said cer chairman giancarlo cimoli in a statement . the trans-national rail cooperative thalys - which offers services in france , belgium , germany and the netherlands - already has the kind of compensation rights the ec says are needed for more competitive service .
refunds for delays range from 20 percent of the ticket price for a half-hour delay , to a full refund for a delay of two hours .
the company also has policies to pick up the costs of onward travel or overnight stays should no connecting trains be available . such customer service policies should be voluntary for rail operators because they 're effective , andreas leisdon , spokesman for thalys international in germany told dw-world .
" i do n't think it 's necessary to have laws to regulate passenger rights , it should be a self-obligation of the companies to offer these rights , " he said .
" what de palacio is asking for is what we 've been offering since 1996 , and we get very positive customer feedback . " more private competition the commission 's compensation proposals are part of a greater reform aimed at liberalizing the operation of europe 's railways to make train travel a more attractive alternative to driving or using europe 's low budget airlines . " in 2010 , the high-speed trans-european network will be connected and new services will be able to develop on the basis of competition , " said de palacio .
" pressure from low-cost airlines is already a reality for international rail passenger services .
they will have to evolve into new models … this is the right time to free up initiatives . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eurostar train .
the commission anticipates the arrival of more private companies to compete with existing trans-national services such as thalys and eurostar , which links the u.k. with destinations on the continent .
thalys admits that while budget airlines are competition , the use of private cars is a factor of equal importance . " rail companies do n't have to be afraid of more competition because the market is big enough , " said leisdon .

the european commission wants more competition on international rail services and regulated compensation rights for customers , as part of its plan to liberalize the rail sector . it 's good news for travelers , but could mean extra bureaucratic hurdles for european railway operators .
eu transport commissioner loyola de palacio 's new proposals for the future of european train travel stress customer service , enshrined by eu-wide regulations on compensation for delays and poor service .
according to de palacio , voluntary passenger rights agreements do n't work . " these companies are hundreds of years old and they have to be brought into line with the new market demand , " de palacio told a news conference this week .
" losses are not incurred because railways are biblically cursed , it 's because they 're poorly managed . " refunds for delays under the proposals in her draft bill , if a passenger on a two-hour cross-border train journey is delayed for more than an hour , he or she would be entitled to full compensation of the ticket price .
the proposals also include laws on how freight operators should compensate customers for delays or damaged goods . the community of european railways -lrb- cer -rrb- heaped criticism on the draft bill .
" creating a uniform , eu-wide legislative approach to define quality could create an extra administrative burden on the rail system , further threatening the competitiveness of rail , " said cer chairman giancarlo cimoli in a statement . the trans-national rail cooperative thalys - which offers services in france , belgium , germany and the netherlands - already has the kind of compensation rights the ec says are needed for more competitive service .
refunds for delays range from 20 percent of the ticket price for a half-hour delay , to a full refund for a delay of two hours .
the company also has policies to pick up the costs of onward travel or overnight stays should no connecting trains be available . such customer service policies should be voluntary for rail operators because they 're effective , andreas leisdon , spokesman for thalys international in germany told dw-world .
" i do n't think it 's necessary to have laws to regulate passenger rights , it should be a self-obligation of the companies to offer these rights , " he said .
" what de palacio is asking for is what we 've been offering since 1996 , and we get very positive customer feedback . " more private competition the commission 's compensation proposals are part of a greater reform aimed at liberalizing the operation of europe 's railways to make train travel a more attractive alternative to driving or using europe 's low budget airlines . " in 2010 , the high-speed trans-european network will be connected and new services will be able to develop on the basis of competition , " said de palacio .
" pressure from low-cost airlines is already a reality for international rail passenger services .
they will have to evolve into new models … this is the right time to free up initiatives . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eurostar train .
the commission anticipates the arrival of more private companies to compete with existing trans-national services such as thalys and eurostar , which links the u.k. with destinations on the continent .
thalys admits that while budget airlines are competition , the use of private cars is a factor of equal importance . " rail companies do n't have to be afraid of more competition because the market is big enough , " said leisdon .
" our main objective is to get more people out of their cars and onto trains .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.03.2004 chip maker 's stock sale ends german ipo drought großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chip maker x-fab 's floatation could open the ipo floodgates .
an erfurt-based producer of semiconductors plans to float its shares on the frankfurt stock market and raise some € 185 million .
germany 's first stock offering in over a year looks to be the start of an ipo upsurge . x-fab semiconductor foundries ag , which manufactures made-to-order semiconductor wafers , will offer up to 13.23 million shares , priced at between € 10 and € 14 -lrb- $ 12 and $ 17 -rrb- apiece , to start trading in frankfurt on march 19 .
order taking began on march 4 and will continue through march 16 .
the company is taking advantage of a 30 percent gain in germany 's blue-chip dax index since january of last year and is the first of at least nine firms planning to raise money on the open market .
analysts say it is the start of the end of a three-year slump in ipo offerings that came about as a result of weak stock markets , falling earnings and accounting scandals .
x-fab 's parent company , the belgian holding company elex nv , will offer between 5 and 7 million of its own x-fab shares plus another 4.5 million new shares and an over-allotment option of an additional 1.7 million if demand is high .
a successful ipo could give the company , which was once part of an east german semiconductor collective , a market valuation of up to € 428.8 million -lrb- $ 527.6 million -rrb- analysts are wary that figure is considered too high by several analysts and many have been publicly cautioning against the ipo .
" we do not recommend this one , " reinhild keitel , spokeswoman with a german organization of small shareholders , told dow jones .
" it looks overpriced , given the information available to us . "
jochen mathée , a fund manager with invesco , told german public television that the price was " ambitious , " saying a valuation of around € 250 million was more appropriate .
others pointed out that x-fab has never been profitable and has posted losses for the last three years .
moreover , the company is saddled with up to € 25 million in debt .
the company also raised suspicions when the lead bank managing the sale , ing , said that " technical difficulties " prevented it from releasing a sales prospectus , which is required reading for investors who want a realistic overview of a company 's health .
germany 's largest association representing private investors , dsw , has discouraged its members from buying the shares , saying the ipo was unattractive all in all , partly because some 60 percent of the proceeds would likely flow to the parent company , elex , and not back into x-fab .
" this issue reminds me of the negative things that led to the devaluation of the neuer markt , " jürgen kurz , a spokesman for dsw , told dow jones , referring to the now defunct german high-tech index which closed in 2003 after investors shied away en masse from the technology sector .
start of a trend despite their misgivings , analysts say a successful x-fab offering would be a positive development , since germany needs a string of success stories to lure wary retail investors back to the market .
already cautious investors , germans started retreating from the market after the bubble burst in 2000 .
the number of shareholders declined to 7.8 percent of the population in 2003 , from a high of 9.7 percent three years earlier .
x-fab 's director , hans-jürgen straub , is undeterred by the pre-offer criticism .
" demand is high , " he said in an interview .
it does appear the ipo is springing to life after a long slumber all across europe .
besides x-fab , british biotech firm ark therapeutics and belgian telecoms firm belgacom have provided details of their ipo plans as economic conditions improve and stock markets rebound .
earlier this week , financial industry analyst dealogic reported a surge in the value of ips in europe to € 599 million -lrb- $ 740 million -rrb- in the first two months of this year , a significant increase from € 19 million -lrb- $ 26 million -rrb- from a year before .

an erfurt-based producer of semiconductors plans to float its shares on the frankfurt stock market and raise some € 185 million .
germany 's first stock offering in over a year looks to be the start of an ipo upsurge . x-fab semiconductor foundries ag , which manufactures made-to-order semiconductor wafers , will offer up to 13.23 million shares , priced at between € 10 and € 14 -lrb- $ 12 and $ 17 -rrb- apiece , to start trading in frankfurt on march 19 .
order taking began on march 4 and will continue through march 16 .
the company is taking advantage of a 30 percent gain in germany 's blue-chip dax index since january of last year and is the first of at least nine firms planning to raise money on the open market .
analysts say it is the start of the end of a three-year slump in ipo offerings that came about as a result of weak stock markets , falling earnings and accounting scandals .
x-fab 's parent company , the belgian holding company elex nv , will offer between 5 and 7 million of its own x-fab shares plus another 4.5 million new shares and an over-allotment option of an additional 1.7 million if demand is high .
a successful ipo could give the company , which was once part of an east german semiconductor collective , a market valuation of up to € 428.8 million -lrb- $ 527.6 million -rrb- analysts are wary that figure is considered too high by several analysts and many have been publicly cautioning against the ipo .
" we do not recommend this one , " reinhild keitel , spokeswoman with a german organization of small shareholders , told dow jones .
" it looks overpriced , given the information available to us . "
jochen mathée , a fund manager with invesco , told german public television that the price was " ambitious , " saying a valuation of around € 250 million was more appropriate .
others pointed out that x-fab has never been profitable and has posted losses for the last three years .
moreover , the company is saddled with up to € 25 million in debt .
the company also raised suspicions when the lead bank managing the sale , ing , said that " technical difficulties " prevented it from releasing a sales prospectus , which is required reading for investors who want a realistic overview of a company 's health .
germany 's largest association representing private investors , dsw , has discouraged its members from buying the shares , saying the ipo was unattractive all in all , partly because some 60 percent of the proceeds would likely flow to the parent company , elex , and not back into x-fab .
" this issue reminds me of the negative things that led to the devaluation of the neuer markt , " jürgen kurz , a spokesman for dsw , told dow jones , referring to the now defunct german high-tech index which closed in 2003 after investors shied away en masse from the technology sector .
start of a trend despite their misgivings , analysts say a successful x-fab offering would be a positive development , since germany needs a string of success stories to lure wary retail investors back to the market .
already cautious investors , germans started retreating from the market after the bubble burst in 2000 .
the number of shareholders declined to 7.8 percent of the population in 2003 , from a high of 9.7 percent three years earlier .
x-fab 's director , hans-jürgen straub , is undeterred by the pre-offer criticism .
" demand is high , " he said in an interview .
it does appear the ipo is springing to life after a long slumber all across europe .
besides x-fab , british biotech firm ark therapeutics and belgian telecoms firm belgacom have provided details of their ipo plans as economic conditions improve and stock markets rebound .
earlier this week , financial industry analyst dealogic reported a surge in the value of ips in europe to € 599 million -lrb- $ 740 million -rrb- in the first two months of this year , a significant increase from € 19 million -lrb- $ 26 million -rrb- from a year before .
" the market is active at the moment , driven by u.s. growth , better markets and as many companies report better than expected results , " james renwick of investment bank ubs told reuters . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de high expectations for public offerings after several difficult years , european market-watchers are hopeful that 2004 will be a turning point for ipos .

" we have both elaborated a strategy to help ireland by whatever means reach a conclusion to the constitutional process , " prodi told a news conference in berlin .
negotiations on a draft constitution presented at the last eu summit in december stalled when poland and spain refused to compromise on the issue of voting weights in the council of ministers .
they want to stick to voting arrangements agreed at nice in 2000 , which give poland and spain almost as many votes as the four largest eu nations .
schröder said he was optimistic that the impasse could be overcome because of the irish presidency 's " first-class work . "
however irish prime minister bertie ahern was more reserved in his comments a day earlier , when he said that work on the constitution was unlikely to resume after the march 25-26 eu summit in brussels .

" we have both elaborated a strategy to help ireland by whatever means reach a conclusion to the constitutional process , " prodi told a news conference in berlin .
negotiations on a draft constitution presented at the last eu summit in december stalled when poland and spain refused to compromise on the issue of voting weights in the council of ministers .
they want to stick to voting arrangements agreed at nice in 2000 , which give poland and spain almost as many votes as the four largest eu nations .
schröder said he was optimistic that the impasse could be overcome because of the irish presidency 's " first-class work . "
however irish prime minister bertie ahern was more reserved in his comments a day earlier , when he said that work on the constitution was unlikely to resume after the march 25-26 eu summit in brussels .
" we ca n't make that call until we have realistic proposals that we think would get broad agreement , " he said . more briefs 04.03.2004 -pipe- german sportswear manufacturers under fire 04.03.2004 -pipe- cannabis still germans ' drug of choice 04.03.2004 -pipe- health insurers say no to homeopathy 04.03.2004 -pipe- u.s. does n't plan major troop withdrawal in germany 04.03.2004 -pipe- tv show investigated for cruelty to animals 03.03.2004 -pipe- schröder snubs germany 's top tabloid 03.03.2004 -pipe- international art fair opens in karlsruhe 02.03.2004 -pipe- opposition fails to agree on presidential candidate radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" internationally , people are looking at the decisions in the german courts - and we could make ourselves laughable . " exploiting every loophole to free suspects hirschmann and other legal experts say the cases against mzoudi and motassadeq demonstrate the difficulty western courts are having in prosecuting suspected islamic terrorists .
for more than a year , federal prosecutors in the united states have been presenting what many say is a porous case against zacarias moussaoui , a french national and the alleged 20th hijacker that never joined the suicide missions on washington d.c. and new york city . moussaoui has frustrated prosecutors by demanding access to suspected al qaeda power brokers , like alleged sept .

a german court 's decision to grant the only person convicted in connection to the sept .
11 terrorist attacks a retrial illustrates the difficulty western courts are having in putting suspected terrorists behind bars . more than year after a german court put the first - and only - suspect connected with the sept .
11 terror cell in hamburg behind bars , a higher court on thursday struck down the decision . in its decision , the five-judge panel of the federal court of justice said that hamburg judges did not have enough evidence to convict mounir el motassadeq on charges of accessory to commit murder in 3,066 cases and membership in a terrorist organization in february 2003 . lawyers for the 30-year-old moroccan national , currently serving a 15-year prison term , said they would apply for the immediate release of their defendant pending the retrial in hamburg . observers say motassadeq 's retrial and possible release is a blow to germany 's reputation as an effective terrorism-fighting country .
interior minister otto schily , who has referred to motassadeq 's conviction as evidence of germany 's commitment in rooting out terrorists , called the decision " regrettable . "
the news follows a decision by bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi a different hamburg a few weeks ago to acquit another suspected accomplice to the hamburg terror cell , abdelghani mzoudi -lrb- photo -rrb- . " a picture emerges that shows that something is n't quite right in the way we 're fighting or prosecuting terrorism , " said kai hirschmann , co-director of the institute for terrorism research and policy in a dw-world interview .
" internationally , people are looking at the decisions in the german courts - and we could make ourselves laughable . " exploiting every loophole to free suspects hirschmann and other legal experts say the cases against mzoudi and motassadeq demonstrate the difficulty western courts are having in prosecuting suspected islamic terrorists .
for more than a year , federal prosecutors in the united states have been presenting what many say is a porous case against zacarias moussaoui , a french national and the alleged 20th hijacker that never joined the suicide missions on washington d.c. and new york city . moussaoui has frustrated prosecutors by demanding access to suspected al qaeda power brokers , like alleged sept .
11 planners ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed , currently in us military custody .
an appeals court is currently deciding whether moussaoui should have that access . " if you look at the moussaoui defense , then you see that they 've built it up along similar lines , " said hirschmann .
" they use every loophole the democratic state allows them . " motassadeq 's lawyers asked for similar access to either binalshibh or transcripts of his testimony , which is allegedly in the hands of germany 's federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
when a bnd officer testified in court that releasing the information would damage germany 's reputation in the intelligence community , the judges accepted the explanation .
the appeals judges on thursday did not . " the high regional court in hamburg should … have acknowledged these events in weighing the evidence , " the five-judge panel wrote in its decision . treating a terrorist like a murderer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people run from the collapse of world trade center tower tuesday , sept .
11 , 2001 in new york .
in a horrific sequence of destruction , terrorists crashed two planes into the world trade center and the twin 110-story towers collapsed .
explosions also rocked the pentagon and the state department and spread fear across the nation .
-lrb- ap photo / suzanne plunkett -rrb- for many , the decision proves that the shadow of the terrorist attacks no longer hovers over the judicial process .
with the horror and trauma of the terrorist attacks no longer fresh in everyone 's minds , legal reason is beginning to set in . " the courts are starting to realize they ca n't on principal treat terrorism any differently , " said michael byers , a duke university specialist in international law , in a dw-world interview .
" releasing a murderer onto the streets … is as dangerous as releasing a terrorist onto the streets , yet we know we do it .
that 's the price society has chosen to pay in order to keep innocent people out of jail . " andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .

11 terror cell in hamburg behind bars , a higher court on thursday struck down the decision . in its decision , the five-judge panel of the federal court of justice said that hamburg judges did not have enough evidence to convict mounir el motassadeq on charges of accessory to commit murder in 3,066 cases and membership in a terrorist organization in february 2003 . lawyers for the 30-year-old moroccan national , currently serving a 15-year prison term , said they would apply for the immediate release of their defendant pending the retrial in hamburg . observers say motassadeq 's retrial and possible release is a blow to germany 's reputation as an effective terrorism-fighting country .
interior minister otto schily , who has referred to motassadeq 's conviction as evidence of germany 's commitment in rooting out terrorists , called the decision " regrettable . "

" internationally , people are looking at the decisions in the german courts - and we could make ourselves laughable . " exploiting every loophole to free suspects hirschmann and other legal experts say the cases against mzoudi and motassadeq demonstrate the difficulty western courts are having in prosecuting suspected islamic terrorists .
for more than a year , federal prosecutors in the united states have been presenting what many say is a porous case against zacarias moussaoui , a french national and the alleged 20th hijacker that never joined the suicide missions on washington d.c. and new york city . moussaoui has frustrated prosecutors by demanding access to suspected al qaeda power brokers , like alleged sept .

but in the end , his wish to set the record straight forced him to change his mind , he told reporters as he presented the first of a two-volume autobiography entitled " memories : 1930 - 1982 . "
kohl said he did n't agree with the way he and his government were described in the memoirs of some of his peers .
" i lived during the same time , i was there and it was completely different , " said kohl .
readers hoping to finally discover the truth about who was involved in the 1999 slush funds scandal that has tainted kohl 's reputation will be disappointed : kohl said he will still not disclose the names of those who donated some € 1 million -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- in illegal campaign contributions .
" i will write about the overall spending question , " said kohl .
" about people , i have given a definitive answer . "
kohl dedicated his memoirs to his late wife , hannelore , who committed suicide in 2001 after suffering for years from an incurable allergy to sunlight . more briefs 05.03.2004 -pipe- germany refuses to foot bill for brothel visits 05.03.2004 -pipe- schröder , prodi voice optimism on eu constitution 04.03.2004 -pipe- german sportswear manufacturers under fire 04.03.2004 -pipe- cannabis still germans ' drug of choice 04.03.2004 -pipe- health insurers say no to homeopathy 04.03.2004 -pipe- u.s. does n't plan major troop withdrawal in germany 04.03.2004 -pipe- tv show investigated for cruelty to animals 03.03.2004 -pipe- schröder snubs germany 's top tabloid 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

urbanization and the spread of large-scale , intensive farming has depleted their natural habitat to the point where rabbits are on germany 's list of endangered species .
to get a better picture of the situation , 800 wildlife-watching volunteers will help officials complete a giant national rabbit count in march .
the volunteers will count the rabbits they see one hour after nightfall , when they typically come out to feed .
" watchers will each cover a planned route with powerful spotlights to seek out the rabbits .
the light reflects off their eyes , making them easily identifiable , " said armin winter of the german hunting protection league .
he expects the € 100,000 -lrb- $ 122,000 -rrb- project to show a slight rise in the rabbit population because a mild climate last year helped more baby rabbits to survive . more briefs 05.03.2004 -pipe- kohl thinks memoirs will set record straight 05.03.2004 -pipe- germany refuses to foot bill for brothel visits 05.03.2004 -pipe- schröder , prodi voice optimism on eu constitution 04.03.2004 -pipe- german sportswear manufacturers under fire 04.03.2004 -pipe- cannabis still germans ' drug of choice 04.03.2004 -pipe- health insurers say no to homeopathy 04.03.2004 -pipe- u.s. does n't plan major troop withdrawal in germany 04.03.2004 -pipe- tv show investigated for cruelty to animals 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but in the end , his wish to set the record straight forced him to change his mind , he told reporters as he presented the first of a two-volume autobiography entitled " memories : 1930 - 1982 . "

" about people , i have given a definitive answer . "

urbanization and the spread of large-scale , intensive farming has depleted their natural habitat to the point where rabbits are on germany 's list of endangered species .
to get a better picture of the situation , 800 wildlife-watching volunteers will help officials complete a giant national rabbit count in march .
the volunteers will count the rabbits they see one hour after nightfall , when they typically come out to feed .
" watchers will each cover a planned route with powerful spotlights to seek out the rabbits .
the light reflects off their eyes , making them easily identifiable , " said armin winter of the german hunting protection league .
he expects the € 100,000 -lrb- $ 122,000 -rrb- project to show a slight rise in the rabbit population because a mild climate last year helped more baby rabbits to survive . more briefs 05.03.2004 -pipe- kohl thinks memoirs will set record straight 05.03.2004 -pipe- germany refuses to foot bill for brothel visits 05.03.2004 -pipe- schröder , prodi voice optimism on eu constitution 04.03.2004 -pipe- german sportswear manufacturers under fire 04.03.2004 -pipe- cannabis still germans ' drug of choice 04.03.2004 -pipe- health insurers say no to homeopathy 04.03.2004 -pipe- u.s. does n't plan major troop withdrawal in germany 04.03.2004 -pipe- tv show investigated for cruelty to animals 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" internationally , people are looking at the decisions in the german courts - and we could make ourselves laughable . " exploiting every loophole to free suspects hirschmann and other legal experts say the cases against mzoudi and motassadeq demonstrate the difficulty western courts are having in prosecuting suspected islamic terrorists .
for more than a year , federal prosecutors in the united states have been presenting what many say is a porous case against zacarias moussaoui , a french national and the alleged 20th hijacker that never joined the suicide missions on washington d.c. and new york city . moussaoui has frustrated prosecutors by demanding access to suspected al qaeda power brokers , like alleged sept .

a german court 's decision to grant the only person convicted in connection to the sept .
11 terrorist attacks a retrial illustrates the difficulty western courts are having in putting suspected terrorists behind bars . more than year after a german court put the first - and only - suspect connected with the sept .
11 terror cell in hamburg behind bars , a higher court on thursday struck down the decision . in its decision , the five-judge panel of the federal court of justice said that hamburg judges did not have enough evidence to convict mounir el motassadeq on charges of accessory to commit murder in 3,066 cases and membership in a terrorist organization in february 2003 . lawyers for the 30-year-old moroccan national , currently serving a 15-year prison term , said they would apply for the immediate release of their defendant pending the retrial in hamburg . observers say motassadeq 's retrial and possible release is a blow to germany 's reputation as an effective terrorism-fighting country .
interior minister otto schily , who has referred to motassadeq 's conviction as evidence of germany 's commitment in rooting out terrorists , called the decision " regrettable . "
the news follows a decision by bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi a different hamburg a few weeks ago to acquit another suspected accomplice to the hamburg terror cell , abdelghani mzoudi -lrb- photo -rrb- . " a picture emerges that shows that something is n't quite right in the way we 're fighting or prosecuting terrorism , " said kai hirschmann , co-director of the institute for terrorism research and policy in a dw-world interview .
" internationally , people are looking at the decisions in the german courts - and we could make ourselves laughable . " exploiting every loophole to free suspects hirschmann and other legal experts say the cases against mzoudi and motassadeq demonstrate the difficulty western courts are having in prosecuting suspected islamic terrorists .
for more than a year , federal prosecutors in the united states have been presenting what many say is a porous case against zacarias moussaoui , a french national and the alleged 20th hijacker that never joined the suicide missions on washington d.c. and new york city . moussaoui has frustrated prosecutors by demanding access to suspected al qaeda power brokers , like alleged sept .
11 planners ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed , currently in us military custody .
an appeals court is currently deciding whether moussaoui should have that access . " if you look at the moussaoui defense , then you see that they 've built it up along similar lines , " said hirschmann .
" they use every loophole the democratic state allows them . " motassadeq 's lawyers asked for similar access to either binalshibh or transcripts of his testimony , which is allegedly in the hands of germany 's federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
when a bnd officer testified in court that releasing the information would damage germany 's reputation in the intelligence community , the judges accepted the explanation .
the appeals judges on thursday did not . " the high regional court in hamburg should … have acknowledged these events in weighing the evidence , " the five-judge panel wrote in its decision . treating a terrorist like a murderer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people run from the collapse of world trade center tower tuesday , sept .

explosions also rocked the pentagon and the state department and spread fear across the nation .
-lrb- ap photo / suzanne plunkett -rrb- for many , the decision proves that the shadow of the terrorist attacks no longer hovers over the judicial process .
with the horror and trauma of the terrorist attacks no longer fresh in everyone 's minds , legal reason is beginning to set in . " the courts are starting to realize they ca n't on principal treat terrorism any differently , " said michael byers , a duke university specialist in international law , in a dw-world interview .
" releasing a murderer onto the streets … is as dangerous as releasing a terrorist onto the streets , yet we know we do it .

they attribute this to the rise in the cost of german health care and a general increase in expenses .
the poll , which was published in the financial times deutschland , said three fifths of those polled said they had not noticed an increase in their income compared to the same time last year , and almost half said they had been expecting their new income to be higher than it is .
the new tax rates have reduced the highest bracket by 3.5 percent to 45 percent , and cut the lowest rate from 19.9 to 16 percent . more briefs 05.03.2004 -pipe- industry calls for tax reductions 05.03.2004 -pipe- chancellor defends apprenticeship penalty plan 05.03.2004 -pipe- deutsche bahn to slash jobs 04.03.2004 -pipe- court denies settlement rumors in mannesmann trial 04.03.2004 -pipe- german unemployment rises , factory orders slump 04.03.2004 -pipe- new adidas logo kicks it like beckham 04.03.2004 -pipe- german car market showing signs of recovery 03.03.2004 -pipe- buying cars abroad can save germans money radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the squad was instrumental in destroying the drug cartels of medellin and cali .
now their target is the last of the big cartels - that of norte del valle , whose leaders are wanted for extradition to the us .
it has been many years since the cartel-busting search bloc has been active in colombia .
farc rebels have plugged the gap in the drugs trade left by the cartels it was this unit made up of elite police that gunned down the legendary head of the medellin drug cartel , pablo escobar , in 1993 as he fled across roof-tops in medellin .
their new target , norte del valle , is based in south-west colombia and is the last of the civilian drug cartels .
the search bloc 's mission is to track down and capture the leaders of the cartel and seize their properties , which will then be sold by the state to raise much-needed revenue .
but should the norte del valle cartel meet the same end as the medellin and cali drug cartels , there will be little interruption in the flow of drugs from colombia , estimated at 800 tonnes of cocaine and 10 tonnes of heroin every year .
into the place of the cartels have stepped two organisations far more powerful and dangerous than the drug gangs - colombia 's marxist guerrillas and right-wing paramilitaries , who now between them dominate the drugs trade .

the firm had previously predicted it would bring in $ 7.9-8.5bn in the first three months of 2004 .
but the over-supply in asia and japan means that it is now predicting $ 8-8.2bn , the first time in several quarters that forecasts have been lowered .
analysts said the hitch was probably a one-off , following the firm 's near-doubling of profits at the end of 2003 .
in january , the firm said it made $ 2.2bn in the final three months of last year , 50 % higher than observers had predicted .
but intel had warned at the time that it saw the possibility of a sales slide in the current three-month period .
much of the firm 's revenues now come from laptop computers , particularly those which contain its centrino wi-fi technology .
but the taiwanese manufacturers which now supply laptops to name-brands around the world say that the usual january slowdown - following the busy end-of-year holiday season - has been sharper than usual .

the firm had previously predicted it would bring in $ 7.9-8.5bn in the first three months of 2004 .
but the over-supply in asia and japan means that it is now predicting $ 8-8.2bn , the first time in several quarters that forecasts have been lowered .
analysts said the hitch was probably a one-off , following the firm 's near-doubling of profits at the end of 2003 .
in january , the firm said it made $ 2.2bn in the final three months of last year , 50 % higher than observers had predicted .
but intel had warned at the time that it saw the possibility of a sales slide in the current three-month period .
much of the firm 's revenues now come from laptop computers , particularly those which contain its centrino wi-fi technology .
but the taiwanese manufacturers which now supply laptops to name-brands around the world say that the usual january slowdown - following the busy end-of-year holiday season - has been sharper than usual .

mr kennedy set out his new economic policies a day before his welsh members gather later in mold .
the party meets over the weekend with council and european elections looming in june .
lib dems also criticised a plan for a children 's commissioner in england , claiming it would create confusion for children in wales .
mr kennedy will tour the new west factory at the airbus plant in broughton , flintshire , before speaking at his party 's conference venue , theatr clwyd , mold .
by taxing incomes over £ 100,000 at 50 % we would raise £ 4.7bn in the uk jenny randerson am while lib dems will concentrate on the june elections , attention could also focus on the economic ideas laid out by mr kennedy in london on thursday .
these include pledges to give more money to schools and hospitals without raising taxes or increasing borrowing .
the party had previously said it would put an extra penny on the basic rate of income tax to pay for better public services .
the lib dems want a 50 % tax rate for people earning over £ 100,000 to pay for scrapping tuition fees and a return to the grant system .
free personal care mr kennedy said savings would be found by selling off assets like the royal mint at llantrisant , and reducing government ministries .
the lib dem leader said his party could save £ 25bn over five years .
welsh lib dem finance spokesperson jenny randerson , the welsh assembly member for cardiff central , said : " by taxing incomes over £ 100,000 at 50 % we would raise £ 4.7bn in the uk , to be used for abolishing tuition fees , bringing back grants and providing free personal care for the elderly . "
she said that would raise an estimated £ 200m- £ 300m for these issues in wales .
meanwhile , fellow lib dem am kirsty williams attacked the uk government 's english children 's commissioner proposal .
ms williams said the welsh commissioner had done a " superb " job since the post was created three years ago , working with children , the police and probation service , " even though he has no direct responsibility over those services . "
but ms williams said the new commissioner " would be responsible for everything except where the matter has been devolved to the national assembly . "
she said : " why does a bill in london need to set out in such detail what happens in wales ?
does n't the uk government trust their own colleagues in wales to develop a tailor made solution for wales ?
" the bill may be a step forward for children in england but it is undoubtedly a step backwards for children in wales . "

every individual who takes part in the programme has his or her own personal and often painful memory , of a strike which transformed the industrial and political landscape of britain .
it is unlikely that we will ever see the likes of it again , but the passage of time has not healed the deep wounds which opened up in a dispute which degenerated into open warfare .
and it was the worst kind of war .
it was civil war which saw miner against miner , coalfield against coalfield , and the forces of right and left ranged against each other in a titanic struggle for the political heart of britain .
the industrial turmoil dragged on for 12 months ; dragged down a union , its people and their industry .
perhaps the most vivid , if not the most poignant , memory of the deep hurt caused in that exhausting year resides with janice reed .
her partner was killed in an incident which came to symbolise the desperation of men consumed by frustration and hardship .
oh i detest him -lsb- scargill -rsb- .
i did then , i do now , and it 's mutual .
he hates me as well .
and i 'd much prefer to have his savage hatred than even the merest hint of friendship from that man neil kinnock janice reed was pregnant with the second child of taxi driver david wilkie , who died in november 1984 when a concrete block was heaved onto his car by two young miners .
he was taking one of the few strike-breakers in south wales back to work at the merthyr vale colliery , when the pair dropped a concrete block off a road bridge onto his car .
janice reed 's continuing quest for information surrounding the death of her partner illustrates just how deep the wounds run .
but she is not the only one to have suffered .
families who believed they were fighting for their communities as well as their livelihoods speak of their hardships and the images they evoke are painful to behold .
maureen palmer , the wife of a striking miner from maerdy , recalls her scavenging trips for coal .
in a memory reminiscent of the 1920s , the young mother re-lives an experience when her own father was on strike .
maureen palmer remembers having to scavenge for coal while she foraged for coal , the strike was being lost by a leadership which had failed , or refused , to realise that the government was prepared for the miners .
huge stocks of coal had been built up at power stations around the county .
margaret thatcher was determined that she would not lose in the way her predecessor ted heath had lost 10 years earlier .
the lights stayed on and two of her lieutenants , energy secretary peter walker and spin doctor bernard ingham , condemn the then national union of mineworkers president arthur scargill for his ' stupidity ' in taking the government on when he did .
but their criticism is not confined to the miners ' leader .
both mrs thatcher 's men are highly critical of ian macgregor , the american brought in to run the coal board .
sir bernard ingham , as he is now , says : " the government got it wrong . "
lord walker , also ennobled , explains just how wrong ian macgregor was when he predicted that the strike would end when the miners ' social security payments ran out : " so , i said , you 're dealing with a totally different strike .
this is a strike about politics , and mr scargill wo n't go into a settlement when the social security runs out . "
num vice president terry thomas was physically attacked how right lord walker was and how wrong was his coal board chief .
painful political memories , though , are not confined to tory politicians .
neil kinnock , who was elected leader of the labour party a few months before the strike began , confesses that his biggest regret was not to call for a national ballot .
now a european commissioner , back then he says he was determined not to give arthur scargill what he calls an alibi .
the depth of his animosity towards mr scargill is staggering .
" oh , i detest him -lrb- scargill -rrb- .
i did then , i do now , and it 's mutual , " he said .
" he hates me as well .
and i 'd much prefer to have his savage hatred than even the merest hint of friendship from that man . "
it is a vivid illustration of the underlying tensions which prevailed during the miners ' strike .
what could not be revealed at the time were the covert efforts being made in south wales - where the strike was solid - to protect the coalfield from long-term damage .
in making the programme we obtained the diaries of the late phillip weekes , the former director of the national coal board in south wales .
the programme also dispels many of the myths which have grown up around the strike .
this was not a strike which south wales miners wanted .
we lost .
we lost the strike .
the trade union movement lost its battle against thatcher and we lost an industry , and we lost thousands of jobs , and we all played a parting in bringing that about , believe me , not just arthur scargill kim howells mp initially , the collieries voted overwhelmingly against the strike , but a group of the ' unofficial left ' organised the picketing of those pits which had voted to continue working .
" it was completely unconstitutional and completely undemocratic , " according to one of the organisers , kim howells .
but it worked .
something deep in the soul of south wales miners prevented them from crossing picketing lines .
without the solidarity of the south wales coalfield the strike would have collapsed .
it was , perhaps , fitting then that it was south wales who led the miners back to work without an agreement .
the men and their families were exhausted and the pain of that decision .
one of them was terry thomas , the vice president of the num in south wales , who was spat at and kicked for leading the move back to work .
the pain continues too for the leader of the north wales miners , ted mackay , who was also spat at , kicked and punched , but for different reasons .
north wales coalfield consisted of only two pits , but it was hopelessly split and mr mackay , one of three moderates on an otherwise militant union executive , argued that the men deserved a national ballot .
it was not to be and mr mackay had to take his family into hiding , but he tells the programme that their faith in what they believed to be right helped them endure .

every individual who takes part in the programme has his or her own personal and often painful memory , of a strike which transformed the industrial and political landscape of britain .
it is unlikely that we will ever see the likes of it again , but the passage of time has not healed the deep wounds which opened up in a dispute which degenerated into open warfare .
and it was the worst kind of war .
it was civil war which saw miner against miner , coalfield against coalfield , and the forces of right and left ranged against each other in a titanic struggle for the political heart of britain .
the industrial turmoil dragged on for 12 months ; dragged down a union , its people and their industry .
perhaps the most vivid , if not the most poignant , memory of the deep hurt caused in that exhausting year resides with janice reed .
her partner was killed in an incident which came to symbolise the desperation of men consumed by frustration and hardship .

he was taking one of the few strike-breakers in south wales back to work at the merthyr vale colliery , when the pair dropped a concrete block off a road bridge onto his car .
janice reed 's continuing quest for information surrounding the death of her partner illustrates just how deep the wounds run .

both mrs thatcher 's men are highly critical of ian macgregor , the american brought in to run the coal board .
sir bernard ingham , as he is now , says : " the government got it wrong . "
lord walker , also ennobled , explains just how wrong ian macgregor was when he predicted that the strike would end when the miners ' social security payments ran out : " so , i said , you 're dealing with a totally different strike .
this is a strike about politics , and mr scargill wo n't go into a settlement when the social security runs out . "

every individual who takes part in the programme has his or her own personal and often painful memory , of a strike which transformed the industrial and political landscape of britain .
it is unlikely that we will ever see the likes of it again , but the passage of time has not healed the deep wounds which opened up in a dispute which degenerated into open warfare .
and it was the worst kind of war .
it was civil war which saw miner against miner , coalfield against coalfield , and the forces of right and left ranged against each other in a titanic struggle for the political heart of britain .
the industrial turmoil dragged on for 12 months ; dragged down a union , its people and their industry .
perhaps the most vivid , if not the most poignant , memory of the deep hurt caused in that exhausting year resides with janice reed .
her partner was killed in an incident which came to symbolise the desperation of men consumed by frustration and hardship . "
oh i detest him -lsb- scargill -rsb- .
i did then , i do now , and it 's mutual .
he hates me as well .
and i 'd much prefer to have his savage hatred than even the merest hint of friendship from that man " neil kinnock janice reed was pregnant with the second child of taxi driver david wilkie , who died in november 1984 when a concrete block was heaved onto his car by two young miners .
he was taking one of the few strike-breakers in south wales back to work at the merthyr vale colliery , when the pair dropped a concrete block off a road bridge onto his car .
janice reed 's continuing quest for information surrounding the death of her partner illustrates just how deep the wounds run .
but she is not the only one to have suffered .
families who believed they were fighting for their communities as well as their livelihoods speak of their hardships and the images they evoke are painful to behold .
maureen palmer , the wife of a striking miner from maerdy , recalls her scavenging trips for coal .
in a memory reminiscent of the 1920s , the young mother re-lives an experience when her own father was on strike .
while she foraged for coal , the strike was being lost by a leadership which had failed , or refused , to realise that the government was prepared for the miners .
huge stocks of coal had been built up at power stations around the county .
margaret thatcher was determined that she would not lose in the way her predecessor ted heath had lost 10 years earlier .
the lights stayed on and two of her lieutenants , energy secretary peter walker and spin doctor bernard ingham , condemn the then national union of mineworkers president arthur scargill for his ' stupidity ' in taking the government on when he did .
but their criticism is not confined to the miners ' leader .
both mrs thatcher 's men are highly critical of ian macgregor , the american brought in to run the coal board .
sir bernard ingham , as he is now , says : " the government got it wrong . "
lord walker , also ennobled , explains just how wrong ian macgregor was when he predicted that the strike would end when the miners ' social security payments ran out : " so , i said , you 're dealing with a totally different strike .
this is a strike about politics , and mr scargill wo n't go into a settlement when the social security runs out . "
how right lord walker was and how wrong was his coal board chief .
painful political memories , though , are not confined to tory politicians .
neil kinnock , who was elected leader of the labour party a few months before the strike began , confesses that his biggest regret was not to call for a national ballot .
now a european commissioner , back then he says he was determined not to give arthur scargill what he calls an alibi .
the depth of his animosity towards mr scargill is staggering .
" oh , i detest him -lrb- scargill -rrb- .
i did then , i do now , and it 's mutual , " he said .
" he hates me as well .
and i 'd much prefer to have his savage hatred than even the merest hint of friendship from that man . "
it is a vivid illustration of the underlying tensions which prevailed during the miners ' strike .
what could not be revealed at the time were the covert efforts being made in south wales - where the strike was solid - to protect the coalfield from long-term damage .
in making the programme we obtained the diaries of the late phillip weekes , the former director of the national coal board in south wales .
the programme also dispels many of the myths which have grown up around the strike .
this was not a strike which south wales miners wanted . "
we lost .
we lost the strike .
the trade union movement lost its battle against thatcher and we lost an industry , and we lost thousands of jobs , and we all played a parting in bringing that about , believe me , not just arthur scargill " kim howells mp initially , the collieries voted overwhelmingly against the strike , but a group of the ' unofficial left ' organised the picketing of those pits which had voted to continue working .
" it was completely unconstitutional and completely undemocratic , " according to one of the organisers , kim howells .
but it worked .
something deep in the soul of south wales miners prevented them from crossing picketing lines .
without the solidarity of the south wales coalfield the strike would have collapsed .
it was , perhaps , fitting then that it was south wales who led the miners back to work without an agreement .
the men and their families were exhausted and the pain of that decision .
one of them was terry thomas , the vice president of the num in south wales , who was spat at and kicked for leading the move back to work .
the pain continues too for the leader of the north wales miners , ted mackay , who was also spat at , kicked and punched , but for different reasons .
north wales coalfield consisted of only two pits , but it was hopelessly split and mr mackay , one of three moderates on an otherwise militant union executive , argued that the men deserved a national ballot .
it was not to be and mr mackay had to take his family into hiding , but he tells the programme that their faith in what they believed to be right helped them endure .

she blamed the affair for worsening her growing depression which led to her attempting to kill herself .
andrew morton used the tapes , the first of a series being aired on nbc , for his book diana : her true story .
diana revealed on the recordings how her life had been filled with heartbreak and unhappiness from her childhood .
i hated myself so much , i did n't think i was good enough for charles diana princess of wales she said : " it was a very unhappy childhood , parents were busy sorting themselves out .
" i remember seeing my father slap my mother across the face and i was crying on the floor ...
mummy was crying an awful lot . "
but , after accepting an offer of marriage from prince charles , diana 's life got worse instead of improving .
she said she knew of his affair with camilla parker bowles through overhearing telephone conversations between the pair .
and she blamed the relationship for worsening the bulimia that developed shortly after the royal couple began making their wedding plans .
she said : " bulimia started the week after we got engaged .
" charles said you 're getting a bit chubby , and that triggered something off . "
wedding day ' hysterical ' " the first time i made myself sick i was so thrilled .
it relieved me of tension . "
she added : " i ate everything i could find and i was as sick as a parrot ... it was an indication of what was going on -lrb- between charles and camilla -rrb- . "
i was very , very deathly calm .
i felt as though i was a lamb going to the slaughter diana , on her marriage diana : key quotes q & a : diana tapes captivating america her marriage to charles in 1981 was a wedding that gripped the nation .
about one million people are reported to have flocked to london to see the ceremony .

" i was very , very deathly calm .
i felt as though i was a lamb going to the slaughter . "
and speaking of when the couple entered st paul 's cathedral , she said : " as i walked up the aisle i was looking for her .
i spotted camilla . "
her bulimia worsened during the couple 's honeymoon , and she was shocked to find prince charles had brought eight novels to read during their trip together .
continuing media attention and the demands of royal life took their toll .
" i had a very bad time with the press - they literally haunted and hunted me , " the princess said .
" i hated myself so much , i did n't think i was good enough for charles .
suicide attempts " my husband made me feel so inadequate in every possible way . "
the paris crash site became a shrine to diana " the public ... they wanted a fairy princess to come and touch them , and everything will turn into gold and all their worries would be forgotten .
" little did they realise that the individual was crucifying herself inside because she did n't think she was good enough . "
" i was trying to cut my wrists with razor blades ... we were trying to hide that from everybody ...
i was just so desperate . "
of the time she was pregnant with william in 1982 , she said she felt so inadequate " ...
i threw myself down the stairs , bearing in mind i was carrying a child .
drama " the queen came out and saw me and was horrified . "
former royal press secretary dickie arbiter said that although the content of the tapes was already known , it was " scary " to hear her voice and " the drama of it all " was more evident .
" it became very apparent that she was unhappy , she was bitter and she was ill .
they were her own words , " he told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
the seven hours of audio tapes are understood to have been secretly recorded at kensington palace , in response to written questions submitted by andrew morton .

the report came as humberside 's chief constable , david westwood , began giving evidence to the bichard inquiry .
the inquiry is investigating how huntley , who murdered 10-year-olds holly wells and jessica chapman , got a job as a school caretaker .
after his conviction it emerged he had faced a string of assault allegations .
the inquiry is specifically examining how allegations were not shared between humberside and cambridgeshire forces .
' different outcome ' in its submission to the inquiry hmic said it was " difficult to believe that a string of eight further allegations of sexual offending would not have at the very least led to collation of a significant and damning intelligence record .
" it is also difficult to believe that huntley would have been confirmed in the post at soham . it surely could have led to a very different outcome in this case . "
inspectors found severe shortcomings in both the strategic and practical approaches to intelligence handling more generally within humberside .
there was clear need for a fundamental overhaul of the whole intelligence handling functions within the force .
if humberside police had dealt " appropriately " with huntley his record would have remained on file , it said .
in a written submission to the inquiry , the force 's chief constable , david westwood , admitted vetting checks by humberside between 1995 and 2003 " can not be fully relied on " .
it is also difficult to believe that huntley would have been confirmed in the post at soham . it surely could have led to a very different outcome in this case hm inspectorate of constabulary but he remained uncertain that his force had ever received a vetting request for an intelligence check on huntley or the surname he was using as an alias , nixon , from cambridgeshire police .
" the totality of the evidence tends to point to the conclusion that no request for a local intelligence check in respect of either huntley or nixon was actually made of humberside police , before , at the time of , or after his appointment as a school caretaker in soham , " the chief constable said .
he added that he had personally pledged to the parents of holly and jessica to learn lessons .
" huntley did not try very hard to beat the system , " he added .
" he got through because basic checks and actions were missed and not due to major national issues . "
the probe , sitting in central london , earlier heard how vetting errors and who was responsible for them would be the focus of the inquiry .
in his opening statement , counsel to the inquiry james eadie said soham college had asked for police checks to be undertaken before employing huntley .
counsel for inquiry , james eadie : hindsight is a wonderful thing those checks had revealed no information about the allegations made in and around huntley 's home town of grimsby to humberside police .
mr eadie told the inquiry that when the checks were carried out , in december 2001 , two matters had been recorded against huntley on the child protection register .
one was the allegation of indecent assault on an 11-year-old girl and there was another allegation of unlawful sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old girl .
but the child protection database would not have been searched at the time of the police checks , mr eadie added .
earlier , mr eadie said humberside 's child protection database was described by the force itself as " ineffective as a source of information " and " almost worthless " .
he also said humberside police had failed to update police national computer records to include huntley 's alias , and so the response to the check in december 2001 would have been " no trace " .
' appropriate balance ' mr eadie told the inquiry the second main focus of the probe would be on how the systems of checking and vetting could be improved for the future .
huntley was only charged in relation to one of four allegations of rape but the matter never reached court on the advice of the crown prosecution service .
mr eadie said humberside police had acted differently from many forces in entering details on the pnc at the point of charge rather than arrest .
he said : " there was a relatively high barrier to information finding its way onto the pnc . "
records , including huntley 's , were automatically deleted after three years but still retained on magnetic tapes and cds .

if humberside police had dealt " appropriately " with huntley his record would have remained on file , it said .
in a written submission to the inquiry , the force 's chief constable , david westwood , admitted vetting checks by humberside between 1995 and 2003 " can not be fully relied on " .
it is also difficult to believe that huntley would have been confirmed in the post at soham . it surely could have led to a very different outcome in this case hm inspectorate of constabulary but he remained uncertain that his force had ever received a vetting request for an intelligence check on huntley or the surname he was using as an alias , nixon , from cambridgeshire police .
" the totality of the evidence tends to point to the conclusion that no request for a local intelligence check in respect of either huntley or nixon was actually made of humberside police , before , at the time of , or after his appointment as a school caretaker in soham , " the chief constable said .
he added that he had personally pledged to the parents of holly and jessica to learn lessons .
" huntley did not try very hard to beat the system , " he added .
" he got through because basic checks and actions were missed and not due to major national issues . "
the probe , sitting in central london , earlier heard how vetting errors and who was responsible for them would be the focus of the inquiry .
in his opening statement , counsel to the inquiry james eadie said soham college had asked for police checks to be undertaken before employing huntley .
counsel for inquiry , james eadie : hindsight is a wonderful thing those checks had revealed no information about the allegations made in and around huntley 's home town of grimsby to humberside police .
mr eadie told the inquiry that when the checks were carried out , in december 2001 , two matters had been recorded against huntley on the child protection register .
one was the allegation of indecent assault on an 11-year-old girl and there was another allegation of unlawful sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old girl .
but the child protection database would not have been searched at the time of the police checks , mr eadie added .
earlier , mr eadie said humberside 's child protection database was described by the force itself as " ineffective as a source of information " and " almost worthless " .
he also said humberside police had failed to update police national computer records to include huntley 's alias , and so the response to the check in december 2001 would have been " no trace " .
' appropriate balance ' mr eadie told the inquiry the second main focus of the probe would be on how the systems of checking and vetting could be improved for the future .
huntley was only charged in relation to one of four allegations of rape but the matter never reached court on the advice of the crown prosecution service .
mr eadie said humberside police had acted differently from many forces in entering details on the pnc at the point of charge rather than arrest .
he said : " there was a relatively high barrier to information finding its way onto the pnc . "
records , including huntley 's , were automatically deleted after three years but still retained on magnetic tapes and cds .

mr wang , one of the founders of the outlawed china democracy party , was sentenced to 11 years in jail in 1998 .
he is staying with fellow dissident xu wenli who was released from a chinese prison in december 2002 .
he was freed on thursday in a move hailed by the united states , but seen by some as an attempt by china to ameliorate its human rights record .
the development comes ahead of an annual un human rights meeting in geneva at which the us was considering criticising china 's rights record .
" i 'm not sure what exactly is going on , " mr wang said on his arrival at tf green airport in warwick , rhode island , on thursday night .
" i need time to clear my head . "
china democracy party set up by dissidents in 1998 first attempt to legally register an opposition party quickly crushed by communist party at least 30 members sentenced to jail terms of up to 13 years co-founders xu wenli released 2002 , qin yongmin still imprisoned us state department spokesman richard boucher said on thursday that the dissident had been " imprisoned for attempting to exercise basic freedoms of speech and assembly and china " .
" we once again call on chinese government to release all prisoners detained for peaceful expression of their views , " mr boucher added .
mr wang was welcomed on his arrival on rhode island by xu wenli , who like mr wang was imprisoned for his part in the 1989 tiananmen square protests , and his part in co-founding the china democracy party .
mr xu said mr wang 's release was merely a gesture by the chinese government .
" it does n't mean chinese human rights have improved , he said .
" we were arrested and also used as a bargaining chip . "
medical worries mr wang , 37 , first came to prominence as one of the student leaders involved in the 1989 tiananmen square demonstrations , which were brutally suppressed by the chinese authorities at the cost of several hundred lives .
mr wang , a physics graduate from peking university , was described by the authorities as one of the " most wanted " students , and was jailed for taking part in the protests .
in 1998 he was sentenced again , for his part in founding the china democracy party , the first attempt to set up a legal opposition to china 's ruling communist party .
communist officials outlawed the party soon after its inception , jailing more than 30 people for taking part .
mr wang was tried on the charge of " subverting state power " , and was accused of organising meetings , using computer e-mail to send information and accepting donations from overseas .
timely decision his release , more than five years ahead of schedule , came on the eve of the chinese parliament 's national people 's congress , which is expected to enshrine a commitment to human rights in china 's constitution .
the us-based rights group the dui hua foundation said mr wang had suffered from bronchial disorders and was recently diagnosed with myocarditis , an inflammation or degeneration of the heart 's muscle tissue .
but it is difficult to determine how far his medical conditions played a part in his release .
a bbc correspondent in beijing , louisa lim , says that medical parole for treatment overseas is often used as a way to send unwanted individuals into exile .
the release came one day after chinese authorities cut the sentence of another prominent prisoner - the uighur businesswoman rabiya kadeer .
she was sentenced to eight years in jail in 2000 on charges of separatism , but is now due to be released in august 2006 , or even sooner , according to the dui hua foundation .

china democracy party set up by dissidents in 1998 first attempt to legally register an opposition party quickly crushed by communist party at least 30 members sentenced to jail terms of up to 13 years co-founders xu wenli released 2002 , qin yongmin still imprisoned us state department spokesman richard boucher said on thursday that the dissident had been " imprisoned for attempting to exercise basic freedoms of speech and assembly and china " .
" we once again call on chinese government to release all prisoners detained for peaceful expression of their views , " mr boucher added .
mr wang was welcomed on his arrival on rhode island by xu wenli , who like mr wang was imprisoned for his part in the 1989 tiananmen square protests , and his part in co-founding the china democracy party .
mr xu said mr wang 's release was merely a gesture by the chinese government .
" it does n't mean chinese human rights have improved , he said .
" we were arrested and also used as a bargaining chip . "
medical worries mr wang , 37 , first came to prominence as one of the student leaders involved in the 1989 tiananmen square demonstrations , which were brutally suppressed by the chinese authorities at the cost of several hundred lives .
mr wang , a physics graduate from peking university , was described by the authorities as one of the " most wanted " students , and was jailed for taking part in the protests .
in 1998 he was sentenced again , for his part in founding the china democracy party , the first attempt to set up a legal opposition to china 's ruling communist party .
communist officials outlawed the party soon after its inception , jailing more than 30 people for taking part .
mr wang was tried on the charge of " subverting state power " , and was accused of organising meetings , using computer e-mail to send information and accepting donations from overseas .
timely decision his release , more than five years ahead of schedule , came on the eve of the chinese parliament 's national people 's congress , which is expected to enshrine a commitment to human rights in china 's constitution .
the us-based rights group the dui hua foundation said mr wang had suffered from bronchial disorders and was recently diagnosed with myocarditis , an inflammation or degeneration of the heart 's muscle tissue .
but it is difficult to determine how far his medical conditions played a part in his release .
a bbc correspondent in beijing , louisa lim , says that medical parole for treatment overseas is often used as a way to send unwanted individuals into exile .
the release came one day after chinese authorities cut the sentence of another prominent prisoner - the uighur businesswoman rabiya kadeer .
she was sentenced to eight years in jail in 2000 on charges of separatism , but is now due to be released in august 2006 , or even sooner , according to the dui hua foundation .

a total of 143 million shares in oil and natural gas commission -lrb- ongc -rrb- were bought within an hour of the offer opening , officials said .
the ongc selloff could raise over $ 2bn , through what is the largest public offering of shares ever in india .
india 's ruling coalition government aims to raise more than $ 3bn by selling shares in largely state-owned firms .
disinvestment process the share offer , which would reduce the government 's holdings in the $ 20bn energy company to 74 % from 84 % , went on sale at a sharp 9.5 % discount to the share price in the market on wednesday .
" the issue has already been over-subscribed , " one of the offering 's managers told agence france-presse , saying bids had been made for 107 % of the shares on offer .
the bombay stock exchange -lrb- bse -rrb- website said that the bids , for 153 million shares , had been received within 11 minutes of the opening of the offer .
ongc shares were up nearly 3 % and bombay 's sensex rose 0.9 % on the back of the offering .
the success of the share offering in india 's national energy company is critical to the bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- -led government 's disinvestment plans before the financial year closes in march .
earlier public share offerings in the country 's largest dredger of ports , dredging corporation , and its largest gas transmission company , the gas authority of india limited -lrb- gail -rrb- , were also oversubscribed .
the federal government is keen to capitalise on what it calls the " feel-good factor " , arising from a robust growth rate of more than 8 % and a strong performance over the past six months .
the disinvestment minister arun shourie kick-started the privatisation of government-owned companies by divesting 25 % of the government stakes in car maker maruti udyog in june last year .

" the issue has already been over-subscribed , " one of the offering 's managers told agence france-presse , saying bids had been made for 107 % of the shares on offer .
the bombay stock exchange -lrb- bse -rrb- website said that the bids , for 153 million shares , had been received within 11 minutes of the opening of the offer .
ongc shares were up nearly 3 % and bombay 's sensex rose 0.9 % on the back of the offering .
the success of the share offering in india 's national energy company is critical to the bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- -led government 's disinvestment plans before the financial year closes in march .
earlier public share offerings in the country 's largest dredger of ports , dredging corporation , and its largest gas transmission company , the gas authority of india limited -lrb- gail -rrb- , were also oversubscribed .
the federal government is keen to capitalise on what it calls the " feel-good factor " , arising from a robust growth rate of more than 8 % and a strong performance over the past six months .
the disinvestment minister arun shourie kick-started the privatisation of government-owned companies by divesting 25 % of the government stakes in car maker maruti udyog in june last year .

nbc said jackson would present and perform on the 10 april edition of the show , broadcast live from new york .
she caused national outrage by exposing her breast during a televised duet at the super bowl on 1 february .
a saturday night live spokesman said he did not know of plans for a tape delay to prevent any possible vulgarity .
the show - a us comedy institution - has already lampooned the incident .
will and grace star megan mullally ripped the breast pocket from american idol runner-up clay aiken .
barred saturday night live has itself been accused of profanity , including a notorious incident in 1981 in which the f-word was used .
jackson , 37 , was barred from appearing at the televised grammy awards after she declined demands to issue an on-air apology for the super bowl incident .
she later bowed out of plans to star in a tv movie about veteran singer lena horne after horne said she was offended by jackson 's act .
the incident led to calls by us politicians for tough measures to " clean up " the nation 's tv coverage .
us broadcasters could face fines of $ 500,000 -lrb- £ 273,000 -rrb- for indecency after politicians overwhelmingly recommended a steep increase in penalties .
