do n't worry , the court 's on your side .
those suffering from gastrointestinal ailments can breathe a little easier today ; germany 's federal social court has ruled that having diarrhea is a valid excuse for showing up late for the judge . the bathroom or the bench ?
that was the dilemma faced by a german man who had an appointment with the social court in the state of baden-württemberg about his disability pension late last month . he was supposed to face the judge at 10:20 a.m. , but an overstimulated digestive tract had the man spending much more time than usual on the toilet .
he called the court early that morning explaining his predicament of being bound to the porcelain bowl , but got little sympathy .
he was told his appointment could not be postponed .
the queasy man finally made it to the courtroom at 10:35 , only to find his case had been decided in his absence .
the court had begun proceedings at 10:23 and seven minutes later the gavel fell - despite the diarrhea , no mercy was shown .
however , the federal social court , based in the city of kassel , saw this case of bowel-related lateness in another light .
it ruled on friday that the lower social court has to extend the current 15-minute tardiness time limit to 30 minutes , if the person in question is having " special difficulties " making the appointment - the runs falls into that category .
otherwise , the court said , an individual 's due process could be undermined .
the higher court ruled that the court baden-württemburg must hear the disabled pensioner 's case again . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

" where chechnya and human rights abuses have occasionally soured the atmosphere , this summit has so far been dominated by moscow 's desire to join the 147-member wto , which russia has been negotiating for six years . the eu , russia 's biggest trading partner , had insisted that moscow raise domestic energy prices to world levels , which it says currently amount to unfair subsidies for russian industries .
brussels also says russia should open its banking , financial and telecommunications sectors to foreign competition . " the eu-russia agreement is a joint step forward to open markets and trade liberalization in europe , " said irish prime minister bertie ahern , the current president of the european council . wto members all have the right to demand applicants sign individual agreements with them .

" the eu has met us halfway in talks over the wto and that can not but affect positively our position on the kyoto protocol , " putin told reporters .
" we will speed up russia 's movement toward the kyoto protocol 's ratification . " the document , which aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions widely thought to cause global warming , must be ratified by at least 55 countries that made up no less than 55 percent of global emissions in 1990 .
since the united states , the world 's largest producer of emissions , has rejected the treaty , only russian ratification would allow it to come into force . but climate experts advised moscow last week against ratifying the treaty , which they said was scientifically unsound and would harm russian growth .
both the russian academy of sciences and the kremlin remain undecided on the issue , german broadcaster wdr reported . issues remaining after the may 1 eu enlargement will also be on the agenda , including language rights for the russian minority in latvia and a fast train corridor from kaliningrad , the russian enclave in the baltics , to russia proper . brussels and moscow had ironed out the main sticking points only five days before the eu admitted to its ranks eight central and eastern european countries once part of the soviet union 's sphere of influence .

even as the last spanish troops are pulled out of iraq this week , italian premier silvio berlusconi has announced his government will keep troops in the country until democracy and stability are ensured . in the same week berlusconi held talks with u.s. president george bush in washington , the italian parliament on thursday voted to keep troops in iraq till order was restored in the country , turning down opposition demands that the 3,000 soldiers deployed there be recalled . berlusconi , who has been under mounting pressure to pull out italian troops from iraq following a similar move by spain , the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal and the first combat loss of an italian solider in iraq earlier this week , remained defiant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi " italy will remain in iraq until it can govern itself in security and freedom and until the bandits and terrorists , who have been sowing death and fear for more than a year and preventing democratic elections in iraq , are wiped out , " he said to applause from his center-right coalition . pulling out sooner would be an " outrage to the honor of the fallen and to the magnificent work of our military and civilian workers , " the premier said .
" withdrawal now means abandoning to chaos a crucial country in the middle east . " spanish pull-out almost complete berlusconi 's announcement coincided with the withdrawal of the last spanish troops from their base in diwaniya , iraq according to the spanish defense ministry .
spanish news agency efe said the spanish general in charge of the unit transferred control of so-called base espana in south-central iraq to u.s. forces thursday night . spain 's new socialist government led by josé luis rodríguez zapatero , which came to power in march elections for pledging to pull out the 1,300 spanish soldiers deployed in iraq , followed up on the election promise and began withdrawing troops in may . stronger role for u.n. berlusconi , one of the strongest allies of the u.s. in the war against iraq , also underlined that there was a clear timetable for the handover of power to the iraqis that envisioned a larger role for the u.n. in the coming weeks . the italian premier added that a candidate had already been identified to head a " new , credible authoritative " iraqi interim government , but he had to yet accept the post .
u.s. president bush announced on wednesday that the representatives of the iraqi interim government would be selected in the next two weeks . berlusconi announced that a new u.n. resolution on iraq would be tabled in the first weeks of june .
" the new resolution will bestow international legitimacy on the new government , which will change the legal basis of the presence of foreign troops and mark the end of the occupation , " he said . the italian premier added he hoped that islamic countries would also participate in the coalition of foreign troops in iraq . peace mission a sham however berlusconi 's decision to keep troops in iraq is not likely to go down well in italy , where popular opinion has swung sharply against the war in recent months . a survey published thursday in la repubblica , a left-leaning daily , showed that 59 percent of italians want the troop withdrawn even if the united nations asks italy to remain in iraq after transfer of power on june 30 . opposition italian politicians in the lower chamber , who had tabled a motion calling for the immediate withdrawal of troops , however said that berlusconi 's portrayal of the iraq deployment as a peace mission was a sham . " the italian parliament had approved a peace mission in iraq - instead of that we 're now caught up in a war there that has led to the fact that we are being perceived as occupiers and enemies by the iraqis , " said piero fassino , leader of the main opposition party , the democrats of the left . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hostage killing fuels security fears in iraq the killing of an italian hostage by iraqi militants thursday and two german security workers last week has heightened security fears for europeans and other foreigners working in iraq .

" where chechnya and human rights abuses have occasionally soured the atmosphere , this summit has so far been dominated by moscow 's desire to join the 147-member wto , which russia has been negotiating for six years . the eu , russia 's biggest trading partner , had insisted that moscow raise domestic energy prices to world levels , which it says currently amount to unfair subsidies for russian industries .
brussels also says russia should open its banking , financial and telecommunications sectors to foreign competition . " the eu-russia agreement is a joint step forward to open markets and trade liberalization in europe , " said irish prime minister bertie ahern , the current president of the european council . wto members all have the right to demand applicants sign individual agreements with them .
a deal with the eu would put moscow a big step closer to membership in the organization , though it must still complete agreements with china , japan and the united states . deal on emissions ? putin confirmed observers predictions that the talks could convince russia to carefully consider ratifying the kyoto protocol on lowering global emissions in exchange for concessions from the eu on wto entry . " the eu has met us halfway in talks over the wto and that can not but affect positively our position on the kyoto protocol , " putin told reporters .
" we will speed up russia 's movement toward the kyoto protocol 's ratification . " the document , which aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions widely thought to cause global warming , must be ratified by at least 55 countries that made up no less than 55 percent of global emissions in 1990 .
since the united states , the world 's largest producer of emissions , has rejected the treaty , only russian ratification would allow it to come into force . but climate experts advised moscow last week against ratifying the treaty , which they said was scientifically unsound and would harm russian growth .
both the russian academy of sciences and the kremlin remain undecided on the issue , german broadcaster wdr reported . issues remaining after the may 1 eu enlargement will also be on the agenda , including language rights for the russian minority in latvia and a fast train corridor from kaliningrad , the russian enclave in the baltics , to russia proper . brussels and moscow had ironed out the main sticking points only five days before the eu admitted to its ranks eight central and eastern european countries once part of the soviet union 's sphere of influence . " enlargement will ring the eu and russia closer together , as it brings us new opportunities for cooperation , " ahern told putin friday . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum the death of chechnya 's president akhmed kadyrov in a bomb attack in grozny on sunday is being viewed as a huge blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability to the war-torn region .

do n't worry , the court 's on your side .
those suffering from gastrointestinal ailments can breathe a little easier today ; germany 's federal social court has ruled that having diarrhea is a valid excuse for showing up late for the judge . the bathroom or the bench ?
that was the dilemma faced by a german man who had an appointment with the social court in the state of baden-württemberg about his disability pension late last month . he was supposed to face the judge at 10:20 a.m. , but an overstimulated digestive tract had the man spending much more time than usual on the toilet .
he called the court early that morning explaining his predicament of being bound to the porcelain bowl , but got little sympathy .
he was told his appointment could not be postponed .
the queasy man finally made it to the courtroom at 10:35 , only to find his case had been decided in his absence .
the court had begun proceedings at 10:23 and seven minutes later the gavel fell - despite the diarrhea , no mercy was shown .
however , the federal social court , based in the city of kassel , saw this case of bowel-related lateness in another light .
it ruled on friday that the lower social court has to extend the current 15-minute tardiness time limit to 30 minutes , if the person in question is having " special difficulties " making the appointment - the runs falls into that category .
otherwise , the court said , an individual 's due process could be undermined .
the higher court ruled that the court baden-württemburg must hear the disabled pensioner 's case again . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

do n't worry , the court 's on your side .
those suffering from gastrointestinal ailments can breathe a little easier today ; germany 's federal social court has ruled that having diarrhea is a valid excuse for showing up late for the judge . the bathroom or the bench ?
that was the dilemma faced by a german man who had an appointment with the social court in the state of baden-württemberg about his disability pension late last month . he was supposed to face the judge at 10:20 a.m. , but an overstimulated digestive tract had the man spending much more time than usual on the toilet .
he called the court early that morning explaining his predicament of being bound to the porcelain bowl , but got little sympathy .
he was told his appointment could not be postponed .
the queasy man finally made it to the courtroom at 10:35 , only to find his case had been decided in his absence .
the court had begun proceedings at 10:23 and seven minutes later the gavel fell - despite the diarrhea , no mercy was shown .
however , the federal social court , based in the city of kassel , saw this case of bowel-related lateness in another light .
it ruled on friday that the lower social court has to extend the current 15-minute tardiness time limit to 30 minutes , if the person in question is having " special difficulties " making the appointment - the runs falls into that category .
otherwise , the court said , an individual 's due process could be undermined .
the higher court ruled that the court baden-württemburg must hear the disabled pensioner 's case again . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

" where chechnya and human rights abuses have occasionally soured the atmosphere , this summit has so far been dominated by moscow 's desire to join the 147-member wto , which russia has been negotiating for six years . the eu , russia 's biggest trading partner , had insisted that moscow raise domestic energy prices to world levels , which it says currently amount to unfair subsidies for russian industries .
brussels also says russia should open its banking , financial and telecommunications sectors to foreign competition . " the eu-russia agreement is a joint step forward to open markets and trade liberalization in europe , " said irish prime minister bertie ahern , the current president of the european council . wto members all have the right to demand applicants sign individual agreements with them .
a deal with the eu would put moscow a big step closer to membership in the organization , though it must still complete agreements with china , japan and the united states . deal on emissions ? putin confirmed observers predictions that the talks could convince russia to carefully consider ratifying the kyoto protocol on lowering global emissions in exchange for concessions from the eu on wto entry . " the eu has met us halfway in talks over the wto and that can not but affect positively our position on the kyoto protocol , " putin told reporters .
" we will speed up russia 's movement toward the kyoto protocol 's ratification . " the document , which aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions widely thought to cause global warming , must be ratified by at least 55 countries that made up no less than 55 percent of global emissions in 1990 .
since the united states , the world 's largest producer of emissions , has rejected the treaty , only russian ratification would allow it to come into force . but climate experts advised moscow last week against ratifying the treaty , which they said was scientifically unsound and would harm russian growth .
both the russian academy of sciences and the kremlin remain undecided on the issue , german broadcaster wdr reported . issues remaining after the may 1 eu enlargement will also be on the agenda , including language rights for the russian minority in latvia and a fast train corridor from kaliningrad , the russian enclave in the baltics , to russia proper . brussels and moscow had ironed out the main sticking points only five days before the eu admitted to its ranks eight central and eastern european countries once part of the soviet union 's sphere of influence .

a judge in the landmark mannesman trial has thrown out criminal charges against the defendants , including deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , accused of profiting from vodafone 's takeover of the mobile phone operator . judge brigitte koppenhöfer in charge of the trial involving germany 's top banker and five other executives , accused of receiving huge executive bonuses when british vodafone took over german mobile phone operator mannesmann in 2000 , all but officially dropped the case on wednesday . the judge 's interim verdict that there was no criminal case to answer was handed down after a meeting between koppenhöfer and lawyers for both prosecution and defense . according to legal experts who have been following the trial , judge brigitte koppenhöffer 's statement that the criminal charges brought against the chief executive of deutsche bank , josef ackermann , klaus esser , mannesmann 's former boss and other executives were unwarranted , in effect mean the end of the trial . koppenhöffer admitted that the bonus payments received by the defendants were inadmissibly high in corporate law terms and may have violated securities law .
but she insisted that there had been no crime .
the judge added that there had been " no breach of trust " and the accused were only guilty of breaking stock corporation law . despite this preliminary ruling , the trial would continue , she said .
" the judges in their preliminary conclusion interpreted some of the questions in favor of the defendants and others still need to be clarified , " koppenhöfer added . trial could be over in days however , observers seem convinced that there is little doubt that all of the defendants will be acquitted .

even as the last spanish troops are pulled out of iraq this week , italian premier silvio berlusconi has announced his government will keep troops in the country until democracy and stability are ensured . in the same week berlusconi held talks with u.s. president george bush in washington , the italian parliament on thursday voted to keep troops in iraq till order was restored in the country , turning down opposition demands that the 3,000 soldiers deployed there be recalled . berlusconi , who has been under mounting pressure to pull out italian troops from iraq following a similar move by spain , the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal and the first combat loss of an italian solider in iraq earlier this week , remained defiant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi " italy will remain in iraq until it can govern itself in security and freedom and until the bandits and terrorists , who have been sowing death and fear for more than a year and preventing democratic elections in iraq , are wiped out , " he said to applause from his center-right coalition . pulling out sooner would be an " outrage to the honor of the fallen and to the magnificent work of our military and civilian workers , " the premier said .
" withdrawal now means abandoning to chaos a crucial country in the middle east . " spanish pull-out almost complete berlusconi 's announcement coincided with the withdrawal of the last spanish troops from their base in diwaniya , iraq according to the spanish defense ministry .
spanish news agency efe said the spanish general in charge of the unit transferred control of so-called base espana in south-central iraq to u.s. forces thursday night . spain 's new socialist government led by josé luis rodríguez zapatero , which came to power in march elections for pledging to pull out the 1,300 spanish soldiers deployed in iraq , followed up on the election promise and began withdrawing troops in may . stronger role for u.n. berlusconi , one of the strongest allies of the u.s. in the war against iraq , also underlined that there was a clear timetable for the handover of power to the iraqis that envisioned a larger role for the u.n. in the coming weeks . the italian premier added that a candidate had already been identified to head a " new , credible authoritative " iraqi interim government , but he had to yet accept the post .
u.s. president bush announced on wednesday that the representatives of the iraqi interim government would be selected in the next two weeks . berlusconi announced that a new u.n. resolution on iraq would be tabled in the first weeks of june .
" the new resolution will bestow international legitimacy on the new government , which will change the legal basis of the presence of foreign troops and mark the end of the occupation , " he said . the italian premier added he hoped that islamic countries would also participate in the coalition of foreign troops in iraq . peace mission a sham however berlusconi 's decision to keep troops in iraq is not likely to go down well in italy , where popular opinion has swung sharply against the war in recent months . a survey published thursday in la repubblica , a left-leaning daily , showed that 59 percent of italians want the troop withdrawn even if the united nations asks italy to remain in iraq after transfer of power on june 30 . opposition italian politicians in the lower chamber , who had tabled a motion calling for the immediate withdrawal of troops , however said that berlusconi 's portrayal of the iraq deployment as a peace mission was a sham . " the italian parliament had approved a peace mission in iraq - instead of that we 're now caught up in a war there that has led to the fact that we are being perceived as occupiers and enemies by the iraqis , " said piero fassino , leader of the main opposition party , the democrats of the left . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hostage killing fuels security fears in iraq the killing of an italian hostage by iraqi militants thursday and two german security workers last week has heightened security fears for europeans and other foreigners working in iraq .

do n't worry , the court 's on your side .

that was the dilemma faced by a german man who had an appointment with the social court in the state of baden-württemberg about his disability pension late last month . he was supposed to face the judge at 10:20 a.m. , but an overstimulated digestive tract had the man spending much more time than usual on the toilet .
he called the court early that morning explaining his predicament of being bound to the porcelain bowl , but got little sympathy .
he was told his appointment could not be postponed .
the queasy man finally made it to the courtroom at 10:35 , only to find his case had been decided in his absence .

it ruled on friday that the lower social court has to extend the current 15-minute tardiness time limit to 30 minutes , if the person in question is having " special difficulties " making the appointment - the runs falls into that category .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.05.2004 -pipe- 09:00 utc irish to push for eu voting rights deal the irish eu presidency is gearing itself up for the first collective discussion by member states on may 24 on the contentious question of a new voting system in the proposed european constitution .
a document circulated to eu governments by dublin on wednesday evening draws some tentative conclusions about where a final compromise might lie on the issue - over which talks collapsed last december .
the document states that while many countries support the new double majority voting system - based on a threshold of member states combined with a threshold of eu population - no consensus will be found on the current thresholds in the draft constitution .
these suggest that a decision is taken when supported by 50 % of member states representing 60 % of the eu population .
however , that has been flatly rejected by spain and poland as it would mean that europe 's big three - the uk , france and germany - could form a blocking minority on any decisions they did not like .
madrid would like the population threshold raised so that it would be much easier for it – as a medium-sized country – to block a decision it did not want .
it recently suggested the bar be raised to 66 % .
raising the thresholds of both the member states and the population appears to be the way the irish presidency is thinking as well .
its document suggests that " consensus will not be secured without raising the population threshold " .
and while the paper makes no mention of a specific figure it may indicate that member states are heading towards a compromise already mooted whereby a majority would consist of 55 % of member states representing 65 % of the population .
this could be accompanied by restrictions – also already floated - such as those states blocking a decision would have to represent at least 15 % of the eu population and at least four member states would be required for a blocking minority .

a document circulated to eu governments by dublin on wednesday evening draws some tentative conclusions about where a final compromise might lie on the issue - over which talks collapsed last december .
the document states that while many countries support the new double majority voting system - based on a threshold of member states combined with a threshold of eu population - no consensus will be found on the current thresholds in the draft constitution .
these suggest that a decision is taken when supported by 50 % of member states representing 60 % of the eu population .
however , that has been flatly rejected by spain and poland as it would mean that europe 's big three - the uk , france and germany - could form a blocking minority on any decisions they did not like .
madrid would like the population threshold raised so that it would be much easier for it – as a medium-sized country – to block a decision it did not want .
it recently suggested the bar be raised to 66 % .
raising the thresholds of both the member states and the population appears to be the way the irish presidency is thinking as well .
its document suggests that " consensus will not be secured without raising the population threshold " .
and while the paper makes no mention of a specific figure it may indicate that member states are heading towards a compromise already mooted whereby a majority would consist of 55 % of member states representing 65 % of the population .
this could be accompanied by restrictions – also already floated - such as those states blocking a decision would have to represent at least 15 % of the eu population and at least four member states would be required for a blocking minority .

" where chechnya and human rights abuses have occasionally soured the atmosphere , this summit has so far been dominated by moscow 's desire to join the 147-member wto , which russia has been negotiating for six years . the eu , russia 's biggest trading partner , had insisted that moscow raise domestic energy prices to world levels , which it says currently amount to unfair subsidies for russian industries .
brussels also says russia should open its banking , financial and telecommunications sectors to foreign competition . " the eu-russia agreement is a joint step forward to open markets and trade liberalization in europe , " said irish prime minister bertie ahern , the current president of the european council . wto members all have the right to demand applicants sign individual agreements with them .
a deal with the eu would put moscow a big step closer to membership in the organization , though it must still complete agreements with china , japan and the united states . deal on emissions ? putin confirmed observers predictions that the talks could convince russia to carefully consider ratifying the kyoto protocol on lowering global emissions in exchange for concessions from the eu on wto entry . " the eu has met us halfway in talks over the wto and that can not but affect positively our position on the kyoto protocol , " putin told reporters .
" we will speed up russia 's movement toward the kyoto protocol 's ratification . " the document , which aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions widely thought to cause global warming , must be ratified by at least 55 countries that made up no less than 55 percent of global emissions in 1990 .
since the united states , the world 's largest producer of emissions , has rejected the treaty , only russian ratification would allow it to come into force . but climate experts advised moscow last week against ratifying the treaty , which they said was scientifically unsound and would harm russian growth .
both the russian academy of sciences and the kremlin remain undecided on the issue , german broadcaster wdr reported . issues remaining after the may 1 eu enlargement will also be on the agenda , including language rights for the russian minority in latvia and a fast train corridor from kaliningrad , the russian enclave in the baltics , to russia proper . brussels and moscow had ironed out the main sticking points only five days before the eu admitted to its ranks eight central and eastern european countries once part of the soviet union 's sphere of influence . " enlargement will ring the eu and russia closer together , as it brings us new opportunities for cooperation , " ahern told putin friday . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum the death of chechnya 's president akhmed kadyrov in a bomb attack in grozny on sunday is being viewed as a huge blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability to the war-torn region .
-lrb- may 10 , 2004 -rrb- eu 's shifting borders problematic for kaliningrad the new eu members will enjoy relaxed border restrictions within the bloc .
but the external borders will be strengthened , causing problems for those traveling from russia through kaliningrad to eu nations .

a judge in the landmark mannesman trial has thrown out criminal charges against the defendants , including deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , accused of profiting from vodafone 's takeover of the mobile phone operator . judge brigitte koppenhöfer in charge of the trial involving germany 's top banker and five other executives , accused of receiving huge executive bonuses when british vodafone took over german mobile phone operator mannesmann in 2000 , all but officially dropped the case on wednesday . the judge 's interim verdict that there was no criminal case to answer was handed down after a meeting between koppenhöfer and lawyers for both prosecution and defense . according to legal experts who have been following the trial , judge brigitte koppenhöffer 's statement that the criminal charges brought against the chief executive of deutsche bank , josef ackermann , klaus esser , mannesmann 's former boss and other executives were unwarranted , in effect mean the end of the trial . koppenhöffer admitted that the bonus payments received by the defendants were inadmissibly high in corporate law terms and may have violated securities law .
but she insisted that there had been no crime .
the judge added that there had been " no breach of trust " and the accused were only guilty of breaking stock corporation law . despite this preliminary ruling , the trial would continue , she said .
" the judges in their preliminary conclusion interpreted some of the questions in favor of the defendants and others still need to be clarified , " koppenhöfer added . trial could be over in days however , observers seem convinced that there is little doubt that all of the defendants will be acquitted .

after vodafone successfully secured the acquisition with its € 180 billion bid , the mannesmann board approved a total of € 57 million in payouts to departing mannesmann staff .

a judge in the landmark mannesman trial has thrown out criminal charges against the defendants , including deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , accused of profiting from vodafone 's takeover of the mobile phone operator . judge brigitte koppenhöfer in charge of the trial involving germany 's top banker and five other executives , accused of receiving huge executive bonuses when british vodafone took over german mobile phone operator mannesmann in 2000 , all but officially dropped the case on wednesday . the judge 's interim verdict that there was no criminal case to answer was handed down after a meeting between koppenhöfer and lawyers for both prosecution and defense . according to legal experts who have been following the trial , judge brigitte koppenhöffer 's statement that the criminal charges brought against the chief executive of deutsche bank , josef ackermann , klaus esser , mannesmann 's former boss and other executives were unwarranted , in effect mean the end of the trial . koppenhöffer admitted that the bonus payments received by the defendants were inadmissibly high in corporate law terms and may have violated securities law .
but she insisted that there had been no crime .
the judge added that there had been " no breach of trust " and the accused were only guilty of breaking stock corporation law . despite this preliminary ruling , the trial would continue , she said .
" the judges in their preliminary conclusion interpreted some of the questions in favor of the defendants and others still need to be clarified , " koppenhöfer added . trial could be over in days however , observers seem convinced that there is little doubt that all of the defendants will be acquitted .

a judge in the landmark mannesman trial has thrown out criminal charges against the defendants , including deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , accused of profiting from vodafone 's takeover of the mobile phone operator . judge brigitte koppenhöfer in charge of the trial involving germany 's top banker and five other executives , accused of receiving huge executive bonuses when british vodafone took over german mobile phone operator mannesmann in 2000 , all but officially dropped the case on wednesday . the judge 's interim verdict that there was no criminal case to answer was handed down after a meeting between koppenhöfer and lawyers for both prosecution and defense . according to legal experts who have been following the trial , judge brigitte koppenhöffer 's statement that the criminal charges brought against the chief executive of deutsche bank , josef ackermann , klaus esser , mannesmann 's former boss and other executives were unwarranted , in effect mean the end of the trial . koppenhöffer admitted that the bonus payments received by the defendants were inadmissibly high in corporate law terms and may have violated securities law .

the judge added that there had been " no breach of trust " and the accused were only guilty of breaking stock corporation law . despite this preliminary ruling , the trial would continue , she said .
" the judges in their preliminary conclusion interpreted some of the questions in favor of the defendants and others still need to be clarified , " koppenhöfer added . trial could be over in days however , observers seem convinced that there is little doubt that all of the defendants will be acquitted .

do n't worry , the court 's on your side .
those suffering from gastrointestinal ailments can breathe a little easier today ; germany 's federal social court has ruled that having diarrhea is a valid excuse for showing up late for the judge . the bathroom or the bench ?
that was the dilemma faced by a german man who had an appointment with the social court in the state of baden-württemberg about his disability pension late last month . he was supposed to face the judge at 10:20 a.m. , but an overstimulated digestive tract had the man spending much more time than usual on the toilet .
he called the court early that morning explaining his predicament of being bound to the porcelain bowl , but got little sympathy .
he was told his appointment could not be postponed .
the queasy man finally made it to the courtroom at 10:35 , only to find his case had been decided in his absence .
the court had begun proceedings at 10:23 and seven minutes later the gavel fell - despite the diarrhea , no mercy was shown .
however , the federal social court , based in the city of kassel , saw this case of bowel-related lateness in another light .
it ruled on friday that the lower social court has to extend the current 15-minute tardiness time limit to 30 minutes , if the person in question is having " special difficulties " making the appointment - the runs falls into that category .
otherwise , the court said , an individual 's due process could be undermined .
the higher court ruled that the court baden-württemburg must hear the disabled pensioner 's case again . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

even as the last spanish troops are pulled out of iraq this week , italian premier silvio berlusconi has announced his government will keep troops in the country until democracy and stability are ensured . in the same week berlusconi held talks with u.s. president george bush in washington , the italian parliament on thursday voted to keep troops in iraq till order was restored in the country , turning down opposition demands that the 3,000 soldiers deployed there be recalled . berlusconi , who has been under mounting pressure to pull out italian troops from iraq following a similar move by spain , the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal and the first combat loss of an italian solider in iraq earlier this week , remained defiant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi " italy will remain in iraq until it can govern itself in security and freedom and until the bandits and terrorists , who have been sowing death and fear for more than a year and preventing democratic elections in iraq , are wiped out , " he said to applause from his center-right coalition . pulling out sooner would be an " outrage to the honor of the fallen and to the magnificent work of our military and civilian workers , " the premier said .
" withdrawal now means abandoning to chaos a crucial country in the middle east . " spanish pull-out almost complete berlusconi 's announcement coincided with the withdrawal of the last spanish troops from their base in diwaniya , iraq according to the spanish defense ministry .
spanish news agency efe said the spanish general in charge of the unit transferred control of so-called base espana in south-central iraq to u.s. forces thursday night . spain 's new socialist government led by josé luis rodríguez zapatero , which came to power in march elections for pledging to pull out the 1,300 spanish soldiers deployed in iraq , followed up on the election promise and began withdrawing troops in may . stronger role for u.n. berlusconi , one of the strongest allies of the u.s. in the war against iraq , also underlined that there was a clear timetable for the handover of power to the iraqis that envisioned a larger role for the u.n. in the coming weeks . the italian premier added that a candidate had already been identified to head a " new , credible authoritative " iraqi interim government , but he had to yet accept the post .
u.s. president bush announced on wednesday that the representatives of the iraqi interim government would be selected in the next two weeks . berlusconi announced that a new u.n. resolution on iraq would be tabled in the first weeks of june .
" the new resolution will bestow international legitimacy on the new government , which will change the legal basis of the presence of foreign troops and mark the end of the occupation , " he said . the italian premier added he hoped that islamic countries would also participate in the coalition of foreign troops in iraq . peace mission a sham however berlusconi 's decision to keep troops in iraq is not likely to go down well in italy , where popular opinion has swung sharply against the war in recent months . a survey published thursday in la repubblica , a left-leaning daily , showed that 59 percent of italians want the troop withdrawn even if the united nations asks italy to remain in iraq after transfer of power on june 30 . opposition italian politicians in the lower chamber , who had tabled a motion calling for the immediate withdrawal of troops , however said that berlusconi 's portrayal of the iraq deployment as a peace mission was a sham . " the italian parliament had approved a peace mission in iraq - instead of that we 're now caught up in a war there that has led to the fact that we are being perceived as occupiers and enemies by the iraqis , " said piero fassino , leader of the main opposition party , the democrats of the left . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hostage killing fuels security fears in iraq the killing of an italian hostage by iraqi militants thursday and two german security workers last week has heightened security fears for europeans and other foreigners working in iraq .

do n't worry , the court 's on your side .
those suffering from gastrointestinal ailments can breathe a little easier today ; germany 's federal social court has ruled that having diarrhea is a valid excuse for showing up late for the judge . the bathroom or the bench ?
that was the dilemma faced by a german man who had an appointment with the social court in the state of baden-württemberg about his disability pension late last month . he was supposed to face the judge at 10:20 a.m. , but an overstimulated digestive tract had the man spending much more time than usual on the toilet .
he called the court early that morning explaining his predicament of being bound to the porcelain bowl , but got little sympathy .
he was told his appointment could not be postponed .
the queasy man finally made it to the courtroom at 10:35 , only to find his case had been decided in his absence .
the court had begun proceedings at 10:23 and seven minutes later the gavel fell - despite the diarrhea , no mercy was shown .
however , the federal social court , based in the city of kassel , saw this case of bowel-related lateness in another light .
it ruled on friday that the lower social court has to extend the current 15-minute tardiness time limit to 30 minutes , if the person in question is having " special difficulties " making the appointment - the runs falls into that category .
otherwise , the court said , an individual 's due process could be undermined .
the higher court ruled that the court baden-württemburg must hear the disabled pensioner 's case again . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

do n't worry , the court 's on your side .
those suffering from gastrointestinal ailments can breathe a little easier today ; germany 's federal social court has ruled that having diarrhea is a valid excuse for showing up late for the judge . the bathroom or the bench ?
that was the dilemma faced by a german man who had an appointment with the social court in the state of baden-württemberg about his disability pension late last month . he was supposed to face the judge at 10:20 a.m. , but an overstimulated digestive tract had the man spending much more time than usual on the toilet .
he called the court early that morning explaining his predicament of being bound to the porcelain bowl , but got little sympathy .
he was told his appointment could not be postponed .
the queasy man finally made it to the courtroom at 10:35 , only to find his case had been decided in his absence .
the court had begun proceedings at 10:23 and seven minutes later the gavel fell - despite the diarrhea , no mercy was shown .
however , the federal social court , based in the city of kassel , saw this case of bowel-related lateness in another light .
it ruled on friday that the lower social court has to extend the current 15-minute tardiness time limit to 30 minutes , if the person in question is having " special difficulties " making the appointment - the runs falls into that category .
otherwise , the court said , an individual 's due process could be undermined .
the higher court ruled that the court baden-württemburg must hear the disabled pensioner 's case again . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

" where chechnya and human rights abuses have occasionally soured the atmosphere , this summit has so far been dominated by moscow 's desire to join the 147-member wto , which russia has been negotiating for six years . the eu , russia 's biggest trading partner , had insisted that moscow raise domestic energy prices to world levels , which it says currently amount to unfair subsidies for russian industries .
brussels also says russia should open its banking , financial and telecommunications sectors to foreign competition . " the eu-russia agreement is a joint step forward to open markets and trade liberalization in europe , " said irish prime minister bertie ahern , the current president of the european council . wto members all have the right to demand applicants sign individual agreements with them .
a deal with the eu would put moscow a big step closer to membership in the organization , though it must still complete agreements with china , japan and the united states . deal on emissions ? putin confirmed observers predictions that the talks could convince russia to carefully consider ratifying the kyoto protocol on lowering global emissions in exchange for concessions from the eu on wto entry . " the eu has met us halfway in talks over the wto and that can not but affect positively our position on the kyoto protocol , " putin told reporters .
" we will speed up russia 's movement toward the kyoto protocol 's ratification . " the document , which aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions widely thought to cause global warming , must be ratified by at least 55 countries that made up no less than 55 percent of global emissions in 1990 .
since the united states , the world 's largest producer of emissions , has rejected the treaty , only russian ratification would allow it to come into force . but climate experts advised moscow last week against ratifying the treaty , which they said was scientifically unsound and would harm russian growth .
both the russian academy of sciences and the kremlin remain undecided on the issue , german broadcaster wdr reported . issues remaining after the may 1 eu enlargement will also be on the agenda , including language rights for the russian minority in latvia and a fast train corridor from kaliningrad , the russian enclave in the baltics , to russia proper . brussels and moscow had ironed out the main sticking points only five days before the eu admitted to its ranks eight central and eastern european countries once part of the soviet union 's sphere of influence . " enlargement will ring the eu and russia closer together , as it brings us new opportunities for cooperation , " ahern told putin friday . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum the death of chechnya 's president akhmed kadyrov in a bomb attack in grozny on sunday is being viewed as a huge blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability to the war-torn region .

" where chechnya and human rights abuses have occasionally soured the atmosphere , this summit has so far been dominated by moscow 's desire to join the 147-member wto , which russia has been negotiating for six years . the eu , russia 's biggest trading partner , had insisted that moscow raise domestic energy prices to world levels , which it says currently amount to unfair subsidies for russian industries .
brussels also says russia should open its banking , financial and telecommunications sectors to foreign competition . " the eu-russia agreement is a joint step forward to open markets and trade liberalization in europe , " said irish prime minister bertie ahern , the current president of the european council . wto members all have the right to demand applicants sign individual agreements with them .
a deal with the eu would put moscow a big step closer to membership in the organization , though it must still complete agreements with china , japan and the united states . deal on emissions ? putin confirmed observers predictions that the talks could convince russia to carefully consider ratifying the kyoto protocol on lowering global emissions in exchange for concessions from the eu on wto entry . " the eu has met us halfway in talks over the wto and that can not but affect positively our position on the kyoto protocol , " putin told reporters .
" we will speed up russia 's movement toward the kyoto protocol 's ratification . " the document , which aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions widely thought to cause global warming , must be ratified by at least 55 countries that made up no less than 55 percent of global emissions in 1990 .
since the united states , the world 's largest producer of emissions , has rejected the treaty , only russian ratification would allow it to come into force . but climate experts advised moscow last week against ratifying the treaty , which they said was scientifically unsound and would harm russian growth .
both the russian academy of sciences and the kremlin remain undecided on the issue , german broadcaster wdr reported . issues remaining after the may 1 eu enlargement will also be on the agenda , including language rights for the russian minority in latvia and a fast train corridor from kaliningrad , the russian enclave in the baltics , to russia proper . brussels and moscow had ironed out the main sticking points only five days before the eu admitted to its ranks eight central and eastern european countries once part of the soviet union 's sphere of influence . " enlargement will ring the eu and russia closer together , as it brings us new opportunities for cooperation , " ahern told putin friday . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum the death of chechnya 's president akhmed kadyrov in a bomb attack in grozny on sunday is being viewed as a huge blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability to the war-torn region .

do n't worry , the court 's on your side .
those suffering from gastrointestinal ailments can breathe a little easier today ; germany 's federal social court has ruled that having diarrhea is a valid excuse for showing up late for the judge . the bathroom or the bench ?
that was the dilemma faced by a german man who had an appointment with the social court in the state of baden-württemberg about his disability pension late last month . he was supposed to face the judge at 10:20 a.m. , but an overstimulated digestive tract had the man spending much more time than usual on the toilet .
he called the court early that morning explaining his predicament of being bound to the porcelain bowl , but got little sympathy .
he was told his appointment could not be postponed .
the queasy man finally made it to the courtroom at 10:35 , only to find his case had been decided in his absence .
the court had begun proceedings at 10:23 and seven minutes later the gavel fell - despite the diarrhea , no mercy was shown .
however , the federal social court , based in the city of kassel , saw this case of bowel-related lateness in another light .
it ruled on friday that the lower social court has to extend the current 15-minute tardiness time limit to 30 minutes , if the person in question is having " special difficulties " making the appointment - the runs falls into that category .
otherwise , the court said , an individual 's due process could be undermined .

a judge in the landmark mannesman trial has thrown out criminal charges against the defendants , including deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , accused of profiting from vodafone 's takeover of the mobile phone operator . judge brigitte koppenhöfer in charge of the trial involving germany 's top banker and five other executives , accused of receiving huge executive bonuses when british vodafone took over german mobile phone operator mannesmann in 2000 , all but officially dropped the case on wednesday . the judge 's interim verdict that there was no criminal case to answer was handed down after a meeting between koppenhöfer and lawyers for both prosecution and defense . according to legal experts who have been following the trial , judge brigitte koppenhöffer 's statement that the criminal charges brought against the chief executive of deutsche bank , josef ackermann , klaus esser , mannesmann 's former boss and other executives were unwarranted , in effect mean the end of the trial . koppenhöffer admitted that the bonus payments received by the defendants were inadmissibly high in corporate law terms and may have violated securities law .
but she insisted that there had been no crime .
the judge added that there had been " no breach of trust " and the accused were only guilty of breaking stock corporation law . despite this preliminary ruling , the trial would continue , she said .
" the judges in their preliminary conclusion interpreted some of the questions in favor of the defendants and others still need to be clarified , " koppenhöfer added . trial could be over in days however , observers seem convinced that there is little doubt that all of the defendants will be acquitted .
the trial , which began in january , had been expected to go on until june when koppenhöffer and four other judges were expected to rule on their findings .

a judge in the landmark mannesman trial has thrown out criminal charges against the defendants , including deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , accused of profiting from vodafone 's takeover of the mobile phone operator . judge brigitte koppenhöfer in charge of the trial involving germany 's top banker and five other executives , accused of receiving huge executive bonuses when british vodafone took over german mobile phone operator mannesmann in 2000 , all but officially dropped the case on wednesday . the judge 's interim verdict that there was no criminal case to answer was handed down after a meeting between koppenhöfer and lawyers for both prosecution and defense . according to legal experts who have been following the trial , judge brigitte koppenhöffer 's statement that the criminal charges brought against the chief executive of deutsche bank , josef ackermann , klaus esser , mannesmann 's former boss and other executives were unwarranted , in effect mean the end of the trial . koppenhöffer admitted that the bonus payments received by the defendants were inadmissibly high in corporate law terms and may have violated securities law .
but she insisted that there had been no crime .
the judge added that there had been " no breach of trust " and the accused were only guilty of breaking stock corporation law . despite this preliminary ruling , the trial would continue , she said .
" the judges in their preliminary conclusion interpreted some of the questions in favor of the defendants and others still need to be clarified , " koppenhöfer added . trial could be over in days however , observers seem convinced that there is little doubt that all of the defendants will be acquitted .

" where chechnya and human rights abuses have occasionally soured the atmosphere , this summit has so far been dominated by moscow 's desire to join the 147-member wto , which russia has been negotiating for six years . the eu , russia 's biggest trading partner , had insisted that moscow raise domestic energy prices to world levels , which it says currently amount to unfair subsidies for russian industries .
brussels also says russia should open its banking , financial and telecommunications sectors to foreign competition . " the eu-russia agreement is a joint step forward to open markets and trade liberalization in europe , " said irish prime minister bertie ahern , the current president of the european council . wto members all have the right to demand applicants sign individual agreements with them .
a deal with the eu would put moscow a big step closer to membership in the organization , though it must still complete agreements with china , japan and the united states . deal on emissions ? putin confirmed observers predictions that the talks could convince russia to carefully consider ratifying the kyoto protocol on lowering global emissions in exchange for concessions from the eu on wto entry . " the eu has met us halfway in talks over the wto and that can not but affect positively our position on the kyoto protocol , " putin told reporters .
" we will speed up russia 's movement toward the kyoto protocol 's ratification . " the document , which aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions widely thought to cause global warming , must be ratified by at least 55 countries that made up no less than 55 percent of global emissions in 1990 .
since the united states , the world 's largest producer of emissions , has rejected the treaty , only russian ratification would allow it to come into force . but climate experts advised moscow last week against ratifying the treaty , which they said was scientifically unsound and would harm russian growth .
both the russian academy of sciences and the kremlin remain undecided on the issue , german broadcaster wdr reported . issues remaining after the may 1 eu enlargement will also be on the agenda , including language rights for the russian minority in latvia and a fast train corridor from kaliningrad , the russian enclave in the baltics , to russia proper . brussels and moscow had ironed out the main sticking points only five days before the eu admitted to its ranks eight central and eastern european countries once part of the soviet union 's sphere of influence . " enlargement will ring the eu and russia closer together , as it brings us new opportunities for cooperation , " ahern told putin friday . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum the death of chechnya 's president akhmed kadyrov in a bomb attack in grozny on sunday is being viewed as a huge blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability to the war-torn region .

do n't worry , the court 's on your side .
those suffering from gastrointestinal ailments can breathe a little easier today ; germany 's federal social court has ruled that having diarrhea is a valid excuse for showing up late for the judge . the bathroom or the bench ?
that was the dilemma faced by a german man who had an appointment with the social court in the state of baden-württemberg about his disability pension late last month . he was supposed to face the judge at 10:20 a.m. , but an overstimulated digestive tract had the man spending much more time than usual on the toilet .
he called the court early that morning explaining his predicament of being bound to the porcelain bowl , but got little sympathy .
he was told his appointment could not be postponed .
the queasy man finally made it to the courtroom at 10:35 , only to find his case had been decided in his absence .
the court had begun proceedings at 10:23 and seven minutes later the gavel fell - despite the diarrhea , no mercy was shown .
however , the federal social court , based in the city of kassel , saw this case of bowel-related lateness in another light .
it ruled on friday that the lower social court has to extend the current 15-minute tardiness time limit to 30 minutes , if the person in question is having " special difficulties " making the appointment - the runs falls into that category .
otherwise , the court said , an individual 's due process could be undermined .

" where chechnya and human rights abuses have occasionally soured the atmosphere , this summit has so far been dominated by moscow 's desire to join the 147-member wto , which russia has been negotiating for six years . the eu , russia 's biggest trading partner , had insisted that moscow raise domestic energy prices to world levels , which it says currently amount to unfair subsidies for russian industries .
brussels also says russia should open its banking , financial and telecommunications sectors to foreign competition . " the eu-russia agreement is a joint step forward to open markets and trade liberalization in europe , " said irish prime minister bertie ahern , the current president of the european council . wto members all have the right to demand applicants sign individual agreements with them .
a deal with the eu would put moscow a big step closer to membership in the organization , though it must still complete agreements with china , japan and the united states . deal on emissions ? putin confirmed observers predictions that the talks could convince russia to carefully consider ratifying the kyoto protocol on lowering global emissions in exchange for concessions from the eu on wto entry . " the eu has met us halfway in talks over the wto and that can not but affect positively our position on the kyoto protocol , " putin told reporters .
" we will speed up russia 's movement toward the kyoto protocol 's ratification . " the document , which aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions widely thought to cause global warming , must be ratified by at least 55 countries that made up no less than 55 percent of global emissions in 1990 .
since the united states , the world 's largest producer of emissions , has rejected the treaty , only russian ratification would allow it to come into force . but climate experts advised moscow last week against ratifying the treaty , which they said was scientifically unsound and would harm russian growth .
both the russian academy of sciences and the kremlin remain undecided on the issue , german broadcaster wdr reported . issues remaining after the may 1 eu enlargement will also be on the agenda , including language rights for the russian minority in latvia and a fast train corridor from kaliningrad , the russian enclave in the baltics , to russia proper . brussels and moscow had ironed out the main sticking points only five days before the eu admitted to its ranks eight central and eastern european countries once part of the soviet union 's sphere of influence .

he called the court early that morning explaining his predicament of being bound to the porcelain bowl , but got little sympathy .
he was told his appointment could not be postponed .
the queasy man finally made it to the courtroom at 10:35 , only to find his case had been decided in his absence .
the court had begun proceedings at 10:23 and seven minutes later the gavel fell - despite the diarrhea , no mercy was shown .
however , the federal social court , based in the city of kassel , saw this case of bowel-related lateness in another light .
it ruled on friday that the lower social court has to extend the current 15-minute tardiness time limit to 30 minutes , if the person in question is having " special difficulties " making the appointment - the runs falls into that category .

do n't worry , the court 's on your side .
those suffering from gastrointestinal ailments can breathe a little easier today ; germany 's federal social court has ruled that having diarrhea is a valid excuse for showing up late for the judge . the bathroom or the bench ?
that was the dilemma faced by a german man who had an appointment with the social court in the state of baden-württemberg about his disability pension late last month . he was supposed to face the judge at 10:20 a.m. , but an overstimulated digestive tract had the man spending much more time than usual on the toilet .
he called the court early that morning explaining his predicament of being bound to the porcelain bowl , but got little sympathy .
he was told his appointment could not be postponed .
the queasy man finally made it to the courtroom at 10:35 , only to find his case had been decided in his absence .
the court had begun proceedings at 10:23 and seven minutes later the gavel fell - despite the diarrhea , no mercy was shown .
however , the federal social court , based in the city of kassel , saw this case of bowel-related lateness in another light .
it ruled on friday that the lower social court has to extend the current 15-minute tardiness time limit to 30 minutes , if the person in question is having " special difficulties " making the appointment - the runs falls into that category .
otherwise , the court said , an individual 's due process could be undermined .

even as the last spanish troops are pulled out of iraq this week , italian premier silvio berlusconi has announced his government will keep troops in the country until democracy and stability are ensured . in the same week berlusconi held talks with u.s. president george bush in washington , the italian parliament on thursday voted to keep troops in iraq till order was restored in the country , turning down opposition demands that the 3,000 soldiers deployed there be recalled . berlusconi , who has been under mounting pressure to pull out italian troops from iraq following a similar move by spain , the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal and the first combat loss of an italian solider in iraq earlier this week , remained defiant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi " italy will remain in iraq until it can govern itself in security and freedom and until the bandits and terrorists , who have been sowing death and fear for more than a year and preventing democratic elections in iraq , are wiped out , " he said to applause from his center-right coalition . pulling out sooner would be an " outrage to the honor of the fallen and to the magnificent work of our military and civilian workers , " the premier said .
" withdrawal now means abandoning to chaos a crucial country in the middle east . " spanish pull-out almost complete berlusconi 's announcement coincided with the withdrawal of the last spanish troops from their base in diwaniya , iraq according to the spanish defense ministry .
spanish news agency efe said the spanish general in charge of the unit transferred control of so-called base espana in south-central iraq to u.s. forces thursday night . spain 's new socialist government led by josé luis rodríguez zapatero , which came to power in march elections for pledging to pull out the 1,300 spanish soldiers deployed in iraq , followed up on the election promise and began withdrawing troops in may . stronger role for u.n. berlusconi , one of the strongest allies of the u.s. in the war against iraq , also underlined that there was a clear timetable for the handover of power to the iraqis that envisioned a larger role for the u.n. in the coming weeks . the italian premier added that a candidate had already been identified to head a " new , credible authoritative " iraqi interim government , but he had to yet accept the post .
u.s. president bush announced on wednesday that the representatives of the iraqi interim government would be selected in the next two weeks . berlusconi announced that a new u.n. resolution on iraq would be tabled in the first weeks of june .
" the new resolution will bestow international legitimacy on the new government , which will change the legal basis of the presence of foreign troops and mark the end of the occupation , " he said . the italian premier added he hoped that islamic countries would also participate in the coalition of foreign troops in iraq . peace mission a sham however berlusconi 's decision to keep troops in iraq is not likely to go down well in italy , where popular opinion has swung sharply against the war in recent months . a survey published thursday in la repubblica , a left-leaning daily , showed that 59 percent of italians want the troop withdrawn even if the united nations asks italy to remain in iraq after transfer of power on june 30 . opposition italian politicians in the lower chamber , who had tabled a motion calling for the immediate withdrawal of troops , however said that berlusconi 's portrayal of the iraq deployment as a peace mission was a sham . " the italian parliament had approved a peace mission in iraq - instead of that we 're now caught up in a war there that has led to the fact that we are being perceived as occupiers and enemies by the iraqis , " said piero fassino , leader of the main opposition party , the democrats of the left . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hostage killing fuels security fears in iraq the killing of an italian hostage by iraqi militants thursday and two german security workers last week has heightened security fears for europeans and other foreigners working in iraq .

those suffering from gastrointestinal ailments can breathe a little easier today ; germany 's federal social court has ruled that having diarrhea is a valid excuse for showing up late for the judge . the bathroom or the bench ?
that was the dilemma faced by a german man who had an appointment with the social court in the state of baden-württemberg about his disability pension late last month . he was supposed to face the judge at 10:20 a.m. , but an overstimulated digestive tract had the man spending much more time than usual on the toilet .
he called the court early that morning explaining his predicament of being bound to the porcelain bowl , but got little sympathy .
he was told his appointment could not be postponed .
the queasy man finally made it to the courtroom at 10:35 , only to find his case had been decided in his absence .
the court had begun proceedings at 10:23 and seven minutes later the gavel fell - despite the diarrhea , no mercy was shown .
however , the federal social court , based in the city of kassel , saw this case of bowel-related lateness in another light .
it ruled on friday that the lower social court has to extend the current 15-minute tardiness time limit to 30 minutes , if the person in question is having " special difficulties " making the appointment - the runs falls into that category .
otherwise , the court said , an individual 's due process could be undermined .
the higher court ruled that the court baden-württemburg must hear the disabled pensioner 's case again . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

even as the last spanish troops are pulled out of iraq this week , italian premier silvio berlusconi has announced his government will keep troops in the country until democracy and stability are ensured . in the same week berlusconi held talks with u.s. president george bush in washington , the italian parliament on thursday voted to keep troops in iraq till order was restored in the country , turning down opposition demands that the 3,000 soldiers deployed there be recalled . berlusconi , who has been under mounting pressure to pull out italian troops from iraq following a similar move by spain , the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal and the first combat loss of an italian solider in iraq earlier this week , remained defiant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi " italy will remain in iraq until it can govern itself in security and freedom and until the bandits and terrorists , who have been sowing death and fear for more than a year and preventing democratic elections in iraq , are wiped out , " he said to applause from his center-right coalition . pulling out sooner would be an " outrage to the honor of the fallen and to the magnificent work of our military and civilian workers , " the premier said .
" withdrawal now means abandoning to chaos a crucial country in the middle east . " spanish pull-out almost complete berlusconi 's announcement coincided with the withdrawal of the last spanish troops from their base in diwaniya , iraq according to the spanish defense ministry .
spanish news agency efe said the spanish general in charge of the unit transferred control of so-called base espana in south-central iraq to u.s. forces thursday night . spain 's new socialist government led by josé luis rodríguez zapatero , which came to power in march elections for pledging to pull out the 1,300 spanish soldiers deployed in iraq , followed up on the election promise and began withdrawing troops in may . stronger role for u.n. berlusconi , one of the strongest allies of the u.s. in the war against iraq , also underlined that there was a clear timetable for the handover of power to the iraqis that envisioned a larger role for the u.n. in the coming weeks . the italian premier added that a candidate had already been identified to head a " new , credible authoritative " iraqi interim government , but he had to yet accept the post .
u.s. president bush announced on wednesday that the representatives of the iraqi interim government would be selected in the next two weeks . berlusconi announced that a new u.n. resolution on iraq would be tabled in the first weeks of june .
" the new resolution will bestow international legitimacy on the new government , which will change the legal basis of the presence of foreign troops and mark the end of the occupation , " he said . the italian premier added he hoped that islamic countries would also participate in the coalition of foreign troops in iraq . peace mission a sham however berlusconi 's decision to keep troops in iraq is not likely to go down well in italy , where popular opinion has swung sharply against the war in recent months . a survey published thursday in la repubblica , a left-leaning daily , showed that 59 percent of italians want the troop withdrawn even if the united nations asks italy to remain in iraq after transfer of power on june 30 . opposition italian politicians in the lower chamber , who had tabled a motion calling for the immediate withdrawal of troops , however said that berlusconi 's portrayal of the iraq deployment as a peace mission was a sham . " the italian parliament had approved a peace mission in iraq - instead of that we 're now caught up in a war there that has led to the fact that we are being perceived as occupiers and enemies by the iraqis , " said piero fassino , leader of the main opposition party , the democrats of the left . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hostage killing fuels security fears in iraq the killing of an italian hostage by iraqi militants thursday and two german security workers last week has heightened security fears for europeans and other foreigners working in iraq .

those suffering from gastrointestinal ailments can breathe a little easier today ; germany 's federal social court has ruled that having diarrhea is a valid excuse for showing up late for the judge . the bathroom or the bench ?
that was the dilemma faced by a german man who had an appointment with the social court in the state of baden-württemberg about his disability pension late last month . he was supposed to face the judge at 10:20 a.m. , but an overstimulated digestive tract had the man spending much more time than usual on the toilet .
he called the court early that morning explaining his predicament of being bound to the porcelain bowl , but got little sympathy .
he was told his appointment could not be postponed .
the queasy man finally made it to the courtroom at 10:35 , only to find his case had been decided in his absence .
the court had begun proceedings at 10:23 and seven minutes later the gavel fell - despite the diarrhea , no mercy was shown .
however , the federal social court , based in the city of kassel , saw this case of bowel-related lateness in another light .
it ruled on friday that the lower social court has to extend the current 15-minute tardiness time limit to 30 minutes , if the person in question is having " special difficulties " making the appointment - the runs falls into that category .

" where chechnya and human rights abuses have occasionally soured the atmosphere , this summit has so far been dominated by moscow 's desire to join the 147-member wto , which russia has been negotiating for six years . the eu , russia 's biggest trading partner , had insisted that moscow raise domestic energy prices to world levels , which it says currently amount to unfair subsidies for russian industries .
brussels also says russia should open its banking , financial and telecommunications sectors to foreign competition . " the eu-russia agreement is a joint step forward to open markets and trade liberalization in europe , " said irish prime minister bertie ahern , the current president of the european council . wto members all have the right to demand applicants sign individual agreements with them .
a deal with the eu would put moscow a big step closer to membership in the organization , though it must still complete agreements with china , japan and the united states . deal on emissions ? putin confirmed observers predictions that the talks could convince russia to carefully consider ratifying the kyoto protocol on lowering global emissions in exchange for concessions from the eu on wto entry . " the eu has met us halfway in talks over the wto and that can not but affect positively our position on the kyoto protocol , " putin told reporters .
" we will speed up russia 's movement toward the kyoto protocol 's ratification . " the document , which aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions widely thought to cause global warming , must be ratified by at least 55 countries that made up no less than 55 percent of global emissions in 1990 .
since the united states , the world 's largest producer of emissions , has rejected the treaty , only russian ratification would allow it to come into force . but climate experts advised moscow last week against ratifying the treaty , which they said was scientifically unsound and would harm russian growth .
both the russian academy of sciences and the kremlin remain undecided on the issue , german broadcaster wdr reported . issues remaining after the may 1 eu enlargement will also be on the agenda , including language rights for the russian minority in latvia and a fast train corridor from kaliningrad , the russian enclave in the baltics , to russia proper . brussels and moscow had ironed out the main sticking points only five days before the eu admitted to its ranks eight central and eastern european countries once part of the soviet union 's sphere of influence . " enlargement will ring the eu and russia closer together , as it brings us new opportunities for cooperation , " ahern told putin friday . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum the death of chechnya 's president akhmed kadyrov in a bomb attack in grozny on sunday is being viewed as a huge blow to moscow 's efforts to restore stability to the war-torn region .

do n't worry , the court 's on your side .
those suffering from gastrointestinal ailments can breathe a little easier today ; germany 's federal social court has ruled that having diarrhea is a valid excuse for showing up late for the judge . the bathroom or the bench ?
that was the dilemma faced by a german man who had an appointment with the social court in the state of baden-württemberg about his disability pension late last month . he was supposed to face the judge at 10:20 a.m. , but an overstimulated digestive tract had the man spending much more time than usual on the toilet .
he called the court early that morning explaining his predicament of being bound to the porcelain bowl , but got little sympathy .
he was told his appointment could not be postponed .
the queasy man finally made it to the courtroom at 10:35 , only to find his case had been decided in his absence .
the court had begun proceedings at 10:23 and seven minutes later the gavel fell - despite the diarrhea , no mercy was shown .
however , the federal social court , based in the city of kassel , saw this case of bowel-related lateness in another light .
it ruled on friday that the lower social court has to extend the current 15-minute tardiness time limit to 30 minutes , if the person in question is having " special difficulties " making the appointment - the runs falls into that category .
otherwise , the court said , an individual 's due process could be undermined .
the higher court ruled that the court baden-württemburg must hear the disabled pensioner 's case again . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

a judge in the landmark mannesman trial has thrown out criminal charges against the defendants , including deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , accused of profiting from vodafone 's takeover of the mobile phone operator . judge brigitte koppenhöfer in charge of the trial involving germany 's top banker and five other executives , accused of receiving huge executive bonuses when british vodafone took over german mobile phone operator mannesmann in 2000 , all but officially dropped the case on wednesday . the judge 's interim verdict that there was no criminal case to answer was handed down after a meeting between koppenhöfer and lawyers for both prosecution and defense . according to legal experts who have been following the trial , judge brigitte koppenhöffer 's statement that the criminal charges brought against the chief executive of deutsche bank , josef ackermann , klaus esser , mannesmann 's former boss and other executives were unwarranted , in effect mean the end of the trial . koppenhöffer admitted that the bonus payments received by the defendants were inadmissibly high in corporate law terms and may have violated securities law .
but she insisted that there had been no crime .
the judge added that there had been " no breach of trust " and the accused were only guilty of breaking stock corporation law . despite this preliminary ruling , the trial would continue , she said .
" the judges in their preliminary conclusion interpreted some of the questions in favor of the defendants and others still need to be clarified , " koppenhöfer added . trial could be over in days however , observers seem convinced that there is little doubt that all of the defendants will be acquitted .
the trial , which began in january , had been expected to go on until june when koppenhöffer and four other judges were expected to rule on their findings .

the preliminary ruling will not only have implications for those involved in the case , but for the future of germany 's biggest bank .

a judge in the landmark mannesman trial has thrown out criminal charges against the defendants , including deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , accused of profiting from vodafone 's takeover of the mobile phone operator . judge brigitte koppenhöfer in charge of the trial involving germany 's top banker and five other executives , accused of receiving huge executive bonuses when british vodafone took over german mobile phone operator mannesmann in 2000 , all but officially dropped the case on wednesday . the judge 's interim verdict that there was no criminal case to answer was handed down after a meeting between koppenhöfer and lawyers for both prosecution and defense . according to legal experts who have been following the trial , judge brigitte koppenhöffer 's statement that the criminal charges brought against the chief executive of deutsche bank , josef ackermann , klaus esser , mannesmann 's former boss and other executives were unwarranted , in effect mean the end of the trial . koppenhöffer admitted that the bonus payments received by the defendants were inadmissibly high in corporate law terms and may have violated securities law .
but she insisted that there had been no crime .
the judge added that there had been " no breach of trust " and the accused were only guilty of breaking stock corporation law . despite this preliminary ruling , the trial would continue , she said .
" the judges in their preliminary conclusion interpreted some of the questions in favor of the defendants and others still need to be clarified , " koppenhöfer added . trial could be over in days however , observers seem convinced that there is little doubt that all of the defendants will be acquitted .
the trial , which began in january , had been expected to go on until june when koppenhöffer and four other judges were expected to rule on their findings .
some experts believe that it may now last only a matter of days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former mannesmann chief executive officer klaus esser .
esser -lrb- photo -rrb- and his former colleagues faced charges of abusing the trust of their shareholders during vodafone 's infamous battle for control of the company in 2000 .
after vodafone successfully secured the acquisition with its € 180 billion bid , the mannesmann board approved a total of € 57 million in payouts to departing mannesmann staff .
esser alone received € 30 million .
the revelation of the " appreciation awards " caused public outrage in germany . others on trial for the involvement in the takeover are former mannesmann personnel chief dietmar droste , the company 's board chairman , joachim funk , and two board members - jürgen ladberg , an employee representative and klaus zwickel , the retired head of the ig metall union . shareholders complaint brought trial to court the case was prompted by shareholders ' complaints about the size of the payout which reflected the type of payments handed down in the more ruthless reward-driven anglo-u.s. model in contrast to the more managed and consensual german system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank chief executive josef ackermann .
the preliminary ruling will not only have implications for those involved in the case , but for the future of germany 's biggest bank .
deutsche bank 's immediate stability is intrinsically linked to the area of the case involving ackermann . ackermann 's verdict vital for deutsche bank until the judge 's statement on wednesday , the chief executive was facing a fine or even a prison term and the possibility of losing his position by choice or through pressure .
that would have destroyed his vision of partnering deutsche bank with an international rival , an idea central to the bank 's future , and would have thrown the bank into a strategic crisis . judge koppenhöffer 's decision would have also forced change onto german companies in the way that they reward their top management .
germany has been traditionally reluctant to adopt anglo-saxon levels of pay and many observers saw the trial as a test of a company 's right to award big payments .
it had also been feared that had the court had charged those involved in the mannesmann case , it would have discouraged companies from doing business in germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank boss cool under fire in mannesmann trial deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , currently facing “ breach of trust ” charges for approving controversial bonuses to mannesmann directors , told a düsseldorf court on thursday that he had nothing to hide .

the first welsh edition of the times educational supplement -lrb- tes -rrb- also found two in five admitted taking children out of school during term time .
latest figures show that in some schools as many as one in four pupils are missing from lessons every day .
of those questioned , 74 % said parents who allowed their children to play truant should be imprisoned .
it is seen as good news for local education authorities across wales who are taking an increasingly hard line against parents .
in carmarthenshire two mothers have been jailed in the past 18 months for allowing their children to truant .
the survey - which questioned 200 parents across wales - also shows that 80 % of parents in wales think teachers are doing a good job .
excellent a total of 40 % of parents of primary school children rated their teachers excellent .
but absenteeism - both truancy and authorised absences - is proving to be a difficulty for the welsh assembly government .
the assembly aims to reduce overall pupil absences from the 2002-03 level of 9.5 % to 8 % this year .
but it says prosecuting parents for unauthorised absences should be a last resort , and has rejected england 's policy of empowering education welfare officers and head teachers to issue £ 100 spot fines for truancy .
instead , it is piloting the use of learning mentors and army-style outdoor activities .
the survey also revealed that a slight majority believe that parents should face legal action if their children make malicious allegations against teachers .
support was strongest among fathers and parents of secondary-age pupils .
are parents to blame for their children 's truancy ?
should parents be sent to prison if children skip school ?
read some of your comments : once my children are dropped off at school they become the responsibility of the school .
if they manage to get out and play truant after that then surely we should be asking the head teachers why they are not looking after our children as they should ?
alan , ruthin do n't waste taxpayers ' money putting the parents in prison karen , london do n't waste taxpayers ' money putting the parents in prison .
it would be more beneficial to everyone if they were made to perform community service .
karen , london prison for truanting parents ?
with more people in jail than ever before and violent criminals and thieves either paroled early or given suspended sentences because there is not enough room for them - seems to me we have our priorities wrong .
no point in making a 15 or 16 year old attend school if they do n't want to - you have to want to learn .
let people make their own decisions and take responsibility for their own lives .
tony , milton keynes surely if the parents are sent to jail their truant children will end up even worse off ?
a system of fines is much less damaging but still a good way of motivating the parents .
better still would be to educate the parents , but unfortunately that may not be practical .
paul , bristol , uk most relevant legislation has served to empower children .
can we be surprised if they use these powers , that make them untouchable , to do just as they want .
now we are trying to ban smacking .
can people not see that things are going in the wrong direction ?
spencer , isle of wight a good initiative would be for shopping centres and places of leisure -lrb- e.g internet cafes -rrb- to tackle to problem with support from the local authorities .
surely children of school age should generally not be in these places during school hours .
ed geater , redcard & cleveland why the parents , why do n't we introduce camps like they have in america - set up to deal with problems in inner cities areas .
they work there - so why not here ?
steve j , pontypool truanting children should be made to attend all lectures / classes with their parents !
then hopefully the whole family learns a lesson .
why should the parents suffer alone and the penalty of prison ?
christine n. , london i work near a shopping centre and i 'm astonished by the number of school-aged children , accompanied by parents or grandparents that i see there .
the parents seem to be well aware of what is happening .
sarah , leeds i say let them truant - these are the children who are least likely to gain anything from being in lessons , moreover they are probably more likely to cause disruption in class .
the less they are there , the less the problem of over populated class sizes .
dave p , surrey have any fathers been jailed for failing to send their children to school ?

people with high levels of antioxidant in their blood are also less likely to have ever smoked , more likely to be physically active and less likely to be obese .
the study was conducted in 4,000 women from all over britain who had blood tests when they were 60-70 years old .
dr lawlor said : " people should be encouraged to eat a healthy diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables and of course should take regular exercise and should not smoke .
" but there is no evidence that taking vitamin supplements will prevent heart disease or cancer . "

the call came from the federation of small businesses -lrb- fsb -rrb- as the indefinite strike started by public service union nipsa members on monday caused mounting problems .
the driver and vehicle testing agency warned of disruption to appointments at seven centres , namely armagh , belfast , craigavon , lisburn , mallusk , newry and newtownards .
some 5,000 mots were expected to be cancelled this week and the situation could get worse next week when two more centres join the strike .
the government has made clear that despite the strike it is not relaxing its requirement for a current mot certificate when a car over four years old is re-taxed .
wilfred mitchell of the fsb called for a government re-think on testing .
he said : " it is surely time for the government to consider changing the current system in northern ireland to that used in other parts of the uk , where private vehicles can be tested by local licensed garages as opposed to government-run centres . "
he said if the government moved to that system it would " provide significant business opportunities to garages in northern ireland " and would ensure the negative effect of industrial action was minimised .
pay package he said the fsb accepted the uk model still had government-run mot centres for commercial and passenger vehicles .
however , he said it would still provide a competitive service , choice to the general public and " create opportunities for garage owners " .
nipsa has been involved in strike action since december over what they said was the government 's refusal to give civil service staff any cost of living increases in rates of pay since april last year .
the government has imposed a pay package which will add 3.67 % to the wage bill of the northern ireland civil service .
however , union officials say that was part of a pre-agreed increment and takes no account of the rise in the cost of living .

to find out what the job entails , the bbc news website spoke to denise deegan , who is resident writer at hmp featherstone , near wolverhampton .
ms deegan , who lives in north east wales , said the role was " fun and exciting " .
" the prisoners are doing stuff they have n't done before .
" quite a few have n't written before - they are surprised at how good they are and so am i. you get your own set of keys - otherwise you would get stuck in places and be relying on other people letting you in and out denise deegan " the job is interesting , always surprising , and quite tiring .
" but it is rewarding , particularly when you see people gain confidence to try new things , and you see people blossoming .
" when you first go , you have an induction week , but it is a bit of a shock to be in the prison " it is a bit strange the first few times you go .
" it is a cross between a huge government office , a school and a hospital .
" you go in there thinking it is going to be claustrophobic , but it is not .
" and you get your own set of keys - otherwise you would get stuck in places and be relying on other people letting you in and out . "

" quite a few of them have n't done any drama before - now a few of them say they are going to join amateur dramatic societies when they get out .
" but you always have to work within the system - hours we can work in , and people move on , like if they are sent to another prison .
i am like a free spirit - i see what things the prisoners are into and expand and evolve from that .
denise deegan " you do have to cope with the unexpected . "
and does she find it strange being a woman inside a man 's prison ?
" you do n't feel like you are the only one , " she said .
" there are quite a few female officers and female teachers in the education department and the probation department .
" sometimes when you are walking down a corridor , you can meet a group of the prisoners , and there may be a comment , but they are a bunch of young men - it 's the same outside . "
there are about 600 men in featherstone , split into different houses , and part of ms deegan 's role is bringing people with similar interests together , and then develop projects from there .
" i am like a free spirit - i see what things the prisoners are into and expand and evolve from that .
" the prisoners often seek me out and make contact .
" the prisoners see it as positive , it is a change to what they normally do .

but many others will want to know whether there is any truth in it all .
did troy exist ?
its makers warner bros are no doubt hopeful that their latest sword and sandal epic will bring home the oscars as gladiator did in 2001 .
the " book of the film " is the iliad , reputedly written in 800bc by the blind greek poet homer .
modern culture is still familiar with the tale .
" the face which launched a thousand ships " is a well-known quote referring to helen , the beauty at the centre of the story .
and any football fan knows the significance of an injury to the achilles tendon , referring to the warrior hero with a fatal weakness .
even computer users recognise a " trojan horse " as something dangerous , if not to life and limb , at least to their pc , referring as it does to the crafty subterfuge which enabled the penetration of troy .
the story appears to have everything - a 10-year conflict between mighty nations and their warrior heroes , triggered by the abduction of helen of troy - the most beautiful woman in the world .
but professor brian rose , an archaeologist from the university of cincinnati , has been trying to separate fact from this fiction for decades .
professor rose has made many finds he says the troy legend is as relevant today as it was to the ancient greeks .
" look at the story - it talks about a coalition of forces heading off to fight in the east , a conflict between east and west .
who would not recognise that today ? "
for centuries experts have pored over homer 's description of this lofty , heavily fortified city and attempted to put it on the modern map .
the text seemed to place it by the side of the dardanelles - the straits between the aegean and black seas .
it is difficult to imagine a more strategically-important spot in terms of trade .
in 1870 , german archaeologist heinrich schliemann began excavating a mound at hisarlik , a few kilometres from the dardanelles .
he found remains of a substantial ancient settlement .
in fact , closer examination of the site revealed not just one city - but several , built one on top of the other .
the deeper you dug , the further back in time you travelled , right back to 4,500 bc .
digs have revealed a probable site for troy so was one of them homer 's troy ?
while there is no obvious cause for the abandonment and rebuilding of some of the cities , there is clear evidence of a violent end to others .
in particular , one caught the eye of researchers .
dating roughly from 1200 bc , this city bore all the hallmarks of having been destroyed by an invading army .
professor rose said : " what we found was a five-foot ' destruction level ' with evidence of burning , bones , and piles of stones for slingshots - it is consistent with a sack of the city . "
a recent study by university of delaware geologists of sediments in the flood plain beside the city , suggests many of the battlefield details of homer 's iliad may have been close to the truth as well .
many archaeologists now believe that there was indeed a war , or perhaps several wars between greeks and " trojans " - most likely the western end of the huge hittite empire which then dominated what is now turkey .
diane kruger plays helen in the movie what they really needed to prove that this indeed was troy was some written evidence from the time that might suggest a conflict , and virtually none has ever been found .
however , when fragments of hittite writings from this era were unearthed , they offered some tantalising clues .
they spoke of a dispute in the west at this time , and described a city whose name was similar to ilion - a later name given to troy .
no document from the period has ever mentioned a helen of troy , or an achilles , but these writings mention an individual called alexandros - an alternative version of the name paris .
while paris may have been a real person , it remains doubtful that his city descended into war over his desire for helen - the strategic position of troy on the main trade routes between east and west is a far more likely explanation .
wooden horse professor rose said : " if a war was fought over troy , it was much more likely to be for money and power rather than love . "
even the existence of the famous wooden horse - one of the highlights of the movie - is in doubt .
no trace of it has ever been found by archaeologists .
homer 's epic was the blockbuster of its time , and it is possible that in a different age - eyesight permitting - he might have been a cinema scriptwriter himself , hyping up the battles and bringing in the love interest .
audiences experiencing his stories for the first time this summer may be seeing a little more truth than in the average hollywood potboiler .

the lloyds tsb group union -lrb- ltu -rrb- was petitioning the company 's annual general meeting in scotland on friday .
union officials were urging shareholders to consider the long-term effects on company profits and customer numbers .
the bank 's call centre in newcastle is to close , with the loss of 960 jobs .
union members have collected 360,000 signatures so far from customers visiting lloyds tsb branches nationwide .
the union , which represents more than 45,000 staff , has been campaigning against plans by the company to move a total of 1,500 jobs from the uk to india by the end of 2004 .
' switch banks ' it fears the move could mean more jobs eventually " off-shored " from call centre , service centres and bank office operations run by the bank .
a union spokesman said : " we are urging shareholders to look at the facts and see that off-shoring of lloyds tsb 's operations is not only bad for customers and staff but for shareholders too .
" a host of recent independent surveys have shown that off-shoring leads to poorer customer service and customer dissatisfaction .
" many customers have said they would rather switch banks than have their financial arrangements managed abroad .
