program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.07.2004 experts : poverty in germany set to rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say they 'll bear the brunt social organizations are warning of a dramatic increase in the number of poor people in germany as a result of welfare reforms being implemented next year .
children will be among the worst affected by the changes . families that rely on food banks because they 've run out of money for groceries ; children that go to school sick because their parents ca n't afford a visit to the doctor ; cities that are divided along lines of social class and income .
it 's not the normal picture that comes to mind when imagining life in germany .
but experts are warning that it 's the reality awaiting germany following the implementation of the government 's package of unemployment and social welfare reforms , known as hartz iv . once the new package of laws goes into effect in january 2005 , the number of poor people in germany will increase from 2.8 to 4.5 million , according to an association of german charities . in european countries , poor people are generally seen as those who live on less than half the average national income .
in germany , the average income is roughly € 2,200 -lrb- $ 2,700 -rrb- per month .
but in making their predictions , charitable organizations count the number of people currently living on the lowest level of social welfare assistance . the new law merges social assistance and second tier unemployment payments , meaning those relying on welfare will suddenly have to make do with far less money .
after hartz iv , they 'll have a monthly income of € 345 minus rent payments , which will be covered by the state . visible consequences werner hesse , the head of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charitable association told dw-world that this new reality will have visible consequences for all germans , especially if families on welfare are forced to relocate to areas with cheaper rents , creating ghettos of the poor and unemployed . " previously , social classes were mixed and people on benefit lived next to more affluent families , " hesse said .
" but if people have to find cheaper apartments , the population will be more segmented - society will be separated according to who 's wealthy and who 's not . " the german anti-poverty conference predicts that the consolidation of welfare payments will have the most drastic consequences for children , with the number of minors living on social welfare increasing three-fold after hartz iv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unemployed mother browses the job listings " it 's the biggest problem we 're facing , " paul saatkamp , spokesman for the national anti-poverty conference , told dw-world .
" there will be connections with education and health .
socially disadvantaged kids also face disadvantages in school , they tend to get sick more often .
we always hear in this country that people need to have more children , that we need more young people for our economy , but after hartz iv we 'll have 150,000 young people out on the streets with no hope for the future . " saatkamp said that politicians are only paying lip-service to the problems facing germany 's poor youth , and that currently , the political instruments to change their fate do n't exist . " the government is n't listening , " he said , adding that after the government passed it 's unpopular agenda 2010 package of economic and social welfare reforms , attitudes changed .
" after agenda 2010 , it was ' grit your teeth and get on with it . '
the governing parties and the opposition are of the same opinion , which is that these reforms are going to go ahead on the backs of the poor in germany . " necessary evil many politicians and economists in germany say the government has no other choice but to push through welfare cuts and other reforms if the country hopes to get its economy back on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter , the spd 's parliamentary group leader the social democrat 's parliamentary group leader , klaus uwe benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- , recently called for a change in mentality on the cuts in unemployment benefits . " we should n't be paying money for doing nothing , " benneter said , adding that the new welfare rules under hartz iv need to be taken on as a " giant task for all of society . " but even leading german researchers in germany who see the positive aspects of hartz iv say that too much is being asked of people who are going to have to get by on too little . thomas kieselbach , who chairs the scientific committee on unemployment and health for the international commission on occupational health , said he approves of the new , more proactive measures to fight long-term unemployment , such as more intensive career counseling in the early stages of unemployment . but the bremen university professor told dw-world that the psychological impact on the millions of unemployed who 'll suddenly see a drastic reduction in their financial support will have long-term consequences . " if you look at the development of countries that have already been through this process in the 90 's , then germany will likely follow with an increase in social inequality , " kieselbach said .
" this could lead to a deeper cleavage between social strata in our society , and there 's an increased potential for social conflict . " negative image change these social changes are unlikely to go unnoticed by the international community .
paul saatkamp of the national anti-poverty conference said germany can expect its image abroad to change if nothing is done to combat the increasing social exclusion of the nation 's poor . " after the reforms , we 'll have the argument that we had to keep in step with globalization , that the social welfare system we had before was impossible to maintain , " saatkamp said .
" but the image of germany as a country with a social conscience is only going to get worse .

in april 1994 , the bvg decided that cannabis possession in small quantities for occasional personal consumption should not be treated as a criminal offence .

in april 1994 , the bvg decided that cannabis possession in small quantities for occasional personal consumption should not be treated as a criminal offence .
however , after struggling to find a consensus on how much hash constitutes a " small " quantity and how often is " occasional use , " the bvg had decided the simplest solution would be to re-criminalize these gray areas .
greens call for review jerzy montag , the green party ’ s speaker on legal issues in the bundestag , demanded a review of the judgment .
" hashish is no more dangerous than nicotine and alcohol .
therefore , hashish consumers might not be in any more danger than a smoker or a heavy drinker . "
the christian social union ’ s health minister werner schnappauf held a different view " the gossip around cannabis as a supposedly harmless drug has led to a dangerous increase in youngsters ’ consumption , " he told reporters .
this playing down of the drug is irresponsible , explained schnappauf and he warned that a new ' entrance culture ' where youngsters would try other drugs after smoking dope would be the result of liberalization .
experts ' study show risk factor low however , three leading european experts on addiction , who had been charged by the federal health ministry to compile definitive information on the effects of cannabis , came to the conclusion that cannabis consumption was far less risky than first thought .
despite an estimated three million users , fatalities attributed to hashish were lower than the 40,000 deaths through alcohol every year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.07.2004 greeks wo n't prevent " rehakles " returning to germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes otto rehhagel will return and bring his magic touch the greek football federation declared on thursday that it would not stop otto rehhagel from returning to germany to take the job of national coach - if he wants to . one of the main obstacles between otto rehhagel and the job many other international coaches are avoiding like the plague was removed on thursday when the greek football federation announced that it would not force the country 's euro 2004-winning coach to honor his contract , thus paving the way for " rehakles " to take the reigns of the german team - if he chooses to . greek football president vassilis gagatsis was quoted as saying that , although rehhagel 's contract does not expire until after the 2006 world cup in germany , king otto - just one of the terms of endearment he 's known by in greece - could relinquish his greek throne under certain circumstances . " in case the coach cites personal reasons and wants to disrupt his cooperation with us , we ca n't keep him willy-nilly , " gagatsis was quoted on the website of radio station flash .
" in such a case we must discuss it with him and see what can be done .
i ca n't rule out anything , " he said . rehhagel steered the greek team to victory in the european championships in portugal , even though the greeks were considered rank outsiders at the start of the tournament .
he is now the main man in the frame for rudi völler 's old job after the germany coach resigned in the wake of his own team 's dismal elimination from the contest 's first round . rehhagel , the one-time coach of werder bremen , bayern munich and kaiserslautern , may soon be the only man in consideration after a series of high profile trainers turned down the job . top coaches go cold on german job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ottmar hitzfeld wants a break after leaving bayern munich another former bayern munich coach , ottmar hitzfeld , was odds-on to take over .
but just as the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- was ready to appoint him as successor , he declared himself unwilling to take on the responsibility .
the offer then went out to former candidate christoph daum who said " thanks , but no thanks , " preferring to stay in turkey .
then it was revealed that franz beckenbauer , president of bayern munich and a heavyweight at the dfb , had sounded out arsenal 's french mastermind arsene wenger about taking the job and was also met with an answer in the negative . " i have a contract at arsenal until 2005 which i will fulfill .
the club will not release me because our season starts in four weeks .
i will decide in october what i will do afterwards .
i am not available right now , " wenger told german soccer magazine kicker . with denmark 's morten olsen , guus hiddink of the netherlands and germans lothar matthäus and volker finke making up a reserve squad of people who might actually be interested in the job , it seems that otto rehhagel is the last remaining top-drawer choice on offer . world cup choice for king otto bildunterschrift : will otto want to challenge for the world cup with his european champions ?
but even though the greeks have made it plain they will not stand in his way , there is the question of whether otto the great will want to return to his native country to lead it into the 2006 world cup - or take his newly crowned greek champions to germany in two years ' time and try his luck on his home soil . the 65-year-old german arrived in greece in 2001 and extended his contract for another two years shortly before this year 's european championships .
gagatsis recently reiterated his confidence that rehhagel will stay in greece .
" from countless conversations i have had with him , i conclude that he wants to stay on the greek bench and offer his services for another two years , " he said . faces from past hold the key however , recent reports suggest that rehhagel has already met with franz beckenbauer for the first round of discussions which could lead to his installation as germany coach . but former world cup-winning player beckenbauer , who is also a dfb vice-president and chief of the world cup organizing committee , fired rehaggel from munich for incompetence eight years ago , and otto may have reservations about being reunited with the mostly bavarian hierarchy at the dfb . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer body on borrowed time after emergency summit a crucial meeting to heal the rifts in the german football association on monday diverted a potential rebellion but failed to fully resolve the major problems threatening the future of german soccer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.07.2004 experts : poverty in germany set to rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say they 'll bear the brunt social organizations are warning of a dramatic increase in the number of poor people in germany as a result of welfare reforms being implemented next year .
children will be among the worst affected by the changes . families that rely on food banks because they 've run out of money for groceries ; children that go to school sick because their parents ca n't afford a visit to the doctor ; cities that are divided along lines of social class and income .
it 's not the normal picture that comes to mind when imagining life in germany .
but experts are warning that it 's the reality awaiting germany following the implementation of the government 's package of unemployment and social welfare reforms , known as hartz iv . once the new package of laws goes into effect in january 2005 , the number of poor people in germany will increase from 2.8 to 4.5 million , according to an association of german charities . in european countries , poor people are generally seen as those who live on less than half the average national income .
in germany , the average income is roughly € 2,200 -lrb- $ 2,700 -rrb- per month .
but in making their predictions , charitable organizations count the number of people currently living on the lowest level of social welfare assistance . the new law merges social assistance and second tier unemployment payments , meaning those relying on welfare will suddenly have to make do with far less money .
after hartz iv , they 'll have a monthly income of € 345 minus rent payments , which will be covered by the state . visible consequences werner hesse , the head of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charitable association told dw-world that this new reality will have visible consequences for all germans , especially if families on welfare are forced to relocate to areas with cheaper rents , creating ghettos of the poor and unemployed . " previously , social classes were mixed and people on benefit lived next to more affluent families , " hesse said .
" but if people have to find cheaper apartments , the population will be more segmented - society will be separated according to who 's wealthy and who 's not . " the german anti-poverty conference predicts that the consolidation of welfare payments will have the most drastic consequences for children , with the number of minors living on social welfare increasing three-fold after hartz iv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unemployed mother browses the job listings " it 's the biggest problem we 're facing , " paul saatkamp , spokesman for the national anti-poverty conference , told dw-world .
" there will be connections with education and health .
socially disadvantaged kids also face disadvantages in school , they tend to get sick more often .
we always hear in this country that people need to have more children , that we need more young people for our economy , but after hartz iv we 'll have 150,000 young people out on the streets with no hope for the future . " saatkamp said that politicians are only paying lip-service to the problems facing germany 's poor youth , and that currently , the political instruments to change their fate do n't exist . " the government is n't listening , " he said , adding that after the government passed it 's unpopular agenda 2010 package of economic and social welfare reforms , attitudes changed .
" after agenda 2010 , it was ' grit your teeth and get on with it . '
the governing parties and the opposition are of the same opinion , which is that these reforms are going to go ahead on the backs of the poor in germany . " necessary evil many politicians and economists in germany say the government has no other choice but to push through welfare cuts and other reforms if the country hopes to get its economy back on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter , the spd 's parliamentary group leader the social democrat 's parliamentary group leader , klaus uwe benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- , recently called for a change in mentality on the cuts in unemployment benefits .

other topics on the agenda include child-care and education . considering the widespread unpopularity of the government 's package of economic , social and health reforms , it comes as little surprise that the spd 's midterm balance is marked by an all-time low in approval ratings .
in a survey conducted by german public broadcaster zdf for its respected political barometer , the spd garnered a mere 25 percent - a loss of two percentage points , and the worst-ever showing for the party in the poll . the rankings of the conservative opposition sister parties cdu and csu remained unchanged at 46 percent .
the junior coalition partner , the greens , gained a single point to reach 12 percent . no quick fix bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuhardenberg palace , where the meeting will take place at a similar meeting in neuhardenberg last year , schröder attempted to combat flagging support by announcing that the spd was pulling forward tax reforms that would put more money back in the pockets of ordinary germans .
but the chancellor 's office denies reports that schröder is aiming to pull another such rabbit out of that hat at this year 's meeting . " the purpose of this gathering is to make clear in everyone 's minds where this cabinet stands two years after being re-elected , and where it 's going , " said schröder 's spokesman , bela anda .
" it 's not an opportunity to present any particular master plan . " however , speculation about magic tricks and master plans is making the rounds in berlin 's political circles .
one such rumor : unemployed educators will be offered jobs in kindergartens , thereby killing the two birds that are unemployment and education with one stone . more investment , not less despite the government 's tight budget restrictions , some spd members are calling for increased investment in communities suffering from the country 's economic downturn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cabinet gathered for open air meetings in the palace gardens last year " an impulse for more investment has to come from neuhardenberg , " said the spd 's parliamentary group deputy , michael müller .
" if not , there 's a danger that the labor market reforms wo n't lead quickly enough to a reduction in unemployment . " representatives from germany 's eastern states , which are disproportionately affected by high unemployment , are also calling for ministers to announce a renewed commitment to the rebuilding of the regions in the former east germany . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd and unions fail to agree on reforms germany 's ruling social democrats failed to bridge differences over the government 's reform plans with organized labor monday .

in germany , the average income is roughly € 2,200 -lrb- $ 2,700 -rrb- per month .
but in making their predictions , charitable organizations count the number of people currently living on the lowest level of social welfare assistance . the new law merges social assistance and second tier unemployment payments , meaning those relying on welfare will suddenly have to make do with far less money .
after hartz iv , they 'll have a monthly income of € 345 minus rent payments , which will be covered by the state . visible consequences werner hesse , the head of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charitable association told dw-world that this new reality will have visible consequences for all germans , especially if families on welfare are forced to relocate to areas with cheaper rents , creating ghettos of the poor and unemployed . " previously , social classes were mixed and people on benefit lived next to more affluent families , " hesse said .
" but if people have to find cheaper apartments , the population will be more segmented - society will be separated according to who 's wealthy and who 's not . " the german anti-poverty conference predicts that the consolidation of welfare payments will have the most drastic consequences for children , with the number of minors living on social welfare increasing three-fold after hartz iv .

" the court is convinced that it is neither desirable , nor even possible as matters stand , to answer in the abstract the question whether the unborn child is a person for the purposes of article 2 " of the european convention on human rights , it said . the case involved thi-nho vo , a 36-year-old of vietnamese origin , who lost her baby in 1991 after a patient mix-up in which hospital staff in the city of lyon confused her with another woman who was to have an intrauterine contraceptive device removed . the erroneous surgery led to the rupture of the water sac protecting the female fetus , forcing the doctor to order an emergency abortion . after taking the hospital to court on manslaughter charges and losing in france , thi-nho 's lawyer lodged the case at the european court of human rights , arguing that the fetus was entitled to protection under the european convention article upholding a right to life . but in its ruling , decided by 14 judges to three , the court decided that such protection could not be extended to fetuses .
german judge georg ress dissented from the majority opinion . it added that it believed the matter would have been better addressed in a civil lawsuit rather than a criminal one , had thi-nho started such a case before a four-year statute of limitations that existed at the time . while calling the case a " tragedy , " abortion rights groups welcomed the court 's decision .

in april 1994 , the bvg decided that cannabis possession in small quantities for occasional personal consumption should not be treated as a criminal offence .
however , after struggling to find a consensus on how much hash constitutes a " small " quantity and how often is " occasional use , " the bvg had decided the simplest solution would be to re-criminalize these gray areas .

the study also found that cannabis has a low dependency rate of one to two percent among all users .
when presented to the bvg in 1994 , the study helped in the decision to decriminalize the possession of small quantities of the drug .

in april 1994 , the bvg decided that cannabis possession in small quantities for occasional personal consumption should not be treated as a criminal offence .
however , after struggling to find a consensus on how much hash constitutes a " small " quantity and how often is " occasional use , " the bvg had decided the simplest solution would be to re-criminalize these gray areas .
greens call for review jerzy montag , the green party ’ s speaker on legal issues in the bundestag , demanded a review of the judgment .
" hashish is no more dangerous than nicotine and alcohol .
therefore , hashish consumers might not be in any more danger than a smoker or a heavy drinker . "
the christian social union ’ s health minister werner schnappauf held a different view " the gossip around cannabis as a supposedly harmless drug has led to a dangerous increase in youngsters ’ consumption , " he told reporters .
this playing down of the drug is irresponsible , explained schnappauf and he warned that a new ' entrance culture ' where youngsters would try other drugs after smoking dope would be the result of liberalization .
experts ' study show risk factor low however , three leading european experts on addiction , who had been charged by the federal health ministry to compile definitive information on the effects of cannabis , came to the conclusion that cannabis consumption was far less risky than first thought .
despite an estimated three million users , fatalities attributed to hashish were lower than the 40,000 deaths through alcohol every year .
the study also found that cannabis has a low dependency rate of one to two percent among all users .
when presented to the bvg in 1994 , the study helped in the decision to decriminalize the possession of small quantities of the drug .
but when reviewing the situation , the bvg concluded that the claim that there had been no deaths through cannabis use was unsubstantiated and that the drug remained a risk to youngsters who could still damage themselves while under the influence of the drug , while not actually being harmed by the drug itself . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green party wants to legalize the green germany ’ s green party is making the legalization of marijuana part of their campaign platform this year .

in april 1994 , the bvg decided that cannabis possession in small quantities for occasional personal consumption should not be treated as a criminal offence .
however , after struggling to find a consensus on how much hash constitutes a " small " quantity and how often is " occasional use , " the bvg had decided the simplest solution would be to re-criminalize these gray areas .
greens call for review jerzy montag , the green party ’ s speaker on legal issues in the bundestag , demanded a review of the judgment .
" hashish is no more dangerous than nicotine and alcohol .
therefore , hashish consumers might not be in any more danger than a smoker or a heavy drinker . "
the christian social union ’ s health minister werner schnappauf held a different view " the gossip around cannabis as a supposedly harmless drug has led to a dangerous increase in youngsters ’ consumption , " he told reporters .
this playing down of the drug is irresponsible , explained schnappauf and he warned that a new ' entrance culture ' where youngsters would try other drugs after smoking dope would be the result of liberalization .
experts ' study show risk factor low however , three leading european experts on addiction , who had been charged by the federal health ministry to compile definitive information on the effects of cannabis , came to the conclusion that cannabis consumption was far less risky than first thought .
despite an estimated three million users , fatalities attributed to hashish were lower than the 40,000 deaths through alcohol every year .
the study also found that cannabis has a low dependency rate of one to two percent among all users .
when presented to the bvg in 1994 , the study helped in the decision to decriminalize the possession of small quantities of the drug .
but when reviewing the situation , the bvg concluded that the claim that there had been no deaths through cannabis use was unsubstantiated and that the drug remained a risk to youngsters who could still damage themselves while under the influence of the drug , while not actually being harmed by the drug itself . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green party wants to legalize the green germany ’ s green party is making the legalization of marijuana part of their campaign platform this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.07.2004 experts : poverty in germany set to rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say they 'll bear the brunt social organizations are warning of a dramatic increase in the number of poor people in germany as a result of welfare reforms being implemented next year .
children will be among the worst affected by the changes . families that rely on food banks because they 've run out of money for groceries ; children that go to school sick because their parents ca n't afford a visit to the doctor ; cities that are divided along lines of social class and income .
it 's not the normal picture that comes to mind when imagining life in germany .
but experts are warning that it 's the reality awaiting germany following the implementation of the government 's package of unemployment and social welfare reforms , known as hartz iv . once the new package of laws goes into effect in january 2005 , the number of poor people in germany will increase from 2.8 to 4.5 million , according to an association of german charities . in european countries , poor people are generally seen as those who live on less than half the average national income .
in germany , the average income is roughly € 2,200 -lrb- $ 2,700 -rrb- per month .
but in making their predictions , charitable organizations count the number of people currently living on the lowest level of social welfare assistance . the new law merges social assistance and second tier unemployment payments , meaning those relying on welfare will suddenly have to make do with far less money .
after hartz iv , they 'll have a monthly income of € 345 minus rent payments , which will be covered by the state . visible consequences werner hesse , the head of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charitable association told dw-world that this new reality will have visible consequences for all germans , especially if families on welfare are forced to relocate to areas with cheaper rents , creating ghettos of the poor and unemployed . " previously , social classes were mixed and people on benefit lived next to more affluent families , " hesse said .
" but if people have to find cheaper apartments , the population will be more segmented - society will be separated according to who 's wealthy and who 's not . " the german anti-poverty conference predicts that the consolidation of welfare payments will have the most drastic consequences for children , with the number of minors living on social welfare increasing three-fold after hartz iv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unemployed mother browses the job listings " it 's the biggest problem we 're facing , " paul saatkamp , spokesman for the national anti-poverty conference , told dw-world .
" there will be connections with education and health .
socially disadvantaged kids also face disadvantages in school , they tend to get sick more often .
we always hear in this country that people need to have more children , that we need more young people for our economy , but after hartz iv we 'll have 150,000 young people out on the streets with no hope for the future . " saatkamp said that politicians are only paying lip-service to the problems facing germany 's poor youth , and that currently , the political instruments to change their fate do n't exist . " the government is n't listening , " he said , adding that after the government passed it 's unpopular agenda 2010 package of economic and social welfare reforms , attitudes changed .
" after agenda 2010 , it was ' grit your teeth and get on with it . '
the governing parties and the opposition are of the same opinion , which is that these reforms are going to go ahead on the backs of the poor in germany . " necessary evil many politicians and economists in germany say the government has no other choice but to push through welfare cuts and other reforms if the country hopes to get its economy back on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter , the spd 's parliamentary group leader the social democrat 's parliamentary group leader , klaus uwe benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- , recently called for a change in mentality on the cuts in unemployment benefits . " we should n't be paying money for doing nothing , " benneter said , adding that the new welfare rules under hartz iv need to be taken on as a " giant task for all of society . " but even leading german researchers in germany who see the positive aspects of hartz iv say that too much is being asked of people who are going to have to get by on too little . thomas kieselbach , who chairs the scientific committee on unemployment and health for the international commission on occupational health , said he approves of the new , more proactive measures to fight long-term unemployment , such as more intensive career counseling in the early stages of unemployment . but the bremen university professor told dw-world that the psychological impact on the millions of unemployed who 'll suddenly see a drastic reduction in their financial support will have long-term consequences . " if you look at the development of countries that have already been through this process in the 90 's , then germany will likely follow with an increase in social inequality , " kieselbach said .
" this could lead to a deeper cleavage between social strata in our society , and there 's an increased potential for social conflict . " negative image change these social changes are unlikely to go unnoticed by the international community .
paul saatkamp of the national anti-poverty conference said germany can expect its image abroad to change if nothing is done to combat the increasing social exclusion of the nation 's poor . " after the reforms , we 'll have the argument that we had to keep in step with globalization , that the social welfare system we had before was impossible to maintain , " saatkamp said .
" but the image of germany as a country with a social conscience is only going to get worse .

in april 1994 , the bvg decided that cannabis possession in small quantities for occasional personal consumption should not be treated as a criminal offence .
however , after struggling to find a consensus on how much hash constitutes a " small " quantity and how often is " occasional use , " the bvg had decided the simplest solution would be to re-criminalize these gray areas .
greens call for review jerzy montag , the green party ’ s speaker on legal issues in the bundestag , demanded a review of the judgment .
" hashish is no more dangerous than nicotine and alcohol .
therefore , hashish consumers might not be in any more danger than a smoker or a heavy drinker . "
the christian social union ’ s health minister werner schnappauf held a different view " the gossip around cannabis as a supposedly harmless drug has led to a dangerous increase in youngsters ’ consumption , " he told reporters .
this playing down of the drug is irresponsible , explained schnappauf and he warned that a new ' entrance culture ' where youngsters would try other drugs after smoking dope would be the result of liberalization .
experts ' study show risk factor low however , three leading european experts on addiction , who had been charged by the federal health ministry to compile definitive information on the effects of cannabis , came to the conclusion that cannabis consumption was far less risky than first thought .
despite an estimated three million users , fatalities attributed to hashish were lower than the 40,000 deaths through alcohol every year .
the study also found that cannabis has a low dependency rate of one to two percent among all users .
when presented to the bvg in 1994 , the study helped in the decision to decriminalize the possession of small quantities of the drug .
but when reviewing the situation , the bvg concluded that the claim that there had been no deaths through cannabis use was unsubstantiated and that the drug remained a risk to youngsters who could still damage themselves while under the influence of the drug , while not actually being harmed by the drug itself . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green party wants to legalize the green germany ’ s green party is making the legalization of marijuana part of their campaign platform this year .

but movie industry representatives say things are improving . bett oder knast - bed or jail - is the choice a young woman gives to her boyfriend , who neglects her because he 's spending all of his time illegally downloading movies from the internet . german movie goers have been chuckling about the spot for months now , but its creators find the problem anything but funny . according to a report by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- to be published monday , illegal movie downloading is increasing faster in europe than anywhere else : of the eight countries with the highest number of movie pirates in 2003 , six were in europe , the international herald tribune reported .
germany came in second , behind the united states . between january and august 2003 , about two million germans illegally downloaded 13.3 million movies , causing damages worth hundreds of million euros to the movie industry . " we really felt it last year , " johannes klingsporn , the executive director of the association of film distributors -lrb- vdf -rrb- told dw-world . successful publicity campaign but a campaign called " web pirates are criminals , " which is co-sponsored by the vdf as well as the association of movie theaters -lrb- hdf -rrb- and the multiplex association cineropa , has helped greatly to combat the problem , klingsporn said . funded by the german federal film board -lrb- ffa -rrb- , the movie industry is using the publicity campaign to fight back .
it 's running spots in movie theatres and on television , distributing flyers and even putting up posters on the walls of bathrooms in restaurants and cafes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a " web pirates wanted " poster is part of the campaign starting in july , the campaign will also tour around germany with a reconstructed jail cell to show people where they might end up if they download movies illegally . a nationwide raid on 800 apartments in mid-march - the biggest anywhere in the world so far , according to klingsporn - dealt a hard blow to web pirates .
it significantly reduced the amount of illegal downloads and increased video rentals at stores by up to 50 percent . " the quality of pirated movies has worsened significantly , " klingsporn said .
" we believe that we 're on the right track . " software piracy another problem meanwhile , another recent survey has showed that about 36 percent of software installed on computers worldwide in 2003 was pirated , representing a loss of about $ 29 billion -lrb- € 23.4 billion -rrb- to companies . the survey , conducted by research firm international data corp. for the business software alliance -lrb- bsa -rrb- , included a broader range of software than previous reports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pirated software program the study found that while $ 80 billion worth of software was installed on computers worldwide last year , only $ 51 billion worth was legally purchased . " software piracy continues to be a major challenge for economies worldwide , " said robert holleyman , president and chief executive of bsa . western europe 's percentage of illegally copied software was 36 percent , leading to losses of $ 9.6 billion .
in north america , losses were pegged at $ 7.2 billion and the piracy rate was 23 percent , the survey found . the losses were greatest in the united states with $ 6.5 billion .
in germany , the losses amounted to $ 1.9 billion . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german music industry wins first court case against music pirates music labels clamping down on music pirates scored their first victory in germany on tuesday .

but movie industry representatives say things are improving . bett oder knast - bed or jail - is the choice a young woman gives to her boyfriend , who neglects her because he 's spending all of his time illegally downloading movies from the internet . german movie goers have been chuckling about the spot for months now , but its creators find the problem anything but funny . according to a report by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- to be published monday , illegal movie downloading is increasing faster in europe than anywhere else : of the eight countries with the highest number of movie pirates in 2003 , six were in europe , the international herald tribune reported .
germany came in second , behind the united states . between january and august 2003 , about two million germans illegally downloaded 13.3 million movies , causing damages worth hundreds of million euros to the movie industry . " we really felt it last year , " johannes klingsporn , the executive director of the association of film distributors -lrb- vdf -rrb- told dw-world . successful publicity campaign but a campaign called " web pirates are criminals , " which is co-sponsored by the vdf as well as the association of movie theaters -lrb- hdf -rrb- and the multiplex association cineropa , has helped greatly to combat the problem , klingsporn said . funded by the german federal film board -lrb- ffa -rrb- , the movie industry is using the publicity campaign to fight back .
it 's running spots in movie theatres and on television , distributing flyers and even putting up posters on the walls of bathrooms in restaurants and cafes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a " web pirates wanted " poster is part of the campaign starting in july , the campaign will also tour around germany with a reconstructed jail cell to show people where they might end up if they download movies illegally . a nationwide raid on 800 apartments in mid-march - the biggest anywhere in the world so far , according to klingsporn - dealt a hard blow to web pirates .
it significantly reduced the amount of illegal downloads and increased video rentals at stores by up to 50 percent . " the quality of pirated movies has worsened significantly , " klingsporn said .
" we believe that we 're on the right track . " software piracy another problem meanwhile , another recent survey has showed that about 36 percent of software installed on computers worldwide in 2003 was pirated , representing a loss of about $ 29 billion -lrb- € 23.4 billion -rrb- to companies . the survey , conducted by research firm international data corp. for the business software alliance -lrb- bsa -rrb- , included a broader range of software than previous reports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pirated software program the study found that while $ 80 billion worth of software was installed on computers worldwide last year , only $ 51 billion worth was legally purchased . " software piracy continues to be a major challenge for economies worldwide , " said robert holleyman , president and chief executive of bsa . western europe 's percentage of illegally copied software was 36 percent , leading to losses of $ 9.6 billion .
in north america , losses were pegged at $ 7.2 billion and the piracy rate was 23 percent , the survey found . the losses were greatest in the united states with $ 6.5 billion .
in germany , the losses amounted to $ 1.9 billion . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german music industry wins first court case against music pirates music labels clamping down on music pirates scored their first victory in germany on tuesday .

in april 1994 , the bvg decided that cannabis possession in small quantities for occasional personal consumption should not be treated as a criminal offence .
however , after struggling to find a consensus on how much hash constitutes a " small " quantity and how often is " occasional use , " the bvg had decided the simplest solution would be to re-criminalize these gray areas .
greens call for review jerzy montag , the green party ’ s speaker on legal issues in the bundestag , demanded a review of the judgment .
" hashish is no more dangerous than nicotine and alcohol .
therefore , hashish consumers might not be in any more danger than a smoker or a heavy drinker . "
the christian social union ’ s health minister werner schnappauf held a different view " the gossip around cannabis as a supposedly harmless drug has led to a dangerous increase in youngsters ’ consumption , " he told reporters .
this playing down of the drug is irresponsible , explained schnappauf and he warned that a new ' entrance culture ' where youngsters would try other drugs after smoking dope would be the result of liberalization .
experts ' study show risk factor low however , three leading european experts on addiction , who had been charged by the federal health ministry to compile definitive information on the effects of cannabis , came to the conclusion that cannabis consumption was far less risky than first thought .
despite an estimated three million users , fatalities attributed to hashish were lower than the 40,000 deaths through alcohol every year .
the study also found that cannabis has a low dependency rate of one to two percent among all users .
when presented to the bvg in 1994 , the study helped in the decision to decriminalize the possession of small quantities of the drug .
but when reviewing the situation , the bvg concluded that the claim that there had been no deaths through cannabis use was unsubstantiated and that the drug remained a risk to youngsters who could still damage themselves while under the influence of the drug , while not actually being harmed by the drug itself . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green party wants to legalize the green germany ’ s green party is making the legalization of marijuana part of their campaign platform this year .

members have passed laws on labor reform and immigration . the german parliament 's upper house , the bundesrat , convenes for the last time before its summer break on friday with a packed agenda to work through .
members of the body , which represents germany 's federal states , face discussion and decision on 99 drafts for laws and regulations including the highly contentious issues of job market reform and immigration policy - both of which have already been through tough negotiation sessions . also on the agenda were greenhouse gas emission trading , education , and a controversial can deposit plan . opposition to the government 's labor reforms , which was expected to be the primary sticking point on the busy schedule , was overcome early in the session . welfare reform made law the bundesrat has now made law the recently approved changes to the country 's unemployment and social welfare systems which are scheduled to take effect in january .
it will mark the first reduction of benefits since the second world war .
with agreement on both sides of the house for the most important part of the government 's labor reform plan , this can be seen as an important victory for the governing social democratic-green coalition . the social democrats and the greens may still face a hard time over the proposed fifty-hour working week , billed as the latest remedy for the country 's high unemployment , which has already raised heckles ahead of the bundesrat 's final session . final hurdle for immigration law the upper house also passed germany 's first law on immigration , which will go into effect on jan .
1 , 2005 .
the law comes after years of heated discussion , negotiation and sometimes vitiolic mud-slinging . the far-reaching legislation , which which was passed by the lower house at the beginning of july , aims to ease the entry of highly qualified immigrants and promote their integration into german society . it almost went down to defeat due to security measures that were added to it in the wake of the march 11 bombings in madrid , but a compromise was eventually found . the subject of greenhouse gas emission trading will also be tackled .
germany received a partial approval of its national emissions trading plan by the european commission on thursday .
the new plan is expected to encourage the modernization of the country 's power plants .
but for the german plans to be passed as law , the bundesrat must approve the proposal with an absolute majority . alcopop tax vetoed for the second time , the bundesrat vetoed a government proposal to raise taxes on so-called alcopops , sweetened drinks with high alcohol content that have proved very popular with young people .
the government proposed in may a tax of between 80 and 90 cents per bottle to reduce sales to youth which have boomed over the last year . despite the veto , it is expected that the bill will return to a special session of the bundestag , where it will likely pass with a necessary majority of 301 votes .

other topics on the agenda include child-care and education . considering the widespread unpopularity of the government 's package of economic , social and health reforms , it comes as little surprise that the spd 's midterm balance is marked by an all-time low in approval ratings .
in a survey conducted by german public broadcaster zdf for its respected political barometer , the spd garnered a mere 25 percent - a loss of two percentage points , and the worst-ever showing for the party in the poll . the rankings of the conservative opposition sister parties cdu and csu remained unchanged at 46 percent .
the junior coalition partner , the greens , gained a single point to reach 12 percent . no quick fix bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuhardenberg palace , where the meeting will take place at a similar meeting in neuhardenberg last year , schröder attempted to combat flagging support by announcing that the spd was pulling forward tax reforms that would put more money back in the pockets of ordinary germans .
but the chancellor 's office denies reports that schröder is aiming to pull another such rabbit out of that hat at this year 's meeting . " the purpose of this gathering is to make clear in everyone 's minds where this cabinet stands two years after being re-elected , and where it 's going , " said schröder 's spokesman , bela anda .
" it 's not an opportunity to present any particular master plan . " however , speculation about magic tricks and master plans is making the rounds in berlin 's political circles .
one such rumor : unemployed educators will be offered jobs in kindergartens , thereby killing the two birds that are unemployment and education with one stone . more investment , not less despite the government 's tight budget restrictions , some spd members are calling for increased investment in communities suffering from the country 's economic downturn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cabinet gathered for open air meetings in the palace gardens last year " an impulse for more investment has to come from neuhardenberg , " said the spd 's parliamentary group deputy , michael müller .
" if not , there 's a danger that the labor market reforms wo n't lead quickly enough to a reduction in unemployment . " representatives from germany 's eastern states , which are disproportionately affected by high unemployment , are also calling for ministers to announce a renewed commitment to the rebuilding of the regions in the former east germany . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd and unions fail to agree on reforms germany 's ruling social democrats failed to bridge differences over the government 's reform plans with organized labor monday .

" the court is convinced that it is neither desirable , nor even possible as matters stand , to answer in the abstract the question whether the unborn child is a person for the purposes of article 2 " of the european convention on human rights , it said . the case involved thi-nho vo , a 36-year-old of vietnamese origin , who lost her baby in 1991 after a patient mix-up in which hospital staff in the city of lyon confused her with another woman who was to have an intrauterine contraceptive device removed . the erroneous surgery led to the rupture of the water sac protecting the female fetus , forcing the doctor to order an emergency abortion . after taking the hospital to court on manslaughter charges and losing in france , thi-nho 's lawyer lodged the case at the european court of human rights , arguing that the fetus was entitled to protection under the european convention article upholding a right to life . but in its ruling , decided by 14 judges to three , the court decided that such protection could not be extended to fetuses .
german judge georg ress dissented from the majority opinion . it added that it believed the matter would have been better addressed in a civil lawsuit rather than a criminal one , had thi-nho started such a case before a four-year statute of limitations that existed at the time . while calling the case a " tragedy , " abortion rights groups welcomed the court 's decision . " this court ruling represents a victory for women ’ s rights and for everyone who provides medical services related to unwanted pregnancy , " said vicky claeys , the regional director of the international planned parenthood federation ’ s european network -lrb- ippf en -rrb- .
" opposition to reproductive rights is on the rise in europe , so today ’ s decision is a firm reinforcement of a woman ’ s legal right to choose . " but abortion opponents criticized the court 's decision not to clarify whether a fetus was a person or not . " the judges decided not to decide anything , " said claudia kaminski , who chairs the " federal association right to life , " an umbrella organization of anti-abortion groups .

but movie industry representatives say things are improving . bett oder knast - bed or jail - is the choice a young woman gives to her boyfriend , who neglects her because he 's spending all of his time illegally downloading movies from the internet . german movie goers have been chuckling about the spot for months now , but its creators find the problem anything but funny . according to a report by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- to be published monday , illegal movie downloading is increasing faster in europe than anywhere else : of the eight countries with the highest number of movie pirates in 2003 , six were in europe , the international herald tribune reported .
germany came in second , behind the united states . between january and august 2003 , about two million germans illegally downloaded 13.3 million movies , causing damages worth hundreds of million euros to the movie industry . " we really felt it last year , " johannes klingsporn , the executive director of the association of film distributors -lrb- vdf -rrb- told dw-world . successful publicity campaign but a campaign called " web pirates are criminals , " which is co-sponsored by the vdf as well as the association of movie theaters -lrb- hdf -rrb- and the multiplex association cineropa , has helped greatly to combat the problem , klingsporn said . funded by the german federal film board -lrb- ffa -rrb- , the movie industry is using the publicity campaign to fight back .
it 's running spots in movie theatres and on television , distributing flyers and even putting up posters on the walls of bathrooms in restaurants and cafes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a " web pirates wanted " poster is part of the campaign starting in july , the campaign will also tour around germany with a reconstructed jail cell to show people where they might end up if they download movies illegally . a nationwide raid on 800 apartments in mid-march - the biggest anywhere in the world so far , according to klingsporn - dealt a hard blow to web pirates .
it significantly reduced the amount of illegal downloads and increased video rentals at stores by up to 50 percent . " the quality of pirated movies has worsened significantly , " klingsporn said .
" we believe that we 're on the right track . " software piracy another problem meanwhile , another recent survey has showed that about 36 percent of software installed on computers worldwide in 2003 was pirated , representing a loss of about $ 29 billion -lrb- € 23.4 billion -rrb- to companies . the survey , conducted by research firm international data corp. for the business software alliance -lrb- bsa -rrb- , included a broader range of software than previous reports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pirated software program the study found that while $ 80 billion worth of software was installed on computers worldwide last year , only $ 51 billion worth was legally purchased . " software piracy continues to be a major challenge for economies worldwide , " said robert holleyman , president and chief executive of bsa . western europe 's percentage of illegally copied software was 36 percent , leading to losses of $ 9.6 billion .
in north america , losses were pegged at $ 7.2 billion and the piracy rate was 23 percent , the survey found . the losses were greatest in the united states with $ 6.5 billion .
in germany , the losses amounted to $ 1.9 billion . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german music industry wins first court case against music pirates music labels clamping down on music pirates scored their first victory in germany on tuesday .

members have passed laws on labor reform and immigration . the german parliament 's upper house , the bundesrat , convenes for the last time before its summer break on friday with a packed agenda to work through .
members of the body , which represents germany 's federal states , face discussion and decision on 99 drafts for laws and regulations including the highly contentious issues of job market reform and immigration policy - both of which have already been through tough negotiation sessions . also on the agenda were greenhouse gas emission trading , education , and a controversial can deposit plan . opposition to the government 's labor reforms , which was expected to be the primary sticking point on the busy schedule , was overcome early in the session . welfare reform made law the bundesrat has now made law the recently approved changes to the country 's unemployment and social welfare systems which are scheduled to take effect in january .
it will mark the first reduction of benefits since the second world war .
with agreement on both sides of the house for the most important part of the government 's labor reform plan , this can be seen as an important victory for the governing social democratic-green coalition . the social democrats and the greens may still face a hard time over the proposed fifty-hour working week , billed as the latest remedy for the country 's high unemployment , which has already raised heckles ahead of the bundesrat 's final session . final hurdle for immigration law the upper house also passed germany 's first law on immigration , which will go into effect on jan .
1 , 2005 .
the law comes after years of heated discussion , negotiation and sometimes vitiolic mud-slinging . the far-reaching legislation , which which was passed by the lower house at the beginning of july , aims to ease the entry of highly qualified immigrants and promote their integration into german society . it almost went down to defeat due to security measures that were added to it in the wake of the march 11 bombings in madrid , but a compromise was eventually found . the subject of greenhouse gas emission trading will also be tackled .
germany received a partial approval of its national emissions trading plan by the european commission on thursday .
the new plan is expected to encourage the modernization of the country 's power plants .
but for the german plans to be passed as law , the bundesrat must approve the proposal with an absolute majority . alcopop tax vetoed for the second time , the bundesrat vetoed a government proposal to raise taxes on so-called alcopops , sweetened drinks with high alcohol content that have proved very popular with young people .
the government proposed in may a tax of between 80 and 90 cents per bottle to reduce sales to youth which have boomed over the last year . despite the veto , it is expected that the bill will return to a special session of the bundestag , where it will likely pass with a necessary majority of 301 votes .

other topics on the agenda include child-care and education . considering the widespread unpopularity of the government 's package of economic , social and health reforms , it comes as little surprise that the spd 's midterm balance is marked by an all-time low in approval ratings .
in a survey conducted by german public broadcaster zdf for its respected political barometer , the spd garnered a mere 25 percent - a loss of two percentage points , and the worst-ever showing for the party in the poll . the rankings of the conservative opposition sister parties cdu and csu remained unchanged at 46 percent .

" in case the coach cites personal reasons and wants to disrupt his cooperation with us , we ca n't keep him willy-nilly , " gagatsis was quoted on the website of radio station flash .
" in such a case we must discuss it with him and see what can be done .
i ca n't rule out anything , " he said . rehhagel steered the greek team to victory in the european championships in portugal , even though the greeks were considered rank outsiders at the start of the tournament .
he is now the main man in the frame for rudi völler 's old job after the germany coach resigned in the wake of his own team 's dismal elimination from the contest 's first round . rehhagel , the one-time coach of werder bremen , bayern munich and kaiserslautern , may soon be the only man in consideration after a series of high profile trainers turned down the job . top coaches go cold on german job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ottmar hitzfeld wants a break after leaving bayern munich another former bayern munich coach , ottmar hitzfeld , was odds-on to take over .
but just as the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- was ready to appoint him as successor , he declared himself unwilling to take on the responsibility .
the offer then went out to former candidate christoph daum who said " thanks , but no thanks , " preferring to stay in turkey .
then it was revealed that franz beckenbauer , president of bayern munich and a heavyweight at the dfb , had sounded out arsenal 's french mastermind arsene wenger about taking the job and was also met with an answer in the negative . " i have a contract at arsenal until 2005 which i will fulfill .

i am not available right now , " wenger told german soccer magazine kicker . with denmark 's morten olsen , guus hiddink of the netherlands and germans lothar matthäus and volker finke making up a reserve squad of people who might actually be interested in the job , it seems that otto rehhagel is the last remaining top-drawer choice on offer . world cup choice for king otto bildunterschrift : will otto want to challenge for the world cup with his european champions ?
but even though the greeks have made it plain they will not stand in his way , there is the question of whether otto the great will want to return to his native country to lead it into the 2006 world cup - or take his newly crowned greek champions to germany in two years ' time and try his luck on his home soil . the 65-year-old german arrived in greece in 2001 and extended his contract for another two years shortly before this year 's european championships .
gagatsis recently reiterated his confidence that rehhagel will stay in greece .
" from countless conversations i have had with him , i conclude that he wants to stay on the greek bench and offer his services for another two years , " he said . faces from past hold the key however , recent reports suggest that rehhagel has already met with franz beckenbauer for the first round of discussions which could lead to his installation as germany coach . but former world cup-winning player beckenbauer , who is also a dfb vice-president and chief of the world cup organizing committee , fired rehaggel from munich for incompetence eight years ago , and otto may have reservations about being reunited with the mostly bavarian hierarchy at the dfb . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer body on borrowed time after emergency summit a crucial meeting to heal the rifts in the german football association on monday diverted a potential rebellion but failed to fully resolve the major problems threatening the future of german soccer .

in april 1994 , the bvg decided that cannabis possession in small quantities for occasional personal consumption should not be treated as a criminal offence .
however , after struggling to find a consensus on how much hash constitutes a " small " quantity and how often is " occasional use , " the bvg had decided the simplest solution would be to re-criminalize these gray areas .
greens call for review jerzy montag , the green party ’ s speaker on legal issues in the bundestag , demanded a review of the judgment .
" hashish is no more dangerous than nicotine and alcohol .
therefore , hashish consumers might not be in any more danger than a smoker or a heavy drinker . "
the christian social union ’ s health minister werner schnappauf held a different view " the gossip around cannabis as a supposedly harmless drug has led to a dangerous increase in youngsters ’ consumption , " he told reporters .
this playing down of the drug is irresponsible , explained schnappauf and he warned that a new ' entrance culture ' where youngsters would try other drugs after smoking dope would be the result of liberalization .
experts ' study show risk factor low however , three leading european experts on addiction , who had been charged by the federal health ministry to compile definitive information on the effects of cannabis , came to the conclusion that cannabis consumption was far less risky than first thought .
despite an estimated three million users , fatalities attributed to hashish were lower than the 40,000 deaths through alcohol every year .
the study also found that cannabis has a low dependency rate of one to two percent among all users .
when presented to the bvg in 1994 , the study helped in the decision to decriminalize the possession of small quantities of the drug .
but when reviewing the situation , the bvg concluded that the claim that there had been no deaths through cannabis use was unsubstantiated and that the drug remained a risk to youngsters who could still damage themselves while under the influence of the drug , while not actually being harmed by the drug itself . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green party wants to legalize the green germany ’ s green party is making the legalization of marijuana part of their campaign platform this year .

children will be among the worst affected by the changes . families that rely on food banks because they 've run out of money for groceries ; children that go to school sick because their parents ca n't afford a visit to the doctor ; cities that are divided along lines of social class and income .
it 's not the normal picture that comes to mind when imagining life in germany .
but experts are warning that it 's the reality awaiting germany following the implementation of the government 's package of unemployment and social welfare reforms , known as hartz iv . once the new package of laws goes into effect in january 2005 , the number of poor people in germany will increase from 2.8 to 4.5 million , according to an association of german charities . in european countries , poor people are generally seen as those who live on less than half the average national income .
in germany , the average income is roughly € 2,200 -lrb- $ 2,700 -rrb- per month .
but in making their predictions , charitable organizations count the number of people currently living on the lowest level of social welfare assistance . the new law merges social assistance and second tier unemployment payments , meaning those relying on welfare will suddenly have to make do with far less money .
after hartz iv , they 'll have a monthly income of € 345 minus rent payments , which will be covered by the state . visible consequences werner hesse , the head of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charitable association told dw-world that this new reality will have visible consequences for all germans , especially if families on welfare are forced to relocate to areas with cheaper rents , creating ghettos of the poor and unemployed . " previously , social classes were mixed and people on benefit lived next to more affluent families , " hesse said .
" but if people have to find cheaper apartments , the population will be more segmented - society will be separated according to who 's wealthy and who 's not . " the german anti-poverty conference predicts that the consolidation of welfare payments will have the most drastic consequences for children , with the number of minors living on social welfare increasing three-fold after hartz iv .

" saatkamp said that politicians are only paying lip-service to the problems facing germany 's poor youth , and that currently , the political instruments to change their fate do n't exist . " the government is n't listening , " he said , adding that after the government passed it 's unpopular agenda 2010 package of economic and social welfare reforms , attitudes changed .
" after agenda 2010 , it was ' grit your teeth and get on with it . '

" but even leading german researchers in germany who see the positive aspects of hartz iv say that too much is being asked of people who are going to have to get by on too little . thomas kieselbach , who chairs the scientific committee on unemployment and health for the international commission on occupational health , said he approves of the new , more proactive measures to fight long-term unemployment , such as more intensive career counseling in the early stages of unemployment . but the bremen university professor told dw-world that the psychological impact on the millions of unemployed who 'll suddenly see a drastic reduction in their financial support will have long-term consequences . " if you look at the development of countries that have already been through this process in the 90 's , then germany will likely follow with an increase in social inequality , " kieselbach said .
" this could lead to a deeper cleavage between social strata in our society , and there 's an increased potential for social conflict . " negative image change these social changes are unlikely to go unnoticed by the international community .
paul saatkamp of the national anti-poverty conference said germany can expect its image abroad to change if nothing is done to combat the increasing social exclusion of the nation 's poor .

in april 1994 , the bvg decided that cannabis possession in small quantities for occasional personal consumption should not be treated as a criminal offence .
however , after struggling to find a consensus on how much hash constitutes a " small " quantity and how often is " occasional use , " the bvg had decided the simplest solution would be to re-criminalize these gray areas .

" hashish is no more dangerous than nicotine and alcohol .
therefore , hashish consumers might not be in any more danger than a smoker or a heavy drinker . "

this playing down of the drug is irresponsible , explained schnappauf and he warned that a new ' entrance culture ' where youngsters would try other drugs after smoking dope would be the result of liberalization .
experts ' study show risk factor low however , three leading european experts on addiction , who had been charged by the federal health ministry to compile definitive information on the effects of cannabis , came to the conclusion that cannabis consumption was far less risky than first thought .
despite an estimated three million users , fatalities attributed to hashish were lower than the 40,000 deaths through alcohol every year .
the study also found that cannabis has a low dependency rate of one to two percent among all users .
when presented to the bvg in 1994 , the study helped in the decision to decriminalize the possession of small quantities of the drug .
but when reviewing the situation , the bvg concluded that the claim that there had been no deaths through cannabis use was unsubstantiated and that the drug remained a risk to youngsters who could still damage themselves while under the influence of the drug , while not actually being harmed by the drug itself . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green party wants to legalize the green germany ’ s green party is making the legalization of marijuana part of their campaign platform this year .

other topics on the agenda include child-care and education . considering the widespread unpopularity of the government 's package of economic , social and health reforms , it comes as little surprise that the spd 's midterm balance is marked by an all-time low in approval ratings .
in a survey conducted by german public broadcaster zdf for its respected political barometer , the spd garnered a mere 25 percent - a loss of two percentage points , and the worst-ever showing for the party in the poll . the rankings of the conservative opposition sister parties cdu and csu remained unchanged at 46 percent .
the junior coalition partner , the greens , gained a single point to reach 12 percent . no quick fix bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuhardenberg palace , where the meeting will take place at a similar meeting in neuhardenberg last year , schröder attempted to combat flagging support by announcing that the spd was pulling forward tax reforms that would put more money back in the pockets of ordinary germans .
but the chancellor 's office denies reports that schröder is aiming to pull another such rabbit out of that hat at this year 's meeting . " the purpose of this gathering is to make clear in everyone 's minds where this cabinet stands two years after being re-elected , and where it 's going , " said schröder 's spokesman , bela anda .
" it 's not an opportunity to present any particular master plan . " however , speculation about magic tricks and master plans is making the rounds in berlin 's political circles .
one such rumor : unemployed educators will be offered jobs in kindergartens , thereby killing the two birds that are unemployment and education with one stone . more investment , not less despite the government 's tight budget restrictions , some spd members are calling for increased investment in communities suffering from the country 's economic downturn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cabinet gathered for open air meetings in the palace gardens last year " an impulse for more investment has to come from neuhardenberg , " said the spd 's parliamentary group deputy , michael müller .
" if not , there 's a danger that the labor market reforms wo n't lead quickly enough to a reduction in unemployment . " representatives from germany 's eastern states , which are disproportionately affected by high unemployment , are also calling for ministers to announce a renewed commitment to the rebuilding of the regions in the former east germany . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd and unions fail to agree on reforms germany 's ruling social democrats failed to bridge differences over the government 's reform plans with organized labor monday .

children will be among the worst affected by the changes . families that rely on food banks because they 've run out of money for groceries ; children that go to school sick because their parents ca n't afford a visit to the doctor ; cities that are divided along lines of social class and income .
it 's not the normal picture that comes to mind when imagining life in germany .
but experts are warning that it 's the reality awaiting germany following the implementation of the government 's package of unemployment and social welfare reforms , known as hartz iv . once the new package of laws goes into effect in january 2005 , the number of poor people in germany will increase from 2.8 to 4.5 million , according to an association of german charities . in european countries , poor people are generally seen as those who live on less than half the average national income .
in germany , the average income is roughly € 2,200 -lrb- $ 2,700 -rrb- per month .
but in making their predictions , charitable organizations count the number of people currently living on the lowest level of social welfare assistance . the new law merges social assistance and second tier unemployment payments , meaning those relying on welfare will suddenly have to make do with far less money .
after hartz iv , they 'll have a monthly income of € 345 minus rent payments , which will be covered by the state . visible consequences werner hesse , the head of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charitable association told dw-world that this new reality will have visible consequences for all germans , especially if families on welfare are forced to relocate to areas with cheaper rents , creating ghettos of the poor and unemployed . " previously , social classes were mixed and people on benefit lived next to more affluent families , " hesse said .
" but if people have to find cheaper apartments , the population will be more segmented - society will be separated according to who 's wealthy and who 's not . " the german anti-poverty conference predicts that the consolidation of welfare payments will have the most drastic consequences for children , with the number of minors living on social welfare increasing three-fold after hartz iv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unemployed mother browses the job listings " it 's the biggest problem we 're facing , " paul saatkamp , spokesman for the national anti-poverty conference , told dw-world .
" there will be connections with education and health .
socially disadvantaged kids also face disadvantages in school , they tend to get sick more often .
we always hear in this country that people need to have more children , that we need more young people for our economy , but after hartz iv we 'll have 150,000 young people out on the streets with no hope for the future . " saatkamp said that politicians are only paying lip-service to the problems facing germany 's poor youth , and that currently , the political instruments to change their fate do n't exist . " the government is n't listening , " he said , adding that after the government passed it 's unpopular agenda 2010 package of economic and social welfare reforms , attitudes changed .
" after agenda 2010 , it was ' grit your teeth and get on with it . '
the governing parties and the opposition are of the same opinion , which is that these reforms are going to go ahead on the backs of the poor in germany . " necessary evil many politicians and economists in germany say the government has no other choice but to push through welfare cuts and other reforms if the country hopes to get its economy back on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter , the spd 's parliamentary group leader the social democrat 's parliamentary group leader , klaus uwe benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- , recently called for a change in mentality on the cuts in unemployment benefits . " we should n't be paying money for doing nothing , " benneter said , adding that the new welfare rules under hartz iv need to be taken on as a " giant task for all of society . " but even leading german researchers in germany who see the positive aspects of hartz iv say that too much is being asked of people who are going to have to get by on too little . thomas kieselbach , who chairs the scientific committee on unemployment and health for the international commission on occupational health , said he approves of the new , more proactive measures to fight long-term unemployment , such as more intensive career counseling in the early stages of unemployment . but the bremen university professor told dw-world that the psychological impact on the millions of unemployed who 'll suddenly see a drastic reduction in their financial support will have long-term consequences . " if you look at the development of countries that have already been through this process in the 90 's , then germany will likely follow with an increase in social inequality , " kieselbach said .
" this could lead to a deeper cleavage between social strata in our society , and there 's an increased potential for social conflict . " negative image change these social changes are unlikely to go unnoticed by the international community .
paul saatkamp of the national anti-poverty conference said germany can expect its image abroad to change if nothing is done to combat the increasing social exclusion of the nation 's poor . " after the reforms , we 'll have the argument that we had to keep in step with globalization , that the social welfare system we had before was impossible to maintain , " saatkamp said .

" in case the coach cites personal reasons and wants to disrupt his cooperation with us , we ca n't keep him willy-nilly , " gagatsis was quoted on the website of radio station flash .

other topics on the agenda include child-care and education . considering the widespread unpopularity of the government 's package of economic , social and health reforms , it comes as little surprise that the spd 's midterm balance is marked by an all-time low in approval ratings .
in a survey conducted by german public broadcaster zdf for its respected political barometer , the spd garnered a mere 25 percent - a loss of two percentage points , and the worst-ever showing for the party in the poll . the rankings of the conservative opposition sister parties cdu and csu remained unchanged at 46 percent .
the junior coalition partner , the greens , gained a single point to reach 12 percent . no quick fix bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuhardenberg palace , where the meeting will take place at a similar meeting in neuhardenberg last year , schröder attempted to combat flagging support by announcing that the spd was pulling forward tax reforms that would put more money back in the pockets of ordinary germans .
but the chancellor 's office denies reports that schröder is aiming to pull another such rabbit out of that hat at this year 's meeting . " the purpose of this gathering is to make clear in everyone 's minds where this cabinet stands two years after being re-elected , and where it 's going , " said schröder 's spokesman , bela anda .
" it 's not an opportunity to present any particular master plan . " however , speculation about magic tricks and master plans is making the rounds in berlin 's political circles .
one such rumor : unemployed educators will be offered jobs in kindergartens , thereby killing the two birds that are unemployment and education with one stone . more investment , not less despite the government 's tight budget restrictions , some spd members are calling for increased investment in communities suffering from the country 's economic downturn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cabinet gathered for open air meetings in the palace gardens last year " an impulse for more investment has to come from neuhardenberg , " said the spd 's parliamentary group deputy , michael müller .
" if not , there 's a danger that the labor market reforms wo n't lead quickly enough to a reduction in unemployment . " representatives from germany 's eastern states , which are disproportionately affected by high unemployment , are also calling for ministers to announce a renewed commitment to the rebuilding of the regions in the former east germany . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd and unions fail to agree on reforms germany 's ruling social democrats failed to bridge differences over the government 's reform plans with organized labor monday .

german judge georg ress dissented from the majority opinion . it added that it believed the matter would have been better addressed in a civil lawsuit rather than a criminal one , had thi-nho started such a case before a four-year statute of limitations that existed at the time . while calling the case a " tragedy , " abortion rights groups welcomed the court 's decision . " this court ruling represents a victory for women ’ s rights and for everyone who provides medical services related to unwanted pregnancy , " said vicky claeys , the regional director of the international planned parenthood federation ’ s european network -lrb- ippf en -rrb- .
" opposition to reproductive rights is on the rise in europe , so today ’ s decision is a firm reinforcement of a woman ’ s legal right to choose . " but abortion opponents criticized the court 's decision not to clarify whether a fetus was a person or not . " the judges decided not to decide anything , " said claudia kaminski , who chairs the " federal association right to life , " an umbrella organization of anti-abortion groups .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.07.2004 experts : poverty in germany set to rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say they 'll bear the brunt social organizations are warning of a dramatic increase in the number of poor people in germany as a result of welfare reforms being implemented next year .
children will be among the worst affected by the changes . families that rely on food banks because they 've run out of money for groceries ; children that go to school sick because their parents ca n't afford a visit to the doctor ; cities that are divided along lines of social class and income .
it 's not the normal picture that comes to mind when imagining life in germany .
but experts are warning that it 's the reality awaiting germany following the implementation of the government 's package of unemployment and social welfare reforms , known as hartz iv . once the new package of laws goes into effect in january 2005 , the number of poor people in germany will increase from 2.8 to 4.5 million , according to an association of german charities . in european countries , poor people are generally seen as those who live on less than half the average national income .
in germany , the average income is roughly € 2,200 -lrb- $ 2,700 -rrb- per month .
but in making their predictions , charitable organizations count the number of people currently living on the lowest level of social welfare assistance . the new law merges social assistance and second tier unemployment payments , meaning those relying on welfare will suddenly have to make do with far less money .
after hartz iv , they 'll have a monthly income of € 345 minus rent payments , which will be covered by the state . visible consequences werner hesse , the head of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charitable association told dw-world that this new reality will have visible consequences for all germans , especially if families on welfare are forced to relocate to areas with cheaper rents , creating ghettos of the poor and unemployed . " previously , social classes were mixed and people on benefit lived next to more affluent families , " hesse said .
" but if people have to find cheaper apartments , the population will be more segmented - society will be separated according to who 's wealthy and who 's not . " the german anti-poverty conference predicts that the consolidation of welfare payments will have the most drastic consequences for children , with the number of minors living on social welfare increasing three-fold after hartz iv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unemployed mother browses the job listings " it 's the biggest problem we 're facing , " paul saatkamp , spokesman for the national anti-poverty conference , told dw-world .
" there will be connections with education and health .
socially disadvantaged kids also face disadvantages in school , they tend to get sick more often .
we always hear in this country that people need to have more children , that we need more young people for our economy , but after hartz iv we 'll have 150,000 young people out on the streets with no hope for the future . " saatkamp said that politicians are only paying lip-service to the problems facing germany 's poor youth , and that currently , the political instruments to change their fate do n't exist . " the government is n't listening , " he said , adding that after the government passed it 's unpopular agenda 2010 package of economic and social welfare reforms , attitudes changed .
" after agenda 2010 , it was ' grit your teeth and get on with it . '
the governing parties and the opposition are of the same opinion , which is that these reforms are going to go ahead on the backs of the poor in germany . " necessary evil many politicians and economists in germany say the government has no other choice but to push through welfare cuts and other reforms if the country hopes to get its economy back on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter , the spd 's parliamentary group leader the social democrat 's parliamentary group leader , klaus uwe benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- , recently called for a change in mentality on the cuts in unemployment benefits . " we should n't be paying money for doing nothing , " benneter said , adding that the new welfare rules under hartz iv need to be taken on as a " giant task for all of society . " but even leading german researchers in germany who see the positive aspects of hartz iv say that too much is being asked of people who are going to have to get by on too little . thomas kieselbach , who chairs the scientific committee on unemployment and health for the international commission on occupational health , said he approves of the new , more proactive measures to fight long-term unemployment , such as more intensive career counseling in the early stages of unemployment . but the bremen university professor told dw-world that the psychological impact on the millions of unemployed who 'll suddenly see a drastic reduction in their financial support will have long-term consequences . " if you look at the development of countries that have already been through this process in the 90 's , then germany will likely follow with an increase in social inequality , " kieselbach said .
" this could lead to a deeper cleavage between social strata in our society , and there 's an increased potential for social conflict . " negative image change these social changes are unlikely to go unnoticed by the international community .
paul saatkamp of the national anti-poverty conference said germany can expect its image abroad to change if nothing is done to combat the increasing social exclusion of the nation 's poor . " after the reforms , we 'll have the argument that we had to keep in step with globalization , that the social welfare system we had before was impossible to maintain , " saatkamp said .

in april 1994 , the bvg decided that cannabis possession in small quantities for occasional personal consumption should not be treated as a criminal offence .
however , after struggling to find a consensus on how much hash constitutes a " small " quantity and how often is " occasional use , " the bvg had decided the simplest solution would be to re-criminalize these gray areas .

" hashish is no more dangerous than nicotine and alcohol .
therefore , hashish consumers might not be in any more danger than a smoker or a heavy drinker . "
the christian social union ’ s health minister werner schnappauf held a different view " the gossip around cannabis as a supposedly harmless drug has led to a dangerous increase in youngsters ’ consumption , " he told reporters .
this playing down of the drug is irresponsible , explained schnappauf and he warned that a new ' entrance culture ' where youngsters would try other drugs after smoking dope would be the result of liberalization .
experts ' study show risk factor low however , three leading european experts on addiction , who had been charged by the federal health ministry to compile definitive information on the effects of cannabis , came to the conclusion that cannabis consumption was far less risky than first thought .
despite an estimated three million users , fatalities attributed to hashish were lower than the 40,000 deaths through alcohol every year .
the study also found that cannabis has a low dependency rate of one to two percent among all users .
when presented to the bvg in 1994 , the study helped in the decision to decriminalize the possession of small quantities of the drug .
but when reviewing the situation , the bvg concluded that the claim that there had been no deaths through cannabis use was unsubstantiated and that the drug remained a risk to youngsters who could still damage themselves while under the influence of the drug , while not actually being harmed by the drug itself . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green party wants to legalize the green germany ’ s green party is making the legalization of marijuana part of their campaign platform this year .

in april 1994 , the bvg decided that cannabis possession in small quantities for occasional personal consumption should not be treated as a criminal offence .

children will be among the worst affected by the changes . families that rely on food banks because they 've run out of money for groceries ; children that go to school sick because their parents ca n't afford a visit to the doctor ; cities that are divided along lines of social class and income .
it 's not the normal picture that comes to mind when imagining life in germany .
but experts are warning that it 's the reality awaiting germany following the implementation of the government 's package of unemployment and social welfare reforms , known as hartz iv . once the new package of laws goes into effect in january 2005 , the number of poor people in germany will increase from 2.8 to 4.5 million , according to an association of german charities . in european countries , poor people are generally seen as those who live on less than half the average national income .
in germany , the average income is roughly € 2,200 -lrb- $ 2,700 -rrb- per month .
but in making their predictions , charitable organizations count the number of people currently living on the lowest level of social welfare assistance . the new law merges social assistance and second tier unemployment payments , meaning those relying on welfare will suddenly have to make do with far less money .
after hartz iv , they 'll have a monthly income of € 345 minus rent payments , which will be covered by the state . visible consequences werner hesse , the head of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charitable association told dw-world that this new reality will have visible consequences for all germans , especially if families on welfare are forced to relocate to areas with cheaper rents , creating ghettos of the poor and unemployed . " previously , social classes were mixed and people on benefit lived next to more affluent families , " hesse said .
" but if people have to find cheaper apartments , the population will be more segmented - society will be separated according to who 's wealthy and who 's not . " the german anti-poverty conference predicts that the consolidation of welfare payments will have the most drastic consequences for children , with the number of minors living on social welfare increasing three-fold after hartz iv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unemployed mother browses the job listings " it 's the biggest problem we 're facing , " paul saatkamp , spokesman for the national anti-poverty conference , told dw-world .
" there will be connections with education and health .
socially disadvantaged kids also face disadvantages in school , they tend to get sick more often .
we always hear in this country that people need to have more children , that we need more young people for our economy , but after hartz iv we 'll have 150,000 young people out on the streets with no hope for the future . " saatkamp said that politicians are only paying lip-service to the problems facing germany 's poor youth , and that currently , the political instruments to change their fate do n't exist . " the government is n't listening , " he said , adding that after the government passed it 's unpopular agenda 2010 package of economic and social welfare reforms , attitudes changed .
" after agenda 2010 , it was ' grit your teeth and get on with it . '
the governing parties and the opposition are of the same opinion , which is that these reforms are going to go ahead on the backs of the poor in germany . " necessary evil many politicians and economists in germany say the government has no other choice but to push through welfare cuts and other reforms if the country hopes to get its economy back on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter , the spd 's parliamentary group leader the social democrat 's parliamentary group leader , klaus uwe benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- , recently called for a change in mentality on the cuts in unemployment benefits . " we should n't be paying money for doing nothing , " benneter said , adding that the new welfare rules under hartz iv need to be taken on as a " giant task for all of society . " but even leading german researchers in germany who see the positive aspects of hartz iv say that too much is being asked of people who are going to have to get by on too little . thomas kieselbach , who chairs the scientific committee on unemployment and health for the international commission on occupational health , said he approves of the new , more proactive measures to fight long-term unemployment , such as more intensive career counseling in the early stages of unemployment . but the bremen university professor told dw-world that the psychological impact on the millions of unemployed who 'll suddenly see a drastic reduction in their financial support will have long-term consequences . " if you look at the development of countries that have already been through this process in the 90 's , then germany will likely follow with an increase in social inequality , " kieselbach said .
" this could lead to a deeper cleavage between social strata in our society , and there 's an increased potential for social conflict . " negative image change these social changes are unlikely to go unnoticed by the international community .
paul saatkamp of the national anti-poverty conference said germany can expect its image abroad to change if nothing is done to combat the increasing social exclusion of the nation 's poor . " after the reforms , we 'll have the argument that we had to keep in step with globalization , that the social welfare system we had before was impossible to maintain , " saatkamp said .

other topics on the agenda include child-care and education . considering the widespread unpopularity of the government 's package of economic , social and health reforms , it comes as little surprise that the spd 's midterm balance is marked by an all-time low in approval ratings .
in a survey conducted by german public broadcaster zdf for its respected political barometer , the spd garnered a mere 25 percent - a loss of two percentage points , and the worst-ever showing for the party in the poll . the rankings of the conservative opposition sister parties cdu and csu remained unchanged at 46 percent .
the junior coalition partner , the greens , gained a single point to reach 12 percent . no quick fix bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuhardenberg palace , where the meeting will take place at a similar meeting in neuhardenberg last year , schröder attempted to combat flagging support by announcing that the spd was pulling forward tax reforms that would put more money back in the pockets of ordinary germans .
but the chancellor 's office denies reports that schröder is aiming to pull another such rabbit out of that hat at this year 's meeting . " the purpose of this gathering is to make clear in everyone 's minds where this cabinet stands two years after being re-elected , and where it 's going , " said schröder 's spokesman , bela anda .
" it 's not an opportunity to present any particular master plan . " however , speculation about magic tricks and master plans is making the rounds in berlin 's political circles .
one such rumor : unemployed educators will be offered jobs in kindergartens , thereby killing the two birds that are unemployment and education with one stone . more investment , not less despite the government 's tight budget restrictions , some spd members are calling for increased investment in communities suffering from the country 's economic downturn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cabinet gathered for open air meetings in the palace gardens last year " an impulse for more investment has to come from neuhardenberg , " said the spd 's parliamentary group deputy , michael müller .
" if not , there 's a danger that the labor market reforms wo n't lead quickly enough to a reduction in unemployment .

in april 1994 , the bvg decided that cannabis possession in small quantities for occasional personal consumption should not be treated as a criminal offence .
however , after struggling to find a consensus on how much hash constitutes a " small " quantity and how often is " occasional use , " the bvg had decided the simplest solution would be to re-criminalize these gray areas .
greens call for review jerzy montag , the green party ’ s speaker on legal issues in the bundestag , demanded a review of the judgment .
" hashish is no more dangerous than nicotine and alcohol .
therefore , hashish consumers might not be in any more danger than a smoker or a heavy drinker . "
the christian social union ’ s health minister werner schnappauf held a different view " the gossip around cannabis as a supposedly harmless drug has led to a dangerous increase in youngsters ’ consumption , " he told reporters .
this playing down of the drug is irresponsible , explained schnappauf and he warned that a new ' entrance culture ' where youngsters would try other drugs after smoking dope would be the result of liberalization .
experts ' study show risk factor low however , three leading european experts on addiction , who had been charged by the federal health ministry to compile definitive information on the effects of cannabis , came to the conclusion that cannabis consumption was far less risky than first thought .
despite an estimated three million users , fatalities attributed to hashish were lower than the 40,000 deaths through alcohol every year .
the study also found that cannabis has a low dependency rate of one to two percent among all users .
when presented to the bvg in 1994 , the study helped in the decision to decriminalize the possession of small quantities of the drug .
but when reviewing the situation , the bvg concluded that the claim that there had been no deaths through cannabis use was unsubstantiated and that the drug remained a risk to youngsters who could still damage themselves while under the influence of the drug , while not actually being harmed by the drug itself . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green party wants to legalize the green germany ’ s green party is making the legalization of marijuana part of their campaign platform this year .

but movie industry representatives say things are improving . bett oder knast - bed or jail - is the choice a young woman gives to her boyfriend , who neglects her because he 's spending all of his time illegally downloading movies from the internet . german movie goers have been chuckling about the spot for months now , but its creators find the problem anything but funny . according to a report by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- to be published monday , illegal movie downloading is increasing faster in europe than anywhere else : of the eight countries with the highest number of movie pirates in 2003 , six were in europe , the international herald tribune reported .
germany came in second , behind the united states . between january and august 2003 , about two million germans illegally downloaded 13.3 million movies , causing damages worth hundreds of million euros to the movie industry . " we really felt it last year , " johannes klingsporn , the executive director of the association of film distributors -lrb- vdf -rrb- told dw-world . successful publicity campaign but a campaign called " web pirates are criminals , " which is co-sponsored by the vdf as well as the association of movie theaters -lrb- hdf -rrb- and the multiplex association cineropa , has helped greatly to combat the problem , klingsporn said . funded by the german federal film board -lrb- ffa -rrb- , the movie industry is using the publicity campaign to fight back .
it 's running spots in movie theatres and on television , distributing flyers and even putting up posters on the walls of bathrooms in restaurants and cafes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a " web pirates wanted " poster is part of the campaign starting in july , the campaign will also tour around germany with a reconstructed jail cell to show people where they might end up if they download movies illegally . a nationwide raid on 800 apartments in mid-march - the biggest anywhere in the world so far , according to klingsporn - dealt a hard blow to web pirates .
it significantly reduced the amount of illegal downloads and increased video rentals at stores by up to 50 percent . " the quality of pirated movies has worsened significantly , " klingsporn said .
" we believe that we 're on the right track . " software piracy another problem meanwhile , another recent survey has showed that about 36 percent of software installed on computers worldwide in 2003 was pirated , representing a loss of about $ 29 billion -lrb- € 23.4 billion -rrb- to companies . the survey , conducted by research firm international data corp. for the business software alliance -lrb- bsa -rrb- , included a broader range of software than previous reports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pirated software program the study found that while $ 80 billion worth of software was installed on computers worldwide last year , only $ 51 billion worth was legally purchased . " software piracy continues to be a major challenge for economies worldwide , " said robert holleyman , president and chief executive of bsa . western europe 's percentage of illegally copied software was 36 percent , leading to losses of $ 9.6 billion .
in north america , losses were pegged at $ 7.2 billion and the piracy rate was 23 percent , the survey found . the losses were greatest in the united states with $ 6.5 billion .

other topics on the agenda include child-care and education . considering the widespread unpopularity of the government 's package of economic , social and health reforms , it comes as little surprise that the spd 's midterm balance is marked by an all-time low in approval ratings .
in a survey conducted by german public broadcaster zdf for its respected political barometer , the spd garnered a mere 25 percent - a loss of two percentage points , and the worst-ever showing for the party in the poll . the rankings of the conservative opposition sister parties cdu and csu remained unchanged at 46 percent .

" the purpose of this gathering is to make clear in everyone 's minds where this cabinet stands two years after being re-elected , and where it 's going , " said schröder 's spokesman , bela anda .

but movie industry representatives say things are improving . bett oder knast - bed or jail - is the choice a young woman gives to her boyfriend , who neglects her because he 's spending all of his time illegally downloading movies from the internet . german movie goers have been chuckling about the spot for months now , but its creators find the problem anything but funny . according to a report by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- to be published monday , illegal movie downloading is increasing faster in europe than anywhere else : of the eight countries with the highest number of movie pirates in 2003 , six were in europe , the international herald tribune reported .
germany came in second , behind the united states . between january and august 2003 , about two million germans illegally downloaded 13.3 million movies , causing damages worth hundreds of million euros to the movie industry . " we really felt it last year , " johannes klingsporn , the executive director of the association of film distributors -lrb- vdf -rrb- told dw-world . successful publicity campaign but a campaign called " web pirates are criminals , " which is co-sponsored by the vdf as well as the association of movie theaters -lrb- hdf -rrb- and the multiplex association cineropa , has helped greatly to combat the problem , klingsporn said . funded by the german federal film board -lrb- ffa -rrb- , the movie industry is using the publicity campaign to fight back .
it 's running spots in movie theatres and on television , distributing flyers and even putting up posters on the walls of bathrooms in restaurants and cafes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a " web pirates wanted " poster is part of the campaign starting in july , the campaign will also tour around germany with a reconstructed jail cell to show people where they might end up if they download movies illegally . a nationwide raid on 800 apartments in mid-march - the biggest anywhere in the world so far , according to klingsporn - dealt a hard blow to web pirates .
it significantly reduced the amount of illegal downloads and increased video rentals at stores by up to 50 percent . " the quality of pirated movies has worsened significantly , " klingsporn said .
" we believe that we 're on the right track . " software piracy another problem meanwhile , another recent survey has showed that about 36 percent of software installed on computers worldwide in 2003 was pirated , representing a loss of about $ 29 billion -lrb- € 23.4 billion -rrb- to companies . the survey , conducted by research firm international data corp. for the business software alliance -lrb- bsa -rrb- , included a broader range of software than previous reports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pirated software program the study found that while $ 80 billion worth of software was installed on computers worldwide last year , only $ 51 billion worth was legally purchased . " software piracy continues to be a major challenge for economies worldwide , " said robert holleyman , president and chief executive of bsa . western europe 's percentage of illegally copied software was 36 percent , leading to losses of $ 9.6 billion .
in north america , losses were pegged at $ 7.2 billion and the piracy rate was 23 percent , the survey found . the losses were greatest in the united states with $ 6.5 billion .
in germany , the losses amounted to $ 1.9 billion . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german music industry wins first court case against music pirates music labels clamping down on music pirates scored their first victory in germany on tuesday .

" in case the coach cites personal reasons and wants to disrupt his cooperation with us , we ca n't keep him willy-nilly , " gagatsis was quoted on the website of radio station flash .

" the court is convinced that it is neither desirable , nor even possible as matters stand , to answer in the abstract the question whether the unborn child is a person for the purposes of article 2 " of the european convention on human rights , it said . the case involved thi-nho vo , a 36-year-old of vietnamese origin , who lost her baby in 1991 after a patient mix-up in which hospital staff in the city of lyon confused her with another woman who was to have an intrauterine contraceptive device removed . the erroneous surgery led to the rupture of the water sac protecting the female fetus , forcing the doctor to order an emergency abortion . after taking the hospital to court on manslaughter charges and losing in france , thi-nho 's lawyer lodged the case at the european court of human rights , arguing that the fetus was entitled to protection under the european convention article upholding a right to life . but in its ruling , decided by 14 judges to three , the court decided that such protection could not be extended to fetuses .
german judge georg ress dissented from the majority opinion . it added that it believed the matter would have been better addressed in a civil lawsuit rather than a criminal one , had thi-nho started such a case before a four-year statute of limitations that existed at the time . while calling the case a " tragedy , " abortion rights groups welcomed the court 's decision . " this court ruling represents a victory for women ’ s rights and for everyone who provides medical services related to unwanted pregnancy , " said vicky claeys , the regional director of the international planned parenthood federation ’ s european network -lrb- ippf en -rrb- .
" opposition to reproductive rights is on the rise in europe , so today ’ s decision is a firm reinforcement of a woman ’ s legal right to choose . " but abortion opponents criticized the court 's decision not to clarify whether a fetus was a person or not . " the judges decided not to decide anything , " said claudia kaminski , who chairs the " federal association right to life , " an umbrella organization of anti-abortion groups .

in april 1994 , the bvg decided that cannabis possession in small quantities for occasional personal consumption should not be treated as a criminal offence .
however , after struggling to find a consensus on how much hash constitutes a " small " quantity and how often is " occasional use , " the bvg had decided the simplest solution would be to re-criminalize these gray areas .
greens call for review jerzy montag , the green party ’ s speaker on legal issues in the bundestag , demanded a review of the judgment .
" hashish is no more dangerous than nicotine and alcohol .
therefore , hashish consumers might not be in any more danger than a smoker or a heavy drinker . "
the christian social union ’ s health minister werner schnappauf held a different view " the gossip around cannabis as a supposedly harmless drug has led to a dangerous increase in youngsters ’ consumption , " he told reporters .
this playing down of the drug is irresponsible , explained schnappauf and he warned that a new ' entrance culture ' where youngsters would try other drugs after smoking dope would be the result of liberalization .
experts ' study show risk factor low however , three leading european experts on addiction , who had been charged by the federal health ministry to compile definitive information on the effects of cannabis , came to the conclusion that cannabis consumption was far less risky than first thought .
despite an estimated three million users , fatalities attributed to hashish were lower than the 40,000 deaths through alcohol every year .
the study also found that cannabis has a low dependency rate of one to two percent among all users .
when presented to the bvg in 1994 , the study helped in the decision to decriminalize the possession of small quantities of the drug .
but when reviewing the situation , the bvg concluded that the claim that there had been no deaths through cannabis use was unsubstantiated and that the drug remained a risk to youngsters who could still damage themselves while under the influence of the drug , while not actually being harmed by the drug itself . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green party wants to legalize the green germany ’ s green party is making the legalization of marijuana part of their campaign platform this year .

in april 1994 , the bvg decided that cannabis possession in small quantities for occasional personal consumption should not be treated as a criminal offence .
however , after struggling to find a consensus on how much hash constitutes a " small " quantity and how often is " occasional use , " the bvg had decided the simplest solution would be to re-criminalize these gray areas .
greens call for review jerzy montag , the green party ’ s speaker on legal issues in the bundestag , demanded a review of the judgment .
" hashish is no more dangerous than nicotine and alcohol .
therefore , hashish consumers might not be in any more danger than a smoker or a heavy drinker . "
the christian social union ’ s health minister werner schnappauf held a different view " the gossip around cannabis as a supposedly harmless drug has led to a dangerous increase in youngsters ’ consumption , " he told reporters .
this playing down of the drug is irresponsible , explained schnappauf and he warned that a new ' entrance culture ' where youngsters would try other drugs after smoking dope would be the result of liberalization .
experts ' study show risk factor low however , three leading european experts on addiction , who had been charged by the federal health ministry to compile definitive information on the effects of cannabis , came to the conclusion that cannabis consumption was far less risky than first thought .
despite an estimated three million users , fatalities attributed to hashish were lower than the 40,000 deaths through alcohol every year .
the study also found that cannabis has a low dependency rate of one to two percent among all users .
when presented to the bvg in 1994 , the study helped in the decision to decriminalize the possession of small quantities of the drug .
but when reviewing the situation , the bvg concluded that the claim that there had been no deaths through cannabis use was unsubstantiated and that the drug remained a risk to youngsters who could still damage themselves while under the influence of the drug , while not actually being harmed by the drug itself . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green party wants to legalize the green germany ’ s green party is making the legalization of marijuana part of their campaign platform this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.07.2004 experts : poverty in germany set to rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say they 'll bear the brunt social organizations are warning of a dramatic increase in the number of poor people in germany as a result of welfare reforms being implemented next year .
children will be among the worst affected by the changes . families that rely on food banks because they 've run out of money for groceries ; children that go to school sick because their parents ca n't afford a visit to the doctor ; cities that are divided along lines of social class and income .
it 's not the normal picture that comes to mind when imagining life in germany .
but experts are warning that it 's the reality awaiting germany following the implementation of the government 's package of unemployment and social welfare reforms , known as hartz iv . once the new package of laws goes into effect in january 2005 , the number of poor people in germany will increase from 2.8 to 4.5 million , according to an association of german charities . in european countries , poor people are generally seen as those who live on less than half the average national income .
in germany , the average income is roughly € 2,200 -lrb- $ 2,700 -rrb- per month .
but in making their predictions , charitable organizations count the number of people currently living on the lowest level of social welfare assistance . the new law merges social assistance and second tier unemployment payments , meaning those relying on welfare will suddenly have to make do with far less money .
after hartz iv , they 'll have a monthly income of € 345 minus rent payments , which will be covered by the state . visible consequences werner hesse , the head of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charitable association told dw-world that this new reality will have visible consequences for all germans , especially if families on welfare are forced to relocate to areas with cheaper rents , creating ghettos of the poor and unemployed . " previously , social classes were mixed and people on benefit lived next to more affluent families , " hesse said .
" but if people have to find cheaper apartments , the population will be more segmented - society will be separated according to who 's wealthy and who 's not . " the german anti-poverty conference predicts that the consolidation of welfare payments will have the most drastic consequences for children , with the number of minors living on social welfare increasing three-fold after hartz iv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unemployed mother browses the job listings " it 's the biggest problem we 're facing , " paul saatkamp , spokesman for the national anti-poverty conference , told dw-world .
" there will be connections with education and health .
socially disadvantaged kids also face disadvantages in school , they tend to get sick more often .
we always hear in this country that people need to have more children , that we need more young people for our economy , but after hartz iv we 'll have 150,000 young people out on the streets with no hope for the future . " saatkamp said that politicians are only paying lip-service to the problems facing germany 's poor youth , and that currently , the political instruments to change their fate do n't exist . " the government is n't listening , " he said , adding that after the government passed it 's unpopular agenda 2010 package of economic and social welfare reforms , attitudes changed .
" after agenda 2010 , it was ' grit your teeth and get on with it . '
the governing parties and the opposition are of the same opinion , which is that these reforms are going to go ahead on the backs of the poor in germany . " necessary evil many politicians and economists in germany say the government has no other choice but to push through welfare cuts and other reforms if the country hopes to get its economy back on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter , the spd 's parliamentary group leader the social democrat 's parliamentary group leader , klaus uwe benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- , recently called for a change in mentality on the cuts in unemployment benefits . " we should n't be paying money for doing nothing , " benneter said , adding that the new welfare rules under hartz iv need to be taken on as a " giant task for all of society . " but even leading german researchers in germany who see the positive aspects of hartz iv say that too much is being asked of people who are going to have to get by on too little . thomas kieselbach , who chairs the scientific committee on unemployment and health for the international commission on occupational health , said he approves of the new , more proactive measures to fight long-term unemployment , such as more intensive career counseling in the early stages of unemployment . but the bremen university professor told dw-world that the psychological impact on the millions of unemployed who 'll suddenly see a drastic reduction in their financial support will have long-term consequences . " if you look at the development of countries that have already been through this process in the 90 's , then germany will likely follow with an increase in social inequality , " kieselbach said .
" this could lead to a deeper cleavage between social strata in our society , and there 's an increased potential for social conflict . " negative image change these social changes are unlikely to go unnoticed by the international community .
paul saatkamp of the national anti-poverty conference said germany can expect its image abroad to change if nothing is done to combat the increasing social exclusion of the nation 's poor . " after the reforms , we 'll have the argument that we had to keep in step with globalization , that the social welfare system we had before was impossible to maintain , " saatkamp said .
" but the image of germany as a country with a social conscience is only going to get worse .

german judge georg ress dissented from the majority opinion . it added that it believed the matter would have been better addressed in a civil lawsuit rather than a criminal one , had thi-nho started such a case before a four-year statute of limitations that existed at the time . while calling the case a " tragedy , " abortion rights groups welcomed the court 's decision .

on wednesday the eu executive approved a package of " aid and trade " measures aimed at ending turkish cypriot isolation following the rejection of a un peace plan by the majority of greek cypriots last april .
however , cypriot foreign minister george iacovou said on thursday that the commission 's motives were " purely political . "
his concerns were echoed by the greek cypriot government spokesperson who said that although the cypriot government is in favor of measures strengthening the economic development of the northern part , some aspects of the plan risk cultivating " divisionist tendencies . "
the commission ’ s proposals were also questioned by the greek and cypriot commissioners , who raised concerns that direct trade between the eu and the turkish cypriot north could lead to a de facto recognition of the breakaway state .
responding to these fears , enlargement commissioner günter verheugen stressed on wednesday that trade facilitation with the northern turkish cypriot part will not lead to its recognition by the eu .

"
vowing to do " all i can to stop them , " he said that those who committed these crimes will be punished " with all the rigor of our laws . "
chirac 's speech , his longest and most powerful for some time on domestic french affairs , was made all the more resonant by his choice of venue .
the president had traveled to le chambon-sur-lignon , a small village in south-west france , where the local population had risked their lives to shelter jews from the nazis during the second world war .
he was accompanied by simone veil , a survivor of auschwitz .
the recent rise in anti-semitic and other racist incidents has shocked france and tarnished its image abroad .
but it is not just anti-semitism that 's on the increase : a muslim cemetery in strasbourg came under attack in june and racist slogans have been daubed on mosques .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.07.2004 greeks wo n't prevent " rehakles " returning to germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes otto rehhagel will return and bring his magic touch the greek football federation declared on thursday that it would not stop otto rehhagel from returning to germany to take the job of national coach - if he wants to . one of the main obstacles between otto rehhagel and the job many other international coaches are avoiding like the plague was removed on thursday when the greek football federation announced that it would not force the country 's euro 2004-winning coach to honor his contract , thus paving the way for " rehakles " to take the reigns of the german team - if he chooses to . greek football president vassilis gagatsis was quoted as saying that , although rehhagel 's contract does not expire until after the 2006 world cup in germany , king otto - just one of the terms of endearment he 's known by in greece - could relinquish his greek throne under certain circumstances . " in case the coach cites personal reasons and wants to disrupt his cooperation with us , we ca n't keep him willy-nilly , " gagatsis was quoted on the website of radio station flash .
" in such a case we must discuss it with him and see what can be done .
i ca n't rule out anything , " he said . rehhagel steered the greek team to victory in the european championships in portugal , even though the greeks were considered rank outsiders at the start of the tournament .
he is now the main man in the frame for rudi völler 's old job after the germany coach resigned in the wake of his own team 's dismal elimination from the contest 's first round . rehhagel , the one-time coach of werder bremen , bayern munich and kaiserslautern , may soon be the only man in consideration after a series of high profile trainers turned down the job . top coaches go cold on german job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ottmar hitzfeld wants a break after leaving bayern munich another former bayern munich coach , ottmar hitzfeld , was odds-on to take over .
but just as the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- was ready to appoint him as successor , he declared himself unwilling to take on the responsibility .
the offer then went out to former candidate christoph daum who said " thanks , but no thanks , " preferring to stay in turkey .
then it was revealed that franz beckenbauer , president of bayern munich and a heavyweight at the dfb , had sounded out arsenal 's french mastermind arsene wenger about taking the job and was also met with an answer in the negative . " i have a contract at arsenal until 2005 which i will fulfill .
the club will not release me because our season starts in four weeks .
i will decide in october what i will do afterwards .
i am not available right now , " wenger told german soccer magazine kicker . with denmark 's morten olsen , guus hiddink of the netherlands and germans lothar matthäus and volker finke making up a reserve squad of people who might actually be interested in the job , it seems that otto rehhagel is the last remaining top-drawer choice on offer . world cup choice for king otto bildunterschrift : will otto want to challenge for the world cup with his european champions ?
but even though the greeks have made it plain they will not stand in his way , there is the question of whether otto the great will want to return to his native country to lead it into the 2006 world cup - or take his newly crowned greek champions to germany in two years ' time and try his luck on his home soil . the 65-year-old german arrived in greece in 2001 and extended his contract for another two years shortly before this year 's european championships .
gagatsis recently reiterated his confidence that rehhagel will stay in greece .
" from countless conversations i have had with him , i conclude that he wants to stay on the greek bench and offer his services for another two years , " he said . faces from past hold the key however , recent reports suggest that rehhagel has already met with franz beckenbauer for the first round of discussions which could lead to his installation as germany coach . but former world cup-winning player beckenbauer , who is also a dfb vice-president and chief of the world cup organizing committee , fired rehaggel from munich for incompetence eight years ago , and otto may have reservations about being reunited with the mostly bavarian hierarchy at the dfb . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer body on borrowed time after emergency summit a crucial meeting to heal the rifts in the german football association on monday diverted a potential rebellion but failed to fully resolve the major problems threatening the future of german soccer .

other topics on the agenda include child-care and education . considering the widespread unpopularity of the government 's package of economic , social and health reforms , it comes as little surprise that the spd 's midterm balance is marked by an all-time low in approval ratings .
in a survey conducted by german public broadcaster zdf for its respected political barometer , the spd garnered a mere 25 percent - a loss of two percentage points , and the worst-ever showing for the party in the poll . the rankings of the conservative opposition sister parties cdu and csu remained unchanged at 46 percent .

but the chancellor 's office denies reports that schröder is aiming to pull another such rabbit out of that hat at this year 's meeting . " the purpose of this gathering is to make clear in everyone 's minds where this cabinet stands two years after being re-elected , and where it 's going , " said schröder 's spokesman , bela anda .
" it 's not an opportunity to present any particular master plan . " however , speculation about magic tricks and master plans is making the rounds in berlin 's political circles .
one such rumor : unemployed educators will be offered jobs in kindergartens , thereby killing the two birds that are unemployment and education with one stone . more investment , not less despite the government 's tight budget restrictions , some spd members are calling for increased investment in communities suffering from the country 's economic downturn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cabinet gathered for open air meetings in the palace gardens last year " an impulse for more investment has to come from neuhardenberg , " said the spd 's parliamentary group deputy , michael müller .

other topics on the agenda include child-care and education . considering the widespread unpopularity of the government 's package of economic , social and health reforms , it comes as little surprise that the spd 's midterm balance is marked by an all-time low in approval ratings .
in a survey conducted by german public broadcaster zdf for its respected political barometer , the spd garnered a mere 25 percent - a loss of two percentage points , and the worst-ever showing for the party in the poll . the rankings of the conservative opposition sister parties cdu and csu remained unchanged at 46 percent .

in april 1994 , the bvg decided that cannabis possession in small quantities for occasional personal consumption should not be treated as a criminal offence .
however , after struggling to find a consensus on how much hash constitutes a " small " quantity and how often is " occasional use , " the bvg had decided the simplest solution would be to re-criminalize these gray areas .

experts ' study show risk factor low however , three leading european experts on addiction , who had been charged by the federal health ministry to compile definitive information on the effects of cannabis , came to the conclusion that cannabis consumption was far less risky than first thought .
despite an estimated three million users , fatalities attributed to hashish were lower than the 40,000 deaths through alcohol every year .
the study also found that cannabis has a low dependency rate of one to two percent among all users .
when presented to the bvg in 1994 , the study helped in the decision to decriminalize the possession of small quantities of the drug .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.07.2004 germany cracks down on movie pirates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looks just like the original movies amount for more than a third of illegal downloads by german computer users , putting the country in second place behind the us , according to a new study .
but movie industry representatives say things are improving . bett oder knast - bed or jail - is the choice a young woman gives to her boyfriend , who neglects her because he 's spending all of his time illegally downloading movies from the internet . german movie goers have been chuckling about the spot for months now , but its creators find the problem anything but funny . according to a report by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- to be published monday , illegal movie downloading is increasing faster in europe than anywhere else : of the eight countries with the highest number of movie pirates in 2003 , six were in europe , the international herald tribune reported .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.07.2004 experts : poverty in germany set to rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say they 'll bear the brunt social organizations are warning of a dramatic increase in the number of poor people in germany as a result of welfare reforms being implemented next year .
children will be among the worst affected by the changes . families that rely on food banks because they 've run out of money for groceries ; children that go to school sick because their parents ca n't afford a visit to the doctor ; cities that are divided along lines of social class and income .
it 's not the normal picture that comes to mind when imagining life in germany .
but experts are warning that it 's the reality awaiting germany following the implementation of the government 's package of unemployment and social welfare reforms , known as hartz iv . once the new package of laws goes into effect in january 2005 , the number of poor people in germany will increase from 2.8 to 4.5 million , according to an association of german charities . in european countries , poor people are generally seen as those who live on less than half the average national income .
in germany , the average income is roughly € 2,200 -lrb- $ 2,700 -rrb- per month .
but in making their predictions , charitable organizations count the number of people currently living on the lowest level of social welfare assistance . the new law merges social assistance and second tier unemployment payments , meaning those relying on welfare will suddenly have to make do with far less money .
after hartz iv , they 'll have a monthly income of € 345 minus rent payments , which will be covered by the state . visible consequences werner hesse , the head of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charitable association told dw-world that this new reality will have visible consequences for all germans , especially if families on welfare are forced to relocate to areas with cheaper rents , creating ghettos of the poor and unemployed . " previously , social classes were mixed and people on benefit lived next to more affluent families , " hesse said .
" but if people have to find cheaper apartments , the population will be more segmented - society will be separated according to who 's wealthy and who 's not . " the german anti-poverty conference predicts that the consolidation of welfare payments will have the most drastic consequences for children , with the number of minors living on social welfare increasing three-fold after hartz iv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unemployed mother browses the job listings " it 's the biggest problem we 're facing , " paul saatkamp , spokesman for the national anti-poverty conference , told dw-world .
" there will be connections with education and health .
socially disadvantaged kids also face disadvantages in school , they tend to get sick more often .
we always hear in this country that people need to have more children , that we need more young people for our economy , but after hartz iv we 'll have 150,000 young people out on the streets with no hope for the future . " saatkamp said that politicians are only paying lip-service to the problems facing germany 's poor youth , and that currently , the political instruments to change their fate do n't exist . " the government is n't listening , " he said , adding that after the government passed it 's unpopular agenda 2010 package of economic and social welfare reforms , attitudes changed .
" after agenda 2010 , it was ' grit your teeth and get on with it . '
the governing parties and the opposition are of the same opinion , which is that these reforms are going to go ahead on the backs of the poor in germany . " necessary evil many politicians and economists in germany say the government has no other choice but to push through welfare cuts and other reforms if the country hopes to get its economy back on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus-uwe benneter , the spd 's parliamentary group leader the social democrat 's parliamentary group leader , klaus uwe benneter -lrb- photo -rrb- , recently called for a change in mentality on the cuts in unemployment benefits . " we should n't be paying money for doing nothing , " benneter said , adding that the new welfare rules under hartz iv need to be taken on as a " giant task for all of society . " but even leading german researchers in germany who see the positive aspects of hartz iv say that too much is being asked of people who are going to have to get by on too little . thomas kieselbach , who chairs the scientific committee on unemployment and health for the international commission on occupational health , said he approves of the new , more proactive measures to fight long-term unemployment , such as more intensive career counseling in the early stages of unemployment . but the bremen university professor told dw-world that the psychological impact on the millions of unemployed who 'll suddenly see a drastic reduction in their financial support will have long-term consequences . " if you look at the development of countries that have already been through this process in the 90 's , then germany will likely follow with an increase in social inequality , " kieselbach said .
" this could lead to a deeper cleavage between social strata in our society , and there 's an increased potential for social conflict . " negative image change these social changes are unlikely to go unnoticed by the international community .
paul saatkamp of the national anti-poverty conference said germany can expect its image abroad to change if nothing is done to combat the increasing social exclusion of the nation 's poor . " after the reforms , we 'll have the argument that we had to keep in step with globalization , that the social welfare system we had before was impossible to maintain , " saatkamp said .
" but the image of germany as a country with a social conscience is only going to get worse .

children will be among the worst affected by the changes . families that rely on food banks because they 've run out of money for groceries ; children that go to school sick because their parents ca n't afford a visit to the doctor ; cities that are divided along lines of social class and income .

but in making their predictions , charitable organizations count the number of people currently living on the lowest level of social welfare assistance . the new law merges social assistance and second tier unemployment payments , meaning those relying on welfare will suddenly have to make do with far less money .

pc simon tudor , 33 , dived into freezing waters at aberystwyth harbour early on 2 january last year to rescue the 39-year-old woman .
pc tudor fought a current to swim to the woman , who was barely conscious and sinking beneath the surface .
he was awarded the title of bravest officer in wales at the police federation 's courage awards .
the dyfed-powys officer 's rescue took place during a search for the woman , which began when he and a colleague found a car abandoned at aberystwyth harbour .
a check found it belonged to a woman who had previously tried to kill herself .
by the time i went into the sea , she seemed to have been caught in a tidal flow and had been swept further away pc simon tudor the officers then found clothing and a set of crutches at the end of the jetty .
shortly afterwards , the woman was spotted about 100metres from shore and drifting further out to sea .
after radioing for coastguard support and emergency services back up , pc tudor attached a lifebelt to himself and swam towards her .
" by the time i went into the sea , she seemed to have been caught in a tidal flow and had been swept further away , " he said .
full recovery the safety line was not long enough to reach her , and so pc tudor let go of the line and swam to her .
but by the time he reached her , she was 300 metres from shore and unable to swim for herself .
he was able to bring her ashore and she made a full recovery after being treated for hypothermia .
pc tudor was given his award in a ceremony at the dorchester hotel , london , on thursday evening attended by home secretary david blunkett .
the presentation followed a reception at 10 downing street where pc tudor and 44 other nominees for the awards from england and wales met tony blair .
' highest praise ' pc tudor was among eight regional winners at the annual ceremony , staged to recognise officers who put themselves at risk of death or serious harm whilst performing their duties .
jan berry , chairman of the police federation of england and wales , which organises the police bravery awards , said : " constable tudor deserves the highest praise .
" he acted beyond the call of duty and demonstrated immense courage by risking his own life to save another .
" he is a credit to the police service .
we hope this award goes some way towards recognising his bravery . "
the award was not the first that pc tudor had received for the rescue : in april 2003 , he was awarded a royal humane society bronze medal for saving the woman .

shortly afterwards , the woman was spotted about 100metres from shore and drifting further out to sea .
after radioing for coastguard support and emergency services back up , pc tudor attached a lifebelt to himself and swam towards her .
" by the time i went into the sea , she seemed to have been caught in a tidal flow and had been swept further away , " he said .

he was able to bring her ashore and she made a full recovery after being treated for hypothermia .
pc tudor was given his award in a ceremony at the dorchester hotel , london , on thursday evening attended by home secretary david blunkett .
the presentation followed a reception at 10 downing street where pc tudor and 44 other nominees for the awards from england and wales met tony blair .

jan berry , chairman of the police federation of england and wales , which organises the police bravery awards , said : " constable tudor deserves the highest praise .
" he acted beyond the call of duty and demonstrated immense courage by risking his own life to save another .
" he is a credit to the police service .
we hope this award goes some way towards recognising his bravery . "
the award was not the first that pc tudor had received for the rescue : in april 2003 , he was awarded a royal humane society bronze medal for saving the woman .

but who decides what parts of the extensive elvis archive will be released , and when ?
that 's all right has gone straight to number one in the billboard hot 100 , and looks set to be top in the uk by the end of the week .
it is just the latest in a long line of anniversaries , re-releases , box sets , special dvds and re-mixes - such as a little less conversation , which got to number one in the uk two years ago after being featured in a tv advert for nike .

" one of the dreams at that time was could we get everybody to play that 's all right around the world at the same time to celebrate that magic occasion . "
he said that the success in managing to make this happen - with over 1,250 stations joining in - was " quite staggering . "
die-hard fans mr seemon said it was a " reasonably easy process " to decide what parts of elvis 's back-catalogue to reissue .

market research with so many anniversaries and landmarks providing opportunities to re-release records , there is seemingly great potential for elvis overkill .

a cd of a broadway elvis musical is in the pipeline for the next year " if the commentary starts to get a bit hostile , then you take notice - all record companies do , " he said .

he stressed that the company did try to make sure there was no repetition of specialist releases , but that greatest hits compilations would be put out every three to four years .

" so when we 're planning forward , the committee really tries to get the best out of these type of products on a global basis .
that 's really where the strategy is . "
market research with so many anniversaries and landmarks providing opportunities to re-release records , there is seemingly great potential for elvis overkill .
but mr seemon said that when this happens , the media and the fans let them know .
a cd of a broadway elvis musical is in the pipeline for the next year " if the commentary starts to get a bit hostile , then you take notice - all record companies do , " he said .
" and if fans start to get a bit disgruntled by it , then we have to listen , because obviously they do n't buy the cds anymore . "
he stressed that the company did try to make sure there was no repetition of specialist releases , but that greatest hits compilations would be put out every three to four years .
" all record companies will apply this logic , " he said .
" there is always a new audience out there for a major established artists , because people are always re-discovering artists ' music .
" i 'll never forget some market research we did on elvis 10 years ago - when you sit in a room with 10 people who you drag off the street to discuss what they would buy and what they like , one out 10 people owned an elvis album .
" the natural instinct is that everybody owns an elvis album - but the truth of the matter is that they do n't . "

mr chidambaram promised to eliminate the deficit by the 2008-09 fiscal year and set the next deficit target at 4.4 % .
economists say that improving infrastructure , as well as cutting the deficit , is the key to sustaining india 's strong economic growth .
the budget has also been criticised by the opposition .
former prime minister atal behari vajpayee said it made many promises but there were no resources to meet them .
the shiv sena party , an ally of mr vajpayee 's bharatiya janata party , called the budget populist and said it seemed the government was gearing up for another general election soon .
there was a more positive response from left-wing parties supporting the government .
the communist party of india-marxist said it appreciated mr chidambaram 's concern for agricultural development , employment generation , health and education .
however , it said it would protest against the government 's decision to allow more foreign investment in the critical telecom , insurance and civil aviation sectors .

car parking charges have led to a drop in trade in cirencester but the peace has been shaken after car parking charges went up more than six-fold .
the price hike has led to furious complaints from traders in cirencester and tetbury .
cotswold district council raised charges from 30p an hour to £ 1 for 30 minutes in april .
long-term charges have more than doubled from £ 2.40 to £ 5 - leading to some traders saying they might have to close .
lizzi pearson , who has run gift shop willow in cirencester for the past 12 years , says her trade dropped by 35 % after the rise was introduced .
ms pearson was so incensed by the rise that she initially refused to pay the increased charges .
she only relented when one of her customers and an anonymous donor offered to pay the fines she incurred .
" this is a quaint english town with little shops and businesses .
people use their cars to come and go and the charges are making life difficult , " she said .
threat of closure " it 's very unfair because now people who work in the town centre are being asked to find an extra £ 15 a week to park . "
ms pearson , a mother of three , warned that she may have to lay off staff or even close the shop completely .
" i 'm going to give it until the end of august , but i really need to make sure i can support my kids . "
george bristow , who runs artique in tetbury , says the town has been " brought to its knees " .
" someone i know had to stop taking her child to nursery .
she started parking on the street , but ended up having an accident .
some machines in tetbury have been vandalised since the price rise " there are even people here who ca n't get to the doctors because of the charges .
" the council says it will monitor this over the next 12 months , but the community is on its knees now .
there will be nothing left in 12 months . "
the parking charge meters in tetbury have also been vandalised during the past few months .
" it 's because people do n't know how to express themselves , " mr bristow said .
" it 's indicative of how bad this problem has become . "
charges ' too low ' the situation in cirencester has even prompted a shopping centre in nearby swindon to employ some cheeky advertising tactics .
the outlet village bought advertising space on the back of cirencester car park tickets boasting that parking was cheaper in the wiltshire town .
cotswold district council say that the criticisms levelled by traders are not fair , claiming a wider dip in retail is also to blame .
" there was a feeling that car parking needed to pay for itself , " lynden stowe , the portfolio holder for environment at cotswold district council said .
" compared to prices in other areas , such as neighbouring stratford-on-avon and cheltenham , we felt our charges were too low .
" in cirencester we saw a 7 % drop in ticket sales , but we anticipated more resistance - up to 20 % .
we do n't think there 's a considerable impact .
" tetbury went down by 20 % , but 60 % of the parking in the town is on-street and free .
we think it shows there may be a wider reason .
" there 's so much adverse publicity about the charges maybe it 's frightening off the public . "

graham allen , for nottingham north , has accused the government of making an example of his council in the run-up to the 2005 elections .
but local government minister nick raynsford insists he has had to be firm with all councils .
" we are keeping our promise to act on high council tax increases , " he said .

it 's a farce .
" i think the real reason is that the government needed a labour council on the list because there are only conservative and liberal democrat councils and they wanted to appear even-handed . "
he added : " they are playing games with people in nottingham north and elsewhere which are among the most deprived areas in the united kingdom . "

we want to see them take responsibility for budgeting prudently and keeping their council tax demands low .
" unfortunately , last year we saw very large council tax increases , averaging 12.9 % and that 's why the government had to issue advance warning to all councils saying that if they did n't meet our expectation of keeping their increases in low single figures , we would have no option but to use our capping powers .

a study released by the motion picture association of america -lrb- mpaa -rrb- found that film piracy was worse in south korea , where broadband is commonplace .
the film studios say piracy on the net has cost them billions of dollars .
last year hollywood 's major studios made a record $ 10.85bn -lrb- £ 5.8bn -rrb- at the international box office .
faster downloads for the study , the mpaa questioned 3,600 internet users who regularly went to the cinema from across the world .
it found that a quarter admitted to having downloaded a film from the internet .
the figure for korea was much higher , with six out of 10 net users downloading movies .
more worrying for the film industry , many downloaders said they had cut back on trips to the cinema and were buying fewer dvds .
the extent of film piracy online looks set to increase as more and more people switch to broadband .
the mpaa found that net users would download more films if they could get the movies faster .
" the time barrier should be mitigated as broadband penetration increases and compression technology improves to reduce the amount of time it will take to download the average movie , " said the mpaa study .
changing attitudes in a bid to combat piracy , the mpaa has launched a global campaign to hammer home the message that piracy is a crime .
but it could face an uphill struggle in changing attitudes .
the survey found that a fifth of downloaders had no qualms about getting hold of a movie before it was released in the cinema .
and a majority said it was ok to download a film once it was available on dvd or video .
the hollywood studios say piracy is costing them billions , even though box office takings rose by 5 % last year .
the mpaa has put the increase down to rising ticket prices , while the number of total tickets sold dropped by 5 % internationally and by 12 % in europe .

a study released by the motion picture association of america -lrb- mpaa -rrb- found that film piracy was worse in south korea , where broadband is commonplace .
the film studios say piracy on the net has cost them billions of dollars .
last year hollywood 's major studios made a record $ 10.85bn -lrb- £ 5.8bn -rrb- at the international box office .
faster downloads for the study , the mpaa questioned 3,600 internet users who regularly went to the cinema from across the world .
it found that a quarter admitted to having downloaded a film from the internet .
the figure for korea was much higher , with six out of 10 net users downloading movies .
more worrying for the film industry , many downloaders said they had cut back on trips to the cinema and were buying fewer dvds .
the extent of film piracy online looks set to increase as more and more people switch to broadband .
the mpaa found that net users would download more films if they could get the movies faster .
" the time barrier should be mitigated as broadband penetration increases and compression technology improves to reduce the amount of time it will take to download the average movie , " said the mpaa study .
changing attitudes in a bid to combat piracy , the mpaa has launched a global campaign to hammer home the message that piracy is a crime .
but it could face an uphill struggle in changing attitudes .
the survey found that a fifth of downloaders had no qualms about getting hold of a movie before it was released in the cinema .
and a majority said it was ok to download a film once it was available on dvd or video .
