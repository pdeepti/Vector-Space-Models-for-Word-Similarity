chocolate maker milka wants to light up germany 's highest mountain , the zugspitze , in the company 's trademark color , purple .
but the idea has turned politicians in bavaria , where the peak is located , red with rage . americans might like to sing about " purple mountain majesties " in their national hymn , " america , the beautiful , " but german politicians are n't much interested in having one of their most famous peaks actually temporarily turned purple for advertising purposes . milka , a subsidiary of kraft foods and one of germany 's favorite chocolate makers , wants to flood the 2,962 meter -lrb- 9,718 foot -rrb- peak with purple light from 140 purple spotlights at the end of june and film the event for a new advertising campaign .
kraft announced that it wants to start a campaign along with the new commercials that would raise € 1 million for various environmental projects . milka 's most well-known advertising symbol until now has been a purple and white cow .
the company is ready to move on to better , and bigger , things . but politicians across the spectrum in the mountain 's home state of bavaria are n't ready to see their beloved mountain go mauve , if only for a little while . " we wish as much rain and fog as possible on this event , " ludwig wörner of the bavarian social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- told reporters . one of his conservative colleagues , henning kaul of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said milka has already contributed to a distorted view of nature .
according to him , a purple precipice in the powerful medium of television would only make the matter worse . " when city kids today are asked what color cows are , they say purple , " he said .
" that they also say mountains are purple should n't happen as well . " a spokesman for milka , stephan becker-sonnenschein , said kids should be given more credit . " just because we light up the mountain one time - and briefly at that - does n't mean that children are n't going to assume that mountains are purple , " he told the newsmagazine der spiegel . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a maypole mountain mystery it 's a thriller that 's keeping bavarians at the edge of their seats : a ruthless gang of senior citizens has snatched the zugspitze mountain 's maypole .

he called on the government to act immediately . " the humanitarian catastrophe must be prevented , " he told reporters , saying the sudanese government must " arrest those responsible in darfur and open up humanitarian aid routes . " fischer , who arrived in khartoum late sunday , demanded the disarming of pro-government arab militias , which are seen as the cause of much of the instability in the region and have been accused by the united nations of carrying out a campaign of ethnic cleansing .
fischer called on the government to immediately rein in the militias . he said aid organizations must have free access to the crisis regions and that as soon as a peace agreement was put into place , germany and the european union would again offer support . " but darfur must be resolved , " he stressed . fischer also denied reports in the sudanese press that germany was aiding the insurgents in darfur " we are supporting no rebel group .
we are supporting no rebellion , " he said . khartoum agrees to act while the government has rejected accusations by aid groups that the government is still backing the arab militias that are responsible for most of the looting , destruction and ethnic evictions , president el-bashir said the government would disarm the militia groups and ismail assured reporters that that fischer 's demands would be met . " but what 's the hurry ? " he asked when journalists pressed him on a time frame . us secretary of state colin powell said during a visit last week that sudan would face global sanctions if it did not move to stop the violence . fischer arrived in darfur with 3.5 tons of medicine for darfur , enough for 1,000 people for a month .
travelling with him is deputy foreign minister kerstin müller .
while fischer is scheduled to fly back to germany on monday , müller will stay to visit the darfur region and assess the situation . rebellion and counter-rebellion the unrest stems from long-standing tension between nomadic arab tribesman and african farmers .
in february 2003 , two black african groups rebelled against the arab government in khartoum , demanding autonomy and more investment for the province .
pro-government arab janjaweed militia retaliated to the rebellion with brutal force , provoking what the united nations has called the world 's worst current humanitarian catastrophe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.07.2004 iraqi foreign minister comes to brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoshyar zebari met his european colleagues for talks the eu 's foreign ministers are meeting on monday in brussels with iraq 's interim foreign minister .
when he gets here , he 'll be facing a still-divided eu . at first , iraqi interim prime minister iyad alawi accepted the invitation of the european union ’ s dutch presidency to travel to brussels this monday to attend a regular meeting of the eu 's foreign ministers .
but sources in brussels said that alawi , who has served as head of the iraqi interim government since june 28 , was forced to cancel the trip because of the deteriorating security situation back home .
instead , he ’ ll be sending hoshyar zebari , who will attend a luncheon with the foreign ministers and discuss iraq ’ s wishes with the europeans .
the belgian capital had been planned as the first stop for alawi , who was also going to travel to a handful of middle eastern countries and britain .
the fact that he didn ’ t plan to make his first trip iraq ’ s former occupying power , the united states , has been seen in brussels as a sign that the iraqi interim government , which was created with the de facto support of the us and britain , is seeking to demonstrate its independence and to forge links with europe .
in brussels , zebari is also expected to visit nato headquarters .
at the nato summit in turkey two weeks ago , the alliance offered its iraq aid in developing its security forces .
however , the specifics of the deal – how that training will be provided and how expansive it will be – must still be negotiated .
germany has called for the training to be conducted outside of iraq and has , indeed , refused to send any troops inside the country for training or any other purpose .
instead , it is pushing for the training to happen at a nato school in the city of oberammergau .
in the preparations for the meeting with the iraqi foreign minister , the eu foreign ministers only succeeded in uniting on one front : a generally reserved statement offering iraq help with its reconstruction and the organization of free elections .
the brakes were applied to broader demands from britain and poland , which both have troops stationed in iraq , by war opponents germany and france , diplomats told deutsche welle .
few new developments expected it ’ s still unclear , for example , when the eu will open its own office in baghdad or when it will begin the training of police it has pledged .
since 2003 , the european union has made around € 305 million in aid payments to iraq .
in the coming year , it is expected to provide an additional € 200 million .

when he gets here , he 'll be facing a still-divided eu . at first , iraqi interim prime minister iyad alawi accepted the invitation of the european union ’ s dutch presidency to travel to brussels this monday to attend a regular meeting of the eu 's foreign ministers .
but sources in brussels said that alawi , who has served as head of the iraqi interim government since june 28 , was forced to cancel the trip because of the deteriorating security situation back home .
instead , he ’ ll be sending hoshyar zebari , who will attend a luncheon with the foreign ministers and discuss iraq ’ s wishes with the europeans .
the belgian capital had been planned as the first stop for alawi , who was also going to travel to a handful of middle eastern countries and britain .
the fact that he didn ’ t plan to make his first trip iraq ’ s former occupying power , the united states , has been seen in brussels as a sign that the iraqi interim government , which was created with the de facto support of the us and britain , is seeking to demonstrate its independence and to forge links with europe .
in brussels , zebari is also expected to visit nato headquarters .
at the nato summit in turkey two weeks ago , the alliance offered its iraq aid in developing its security forces .
however , the specifics of the deal – how that training will be provided and how expansive it will be – must still be negotiated .
germany has called for the training to be conducted outside of iraq and has , indeed , refused to send any troops inside the country for training or any other purpose .
instead , it is pushing for the training to happen at a nato school in the city of oberammergau .
in the preparations for the meeting with the iraqi foreign minister , the eu foreign ministers only succeeded in uniting on one front : a generally reserved statement offering iraq help with its reconstruction and the organization of free elections .
the brakes were applied to broader demands from britain and poland , which both have troops stationed in iraq , by war opponents germany and france , diplomats told deutsche welle .
few new developments expected it ’ s still unclear , for example , when the eu will open its own office in baghdad or when it will begin the training of police it has pledged .

when he gets here , he 'll be facing a still-divided eu . at first , iraqi interim prime minister iyad alawi accepted the invitation of the european union ’ s dutch presidency to travel to brussels this monday to attend a regular meeting of the eu 's foreign ministers .
but sources in brussels said that alawi , who has served as head of the iraqi interim government since june 28 , was forced to cancel the trip because of the deteriorating security situation back home .
instead , he ’ ll be sending hoshyar zebari , who will attend a luncheon with the foreign ministers and discuss iraq ’ s wishes with the europeans .
the belgian capital had been planned as the first stop for alawi , who was also going to travel to a handful of middle eastern countries and britain .
the fact that he didn ’ t plan to make his first trip iraq ’ s former occupying power , the united states , has been seen in brussels as a sign that the iraqi interim government , which was created with the de facto support of the us and britain , is seeking to demonstrate its independence and to forge links with europe .
in brussels , zebari is also expected to visit nato headquarters .
at the nato summit in turkey two weeks ago , the alliance offered its iraq aid in developing its security forces .
however , the specifics of the deal – how that training will be provided and how expansive it will be – must still be negotiated .
germany has called for the training to be conducted outside of iraq and has , indeed , refused to send any troops inside the country for training or any other purpose .
instead , it is pushing for the training to happen at a nato school in the city of oberammergau .
in the preparations for the meeting with the iraqi foreign minister , the eu foreign ministers only succeeded in uniting on one front : a generally reserved statement offering iraq help with its reconstruction and the organization of free elections .
the brakes were applied to broader demands from britain and poland , which both have troops stationed in iraq , by war opponents germany and france , diplomats told deutsche welle .
few new developments expected it ’ s still unclear , for example , when the eu will open its own office in baghdad or when it will begin the training of police it has pledged .
since 2003 , the european union has made around € 305 million in aid payments to iraq .
in the coming year , it is expected to provide an additional € 200 million .
the foreign ministers are expected to confirm this sum again during zebari ’ s visit .
otherwise , the ministers are expected to discuss with zebari laws in iraq pertaining to states of emergency , the possibility of debt relief for iraq as well as the planning of a possible international iraq conference similar to the successful petersberg conference for afghanistan that was held near the german city of bonn .
peacekeeping on the agenda the eu foreign ministers are also expected on monday to decide on the structure of a future eu mission in bosnia-herzegovina .

but authorities have arrested the ship 's captain and the head of the german aid group . after nearly three weeks on the german rescue ship " cap anamur , " the refugees , mostly from sudan , will now be brought to a refugee center near the italian town of agrigent , italian officials said on monday morning .
" port police has given us permission to enter the harbor , " stefan schmidt , the ship 's captain , told reporters , adding that the entrance to the harbor , porto empedocle in southern sicily , was no longer blocked by coast guards .
however the situation has become complicated with italian authorities taking the ship 's captain , stefan schmidt , and the organization 's head , elias bierdel , in for questioning about aiding illegal immigration , then arresting them .
on sunday , the italian government had permitted the ship to enter sicilian waters , italian news agency ansa reported .
it did not , however , allow the ship from the cologne-based relief organization to dock .
two ships from the italian coast guard were blocking entry to the port , according to the organization 's director bierdel , who referred to the action as " a degrading show of force . "
the ship 's captain had reported earlier that the situation on board was deteriorating rapidly , with some refugees threatening to jump overboard if the vessel didn ’ t dock soon .
the italian government , however , had strictly refused to take in the africans - mostly sudanese - because , it said , the ship had previously entered maltese territorial waters , which under eu rules would have made malta responsible for accepting any asylum applications .
in an interview with german public broadcaster ard , the ship ’ s captain confirmed the ship had approached malta , but only on " transit " to italy and that the government in valetta -lrb- the maltese capital -rrb- had no responsibility for the refugees .
officials at cap anamur said sunday that the refugees had applied for political asylum in germany .
the organization said the refugees ’ hand-written asylum applications would be promptly delivered to the responsible federal authority in the southern german city of nuremberg .
german government officials meanwhile said they did not believe the refugees could apply for asylum in the country , saying that the country the refugees first entered would have to decide about their applications .
plucked from the sea just over two weeks ago the 37 sudanese refugees were plucked from the sea off the coast of malta .
the german ship then set sail for the closest harbor - on the southern italian island of sicily .
initially the crew believed there would not be a problem , said bierdel .
" we did everything according to the book , asking for entry into the harbor and initially we got the go ahead .
but when we arrived we were held up by gun boats and helicopters .
i felt reminded of a maritime battle , " bierdel said .
while the german aid organization claims that no reason was given for the authorities ' change of heart , italian sources said that the information on the identity of the refugees was insufficient .
cap anamur has deplored the delay , saying that the ship could be rescuing other people instead of waiting for the resolution of this particular problem .
' we 're trying to save lives ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the 1970s , the cap anamur made a name for itself by saving as many as 8,000 so-called " boat people " refugees from vietnam " we are a humanitarian organization .

but authorities have arrested the ship 's captain and the head of the german aid group . after nearly three weeks on the german rescue ship " cap anamur , " the refugees , mostly from sudan , will now be brought to a refugee center near the italian town of agrigent , italian officials said on monday morning .
" port police has given us permission to enter the harbor , " stefan schmidt , the ship 's captain , told reporters , adding that the entrance to the harbor , porto empedocle in southern sicily , was no longer blocked by coast guards .
however the situation has become complicated with italian authorities taking the ship 's captain , stefan schmidt , and the organization 's head , elias bierdel , in for questioning about aiding illegal immigration , then arresting them .
on sunday , the italian government had permitted the ship to enter sicilian waters , italian news agency ansa reported .
it did not , however , allow the ship from the cologne-based relief organization to dock .
two ships from the italian coast guard were blocking entry to the port , according to the organization 's director bierdel , who referred to the action as " a degrading show of force . "
the ship 's captain had reported earlier that the situation on board was deteriorating rapidly , with some refugees threatening to jump overboard if the vessel didn ’ t dock soon .
the italian government , however , had strictly refused to take in the africans - mostly sudanese - because , it said , the ship had previously entered maltese territorial waters , which under eu rules would have made malta responsible for accepting any asylum applications .
in an interview with german public broadcaster ard , the ship ’ s captain confirmed the ship had approached malta , but only on " transit " to italy and that the government in valetta -lrb- the maltese capital -rrb- had no responsibility for the refugees .
officials at cap anamur said sunday that the refugees had applied for political asylum in germany .
the organization said the refugees ’ hand-written asylum applications would be promptly delivered to the responsible federal authority in the southern german city of nuremberg .
german government officials meanwhile said they did not believe the refugees could apply for asylum in the country , saying that the country the refugees first entered would have to decide about their applications .
plucked from the sea just over two weeks ago the 37 sudanese refugees were plucked from the sea off the coast of malta .
the german ship then set sail for the closest harbor - on the southern italian island of sicily .
initially the crew believed there would not be a problem , said bierdel .
" we did everything according to the book , asking for entry into the harbor and initially we got the go ahead .
but when we arrived we were held up by gun boats and helicopters .
i felt reminded of a maritime battle , " bierdel said .
while the german aid organization claims that no reason was given for the authorities ' change of heart , italian sources said that the information on the identity of the refugees was insufficient .
cap anamur has deplored the delay , saying that the ship could be rescuing other people instead of waiting for the resolution of this particular problem .
' we 're trying to save lives ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the 1970s , the cap anamur made a name for itself by saving as many as 8,000 so-called " boat people " refugees from vietnam " we are a humanitarian organization .

he called on the government to act immediately . " the humanitarian catastrophe must be prevented , " he told reporters , saying the sudanese government must " arrest those responsible in darfur and open up humanitarian aid routes . " fischer , who arrived in khartoum late sunday , demanded the disarming of pro-government arab militias , which are seen as the cause of much of the instability in the region and have been accused by the united nations of carrying out a campaign of ethnic cleansing .
fischer called on the government to immediately rein in the militias . he said aid organizations must have free access to the crisis regions and that as soon as a peace agreement was put into place , germany and the european union would again offer support . " but darfur must be resolved , " he stressed . fischer also denied reports in the sudanese press that germany was aiding the insurgents in darfur " we are supporting no rebel group .
we are supporting no rebellion , " he said . khartoum agrees to act while the government has rejected accusations by aid groups that the government is still backing the arab militias that are responsible for most of the looting , destruction and ethnic evictions , president el-bashir said the government would disarm the militia groups and ismail assured reporters that that fischer 's demands would be met . " but what 's the hurry ? " he asked when journalists pressed him on a time frame . us secretary of state colin powell said during a visit last week that sudan would face global sanctions if it did not move to stop the violence . fischer arrived in darfur with 3.5 tons of medicine for darfur , enough for 1,000 people for a month .
travelling with him is deputy foreign minister kerstin müller .
while fischer is scheduled to fly back to germany on monday , müller will stay to visit the darfur region and assess the situation . rebellion and counter-rebellion the unrest stems from long-standing tension between nomadic arab tribesman and african farmers .
in february 2003 , two black african groups rebelled against the arab government in khartoum , demanding autonomy and more investment for the province .
pro-government arab janjaweed militia retaliated to the rebellion with brutal force , provoking what the united nations has called the world 's worst current humanitarian catastrophe .
it is estimated that 30,000 people have been killed and more than one million people have been forced from their homes and villages dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer wants action in crisis-plagued sudan foreign minister joschka fischer and his deputy , kerstin müller , travel to sudan on sunday for talks with sudan 's president omar el-bashir about ending violence in the darfur region .

chocolate maker milka wants to light up germany 's highest mountain , the zugspitze , in the company 's trademark color , purple .
but the idea has turned politicians in bavaria , where the peak is located , red with rage . americans might like to sing about " purple mountain majesties " in their national hymn , " america , the beautiful , " but german politicians are n't much interested in having one of their most famous peaks actually temporarily turned purple for advertising purposes . milka , a subsidiary of kraft foods and one of germany 's favorite chocolate makers , wants to flood the 2,962 meter -lrb- 9,718 foot -rrb- peak with purple light from 140 purple spotlights at the end of june and film the event for a new advertising campaign .
kraft announced that it wants to start a campaign along with the new commercials that would raise € 1 million for various environmental projects . milka 's most well-known advertising symbol until now has been a purple and white cow .
the company is ready to move on to better , and bigger , things . but politicians across the spectrum in the mountain 's home state of bavaria are n't ready to see their beloved mountain go mauve , if only for a little while . " we wish as much rain and fog as possible on this event , " ludwig wörner of the bavarian social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- told reporters . one of his conservative colleagues , henning kaul of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said milka has already contributed to a distorted view of nature .
according to him , a purple precipice in the powerful medium of television would only make the matter worse . " when city kids today are asked what color cows are , they say purple , " he said .
" that they also say mountains are purple should n't happen as well . " a spokesman for milka , stephan becker-sonnenschein , said kids should be given more credit .

he called on the government to act immediately . " the humanitarian catastrophe must be prevented , " he told reporters , saying the sudanese government must " arrest those responsible in darfur and open up humanitarian aid routes . " fischer , who arrived in khartoum late sunday , demanded the disarming of pro-government arab militias , which are seen as the cause of much of the instability in the region and have been accused by the united nations of carrying out a campaign of ethnic cleansing .
fischer called on the government to immediately rein in the militias . he said aid organizations must have free access to the crisis regions and that as soon as a peace agreement was put into place , germany and the european union would again offer support .

last week in washington , a us senate committee concluded that us intelligence agencies overstated iraq ’ s weapons threat and relied on questionable sources . in the same week , blair admitted that iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction may never be found .
still , there are two areas in the senate report which could work in blair 's favor . “ firstly , the senate found no evidence of political pressure being applied on the central intelligence agency by president bush and secondly , there 's the admission by the senate inquiry that , in a way , everyone was hoodwinked by saddam hussein , " graham leach , a london-based political analyst told deutsche welle . fresh trouble for blair ? last september , blair presented to parliament a dossier on iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction , which said that british intelligence had established beyond doubt that iraq had chemical and biological weapons . this wednesday , lord robin butler , a former civil service chief , will report on the conclusions of a five-month inquiry into whether britain fought the iraq war on the basis of false intelligence about baghdad ’ s weaponry . but despite recent reports in the british media that blair had come close to resigning last month , the contents of the report are n't expected to cost the prime minister his job . " all the leaks and all the impressions emerging in these days before the butler inquiry is that the welter of criticism will be directed at britain ’ s intelligence services rather than the government , " leach said . the report is expected to heavily criticize sir richard dearlove , the outgoing head of britain ’ s secret intelligence service mi6 , and its incoming head john scarlett . critical elections on thursday , blair ’ s labour party faces two difficult by-elections in birmingham and leicester .
labour has suffered significant losses in popularity because of the iraq war .
in recent months , blair has struggled to draw a line under the iraq war and shift the spotlight back to the domestic agenda . the butler report will revive questions about blair ’ s trustworthiness and will likely affect the way voters cast their ballots in the by-elections . anita purcell -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain to hold inquiry into iraq intelligence britain will hold an inquiry to investigate the intelligence used to build the case for war in iraq .

he called on the government to act immediately . " the humanitarian catastrophe must be prevented , " he told reporters , saying the sudanese government must " arrest those responsible in darfur and open up humanitarian aid routes . " fischer , who arrived in khartoum late sunday , demanded the disarming of pro-government arab militias , which are seen as the cause of much of the instability in the region and have been accused by the united nations of carrying out a campaign of ethnic cleansing .
fischer called on the government to immediately rein in the militias . he said aid organizations must have free access to the crisis regions and that as soon as a peace agreement was put into place , germany and the european union would again offer support . " but darfur must be resolved , " he stressed . fischer also denied reports in the sudanese press that germany was aiding the insurgents in darfur " we are supporting no rebel group .
we are supporting no rebellion , " he said . khartoum agrees to act while the government has rejected accusations by aid groups that the government is still backing the arab militias that are responsible for most of the looting , destruction and ethnic evictions , president el-bashir said the government would disarm the militia groups and ismail assured reporters that that fischer 's demands would be met . " but what 's the hurry ? " he asked when journalists pressed him on a time frame . us secretary of state colin powell said during a visit last week that sudan would face global sanctions if it did not move to stop the violence . fischer arrived in darfur with 3.5 tons of medicine for darfur , enough for 1,000 people for a month .
travelling with him is deputy foreign minister kerstin müller .
while fischer is scheduled to fly back to germany on monday , müller will stay to visit the darfur region and assess the situation . rebellion and counter-rebellion the unrest stems from long-standing tension between nomadic arab tribesman and african farmers .
in february 2003 , two black african groups rebelled against the arab government in khartoum , demanding autonomy and more investment for the province .
pro-government arab janjaweed militia retaliated to the rebellion with brutal force , provoking what the united nations has called the world 's worst current humanitarian catastrophe .

chocolate maker milka wants to light up germany 's highest mountain , the zugspitze , in the company 's trademark color , purple .
but the idea has turned politicians in bavaria , where the peak is located , red with rage . americans might like to sing about " purple mountain majesties " in their national hymn , " america , the beautiful , " but german politicians are n't much interested in having one of their most famous peaks actually temporarily turned purple for advertising purposes . milka , a subsidiary of kraft foods and one of germany 's favorite chocolate makers , wants to flood the 2,962 meter -lrb- 9,718 foot -rrb- peak with purple light from 140 purple spotlights at the end of june and film the event for a new advertising campaign .
kraft announced that it wants to start a campaign along with the new commercials that would raise € 1 million for various environmental projects . milka 's most well-known advertising symbol until now has been a purple and white cow .
the company is ready to move on to better , and bigger , things . but politicians across the spectrum in the mountain 's home state of bavaria are n't ready to see their beloved mountain go mauve , if only for a little while . " we wish as much rain and fog as possible on this event , " ludwig wörner of the bavarian social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- told reporters . one of his conservative colleagues , henning kaul of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said milka has already contributed to a distorted view of nature .
according to him , a purple precipice in the powerful medium of television would only make the matter worse . " when city kids today are asked what color cows are , they say purple , " he said .
" that they also say mountains are purple should n't happen as well . " a spokesman for milka , stephan becker-sonnenschein , said kids should be given more credit . " just because we light up the mountain one time - and briefly at that - does n't mean that children are n't going to assume that mountains are purple , " he told the newsmagazine der spiegel . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a maypole mountain mystery it 's a thriller that 's keeping bavarians at the edge of their seats : a ruthless gang of senior citizens has snatched the zugspitze mountain 's maypole .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.07.2004 -pipe- 08:00 utc french minister moots transatlantic treaty speaking at the 30th anniversary of a foreign affairs think tank in paris , french foreign minister michel barnier said that in the post cold-war world , the transatlantic relationship has become a " choice rather than a necessity . "
however , ties still need to be better organised to avoid spats like the one that occurred over iraq , he argued and he proposed that " a treaty could seal this renewed union . "
the idea of a new transatlantic treaty is not new - it was first proposed by the then foreign minister alain juppé 10 years ago .
" the last ten years have taken nothing away from its relevance , " barnier said , according to le figaro .
" in fact the opposite is true . "
the proposal comes as franco-us relations continue to be shaky .
although far removed from the depths plumbed during the iraq war , ties remain uneasy , with french president jacques chirac recently criticizing us president george bush in public for taking a stance over turkey 's eventual membership of the eu .
paris also recently annoyed the us by opposing the use of nato troops in iraq during a recent meeting .

that 's the proposal put forth over the weekend by leading members of the social democrats and opposition parties .
rather than take away vacation days or add more hours to the work week , which averages roughly 35 to 38 hours for the industrial and manufacturing sector , the politicians favored scratching a few of the dozen state holidays .
" before we take away vacation days , we should look at holidays , " suggested the christian democrats ' state party leader for schleswig-holstein , peter harry carstensen .
compared to other european and industrialized countries , germans enjoy the most holidays , averaging 13 in the western part and 11 in the eastern part of the nation .
when added to the approximately 30 vacation days , germans rank top on a list for most days off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german teenagers dressed as the three wise men collect money for charities around epiphany .
the premier for the eastern state of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer -lrb- cdu -rrb- , endorsed the proposal to cut down the holidays : " i am not opposed to it , " he told the mass-circulation bild .
he said the first to get cancelled would be epiphany on jan .
6 , which is an official holiday in only three german states , including saxony-anhalt .
religious opposition but the proposal to cut holidays , primarily religious ones , has met with sharp criticism from church leaders .
on monday catholic bishops throughout the country defended retaining all of the country 's holidays , saying they represented germany 's religious and cultural values .
cardinal friedrich wetter from munich said reducing the number of holidays should not play a role in the discussion on increasing worker productivity .
there are enough other possibilities in this area he said .
bishop heinz josef algermissen from fulda criticized the christian democrat union and the business-friendly free democrats for calling for a reduction in religious holidays .
instead the politicians should be thinking about ways to increase the working week or reducing vacation days , he said .
in general he cautioned the politicians about focusing too much on " creating a society which places all priority on the economy " while removing the spiritual aspects .
increasing worker productivity the proposal to cut holidays represents the politicians ' latest attempts to increase productivity and boost the sluggish economy without touching the sensitive issue of raising the hours in the work week or taking away vacation days , both of which have been strongly opposed by the unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans only work 35 hours per week jürgen peters , head of ig-metall , germany 's largest labor union , warned the government not to meddle with the work week and vacation .
if the government calls for increasing working hours or taking away vacation days , the union would call for widespread strikes .
" we will do what it takes to defend the 35-hour work week , " peters said .
the government in the meantime has criticized the " ideological fixation " on a specific number of working hours as impractical and detrimental to economic growth .
deputy spokesperson thomas steg said in berlin on monday that " a fixation of any sort was misleading , " and pointed to open clauses in tariffs , which allow for flexible solutions .
vacation meisters german president horst köhler echoed the government 's position and urged germans to engage in a debate without taboos .

that 's the proposal put forth over the weekend by leading members of the social democrats and opposition parties .
rather than take away vacation days or add more hours to the work week , which averages roughly 35 to 38 hours for the industrial and manufacturing sector , the politicians favored scratching a few of the dozen state holidays .
" before we take away vacation days , we should look at holidays , " suggested the christian democrats ' state party leader for schleswig-holstein , peter harry carstensen .
compared to other european and industrialized countries , germans enjoy the most holidays , averaging 13 in the western part and 11 in the eastern part of the nation .
when added to the approximately 30 vacation days , germans rank top on a list for most days off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german teenagers dressed as the three wise men collect money for charities around epiphany .
the premier for the eastern state of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer -lrb- cdu -rrb- , endorsed the proposal to cut down the holidays : " i am not opposed to it , " he told the mass-circulation bild .
he said the first to get cancelled would be epiphany on jan .
6 , which is an official holiday in only three german states , including saxony-anhalt .
religious opposition but the proposal to cut holidays , primarily religious ones , has met with sharp criticism from church leaders .
on monday catholic bishops throughout the country defended retaining all of the country 's holidays , saying they represented germany 's religious and cultural values .
cardinal friedrich wetter from munich said reducing the number of holidays should not play a role in the discussion on increasing worker productivity .
there are enough other possibilities in this area he said .
bishop heinz josef algermissen from fulda criticized the christian democrat union and the business-friendly free democrats for calling for a reduction in religious holidays .
instead the politicians should be thinking about ways to increase the working week or reducing vacation days , he said .
in general he cautioned the politicians about focusing too much on " creating a society which places all priority on the economy " while removing the spiritual aspects .
increasing worker productivity the proposal to cut holidays represents the politicians ' latest attempts to increase productivity and boost the sluggish economy without touching the sensitive issue of raising the hours in the work week or taking away vacation days , both of which have been strongly opposed by the unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans only work 35 hours per week jürgen peters , head of ig-metall , germany 's largest labor union , warned the government not to meddle with the work week and vacation .
if the government calls for increasing working hours or taking away vacation days , the union would call for widespread strikes .
" we will do what it takes to defend the 35-hour work week , " peters said .
the government in the meantime has criticized the " ideological fixation " on a specific number of working hours as impractical and detrimental to economic growth .
deputy spokesperson thomas steg said in berlin on monday that " a fixation of any sort was misleading , " and pointed to open clauses in tariffs , which allow for flexible solutions .
vacation meisters german president horst köhler echoed the government 's position and urged germans to engage in a debate without taboos .

that 's the proposal put forth over the weekend by leading members of the social democrats and opposition parties .
rather than take away vacation days or add more hours to the work week , which averages roughly 35 to 38 hours for the industrial and manufacturing sector , the politicians favored scratching a few of the dozen state holidays .
" before we take away vacation days , we should look at holidays , " suggested the christian democrats ' state party leader for schleswig-holstein , peter harry carstensen .
compared to other european and industrialized countries , germans enjoy the most holidays , averaging 13 in the western part and 11 in the eastern part of the nation .
when added to the approximately 30 vacation days , germans rank top on a list for most days off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german teenagers dressed as the three wise men collect money for charities around epiphany .
the premier for the eastern state of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer -lrb- cdu -rrb- , endorsed the proposal to cut down the holidays : " i am not opposed to it , " he told the mass-circulation bild .
he said the first to get cancelled would be epiphany on jan .
6 , which is an official holiday in only three german states , including saxony-anhalt .
religious opposition but the proposal to cut holidays , primarily religious ones , has met with sharp criticism from church leaders .
on monday catholic bishops throughout the country defended retaining all of the country 's holidays , saying they represented germany 's religious and cultural values .
cardinal friedrich wetter from munich said reducing the number of holidays should not play a role in the discussion on increasing worker productivity .
there are enough other possibilities in this area he said .
bishop heinz josef algermissen from fulda criticized the christian democrat union and the business-friendly free democrats for calling for a reduction in religious holidays .
instead the politicians should be thinking about ways to increase the working week or reducing vacation days , he said .
in general he cautioned the politicians about focusing too much on " creating a society which places all priority on the economy " while removing the spiritual aspects .
increasing worker productivity the proposal to cut holidays represents the politicians ' latest attempts to increase productivity and boost the sluggish economy without touching the sensitive issue of raising the hours in the work week or taking away vacation days , both of which have been strongly opposed by the unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans only work 35 hours per week jürgen peters , head of ig-metall , germany 's largest labor union , warned the government not to meddle with the work week and vacation .
if the government calls for increasing working hours or taking away vacation days , the union would call for widespread strikes .
" we will do what it takes to defend the 35-hour work week , " peters said .
the government in the meantime has criticized the " ideological fixation " on a specific number of working hours as impractical and detrimental to economic growth .
deputy spokesperson thomas steg said in berlin on monday that " a fixation of any sort was misleading , " and pointed to open clauses in tariffs , which allow for flexible solutions .
vacation meisters german president horst köhler echoed the government 's position and urged germans to engage in a debate without taboos .
" germany is in fact the world 's vacation ' meister ' and it can not be a taboo to talk about this topic , " köhler said in an interview with german public television on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans love their seaside vacation " all efforts should be focused on the questions of what will create jobs and what will help the economy grow , " köhler said and added that extending the working week or reducing the number of days off should be integral parts of this discussion . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : longer work week already reality while germans are debating whether to extend the work week to help the country 's ailing economy , some experts say many employees already spend almost 40 hours on the job each week .

the reform , which involves a pooling of unemployment and social welfare benefits , is deeply unpopular among the former communist east german states .

" we have three to four times as many welfare and unemployment recipients in the east as compared to the west and that 's why it 's a special situation , " said dieter althaus , premier of the state of thüringia .
schröder however has made clear that he will not make any exceptions .
" the law has been decided and is binding on all , " he said . dw-world.de spd and greens take stock of reforms at a two-day meeting near berlin , gerhard schröder urges his cabinet to continue with difficult reforms and to find solutions to make their implementation as conflict-free as possible .

that 's the proposal put forth over the weekend by leading members of the social democrats and opposition parties .
rather than take away vacation days or add more hours to the work week , which averages roughly 35 to 38 hours for the industrial and manufacturing sector , the politicians favored scratching a few of the dozen state holidays .
" before we take away vacation days , we should look at holidays , " suggested the christian democrats ' state party leader for schleswig-holstein , peter harry carstensen .
compared to other european and industrialized countries , germans enjoy the most holidays , averaging 13 in the western part and 11 in the eastern part of the nation .
when added to the approximately 30 vacation days , germans rank top on a list for most days off .

the premier for the eastern state of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer -lrb- cdu -rrb- , endorsed the proposal to cut down the holidays : " i am not opposed to it , " he told the mass-circulation bild .
he said the first to get cancelled would be epiphany on jan .
6 , which is an official holiday in only three german states , including saxony-anhalt .
religious opposition but the proposal to cut holidays , primarily religious ones , has met with sharp criticism from church leaders .
on monday catholic bishops throughout the country defended retaining all of the country 's holidays , saying they represented germany 's religious and cultural values .
cardinal friedrich wetter from munich said reducing the number of holidays should not play a role in the discussion on increasing worker productivity .
there are enough other possibilities in this area he said .
bishop heinz josef algermissen from fulda criticized the christian democrat union and the business-friendly free democrats for calling for a reduction in religious holidays .
instead the politicians should be thinking about ways to increase the working week or reducing vacation days , he said .
in general he cautioned the politicians about focusing too much on " creating a society which places all priority on the economy " while removing the spiritual aspects .
increasing worker productivity the proposal to cut holidays represents the politicians ' latest attempts to increase productivity and boost the sluggish economy without touching the sensitive issue of raising the hours in the work week or taking away vacation days , both of which have been strongly opposed by the unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans only work 35 hours per week jürgen peters , head of ig-metall , germany 's largest labor union , warned the government not to meddle with the work week and vacation .
if the government calls for increasing working hours or taking away vacation days , the union would call for widespread strikes .
" we will do what it takes to defend the 35-hour work week , " peters said .
the government in the meantime has criticized the " ideological fixation " on a specific number of working hours as impractical and detrimental to economic growth .
deputy spokesperson thomas steg said in berlin on monday that " a fixation of any sort was misleading , " and pointed to open clauses in tariffs , which allow for flexible solutions .
vacation meisters german president horst köhler echoed the government 's position and urged germans to engage in a debate without taboos .

that 's the proposal put forth over the weekend by leading members of the social democrats and opposition parties .
rather than take away vacation days or add more hours to the work week , which averages roughly 35 to 38 hours for the industrial and manufacturing sector , the politicians favored scratching a few of the dozen state holidays .
" before we take away vacation days , we should look at holidays , " suggested the christian democrats ' state party leader for schleswig-holstein , peter harry carstensen .
compared to other european and industrialized countries , germans enjoy the most holidays , averaging 13 in the western part and 11 in the eastern part of the nation .
when added to the approximately 30 vacation days , germans rank top on a list for most days off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german teenagers dressed as the three wise men collect money for charities around epiphany .
the premier for the eastern state of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer -lrb- cdu -rrb- , endorsed the proposal to cut down the holidays : " i am not opposed to it , " he told the mass-circulation bild .
he said the first to get cancelled would be epiphany on jan .
6 , which is an official holiday in only three german states , including saxony-anhalt .
religious opposition but the proposal to cut holidays , primarily religious ones , has met with sharp criticism from church leaders .
on monday catholic bishops throughout the country defended retaining all of the country 's holidays , saying they represented germany 's religious and cultural values .
cardinal friedrich wetter from munich said reducing the number of holidays should not play a role in the discussion on increasing worker productivity .
there are enough other possibilities in this area he said .
bishop heinz josef algermissen from fulda criticized the christian democrat union and the business-friendly free democrats for calling for a reduction in religious holidays .
instead the politicians should be thinking about ways to increase the working week or reducing vacation days , he said .
in general he cautioned the politicians about focusing too much on " creating a society which places all priority on the economy " while removing the spiritual aspects .
increasing worker productivity the proposal to cut holidays represents the politicians ' latest attempts to increase productivity and boost the sluggish economy without touching the sensitive issue of raising the hours in the work week or taking away vacation days , both of which have been strongly opposed by the unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans only work 35 hours per week jürgen peters , head of ig-metall , germany 's largest labor union , warned the government not to meddle with the work week and vacation .
if the government calls for increasing working hours or taking away vacation days , the union would call for widespread strikes .
" we will do what it takes to defend the 35-hour work week , " peters said .
the government in the meantime has criticized the " ideological fixation " on a specific number of working hours as impractical and detrimental to economic growth .
deputy spokesperson thomas steg said in berlin on monday that " a fixation of any sort was misleading , " and pointed to open clauses in tariffs , which allow for flexible solutions .
vacation meisters german president horst köhler echoed the government 's position and urged germans to engage in a debate without taboos .
" germany is in fact the world 's vacation ' meister ' and it can not be a taboo to talk about this topic , " köhler said in an interview with german public television on sunday .

he called on the government to act immediately . " the humanitarian catastrophe must be prevented , " he told reporters , saying the sudanese government must " arrest those responsible in darfur and open up humanitarian aid routes . " fischer , who arrived in khartoum late sunday , demanded the disarming of pro-government arab militias , which are seen as the cause of much of the instability in the region and have been accused by the united nations of carrying out a campaign of ethnic cleansing .
fischer called on the government to immediately rein in the militias . he said aid organizations must have free access to the crisis regions and that as soon as a peace agreement was put into place , germany and the european union would again offer support . " but darfur must be resolved , " he stressed . fischer also denied reports in the sudanese press that germany was aiding the insurgents in darfur " we are supporting no rebel group .

" but what 's the hurry ? " he asked when journalists pressed him on a time frame . us secretary of state colin powell said during a visit last week that sudan would face global sanctions if it did not move to stop the violence . fischer arrived in darfur with 3.5 tons of medicine for darfur , enough for 1,000 people for a month .

but authorities have arrested the ship 's captain and the head of the german aid group . after nearly three weeks on the german rescue ship " cap anamur , " the refugees , mostly from sudan , will now be brought to a refugee center near the italian town of agrigent , italian officials said on monday morning .
" port police has given us permission to enter the harbor , " stefan schmidt , the ship 's captain , told reporters , adding that the entrance to the harbor , porto empedocle in southern sicily , was no longer blocked by coast guards .
however the situation has become complicated with italian authorities taking the ship 's captain , stefan schmidt , and the organization 's head , elias bierdel , in for questioning about aiding illegal immigration , then arresting them .
on sunday , the italian government had permitted the ship to enter sicilian waters , italian news agency ansa reported .
it did not , however , allow the ship from the cologne-based relief organization to dock .
two ships from the italian coast guard were blocking entry to the port , according to the organization 's director bierdel , who referred to the action as " a degrading show of force . "
the ship 's captain had reported earlier that the situation on board was deteriorating rapidly , with some refugees threatening to jump overboard if the vessel didn ’ t dock soon .
the italian government , however , had strictly refused to take in the africans - mostly sudanese - because , it said , the ship had previously entered maltese territorial waters , which under eu rules would have made malta responsible for accepting any asylum applications .
in an interview with german public broadcaster ard , the ship ’ s captain confirmed the ship had approached malta , but only on " transit " to italy and that the government in valetta -lrb- the maltese capital -rrb- had no responsibility for the refugees .
officials at cap anamur said sunday that the refugees had applied for political asylum in germany .
the organization said the refugees ’ hand-written asylum applications would be promptly delivered to the responsible federal authority in the southern german city of nuremberg .
german government officials meanwhile said they did not believe the refugees could apply for asylum in the country , saying that the country the refugees first entered would have to decide about their applications .
plucked from the sea just over two weeks ago the 37 sudanese refugees were plucked from the sea off the coast of malta .
the german ship then set sail for the closest harbor - on the southern italian island of sicily .
initially the crew believed there would not be a problem , said bierdel .
" we did everything according to the book , asking for entry into the harbor and initially we got the go ahead .
but when we arrived we were held up by gun boats and helicopters .
i felt reminded of a maritime battle , " bierdel said .
while the german aid organization claims that no reason was given for the authorities ' change of heart , italian sources said that the information on the identity of the refugees was insufficient .
cap anamur has deplored the delay , saying that the ship could be rescuing other people instead of waiting for the resolution of this particular problem .
' we 're trying to save lives ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the 1970s , the cap anamur made a name for itself by saving as many as 8,000 so-called " boat people " refugees from vietnam " we are a humanitarian organization .

but authorities have arrested the ship 's captain and the head of the german aid group . after nearly three weeks on the german rescue ship " cap anamur , " the refugees , mostly from sudan , will now be brought to a refugee center near the italian town of agrigent , italian officials said on monday morning .
" port police has given us permission to enter the harbor , " stefan schmidt , the ship 's captain , told reporters , adding that the entrance to the harbor , porto empedocle in southern sicily , was no longer blocked by coast guards .
however the situation has become complicated with italian authorities taking the ship 's captain , stefan schmidt , and the organization 's head , elias bierdel , in for questioning about aiding illegal immigration , then arresting them .
on sunday , the italian government had permitted the ship to enter sicilian waters , italian news agency ansa reported .
it did not , however , allow the ship from the cologne-based relief organization to dock .
two ships from the italian coast guard were blocking entry to the port , according to the organization 's director bierdel , who referred to the action as " a degrading show of force . "
the ship 's captain had reported earlier that the situation on board was deteriorating rapidly , with some refugees threatening to jump overboard if the vessel didn ’ t dock soon .
the italian government , however , had strictly refused to take in the africans - mostly sudanese - because , it said , the ship had previously entered maltese territorial waters , which under eu rules would have made malta responsible for accepting any asylum applications .
in an interview with german public broadcaster ard , the ship ’ s captain confirmed the ship had approached malta , but only on " transit " to italy and that the government in valetta -lrb- the maltese capital -rrb- had no responsibility for the refugees .
officials at cap anamur said sunday that the refugees had applied for political asylum in germany .
the organization said the refugees ’ hand-written asylum applications would be promptly delivered to the responsible federal authority in the southern german city of nuremberg .
german government officials meanwhile said they did not believe the refugees could apply for asylum in the country , saying that the country the refugees first entered would have to decide about their applications .
plucked from the sea just over two weeks ago the 37 sudanese refugees were plucked from the sea off the coast of malta .
the german ship then set sail for the closest harbor - on the southern italian island of sicily .
initially the crew believed there would not be a problem , said bierdel .
" we did everything according to the book , asking for entry into the harbor and initially we got the go ahead .
but when we arrived we were held up by gun boats and helicopters .
i felt reminded of a maritime battle , " bierdel said .
while the german aid organization claims that no reason was given for the authorities ' change of heart , italian sources said that the information on the identity of the refugees was insufficient .
cap anamur has deplored the delay , saying that the ship could be rescuing other people instead of waiting for the resolution of this particular problem .
' we 're trying to save lives ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the 1970s , the cap anamur made a name for itself by saving as many as 8,000 so-called " boat people " refugees from vietnam " we are a humanitarian organization .

but authorities have arrested the ship 's captain and the head of the german aid group . after nearly three weeks on the german rescue ship " cap anamur , " the refugees , mostly from sudan , will now be brought to a refugee center near the italian town of agrigent , italian officials said on monday morning .
" port police has given us permission to enter the harbor , " stefan schmidt , the ship 's captain , told reporters , adding that the entrance to the harbor , porto empedocle in southern sicily , was no longer blocked by coast guards .
however the situation has become complicated with italian authorities taking the ship 's captain , stefan schmidt , and the organization 's head , elias bierdel , in for questioning about aiding illegal immigration , then arresting them .
on sunday , the italian government had permitted the ship to enter sicilian waters , italian news agency ansa reported .
it did not , however , allow the ship from the cologne-based relief organization to dock .
two ships from the italian coast guard were blocking entry to the port , according to the organization 's director bierdel , who referred to the action as " a degrading show of force . "
the ship 's captain had reported earlier that the situation on board was deteriorating rapidly , with some refugees threatening to jump overboard if the vessel didn ’ t dock soon .
the italian government , however , had strictly refused to take in the africans - mostly sudanese - because , it said , the ship had previously entered maltese territorial waters , which under eu rules would have made malta responsible for accepting any asylum applications .
in an interview with german public broadcaster ard , the ship ’ s captain confirmed the ship had approached malta , but only on " transit " to italy and that the government in valetta -lrb- the maltese capital -rrb- had no responsibility for the refugees .
officials at cap anamur said sunday that the refugees had applied for political asylum in germany .
the organization said the refugees ’ hand-written asylum applications would be promptly delivered to the responsible federal authority in the southern german city of nuremberg .
german government officials meanwhile said they did not believe the refugees could apply for asylum in the country , saying that the country the refugees first entered would have to decide about their applications .
plucked from the sea just over two weeks ago the 37 sudanese refugees were plucked from the sea off the coast of malta .
the german ship then set sail for the closest harbor - on the southern italian island of sicily .
initially the crew believed there would not be a problem , said bierdel .
" we did everything according to the book , asking for entry into the harbor and initially we got the go ahead .
but when we arrived we were held up by gun boats and helicopters .
i felt reminded of a maritime battle , " bierdel said .
while the german aid organization claims that no reason was given for the authorities ' change of heart , italian sources said that the information on the identity of the refugees was insufficient .
cap anamur has deplored the delay , saying that the ship could be rescuing other people instead of waiting for the resolution of this particular problem .
' we 're trying to save lives ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the 1970s , the cap anamur made a name for itself by saving as many as 8,000 so-called " boat people " refugees from vietnam " we are a humanitarian organization .

according to the state prosecutor 's office on monday , the officials were looking for material such as videos , dvd 's and publications which showed violent and degrading images .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a journalists photographs a raided closet in one of the mosque 's classrooms lead prosecutor hubert harth confirmed the search of the school , which is part of the taqwa mosque and its adjoining cultural association , but would not comment on any further details .
he told the german press that the authorities would now be busy sifting through the confiscated material and that it would probably take weeks before any conclusion could be drawn .
teaching fundamentalism authorities for the city launched the investigation after receiving a complaint from a female student at the school , who claimed children were being exposed to video material which offended human rights .
one of the videos mentioned allegedly showed a decapitation , another featured violence against women .
authorities had also registered complaints of female pupils being slapped as punishment at the school and treated in a degrading manner .
a spokeswoman for the prosecutor 's office in frankfurt told german public television that there were " indications that the school was calling for a holy war against non-believers and that violent images were used to illustrate the war . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayaozu ahmed ayaozu ahmed -lrb- photo -rrb- from the taqwa mosque vehemently rejected the accusations , saying the school had never shown violent material to its pupils and that its sole purpose was to teach children arabic so that they can read the koran .
" we have never shown such things .
we do n't even have a video player , " he told the media .
so-called koran schools , such as the one in frankfurt where 300 children are instructed in arabic and studies of the koran , enjoy a growing popularity in germany .
unlike regular public schools they do not fall under the supervision of the state school board and their is no control of the content of their teachings .

when he gets here , he 'll be facing a still-divided eu . at first , iraqi interim prime minister iyad alawi accepted the invitation of the european union ’ s dutch presidency to travel to brussels this monday to attend a regular meeting of the eu 's foreign ministers .
but sources in brussels said that alawi , who has served as head of the iraqi interim government since june 28 , was forced to cancel the trip because of the deteriorating security situation back home .
instead , he ’ ll be sending hoshyar zebari , who will attend a luncheon with the foreign ministers and discuss iraq ’ s wishes with the europeans .
the belgian capital had been planned as the first stop for alawi , who was also going to travel to a handful of middle eastern countries and britain .
the fact that he didn ’ t plan to make his first trip iraq ’ s former occupying power , the united states , has been seen in brussels as a sign that the iraqi interim government , which was created with the de facto support of the us and britain , is seeking to demonstrate its independence and to forge links with europe .
in brussels , zebari is also expected to visit nato headquarters .
at the nato summit in turkey two weeks ago , the alliance offered its iraq aid in developing its security forces .
however , the specifics of the deal – how that training will be provided and how expansive it will be – must still be negotiated .
germany has called for the training to be conducted outside of iraq and has , indeed , refused to send any troops inside the country for training or any other purpose .
instead , it is pushing for the training to happen at a nato school in the city of oberammergau .
in the preparations for the meeting with the iraqi foreign minister , the eu foreign ministers only succeeded in uniting on one front : a generally reserved statement offering iraq help with its reconstruction and the organization of free elections .
the brakes were applied to broader demands from britain and poland , which both have troops stationed in iraq , by war opponents germany and france , diplomats told deutsche welle .
few new developments expected it ’ s still unclear , for example , when the eu will open its own office in baghdad or when it will begin the training of police it has pledged .
since 2003 , the european union has made around € 305 million in aid payments to iraq .
in the coming year , it is expected to provide an additional € 200 million .
the foreign ministers are expected to confirm this sum again during zebari ’ s visit .
otherwise , the ministers are expected to discuss with zebari laws in iraq pertaining to states of emergency , the possibility of debt relief for iraq as well as the planning of a possible international iraq conference similar to the successful petersberg conference for afghanistan that was held near the german city of bonn .
peacekeeping on the agenda the eu foreign ministers are also expected on monday to decide on the structure of a future eu mission in bosnia-herzegovina .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato-led soldier guards entrance to a german peace keepers camp in the bosnian serb village of celebici near foca .
the eu is currently in the process of taking over leadership of the sfor peacekeeping mission from nato .
the mission will soon be renamed althea at the suggestion of the french .
after considerable delay , the international computer deployed a mass number of peacekeeping troops to stop the civil war between ethnic-religious groups in bosnia-herzegovina .
due to positive security developments in the region , the number of troops is expected to be reduced to 7,000 at the time of the command change .
but mostly , it will just be the name that ’ s changing – the same structure of troops will still be kept in place .
with althea , the eu will be taking command of its third peacekeeping job , following its leadership of missions in macedonia and the congo .
the duration of the eu deployment in bosnia-herzegovina hasn ’ t been determined , but a decision is expected during the second half of 2005 .
meanwhile , at the request of the united states , nato will remain present with its own headquarters in sarajevo , where it will advise the government and continue its hunt for war criminals .

he is currently traveling in the sudan , where he is discussing the condition of the refugees in the western sudan region of darfur and bordering chad with the government in khartoum .
government sources told deutsche welle that fischer ’ s trip is intended to send a signal to the eu that it is moving too slow in expressing its opinion on the crisis in darfur .

in europe , france and britain have both opposed sanctions .
and in the un security council , china and russian have both expressed their concerns about issuing sanctions against sudan .
in their view , the refugee problem is a " domestic concern " for the country .
however , following the recent visit by us secretary of state colin powell , washington also appears prepared to take more decisive action .
if the sudanese government refuses to negotiate in the coming weeks , the pressure will increase on the eu to take action . bernd riegert -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer wants action in crisis-plagued sudan foreign minister joschka fischer and his deputy , kerstin müller , travel to sudan on sunday for talks with sudan 's president omar el-bashir about ending violence in the darfur region .

when he gets here , he 'll be facing a still-divided eu . at first , iraqi interim prime minister iyad alawi accepted the invitation of the european union ’ s dutch presidency to travel to brussels this monday to attend a regular meeting of the eu 's foreign ministers .
but sources in brussels said that alawi , who has served as head of the iraqi interim government since june 28 , was forced to cancel the trip because of the deteriorating security situation back home .
instead , he ’ ll be sending hoshyar zebari , who will attend a luncheon with the foreign ministers and discuss iraq ’ s wishes with the europeans .
the belgian capital had been planned as the first stop for alawi , who was also going to travel to a handful of middle eastern countries and britain .
the fact that he didn ’ t plan to make his first trip iraq ’ s former occupying power , the united states , has been seen in brussels as a sign that the iraqi interim government , which was created with the de facto support of the us and britain , is seeking to demonstrate its independence and to forge links with europe .
in brussels , zebari is also expected to visit nato headquarters .
at the nato summit in turkey two weeks ago , the alliance offered its iraq aid in developing its security forces .
however , the specifics of the deal – how that training will be provided and how expansive it will be – must still be negotiated .
germany has called for the training to be conducted outside of iraq and has , indeed , refused to send any troops inside the country for training or any other purpose .
instead , it is pushing for the training to happen at a nato school in the city of oberammergau .
in the preparations for the meeting with the iraqi foreign minister , the eu foreign ministers only succeeded in uniting on one front : a generally reserved statement offering iraq help with its reconstruction and the organization of free elections .
the brakes were applied to broader demands from britain and poland , which both have troops stationed in iraq , by war opponents germany and france , diplomats told deutsche welle .
few new developments expected it ’ s still unclear , for example , when the eu will open its own office in baghdad or when it will begin the training of police it has pledged .
since 2003 , the european union has made around € 305 million in aid payments to iraq .
in the coming year , it is expected to provide an additional € 200 million .
the foreign ministers are expected to confirm this sum again during zebari ’ s visit .
otherwise , the ministers are expected to discuss with zebari laws in iraq pertaining to states of emergency , the possibility of debt relief for iraq as well as the planning of a possible international iraq conference similar to the successful petersberg conference for afghanistan that was held near the german city of bonn .
peacekeeping on the agenda the eu foreign ministers are also expected on monday to decide on the structure of a future eu mission in bosnia-herzegovina .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato-led soldier guards entrance to a german peace keepers camp in the bosnian serb village of celebici near foca .
the eu is currently in the process of taking over leadership of the sfor peacekeeping mission from nato .
the mission will soon be renamed althea at the suggestion of the french .
after considerable delay , the international computer deployed a mass number of peacekeeping troops to stop the civil war between ethnic-religious groups in bosnia-herzegovina .
due to positive security developments in the region , the number of troops is expected to be reduced to 7,000 at the time of the command change .
but mostly , it will just be the name that ’ s changing – the same structure of troops will still be kept in place .
with althea , the eu will be taking command of its third peacekeeping job , following its leadership of missions in macedonia and the congo .
the duration of the eu deployment in bosnia-herzegovina hasn ’ t been determined , but a decision is expected during the second half of 2005 .
meanwhile , at the request of the united states , nato will remain present with its own headquarters in sarajevo , where it will advise the government and continue its hunt for war criminals .
fischer in sudan germany ’ s foreign minister , joschka fischer , is not expected to take part in monday ’ s discussions .
he is currently traveling in the sudan , where he is discussing the condition of the refugees in the western sudan region of darfur and bordering chad with the government in khartoum .
government sources told deutsche welle that fischer ’ s trip is intended to send a signal to the eu that it is moving too slow in expressing its opinion on the crisis in darfur .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sudanese refugee walks past a dead donkey in a refugee camp in bahai on the chad , sudan border .
an estimated 1 million sudanese have been displaced during the conflict with arab militias .
in europe , france and britain have both opposed sanctions .
and in the un security council , china and russian have both expressed their concerns about issuing sanctions against sudan .
in their view , the refugee problem is a " domestic concern " for the country .
however , following the recent visit by us secretary of state colin powell , washington also appears prepared to take more decisive action .

at the nato summit in turkey two weeks ago , the alliance offered its iraq aid in developing its security forces .
however , the specifics of the deal – how that training will be provided and how expansive it will be – must still be negotiated .
germany has called for the training to be conducted outside of iraq and has , indeed , refused to send any troops inside the country for training or any other purpose .
instead , it is pushing for the training to happen at a nato school in the city of oberammergau .
in the preparations for the meeting with the iraqi foreign minister , the eu foreign ministers only succeeded in uniting on one front : a generally reserved statement offering iraq help with its reconstruction and the organization of free elections .
the brakes were applied to broader demands from britain and poland , which both have troops stationed in iraq , by war opponents germany and france , diplomats told deutsche welle .
few new developments expected it ’ s still unclear , for example , when the eu will open its own office in baghdad or when it will begin the training of police it has pledged .
since 2003 , the european union has made around € 305 million in aid payments to iraq .
in the coming year , it is expected to provide an additional € 200 million .
the foreign ministers are expected to confirm this sum again during zebari ’ s visit .
otherwise , the ministers are expected to discuss with zebari laws in iraq pertaining to states of emergency , the possibility of debt relief for iraq as well as the planning of a possible international iraq conference similar to the successful petersberg conference for afghanistan that was held near the german city of bonn .
peacekeeping on the agenda the eu foreign ministers are also expected on monday to decide on the structure of a future eu mission in bosnia-herzegovina .

the eu is currently in the process of taking over leadership of the sfor peacekeeping mission from nato .
the mission will soon be renamed althea at the suggestion of the french .
after considerable delay , the international computer deployed a mass number of peacekeeping troops to stop the civil war between ethnic-religious groups in bosnia-herzegovina .
due to positive security developments in the region , the number of troops is expected to be reduced to 7,000 at the time of the command change .
but mostly , it will just be the name that ’ s changing – the same structure of troops will still be kept in place .
with althea , the eu will be taking command of its third peacekeeping job , following its leadership of missions in macedonia and the congo .
the duration of the eu deployment in bosnia-herzegovina hasn ’ t been determined , but a decision is expected during the second half of 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.07.2004 -pipe- 08:00 utc french minister moots transatlantic treaty speaking at the 30th anniversary of a foreign affairs think tank in paris , french foreign minister michel barnier said that in the post cold-war world , the transatlantic relationship has become a " choice rather than a necessity . "
however , ties still need to be better organised to avoid spats like the one that occurred over iraq , he argued and he proposed that " a treaty could seal this renewed union . "
the idea of a new transatlantic treaty is not new - it was first proposed by the then foreign minister alain juppé 10 years ago .
" the last ten years have taken nothing away from its relevance , " barnier said , according to le figaro .
" in fact the opposite is true . "
the proposal comes as franco-us relations continue to be shaky .
although far removed from the depths plumbed during the iraq war , ties remain uneasy , with french president jacques chirac recently criticizing us president george bush in public for taking a stance over turkey 's eventual membership of the eu .
paris also recently annoyed the us by opposing the use of nato troops in iraq during a recent meeting .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.07.2004 iraqi foreign minister comes to brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoshyar zebari met his european colleagues for talks the eu 's foreign ministers are meeting on monday in brussels with iraq 's interim foreign minister .
when he gets here , he 'll be facing a still-divided eu . at first , iraqi interim prime minister iyad alawi accepted the invitation of the european union ’ s dutch presidency to travel to brussels this monday to attend a regular meeting of the eu 's foreign ministers .
but sources in brussels said that alawi , who has served as head of the iraqi interim government since june 28 , was forced to cancel the trip because of the deteriorating security situation back home .
instead , he ’ ll be sending hoshyar zebari , who will attend a luncheon with the foreign ministers and discuss iraq ’ s wishes with the europeans .
the belgian capital had been planned as the first stop for alawi , who was also going to travel to a handful of middle eastern countries and britain .
the fact that he didn ’ t plan to make his first trip iraq ’ s former occupying power , the united states , has been seen in brussels as a sign that the iraqi interim government , which was created with the de facto support of the us and britain , is seeking to demonstrate its independence and to forge links with europe .
in brussels , zebari is also expected to visit nato headquarters .
at the nato summit in turkey two weeks ago , the alliance offered its iraq aid in developing its security forces .
however , the specifics of the deal – how that training will be provided and how expansive it will be – must still be negotiated .
germany has called for the training to be conducted outside of iraq and has , indeed , refused to send any troops inside the country for training or any other purpose .
instead , it is pushing for the training to happen at a nato school in the city of oberammergau .
in the preparations for the meeting with the iraqi foreign minister , the eu foreign ministers only succeeded in uniting on one front : a generally reserved statement offering iraq help with its reconstruction and the organization of free elections .
the brakes were applied to broader demands from britain and poland , which both have troops stationed in iraq , by war opponents germany and france , diplomats told deutsche welle .
few new developments expected it ’ s still unclear , for example , when the eu will open its own office in baghdad or when it will begin the training of police it has pledged .
since 2003 , the european union has made around € 305 million in aid payments to iraq .
in the coming year , it is expected to provide an additional € 200 million .
the foreign ministers are expected to confirm this sum again during zebari ’ s visit .
otherwise , the ministers are expected to discuss with zebari laws in iraq pertaining to states of emergency , the possibility of debt relief for iraq as well as the planning of a possible international iraq conference similar to the successful petersberg conference for afghanistan that was held near the german city of bonn .
peacekeeping on the agenda the eu foreign ministers are also expected on monday to decide on the structure of a future eu mission in bosnia-herzegovina .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.07.2004 iraqi foreign minister comes to brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoshyar zebari met his european colleagues for talks the eu 's foreign ministers are meeting on monday in brussels with iraq 's interim foreign minister .
when he gets here , he 'll be facing a still-divided eu . at first , iraqi interim prime minister iyad alawi accepted the invitation of the european union ’ s dutch presidency to travel to brussels this monday to attend a regular meeting of the eu 's foreign ministers .
but sources in brussels said that alawi , who has served as head of the iraqi interim government since june 28 , was forced to cancel the trip because of the deteriorating security situation back home .
instead , he ’ ll be sending hoshyar zebari , who will attend a luncheon with the foreign ministers and discuss iraq ’ s wishes with the europeans .
the belgian capital had been planned as the first stop for alawi , who was also going to travel to a handful of middle eastern countries and britain .
the fact that he didn ’ t plan to make his first trip iraq ’ s former occupying power , the united states , has been seen in brussels as a sign that the iraqi interim government , which was created with the de facto support of the us and britain , is seeking to demonstrate its independence and to forge links with europe .
in brussels , zebari is also expected to visit nato headquarters .
at the nato summit in turkey two weeks ago , the alliance offered its iraq aid in developing its security forces .
however , the specifics of the deal – how that training will be provided and how expansive it will be – must still be negotiated .
germany has called for the training to be conducted outside of iraq and has , indeed , refused to send any troops inside the country for training or any other purpose .
instead , it is pushing for the training to happen at a nato school in the city of oberammergau .
in the preparations for the meeting with the iraqi foreign minister , the eu foreign ministers only succeeded in uniting on one front : a generally reserved statement offering iraq help with its reconstruction and the organization of free elections .
the brakes were applied to broader demands from britain and poland , which both have troops stationed in iraq , by war opponents germany and france , diplomats told deutsche welle .
few new developments expected it ’ s still unclear , for example , when the eu will open its own office in baghdad or when it will begin the training of police it has pledged .
since 2003 , the european union has made around € 305 million in aid payments to iraq .
in the coming year , it is expected to provide an additional € 200 million .
the foreign ministers are expected to confirm this sum again during zebari ’ s visit .
otherwise , the ministers are expected to discuss with zebari laws in iraq pertaining to states of emergency , the possibility of debt relief for iraq as well as the planning of a possible international iraq conference similar to the successful petersberg conference for afghanistan that was held near the german city of bonn .
peacekeeping on the agenda the eu foreign ministers are also expected on monday to decide on the structure of a future eu mission in bosnia-herzegovina .

but authorities have arrested the ship 's captain and the head of the german aid group . after nearly three weeks on the german rescue ship " cap anamur , " the refugees , mostly from sudan , will now be brought to a refugee center near the italian town of agrigent , italian officials said on monday morning .
" port police has given us permission to enter the harbor , " stefan schmidt , the ship 's captain , told reporters , adding that the entrance to the harbor , porto empedocle in southern sicily , was no longer blocked by coast guards .
however the situation has become complicated with italian authorities taking the ship 's captain , stefan schmidt , and the organization 's head , elias bierdel , in for questioning about aiding illegal immigration , then arresting them .
on sunday , the italian government had permitted the ship to enter sicilian waters , italian news agency ansa reported .
it did not , however , allow the ship from the cologne-based relief organization to dock .
two ships from the italian coast guard were blocking entry to the port , according to the organization 's director bierdel , who referred to the action as " a degrading show of force . "
the ship 's captain had reported earlier that the situation on board was deteriorating rapidly , with some refugees threatening to jump overboard if the vessel didn ’ t dock soon .
the italian government , however , had strictly refused to take in the africans - mostly sudanese - because , it said , the ship had previously entered maltese territorial waters , which under eu rules would have made malta responsible for accepting any asylum applications .
in an interview with german public broadcaster ard , the ship ’ s captain confirmed the ship had approached malta , but only on " transit " to italy and that the government in valetta -lrb- the maltese capital -rrb- had no responsibility for the refugees .
officials at cap anamur said sunday that the refugees had applied for political asylum in germany .
the organization said the refugees ’ hand-written asylum applications would be promptly delivered to the responsible federal authority in the southern german city of nuremberg .
german government officials meanwhile said they did not believe the refugees could apply for asylum in the country , saying that the country the refugees first entered would have to decide about their applications .
plucked from the sea just over two weeks ago the 37 sudanese refugees were plucked from the sea off the coast of malta .
the german ship then set sail for the closest harbor - on the southern italian island of sicily .
initially the crew believed there would not be a problem , said bierdel .
" we did everything according to the book , asking for entry into the harbor and initially we got the go ahead .
but when we arrived we were held up by gun boats and helicopters .
i felt reminded of a maritime battle , " bierdel said .
while the german aid organization claims that no reason was given for the authorities ' change of heart , italian sources said that the information on the identity of the refugees was insufficient .
cap anamur has deplored the delay , saying that the ship could be rescuing other people instead of waiting for the resolution of this particular problem .
' we 're trying to save lives ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the 1970s , the cap anamur made a name for itself by saving as many as 8,000 so-called " boat people " refugees from vietnam " we are a humanitarian organization .

we are very surprised to find the european union now uses gun boats to prevent us from doing that , " bierdel said .

he called on the government to act immediately . " the humanitarian catastrophe must be prevented , " he told reporters , saying the sudanese government must " arrest those responsible in darfur and open up humanitarian aid routes . " fischer , who arrived in khartoum late sunday , demanded the disarming of pro-government arab militias , which are seen as the cause of much of the instability in the region and have been accused by the united nations of carrying out a campaign of ethnic cleansing .
fischer called on the government to immediately rein in the militias . he said aid organizations must have free access to the crisis regions and that as soon as a peace agreement was put into place , germany and the european union would again offer support . " but darfur must be resolved , " he stressed . fischer also denied reports in the sudanese press that germany was aiding the insurgents in darfur " we are supporting no rebel group .
we are supporting no rebellion , " he said . khartoum agrees to act while the government has rejected accusations by aid groups that the government is still backing the arab militias that are responsible for most of the looting , destruction and ethnic evictions , president el-bashir said the government would disarm the militia groups and ismail assured reporters that that fischer 's demands would be met . " but what 's the hurry ? " he asked when journalists pressed him on a time frame . us secretary of state colin powell said during a visit last week that sudan would face global sanctions if it did not move to stop the violence . fischer arrived in darfur with 3.5 tons of medicine for darfur , enough for 1,000 people for a month .
travelling with him is deputy foreign minister kerstin müller .
while fischer is scheduled to fly back to germany on monday , müller will stay to visit the darfur region and assess the situation . rebellion and counter-rebellion the unrest stems from long-standing tension between nomadic arab tribesman and african farmers .
in february 2003 , two black african groups rebelled against the arab government in khartoum , demanding autonomy and more investment for the province .
pro-government arab janjaweed militia retaliated to the rebellion with brutal force , provoking what the united nations has called the world 's worst current humanitarian catastrophe .

the ship 's captain had reported earlier that the situation on board was deteriorating rapidly , with some refugees threatening to jump overboard if the vessel didn ’ t dock soon .

officials at cap anamur said sunday that the refugees had applied for political asylum in germany .
the organization said the refugees ’ hand-written asylum applications would be promptly delivered to the responsible federal authority in the southern german city of nuremberg .
german government officials meanwhile said they did not believe the refugees could apply for asylum in the country , saying that the country the refugees first entered would have to decide about their applications .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.07.2004 iraqi foreign minister comes to brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoshyar zebari met his european colleagues for talks the eu 's foreign ministers are meeting on monday in brussels with iraq 's interim foreign minister .
when he gets here , he 'll be facing a still-divided eu . at first , iraqi interim prime minister iyad alawi accepted the invitation of the european union ’ s dutch presidency to travel to brussels this monday to attend a regular meeting of the eu 's foreign ministers .
but sources in brussels said that alawi , who has served as head of the iraqi interim government since june 28 , was forced to cancel the trip because of the deteriorating security situation back home .
instead , he ’ ll be sending hoshyar zebari , who will attend a luncheon with the foreign ministers and discuss iraq ’ s wishes with the europeans .
the belgian capital had been planned as the first stop for alawi , who was also going to travel to a handful of middle eastern countries and britain .
the fact that he didn ’ t plan to make his first trip iraq ’ s former occupying power , the united states , has been seen in brussels as a sign that the iraqi interim government , which was created with the de facto support of the us and britain , is seeking to demonstrate its independence and to forge links with europe .
in brussels , zebari is also expected to visit nato headquarters .
at the nato summit in turkey two weeks ago , the alliance offered its iraq aid in developing its security forces .
however , the specifics of the deal – how that training will be provided and how expansive it will be – must still be negotiated .
germany has called for the training to be conducted outside of iraq and has , indeed , refused to send any troops inside the country for training or any other purpose .

when he gets here , he 'll be facing a still-divided eu . at first , iraqi interim prime minister iyad alawi accepted the invitation of the european union ’ s dutch presidency to travel to brussels this monday to attend a regular meeting of the eu 's foreign ministers .
but sources in brussels said that alawi , who has served as head of the iraqi interim government since june 28 , was forced to cancel the trip because of the deteriorating security situation back home .
instead , he ’ ll be sending hoshyar zebari , who will attend a luncheon with the foreign ministers and discuss iraq ’ s wishes with the europeans .
the belgian capital had been planned as the first stop for alawi , who was also going to travel to a handful of middle eastern countries and britain .
the fact that he didn ’ t plan to make his first trip iraq ’ s former occupying power , the united states , has been seen in brussels as a sign that the iraqi interim government , which was created with the de facto support of the us and britain , is seeking to demonstrate its independence and to forge links with europe .
in brussels , zebari is also expected to visit nato headquarters .
at the nato summit in turkey two weeks ago , the alliance offered its iraq aid in developing its security forces .
however , the specifics of the deal – how that training will be provided and how expansive it will be – must still be negotiated .
germany has called for the training to be conducted outside of iraq and has , indeed , refused to send any troops inside the country for training or any other purpose .

rules brought in at the end of last year meant jersey fishermen had to apply for licences to fish in a 12-mile area around the island .
in the past , they were allowed to fish in guernsey waters provided they held a licence from either jersey or the uk 's authorities .
last week guernsey 's royal court ruled the position was illegal , but now an appeal court has agreed to review the decision .
the jersey politician responsible for fishing , deputy mike taylor , says jersey fishermen will not give the waters up without a fight .

half the £ 5 seats sold for the welsh national opera 's -lrb- wno -rrb- debut show at the centre have been bought by first-timers .
the company says its first performance of la traviata in february 2005 - for which top ticket prices have also been slashed - has completely sold out .
the wno claims its strategy to bring in newcomers is working .
the company announced in march that it was going to cut prices at the wales millennium centre .
the new centre , which opens in november , boasts a 1,750-seat auditorium .
top price tickets were cut by 25 % to £ 35 , while the 250 cheapest seats cost as little as £ 5 - a reduction of 37 % and less than the price of many cinema tickets .
hundreds of newcomers will be introduced into opera as well as the opening night sell-out , mozart 's the magic flute on the first night of the wno 's summer season next may has already sold almost 50 % of the £ 5 seats .
wno marketing director lucy shorrocks said that reducing ticket prices had been considered " a risky thing to do " .
" but we are delighted that our confidence in our ability to bring many more people to opera through making prices accessible appears to be justified , " she said .
" by reducing our top-price tickets by £ 12 , and having so many fantastic seats available at only a fiver , we are succeeding in attracting many people who have not seen our work before . "
welsh national opera will move into the new £ 104m wales millennium centre when it opens at the end of this year .
the new base will mean that , for the first time , that the company 's rehearsal , administrative and performing base will be in one building .
it will also mean the end of a 50-year association with cardiff 's new theatre but the opera will carry on touring around the uk .
bryn terfel is to open the wales millennium centre , which will also be home to the diversions dance company and five other arts organisations , at a gala weekend . .
