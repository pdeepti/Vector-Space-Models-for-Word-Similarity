in recent years , germany has become less than fertile ground for start-up companies , as entrepreneurs have struggled to find funding .
despite the government ’ s new interest in innovation , that ’ s unlikely to change soon . the concept “ german entrepreneur ” may soon be an oxymoron . according to the german venture capital association -lrb- bvk -rrb- , ever fewer researchers and engineers are taking the step toward self-employment , simply because the financial risks have gotten too big . “ that has a negative impact on the crucial creation of a new generation of entrepreneurs focused on innovation and technology , ” bvk board member michael groß said at a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
he also said there was an “ extreme dearth of capital ” for start-ups . though germany has plenty of scientists and businessmen with decent ideas , the country has never been considered the world ’ s greatest place for a start-up .
a heavy reliance on bank lending and plenty of bureaucratic red tape have always handicapped entrepreneurs in their search for funding , however , as the “ new economy ” technology bubble burst a few years ago things have gone from bad to worse . the bvk said private equity investments of its 187 members in 2003 fell about four percent to € 2.6 billion -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- from the year before .
although the majority of that funding went to small and mid-sized firms , most was concentrated on established companies and corporate takeovers .
perhaps even more telling , the share of funding for high-tech companies has plummeted from 54 percent in 2000 to 25.4 percent last year . that could bode ill for german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s call to make 2004 a year of “ innovation ” and scientific research .
schröder hopes that encouraging new partnerships between science and industry could help boost the country ’ s economic growth .
but if the money for german start-ups continues to disappear , the new initiative will likely have difficulty producing substantive results , since big corporations have never been particularly known as hotbeds of innovation and new ideas . funding drying up according to the berlin daily newspaper der tagesspiegel , the government-backed technologie-beteiligungs-gesellschaft -lrb- tbg -rrb- venture capital fund for young high-tech companies is aware of the problem .
tbg ’ s michael brandkamp told the paper that only 40 percent of the firms supported by the fund are able to find continuing funding . “ it ’ s staggering how much the financing for start-ups has fallen , ” brandkamp said , adding investors have become reluctant after getting burned during the “ new economy ” boom .
“ the market is failing . ” der tagesspiegel reported that germany ’ s respected fraunhofer institute – which helped develop the mp3 digital music format – is also concerned that private start-up money is drying up . even those entrepreneurs that established their start-ups long before the high-tech crash on the stock market are having a hard time rounding up cash these days .
it is widely speculated that german software golden boy stephan schambach was forced to leave his company intershop earlier this month to help ease the search for an investor . the 33-year-old schambach founded intershop in 1992 and was long been considered the best example of the entrepreneurial spirit to emerge from eastern germany .

in recent years , germany has become less than fertile ground for start-up companies , as entrepreneurs have struggled to find funding .
despite the government ’ s new interest in innovation , that ’ s unlikely to change soon . the concept “ german entrepreneur ” may soon be an oxymoron . according to the german venture capital association -lrb- bvk -rrb- , ever fewer researchers and engineers are taking the step toward self-employment , simply because the financial risks have gotten too big . “ that has a negative impact on the crucial creation of a new generation of entrepreneurs focused on innovation and technology , ” bvk board member michael groß said at a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
he also said there was an “ extreme dearth of capital ” for start-ups . though germany has plenty of scientists and businessmen with decent ideas , the country has never been considered the world ’ s greatest place for a start-up .
a heavy reliance on bank lending and plenty of bureaucratic red tape have always handicapped entrepreneurs in their search for funding , however , as the “ new economy ” technology bubble burst a few years ago things have gone from bad to worse . the bvk said private equity investments of its 187 members in 2003 fell about four percent to € 2.6 billion -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- from the year before .
although the majority of that funding went to small and mid-sized firms , most was concentrated on established companies and corporate takeovers .
perhaps even more telling , the share of funding for high-tech companies has plummeted from 54 percent in 2000 to 25.4 percent last year . that could bode ill for german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s call to make 2004 a year of “ innovation ” and scientific research .
schröder hopes that encouraging new partnerships between science and industry could help boost the country ’ s economic growth .
but if the money for german start-ups continues to disappear , the new initiative will likely have difficulty producing substantive results , since big corporations have never been particularly known as hotbeds of innovation and new ideas . funding drying up according to the berlin daily newspaper der tagesspiegel , the government-backed technologie-beteiligungs-gesellschaft -lrb- tbg -rrb- venture capital fund for young high-tech companies is aware of the problem .
tbg ’ s michael brandkamp told the paper that only 40 percent of the firms supported by the fund are able to find continuing funding . “ it ’ s staggering how much the financing for start-ups has fallen , ” brandkamp said , adding investors have become reluctant after getting burned during the “ new economy ” boom .
“ the market is failing . ” der tagesspiegel reported that germany ’ s respected fraunhofer institute – which helped develop the mp3 digital music format – is also concerned that private start-up money is drying up . even those entrepreneurs that established their start-ups long before the high-tech crash on the stock market are having a hard time rounding up cash these days .
it is widely speculated that german software golden boy stephan schambach was forced to leave his company intershop earlier this month to help ease the search for an investor . the 33-year-old schambach founded intershop in 1992 and was long been considered the best example of the entrepreneurial spirit to emerge from eastern germany .

in recent years , germany has become less than fertile ground for start-up companies , as entrepreneurs have struggled to find funding .
despite the government ’ s new interest in innovation , that ’ s unlikely to change soon . the concept “ german entrepreneur ” may soon be an oxymoron . according to the german venture capital association -lrb- bvk -rrb- , ever fewer researchers and engineers are taking the step toward self-employment , simply because the financial risks have gotten too big . “ that has a negative impact on the crucial creation of a new generation of entrepreneurs focused on innovation and technology , ” bvk board member michael groß said at a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
he also said there was an “ extreme dearth of capital ” for start-ups . though germany has plenty of scientists and businessmen with decent ideas , the country has never been considered the world ’ s greatest place for a start-up .
a heavy reliance on bank lending and plenty of bureaucratic red tape have always handicapped entrepreneurs in their search for funding , however , as the “ new economy ” technology bubble burst a few years ago things have gone from bad to worse . the bvk said private equity investments of its 187 members in 2003 fell about four percent to € 2.6 billion -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- from the year before .
although the majority of that funding went to small and mid-sized firms , most was concentrated on established companies and corporate takeovers .
perhaps even more telling , the share of funding for high-tech companies has plummeted from 54 percent in 2000 to 25.4 percent last year . that could bode ill for german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s call to make 2004 a year of “ innovation ” and scientific research .
schröder hopes that encouraging new partnerships between science and industry could help boost the country ’ s economic growth .
but if the money for german start-ups continues to disappear , the new initiative will likely have difficulty producing substantive results , since big corporations have never been particularly known as hotbeds of innovation and new ideas . funding drying up according to the berlin daily newspaper der tagesspiegel , the government-backed technologie-beteiligungs-gesellschaft -lrb- tbg -rrb- venture capital fund for young high-tech companies is aware of the problem .
tbg ’ s michael brandkamp told the paper that only 40 percent of the firms supported by the fund are able to find continuing funding . “ it ’ s staggering how much the financing for start-ups has fallen , ” brandkamp said , adding investors have become reluctant after getting burned during the “ new economy ” boom .
“ the market is failing . ” der tagesspiegel reported that germany ’ s respected fraunhofer institute – which helped develop the mp3 digital music format – is also concerned that private start-up money is drying up . even those entrepreneurs that established their start-ups long before the high-tech crash on the stock market are having a hard time rounding up cash these days .
it is widely speculated that german software golden boy stephan schambach was forced to leave his company intershop earlier this month to help ease the search for an investor . the 33-year-old schambach founded intershop in 1992 and was long been considered the best example of the entrepreneurial spirit to emerge from eastern germany .

a heavy reliance on bank lending and plenty of bureaucratic red tape have always handicapped entrepreneurs in their search for funding , however , as the “ new economy ” technology bubble burst a few years ago things have gone from bad to worse . the bvk said private equity investments of its 187 members in 2003 fell about four percent to € 2.6 billion -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- from the year before .
although the majority of that funding went to small and mid-sized firms , most was concentrated on established companies and corporate takeovers .
perhaps even more telling , the share of funding for high-tech companies has plummeted from 54 percent in 2000 to 25.4 percent last year . that could bode ill for german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s call to make 2004 a year of “ innovation ” and scientific research .
schröder hopes that encouraging new partnerships between science and industry could help boost the country ’ s economic growth .
but if the money for german start-ups continues to disappear , the new initiative will likely have difficulty producing substantive results , since big corporations have never been particularly known as hotbeds of innovation and new ideas . funding drying up according to the berlin daily newspaper der tagesspiegel , the government-backed technologie-beteiligungs-gesellschaft -lrb- tbg -rrb- venture capital fund for young high-tech companies is aware of the problem .
tbg ’ s michael brandkamp told the paper that only 40 percent of the firms supported by the fund are able to find continuing funding . “ it ’ s staggering how much the financing for start-ups has fallen , ” brandkamp said , adding investors have become reluctant after getting burned during the “ new economy ” boom .
“ the market is failing . ” der tagesspiegel reported that germany ’ s respected fraunhofer institute – which helped develop the mp3 digital music format – is also concerned that private start-up money is drying up . even those entrepreneurs that established their start-ups long before the high-tech crash on the stock market are having a hard time rounding up cash these days .
it is widely speculated that german software golden boy stephan schambach was forced to leave his company intershop earlier this month to help ease the search for an investor . the 33-year-old schambach founded intershop in 1992 and was long been considered the best example of the entrepreneurial spirit to emerge from eastern germany .
but after wild growth throughout the 1990s , the company was plagued by operational problems and a sinking share price , which forced it to slash its staff and look for new financing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany falling behind in the technology race insufficient investment in education and research threatens germany 's high-tech standing in the world as fewer opt for degrees in the sciences .
the technology slump could have long-term economic ramifications .

in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau newspaper to be published on monday , struck said the conditions necessary for the involvement of the transatlantic alliance in iraq would n't be fulfilled for quite a long time .
he said a decision on a nato deployment could " maybe " happen next year .
at the same time he warned against expecting too much from any potential nato role in iraq .
" nato wo n't replace large numbers of troops , such as those currently deployed by poland , " struck said .
" the idea , say that 20,000 americans are replaced by nato soldiers is completely illusionary . "
the u.s. government hopes that the nato take part in stabilizing by as soon as this summer after the american-run administration begins to cede power to the iraqis . more briefs 13.02.2004 -pipe- german team wins biathlon gold 13.02.2004 -pipe- teachers trip on chocolate hash cake 13.02.2004 -pipe- spd popularity reaches record low 13.02.2004 -pipe- german parliament passes 2004 budget 12.02.2004 -pipe- berlin wall guards found guilty of manslaughter 12.02.2004 -pipe- hamburg 's justice minister stabbed 11.02.2004 -pipe- german court bans one-sided prenuptial agreements 11.02.2004 -pipe- berliners voted the worst drivers radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in recent years , germany has become less than fertile ground for start-up companies , as entrepreneurs have struggled to find funding .
despite the government ’ s new interest in innovation , that ’ s unlikely to change soon . the concept “ german entrepreneur ” may soon be an oxymoron . according to the german venture capital association -lrb- bvk -rrb- , ever fewer researchers and engineers are taking the step toward self-employment , simply because the financial risks have gotten too big . “ that has a negative impact on the crucial creation of a new generation of entrepreneurs focused on innovation and technology , ” bvk board member michael groß said at a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
he also said there was an “ extreme dearth of capital ” for start-ups . though germany has plenty of scientists and businessmen with decent ideas , the country has never been considered the world ’ s greatest place for a start-up .
a heavy reliance on bank lending and plenty of bureaucratic red tape have always handicapped entrepreneurs in their search for funding , however , as the “ new economy ” technology bubble burst a few years ago things have gone from bad to worse . the bvk said private equity investments of its 187 members in 2003 fell about four percent to € 2.6 billion -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- from the year before .
although the majority of that funding went to small and mid-sized firms , most was concentrated on established companies and corporate takeovers .
perhaps even more telling , the share of funding for high-tech companies has plummeted from 54 percent in 2000 to 25.4 percent last year . that could bode ill for german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s call to make 2004 a year of “ innovation ” and scientific research .
schröder hopes that encouraging new partnerships between science and industry could help boost the country ’ s economic growth .
but if the money for german start-ups continues to disappear , the new initiative will likely have difficulty producing substantive results , since big corporations have never been particularly known as hotbeds of innovation and new ideas . funding drying up according to the berlin daily newspaper der tagesspiegel , the government-backed technologie-beteiligungs-gesellschaft -lrb- tbg -rrb- venture capital fund for young high-tech companies is aware of the problem .
tbg ’ s michael brandkamp told the paper that only 40 percent of the firms supported by the fund are able to find continuing funding . “ it ’ s staggering how much the financing for start-ups has fallen , ” brandkamp said , adding investors have become reluctant after getting burned during the “ new economy ” boom .
“ the market is failing . ” der tagesspiegel reported that germany ’ s respected fraunhofer institute – which helped develop the mp3 digital music format – is also concerned that private start-up money is drying up . even those entrepreneurs that established their start-ups long before the high-tech crash on the stock market are having a hard time rounding up cash these days .
it is widely speculated that german software golden boy stephan schambach was forced to leave his company intershop earlier this month to help ease the search for an investor . the 33-year-old schambach founded intershop in 1992 and was long been considered the best example of the entrepreneurial spirit to emerge from eastern germany .

in recent years , germany has become less than fertile ground for start-up companies , as entrepreneurs have struggled to find funding .
despite the government ’ s new interest in innovation , that ’ s unlikely to change soon . the concept “ german entrepreneur ” may soon be an oxymoron . according to the german venture capital association -lrb- bvk -rrb- , ever fewer researchers and engineers are taking the step toward self-employment , simply because the financial risks have gotten too big . “ that has a negative impact on the crucial creation of a new generation of entrepreneurs focused on innovation and technology , ” bvk board member michael groß said at a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
he also said there was an “ extreme dearth of capital ” for start-ups . though germany has plenty of scientists and businessmen with decent ideas , the country has never been considered the world ’ s greatest place for a start-up .
a heavy reliance on bank lending and plenty of bureaucratic red tape have always handicapped entrepreneurs in their search for funding , however , as the “ new economy ” technology bubble burst a few years ago things have gone from bad to worse . the bvk said private equity investments of its 187 members in 2003 fell about four percent to € 2.6 billion -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- from the year before .
although the majority of that funding went to small and mid-sized firms , most was concentrated on established companies and corporate takeovers .
perhaps even more telling , the share of funding for high-tech companies has plummeted from 54 percent in 2000 to 25.4 percent last year . that could bode ill for german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s call to make 2004 a year of “ innovation ” and scientific research .
schröder hopes that encouraging new partnerships between science and industry could help boost the country ’ s economic growth .
but if the money for german start-ups continues to disappear , the new initiative will likely have difficulty producing substantive results , since big corporations have never been particularly known as hotbeds of innovation and new ideas . funding drying up according to the berlin daily newspaper der tagesspiegel , the government-backed technologie-beteiligungs-gesellschaft -lrb- tbg -rrb- venture capital fund for young high-tech companies is aware of the problem .
tbg ’ s michael brandkamp told the paper that only 40 percent of the firms supported by the fund are able to find continuing funding . “ it ’ s staggering how much the financing for start-ups has fallen , ” brandkamp said , adding investors have become reluctant after getting burned during the “ new economy ” boom .
“ the market is failing . ” der tagesspiegel reported that germany ’ s respected fraunhofer institute – which helped develop the mp3 digital music format – is also concerned that private start-up money is drying up . even those entrepreneurs that established their start-ups long before the high-tech crash on the stock market are having a hard time rounding up cash these days .
it is widely speculated that german software golden boy stephan schambach was forced to leave his company intershop earlier this month to help ease the search for an investor . the 33-year-old schambach founded intershop in 1992 and was long been considered the best example of the entrepreneurial spirit to emerge from eastern germany .

in recent years , germany has become less than fertile ground for start-up companies , as entrepreneurs have struggled to find funding .
despite the government ’ s new interest in innovation , that ’ s unlikely to change soon . the concept “ german entrepreneur ” may soon be an oxymoron . according to the german venture capital association -lrb- bvk -rrb- , ever fewer researchers and engineers are taking the step toward self-employment , simply because the financial risks have gotten too big . “ that has a negative impact on the crucial creation of a new generation of entrepreneurs focused on innovation and technology , ” bvk board member michael groß said at a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
he also said there was an “ extreme dearth of capital ” for start-ups . though germany has plenty of scientists and businessmen with decent ideas , the country has never been considered the world ’ s greatest place for a start-up .
a heavy reliance on bank lending and plenty of bureaucratic red tape have always handicapped entrepreneurs in their search for funding , however , as the “ new economy ” technology bubble burst a few years ago things have gone from bad to worse . the bvk said private equity investments of its 187 members in 2003 fell about four percent to € 2.6 billion -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- from the year before .
although the majority of that funding went to small and mid-sized firms , most was concentrated on established companies and corporate takeovers .
perhaps even more telling , the share of funding for high-tech companies has plummeted from 54 percent in 2000 to 25.4 percent last year . that could bode ill for german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s call to make 2004 a year of “ innovation ” and scientific research .
schröder hopes that encouraging new partnerships between science and industry could help boost the country ’ s economic growth .
but if the money for german start-ups continues to disappear , the new initiative will likely have difficulty producing substantive results , since big corporations have never been particularly known as hotbeds of innovation and new ideas . funding drying up according to the berlin daily newspaper der tagesspiegel , the government-backed technologie-beteiligungs-gesellschaft -lrb- tbg -rrb- venture capital fund for young high-tech companies is aware of the problem .
tbg ’ s michael brandkamp told the paper that only 40 percent of the firms supported by the fund are able to find continuing funding . “ it ’ s staggering how much the financing for start-ups has fallen , ” brandkamp said , adding investors have become reluctant after getting burned during the “ new economy ” boom .
“ the market is failing . ” der tagesspiegel reported that germany ’ s respected fraunhofer institute – which helped develop the mp3 digital music format – is also concerned that private start-up money is drying up . even those entrepreneurs that established their start-ups long before the high-tech crash on the stock market are having a hard time rounding up cash these days .
it is widely speculated that german software golden boy stephan schambach was forced to leave his company intershop earlier this month to help ease the search for an investor . the 33-year-old schambach founded intershop in 1992 and was long been considered the best example of the entrepreneurial spirit to emerge from eastern germany .

he also said there was an “ extreme dearth of capital ” for start-ups . though germany has plenty of scientists and businessmen with decent ideas , the country has never been considered the world ’ s greatest place for a start-up .
a heavy reliance on bank lending and plenty of bureaucratic red tape have always handicapped entrepreneurs in their search for funding , however , as the “ new economy ” technology bubble burst a few years ago things have gone from bad to worse . the bvk said private equity investments of its 187 members in 2003 fell about four percent to € 2.6 billion -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- from the year before .
although the majority of that funding went to small and mid-sized firms , most was concentrated on established companies and corporate takeovers .
perhaps even more telling , the share of funding for high-tech companies has plummeted from 54 percent in 2000 to 25.4 percent last year . that could bode ill for german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s call to make 2004 a year of “ innovation ” and scientific research .
schröder hopes that encouraging new partnerships between science and industry could help boost the country ’ s economic growth .
but if the money for german start-ups continues to disappear , the new initiative will likely have difficulty producing substantive results , since big corporations have never been particularly known as hotbeds of innovation and new ideas . funding drying up according to the berlin daily newspaper der tagesspiegel , the government-backed technologie-beteiligungs-gesellschaft -lrb- tbg -rrb- venture capital fund for young high-tech companies is aware of the problem .
tbg ’ s michael brandkamp told the paper that only 40 percent of the firms supported by the fund are able to find continuing funding . “ it ’ s staggering how much the financing for start-ups has fallen , ” brandkamp said , adding investors have become reluctant after getting burned during the “ new economy ” boom .
“ the market is failing . ” der tagesspiegel reported that germany ’ s respected fraunhofer institute – which helped develop the mp3 digital music format – is also concerned that private start-up money is drying up . even those entrepreneurs that established their start-ups long before the high-tech crash on the stock market are having a hard time rounding up cash these days .
it is widely speculated that german software golden boy stephan schambach was forced to leave his company intershop earlier this month to help ease the search for an investor . the 33-year-old schambach founded intershop in 1992 and was long been considered the best example of the entrepreneurial spirit to emerge from eastern germany .

in recent years , germany has become less than fertile ground for start-up companies , as entrepreneurs have struggled to find funding .
despite the government ’ s new interest in innovation , that ’ s unlikely to change soon . the concept “ german entrepreneur ” may soon be an oxymoron . according to the german venture capital association -lrb- bvk -rrb- , ever fewer researchers and engineers are taking the step toward self-employment , simply because the financial risks have gotten too big . “ that has a negative impact on the crucial creation of a new generation of entrepreneurs focused on innovation and technology , ” bvk board member michael groß said at a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
he also said there was an “ extreme dearth of capital ” for start-ups . though germany has plenty of scientists and businessmen with decent ideas , the country has never been considered the world ’ s greatest place for a start-up .
a heavy reliance on bank lending and plenty of bureaucratic red tape have always handicapped entrepreneurs in their search for funding , however , as the “ new economy ” technology bubble burst a few years ago things have gone from bad to worse . the bvk said private equity investments of its 187 members in 2003 fell about four percent to € 2.6 billion -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- from the year before .
although the majority of that funding went to small and mid-sized firms , most was concentrated on established companies and corporate takeovers .
perhaps even more telling , the share of funding for high-tech companies has plummeted from 54 percent in 2000 to 25.4 percent last year . that could bode ill for german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s call to make 2004 a year of “ innovation ” and scientific research .
schröder hopes that encouraging new partnerships between science and industry could help boost the country ’ s economic growth .
but if the money for german start-ups continues to disappear , the new initiative will likely have difficulty producing substantive results , since big corporations have never been particularly known as hotbeds of innovation and new ideas . funding drying up according to the berlin daily newspaper der tagesspiegel , the government-backed technologie-beteiligungs-gesellschaft -lrb- tbg -rrb- venture capital fund for young high-tech companies is aware of the problem .
tbg ’ s michael brandkamp told the paper that only 40 percent of the firms supported by the fund are able to find continuing funding . “ it ’ s staggering how much the financing for start-ups has fallen , ” brandkamp said , adding investors have become reluctant after getting burned during the “ new economy ” boom .
“ the market is failing . ” der tagesspiegel reported that germany ’ s respected fraunhofer institute – which helped develop the mp3 digital music format – is also concerned that private start-up money is drying up . even those entrepreneurs that established their start-ups long before the high-tech crash on the stock market are having a hard time rounding up cash these days .
it is widely speculated that german software golden boy stephan schambach was forced to leave his company intershop earlier this month to help ease the search for an investor . the 33-year-old schambach founded intershop in 1992 and was long been considered the best example of the entrepreneurial spirit to emerge from eastern germany .
but after wild growth throughout the 1990s , the company was plagued by operational problems and a sinking share price , which forced it to slash its staff and look for new financing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany falling behind in the technology race insufficient investment in education and research threatens germany 's high-tech standing in the world as fewer opt for degrees in the sciences .
the technology slump could have long-term economic ramifications .

in recent years , germany has become less than fertile ground for start-up companies , as entrepreneurs have struggled to find funding .
despite the government ’ s new interest in innovation , that ’ s unlikely to change soon . the concept “ german entrepreneur ” may soon be an oxymoron . according to the german venture capital association -lrb- bvk -rrb- , ever fewer researchers and engineers are taking the step toward self-employment , simply because the financial risks have gotten too big . “ that has a negative impact on the crucial creation of a new generation of entrepreneurs focused on innovation and technology , ” bvk board member michael groß said at a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
he also said there was an “ extreme dearth of capital ” for start-ups . though germany has plenty of scientists and businessmen with decent ideas , the country has never been considered the world ’ s greatest place for a start-up .
a heavy reliance on bank lending and plenty of bureaucratic red tape have always handicapped entrepreneurs in their search for funding , however , as the “ new economy ” technology bubble burst a few years ago things have gone from bad to worse . the bvk said private equity investments of its 187 members in 2003 fell about four percent to € 2.6 billion -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- from the year before .
although the majority of that funding went to small and mid-sized firms , most was concentrated on established companies and corporate takeovers .
perhaps even more telling , the share of funding for high-tech companies has plummeted from 54 percent in 2000 to 25.4 percent last year . that could bode ill for german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s call to make 2004 a year of “ innovation ” and scientific research .
schröder hopes that encouraging new partnerships between science and industry could help boost the country ’ s economic growth .
but if the money for german start-ups continues to disappear , the new initiative will likely have difficulty producing substantive results , since big corporations have never been particularly known as hotbeds of innovation and new ideas . funding drying up according to the berlin daily newspaper der tagesspiegel , the government-backed technologie-beteiligungs-gesellschaft -lrb- tbg -rrb- venture capital fund for young high-tech companies is aware of the problem .
tbg ’ s michael brandkamp told the paper that only 40 percent of the firms supported by the fund are able to find continuing funding . “ it ’ s staggering how much the financing for start-ups has fallen , ” brandkamp said , adding investors have become reluctant after getting burned during the “ new economy ” boom .
“ the market is failing . ” der tagesspiegel reported that germany ’ s respected fraunhofer institute – which helped develop the mp3 digital music format – is also concerned that private start-up money is drying up . even those entrepreneurs that established their start-ups long before the high-tech crash on the stock market are having a hard time rounding up cash these days .
it is widely speculated that german software golden boy stephan schambach was forced to leave his company intershop earlier this month to help ease the search for an investor . the 33-year-old schambach founded intershop in 1992 and was long been considered the best example of the entrepreneurial spirit to emerge from eastern germany .

in recent years , germany has become less than fertile ground for start-up companies , as entrepreneurs have struggled to find funding .
despite the government ’ s new interest in innovation , that ’ s unlikely to change soon . the concept “ german entrepreneur ” may soon be an oxymoron . according to the german venture capital association -lrb- bvk -rrb- , ever fewer researchers and engineers are taking the step toward self-employment , simply because the financial risks have gotten too big . “ that has a negative impact on the crucial creation of a new generation of entrepreneurs focused on innovation and technology , ” bvk board member michael groß said at a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
he also said there was an “ extreme dearth of capital ” for start-ups . though germany has plenty of scientists and businessmen with decent ideas , the country has never been considered the world ’ s greatest place for a start-up .
a heavy reliance on bank lending and plenty of bureaucratic red tape have always handicapped entrepreneurs in their search for funding , however , as the “ new economy ” technology bubble burst a few years ago things have gone from bad to worse . the bvk said private equity investments of its 187 members in 2003 fell about four percent to € 2.6 billion -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- from the year before .
although the majority of that funding went to small and mid-sized firms , most was concentrated on established companies and corporate takeovers .
perhaps even more telling , the share of funding for high-tech companies has plummeted from 54 percent in 2000 to 25.4 percent last year . that could bode ill for german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s call to make 2004 a year of “ innovation ” and scientific research .
schröder hopes that encouraging new partnerships between science and industry could help boost the country ’ s economic growth .
but if the money for german start-ups continues to disappear , the new initiative will likely have difficulty producing substantive results , since big corporations have never been particularly known as hotbeds of innovation and new ideas . funding drying up according to the berlin daily newspaper der tagesspiegel , the government-backed technologie-beteiligungs-gesellschaft -lrb- tbg -rrb- venture capital fund for young high-tech companies is aware of the problem .
tbg ’ s michael brandkamp told the paper that only 40 percent of the firms supported by the fund are able to find continuing funding . “ it ’ s staggering how much the financing for start-ups has fallen , ” brandkamp said , adding investors have become reluctant after getting burned during the “ new economy ” boom .
“ the market is failing . ” der tagesspiegel reported that germany ’ s respected fraunhofer institute – which helped develop the mp3 digital music format – is also concerned that private start-up money is drying up . even those entrepreneurs that established their start-ups long before the high-tech crash on the stock market are having a hard time rounding up cash these days .
it is widely speculated that german software golden boy stephan schambach was forced to leave his company intershop earlier this month to help ease the search for an investor . the 33-year-old schambach founded intershop in 1992 and was long been considered the best example of the entrepreneurial spirit to emerge from eastern germany .
but after wild growth throughout the 1990s , the company was plagued by operational problems and a sinking share price , which forced it to slash its staff and look for new financing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany falling behind in the technology race insufficient investment in education and research threatens germany 's high-tech standing in the world as fewer opt for degrees in the sciences .

research into intellectual property theft found that almost 70 % of people have stolen key information from work .
the most pilfered items include e-mail address books , customer databases as well as proposals and presentations .
many of those questioned said they used office e-mail to get the stolen information off company premises .
lost prospects most of those stealing important information said they did so when they were leaving a firm to take up a new job .
the majority of those questioned , 72 % , had no ethical problems stealing information to help them in a new post .
most , 58 % , thought that , in moral terms , it ranked with exaggerating insurance claims .
" the surprising thing is the level to which people believe this is acceptable , " said chris watson of data forensics firm ibas , which commissioned the survey .
he said that many thought that they were entitled to take information with them because they had helped win customers and create databases of sales leads .
" they have invested a lot of time putting it together and that 's why they feel they have ownership of it , " he said .
over 80 % of those surveyed said this input justifted their theft .
" the classic case is in sales environments where the contacts database is taken from one company to another even if it is not relevant to that business , " he said .
the survey found that 30 % of people had stolen a contact database when they left an employer .
" when people used to leave a company they would take a few pencils with them , " he said , " but the computer age is taking it on to a new level . "
many of those stealing from companies send the purloined data to their personal e-mail account held at home or on the web .
a small number , 21 % , burned the information onto cds .
the survey also revealed some gender biases .
women were 20 % more likely to think that taking key documents and files was acceptable but men were 28 % more likely to go through with the theft .
mr watson said filtering tools on e-mail servers could catch some of the intellectual property thieves but just as important were well-enforced policies that reminded employees of their obligations and responsibilities .

the city hall said it had married some 900 gay couples over the past three days and expected to issue hundreds more licences for wedding ceremonies .
mayor gavin newsom took the decision on thursday on the grounds that the ban was a form of discrimination .
a legal challenge to the move by anti-gay-groups is to be heard on tuesday .
no us state allows same-sex marriage , however , san francisco has long been a pioneer in gay rights legislation .
i had this image of getting married on valentine 's day .
i 'm just tickled to death lory duncan in pictures : gay weddings the mayor 's decision puts officials centre stage in an intensifying national debate over same-sex marriage , the bbc 's david willis in california says .
president bush is among those opposed to it , and it is thought he may soon endorse a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage , our correspondent adds .
gay valentine news of the mayor 's decision to issue marriage licences to gay couples prompted hundreds to converge on city hall .
the mayor said he was confident he would win the legal battle the first in the line were phyllis lyon , 79 , and del martin , 83 , who celebrate 51 years together on valentine 's day .
they became the first same-sex couple in america to wed legally .
" couples are coming from as far away as new york and minnesota to be married here , " san francisco 's city hall official told the afp news agency .
" we married 87 couple on thursday , 590 yesterday -lrb- friday -rrb- and at least 200 today -lrb- saturday -rrb- so far , " the official said .
gay couples accompanied by their friends had been waiting for hours to get married - as queues stretched several blocs away from the city hall .
the authorities were forced to bring in extra staff to cope with the demand .
the mayor 's decision was hailed by gay couples around america , many of whom rushed to san francisco .
" we found out from our friends -lrb- on thursday -rrb- afternoon and flew up from los angeles last night as soon as we could , " wendy higgins-goodell was quoted as saying by reuters news agency .
" we 've waited 13 years for this , " added ms higgins-goodell , as she was holding the daughter her partner tristan gave birth to last year via artificial insemination .

seasonal harvesting jim hosking , chairman of the bulbgrowers of cornwall , is a daffodil grower .
he is pleased that the government has increased the numbers of work permits available and that he can now recruit pickers when he needs them .

allegations by greeks that they were treated as slaves on a flower farm in cornwall has also highlighted the growing demand for immigrant labour at a time of near full employment , and the potential for exploitation .
av produce , based at dartford in kent , is particularly busy at this time of year packing vegetables such as spring greens and cauliflower .
many of the workers are from outside the european union including some from latvia .
they are working legitimately under a recently expanded government scheme which allows 25,000 immigrants each year to come to the uk for seasonal agricultural work .
" it is good - we get much more than we can in latvia - we are allowed to stay up to six months - i like england , " said one worker .
seasonal harvesting jim hosking , chairman of the bulbgrowers of cornwall , is a daffodil grower .
he is pleased that the government has increased the numbers of work permits available and that he can now recruit pickers when he needs them .
mr hosking highlights the pressures resulting from highly seasonal harvesting work : " the good news is that there is much less unemployment in cornwall so there are n't the number of people we require standing about waiting for a job .
workers are often needed at short notice to pick cauliflowers " we need about 5,000 people at this time of year quite suddenly and we have n't got large conurbations where we can get busloads of people who can come out and do the work .
" so the gangmasters who bring teams down are essential and by and large do an excellent job of work " .
but he was shocked by allegations of " slave " labour at a flower farm near hayle in cornwall .
fifty greek nationals returned home after their wages failed to materialise .
the boss of the firm which brought the flower pickers over said his business was totally legal , and has claimed the workers simply did not want to work paperwork requests the gangmasters , who provide labour in agriculture and horticulture , are obliged to check the work permits of their immigrant workers .
so are the farmers and other employers who recruit from the gangmasters .
but as sean levy of the national farmers union says this is not always so straightforward .
" if you 've suddenly got a crop of strawberries or cauliflowers which you need picking and you need a hundred people at half past six on a cold morning , then checking the sort of paperwork the home office envisages makes you think about an easier way of making a living " .
if you are talking about the gross value of the -lrb- informal -rrb- business being conducted then it might well be at the top end of the scale lord grabiner at the other end of the chain supermarkets demand a ready supply of fruit and vegetables for the shelves .
this in turn puts more pressure on suppliers to deliver at short notice and with the lid kept on prices .
michael jack mp , chairs the commons agriculture select committee , which has carried out an investigation of the role of gangmasters .
he highlights a factor which might lead food producers to cut corners .
" the growing pressure of working seven days a week for the supermarkets who at the last minute can change substantial orders - it requires farmers and growers to have a flexible approach as far as labour is concerned to meet those demands on their business .
" some have strayed into illegal solutions to cut their costs and stay in business " .
big business no-one knows how widespread the murky world of illegal employment is .
four years ago the lawyer lord grabiner was asked by the chancellor to investigate what was described as the informal economy .
he said it could be worth anything from £ 2bn to £ 10bn per year .

the bbc has learnt the metropolitan police investigation looked at children who came through heathrow airport with adults who were not their parents .
until recently few checks have been made by immigration at the airport .
campaigners fear thousands of children are being used as domestic slaves after being brought into britain .
children often arrive at heathrow accompanied not by parents but by adults who claim to be uncles or aunts .
' hot ' addresses sometimes the children arrive alone at the airport and go through immigration to be met by adults who claim to be relatives .
the metropolitan police launched operation palladin child last september and for the next three months they went and knocked on the doors of the addresses given by the children when they passed through immigration .
the police focused only on a sample of addresses which they thought were suspicious . "
the children would be all lined up at heathrow with bits of paper hanging from around their necks " operation palladin child source neither the metropolitan police or the immigration service would officially release the findings but bbc radio five live understands the children could not be found at up to 30 of the addresses visited during that three month period .
police discovered that in some cases the same address had been given by successive children who could not be traced .
some of the houses they visited were so called " hot " addresses which means they were already associated with criminals .
several addresses were well known to officers who work on operation trident which targets gun crime in the black community .
' aunts ' and ' uncles ' the vast majority of the children were from nigeria , which is well known among law enforcement officials as being the main source for trafficked children into britain .
" for years these children have been arriving at heathrow and we 've been sending them through without having a clue where they were going to , " said a source familiar with the investigation , who declined to be named .
" sometimes the children would be all lined up at heathrow with bits of paper hanging from around their necks , these were letters supposedly from their parents saying it was all right to pass them through immigration to their so called uncles at the other side .
" we 've been doing this for years without knowing what 's happening to these kids , " he said .
the police operation found that up to 190 unaccompanied children pass through heathrow airport every week .
campaigners say child slavery is rife in britain .
debbie ariyo of africans against child abuse said : " they are used mainly as free child care .
" they are brought into this country to look after the children of african couples living in this country .
" back home it is the culture to use children for domestic work .
but here they do n't go to school , they have to work all day and they are then at risk from abuse . "

cornwall county council is carrying out the research in partnership with devon , torbay and plymouth councils .
the review is to include surveys of residents .
a conference will also be held later in the month .
at the meeting , dentists , health representatives and speakers from regional dental bodies will discuss the difficulties some people face in getting access to an nhs dentist .
the survey will examine whether the problem is worse in the south west than in other parts of the country .
it will also look at the long-term impact the problem is having on dental care , particularly among children and pregnant women .

the suggestion has been made by two harrogate councillors who are investigating ways of keeping the town 's historic starbeck baths open .
the pool , in spa lane , came under threat of closure as the council tried to make cutbacks in its budget .
council chiefs thought the cost of renovating the 130-year-old victorian building , at nearly £ 1m , was too high .
access to funding but the conservative administration decided to set up a working party to examine the pool 's future .
the party will report back in july but councillors jim clark and fred willis believe a not-for-profit trust could be the way forward .
councillor clark says a pool in newcastle was saved by a trust and tadcaster swimming pool has always been using such procedures .
he also argues that setting up a trust would give starbeck access to funds which are not available to the council .
the only other public swimming pool in harrogate is the hydro on jennyfield drive which was opened in 1999 .
