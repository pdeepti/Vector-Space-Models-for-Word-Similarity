" a peaceful afghanistan is an anchor for greater political stability in the region and a sign of hope for us all , " schröder told the assembled dignitaries and press .

" the positive developments in afghanistan show what can be achieved when we combine our efforts , " he said .
" every success that we score in bringing afghanistan on a path towards more freedom and security is not only progress for people in the country .
it is a success for us all . " in his speech later in the day , karzai said his country had come a long way since the fall of the taliban , with a constitution that reflected a desire to be partners with the international community and no longer " threatened by drugs and terrorism .

it will also tackle the problems of insecurity and drugs production plaguing the country despite the ousting of the taliban regime more than two years ago . chancellor schröder highlighted the three main goals of the conference : to support the political progress , including elections planned for september ; to increase aid for the country 's reconstruction ; and to help the kabul government establish security and the rule of law . schröder rallies international community he also used the speech to rally those countries that had already supported reconstruction efforts in afghanistan by reminding the hundreds of delegates , including 20 foreign ministers and officials from more than 60 countries and organizations , that there had been many successes in spite of the difficult conditions that still prevailed . " the positive developments in afghanistan show what can be achieved when we combine our efforts , " he said .
" every success that we score in bringing afghanistan on a path towards more freedom and security is not only progress for people in the country .
it is a success for us all . " in his speech later in the day , karzai said his country had come a long way since the fall of the taliban , with a constitution that reflected a desire to be partners with the international community and no longer " threatened by drugs and terrorism . " " what we have achieved is very promising , but let me be frank and say that the reconstruction has only begun , " karzai told the gathering . federal government extends financial aid bildunterschrift : on the subject of financial assistance , schröder vowed that germany would contribute € 320 million -lrb- $ 389.5 million -rrb- over the next four years to boost the reconstruction process in afghanistan .
the amount of financial aid by the german government since september 2001 will eventually total € 7.4 billion . sadako ogata , japan 's envoy to afghanistan , followed schröder 's lead by pledging $ 400 million -lrb- € 328.6 million -rrb- over the next two years .
" i am pleased to announce that japan is prepared to make further grant assistance amounting to $ 400 million over the coming two years , which brings japan 's contribution since september 2001 to over $ 1 billion , " she said .
earlier this month , japan said its financial assistance to afghanistan had reached $ 683 million , exceeding an initial pledge of $ 500 million . reconstruction funds a priority before the conference began , officials from participating countries and organizations spoke hopefully of raising $ 4 billion after afghan ministers called for more direct aid and investment .
afghan finance minister ashraf ghani told the handelsblatt business daily on tuesday that he was content with the international commitment so far , but more was necessary . he said earlier this month that $ 27.5 billion would be needed in the next seven years and previous promises " vastly underestimated " afghanistan 's needs . reconstruction minister amin farhang added in an interview with germany 's inforadio that he hoped the promised money would go directly to the kabul government instead of mainly to non-governmental organizations .
farhang told the radio station that afghanistan needed around $ 4.5 billion for this year , which would help train the afghan army and police force to tackle the rampant drugs problem controlled largely by influential provincial warlords . germany 's pledge of more financial aid came hours after u.s. secretary of state colin powell praised german efforts in aiding afghanistan . powell praises german efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : powell praised german efforts .
in an article in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , powell said , " it is in no small part thanks to germany 's engagement that afghanistan has made the progress it has that we want to pay tribute to at this international conference . "
" germany has shown vision and leadership quality , " he added .
" germany can be especially proud of the stationing of bundeswehr soldiers in kunduz , where the german soldiers were the first to lead a provincial reconstruction team in the framework of isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- .

by the time he returned , he had made up his mind : europe ’ s biggest media group must immediately boost its position on the asian markets in order to profit from the dynamic growth in the region .
in china and india , bertelsmann has already set up shop . in the beijing region , for example , the group has already brought in 1.5 million members for its chinese-language book club .
and that 's only the beginning .

" that ’ s the same amount of books as we sell in france .
the turnover , however , is only a tenth in china , because there a book costs $ 1.5 while it costs $ 15 in france .
that ’ s the big difference and the reason for this is that the chinese market is still being regulated , " thielen said . " but once that starts changing , the prices will increase and so will our turnover .
in a long term perspective of 10 or 15 years , we will multiply our sales in asia and at some point it will represent at least 10 percent of our revenues , " he added .
the company still has a long way to go .
of its approximately € 17 billion in revenues last year , just € 2 billion came from sales in asia .
with a string of new investments , bertelsmann is seeking to increase its market share .
in china , bertelsmann wants to invest heavily in printing and publishing houses .

still , business there is only just starting for the media group and the future looks promising , as india currently has growth rates of 7-8 percent per year - nearly comparable to those in china .
both are markets that bring euros to the eyes of bertelsmann managers .
" together they have a population of 2.4 billion people thus representing a third of the world population , " he said .
" this must become a market one day .
of course if you compare these countries to america , they are still dwarfs .
but if you look at their growth rates it ’ s clear that we must closely watch these markets .
and i am positive that we will increasingly position ourselves there . "
today the media giant only makes 3 percent of its turnover in asia , that ’ s around € 600 million per year .
and only 1 percent - about € 200 million - are being earned in eastern europe , which bertelsmann also views as a promising market for its television , publishing and printing operations .
currently , germany remains one of bertelsmann 's most important markets .
a third of the company 's overall turnover is made here , with 40 percent coming from the rest of europe and 25 percent in the united states and canada .
only 3 percent of revenues are currently derived from its asian units .

europe 's new counter-terrorism chief gijs de vries reported to work this week amid enduring questions over the exact nature of his work and his plans to keep europe safe . gijs de vries , a relatively low-profile former dutch interior minister and member of the european parliament , was appointed europe 's first " anti-terrorism czar " last week .
the post , created amid a surge of european unity following the madrid bombings and after years of talks on the necessity of such a position , is a strong sign that european anti-terrorism efforts have taken on a new urgency .
introduced at a packed news briefing in brussels on tuesday this week , the eu 's new counter-terorism chief has attracted much attention .
but by his second day on the job , otto schily , germany 's interior minister - who was in brussels for a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers - was asking for further clarification of de vries ' new duties and his future plans .
indeed , the appointment of this experienced yet relatively unknown european politician has left many raising the same questions .
an experienced european technocrat the 48-year-old gijs de vries was born in new york and has a respected career in european politics behind him .
de vries served as a liberal member of the european parliament for fourteen years , before taking the position of interior minister in the netherlands .
the dual u.s.-dutch citizen is fluent in several languages , including french , german and english , and he holds degrees from the university of leiden and the european university institute in florence , italy .
though de vries has relatively little experience in security and intelligence matters , which has given some commentators food for thought , he is described by others as an experienced technocrat .
de vries will have to call upon all of his faculties , which include a diplomatic and businesslike manner as well as extensive political knowledge , to implement the task he has been charged with : helping to safeguard europe 's security in an ever-more insecure world .
officially , de vries will be responsible for seeing that the various government bodies of eu member states and eu institutions in brussels work together to pool resources and intelligence .
namely , he has been charged with what romano prodi , the president of the european commission , has described as " breaking down the cultural obstacles to cooperation " .
what 's more , de vries can use his position to apply political pressure to eu members who lag behind in implementing the anti-terror measures that have already been agreed upon .
de vries has already promised to improve cooperation between european countries .
' ' terror is not just the concern of an intelligence agency in one nation , so the information gained must be shared by all nations , " he said .
a higher profile in the coming months how this still somewhat vague job description will translate into action remains to be seen during the coming months .
de vries ' plans will become more apparent in june , when he presents more specific proposals to eu heads of state at the next eu-wide summit in june .
but in his first days on the job , de vries has made some statements indicating his position on certain key issues .
notably , while pushing for the better exchange of resources and analysis , de vries said that increased efforts to fight terror in europe can not forfeit civil liberties .
" there can never be , in any society , a guarantee of 100 percent security , " de vries told reporters on tuesday after meeting with his boss , javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief .

the post , created amid a surge of european unity following the madrid bombings and after years of talks on the necessity of such a position , is a strong sign that european anti-terrorism efforts have taken on a new urgency .
introduced at a packed news briefing in brussels on tuesday this week , the eu 's new counter-terorism chief has attracted much attention .
but by his second day on the job , otto schily , germany 's interior minister - who was in brussels for a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers - was asking for further clarification of de vries ' new duties and his future plans .
indeed , the appointment of this experienced yet relatively unknown european politician has left many raising the same questions .
an experienced european technocrat the 48-year-old gijs de vries was born in new york and has a respected career in european politics behind him .
de vries served as a liberal member of the european parliament for fourteen years , before taking the position of interior minister in the netherlands .
the dual u.s.-dutch citizen is fluent in several languages , including french , german and english , and he holds degrees from the university of leiden and the european university institute in florence , italy .
though de vries has relatively little experience in security and intelligence matters , which has given some commentators food for thought , he is described by others as an experienced technocrat .
de vries will have to call upon all of his faculties , which include a diplomatic and businesslike manner as well as extensive political knowledge , to implement the task he has been charged with : helping to safeguard europe 's security in an ever-more insecure world .
officially , de vries will be responsible for seeing that the various government bodies of eu member states and eu institutions in brussels work together to pool resources and intelligence .
namely , he has been charged with what romano prodi , the president of the european commission , has described as " breaking down the cultural obstacles to cooperation " .
what 's more , de vries can use his position to apply political pressure to eu members who lag behind in implementing the anti-terror measures that have already been agreed upon .
de vries has already promised to improve cooperation between european countries .
' ' terror is not just the concern of an intelligence agency in one nation , so the information gained must be shared by all nations , " he said .
a higher profile in the coming months how this still somewhat vague job description will translate into action remains to be seen during the coming months .
de vries ' plans will become more apparent in june , when he presents more specific proposals to eu heads of state at the next eu-wide summit in june .
but in his first days on the job , de vries has made some statements indicating his position on certain key issues .
notably , while pushing for the better exchange of resources and analysis , de vries said that increased efforts to fight terror in europe can not forfeit civil liberties .
" there can never be , in any society , a guarantee of 100 percent security , " de vries told reporters on tuesday after meeting with his boss , javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief . " we are living in an open society in europe , an open society in which people can enjoy many liberties , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.03.2004 bertelsmann plans asia push großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's biggest media company wants to become a household name in asia despite a global slump on the advertising and music market , europe ’ s biggest media group , germany-based bertelsmann , is looking towards black ink and a major expansion in asia this year . earlier this year bertelsmann chairman gunter thielen traveled to china , india and vietnam to explore business opportunities there .
by the time he returned , he had made up his mind : europe ’ s biggest media group must immediately boost its position on the asian markets in order to profit from the dynamic growth in the region .
in china and india , bertelsmann has already set up shop . in the beijing region , for example , the group has already brought in 1.5 million members for its chinese-language book club .
and that 's only the beginning .
a million served bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gunter thielen " our team currently sells 20 million books in china , " thielen said tuesday at the company 's board meeting .
" that ’ s the same amount of books as we sell in france .
the turnover , however , is only a tenth in china , because there a book costs $ 1.5 while it costs $ 15 in france .
that ’ s the big difference and the reason for this is that the chinese market is still being regulated , " thielen said . " but once that starts changing , the prices will increase and so will our turnover .
in a long term perspective of 10 or 15 years , we will multiply our sales in asia and at some point it will represent at least 10 percent of our revenues , " he added .
the company still has a long way to go .
of its approximately € 17 billion in revenues last year , just € 2 billion came from sales in asia .
with a string of new investments , bertelsmann is seeking to increase its market share .
in china , bertelsmann wants to invest heavily in printing and publishing houses .
" we will stay away from the music sector , " he said .
" the bootleg system is so sophisticated in china , you can purchase a disc for $ 1 at any corner there .
that ’ s why it doesn ’ t make sense for us to produce discs in china . "
a fast growing market in india , bertelsmann ’ s random house publishing arm , as well as the printing subsidiary arvato , is already active .
still , business there is only just starting for the media group and the future looks promising , as india currently has growth rates of 7-8 percent per year - nearly comparable to those in china .
both are markets that bring euros to the eyes of bertelsmann managers .

by the time he returned , he had made up his mind : europe ’ s biggest media group must immediately boost its position on the asian markets in order to profit from the dynamic growth in the region .
in china and india , bertelsmann has already set up shop . in the beijing region , for example , the group has already brought in 1.5 million members for its chinese-language book club .
and that 's only the beginning .
a million served bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gunter thielen " our team currently sells 20 million books in china , " thielen said tuesday at the company 's board meeting .
" that ’ s the same amount of books as we sell in france .
the turnover , however , is only a tenth in china , because there a book costs $ 1.5 while it costs $ 15 in france .
that ’ s the big difference and the reason for this is that the chinese market is still being regulated , " thielen said . " but once that starts changing , the prices will increase and so will our turnover .
in a long term perspective of 10 or 15 years , we will multiply our sales in asia and at some point it will represent at least 10 percent of our revenues , " he added .
the company still has a long way to go .
of its approximately € 17 billion in revenues last year , just € 2 billion came from sales in asia .
with a string of new investments , bertelsmann is seeking to increase its market share .
in china , bertelsmann wants to invest heavily in printing and publishing houses .
" we will stay away from the music sector , " he said .
" the bootleg system is so sophisticated in china , you can purchase a disc for $ 1 at any corner there .
that ’ s why it doesn ’ t make sense for us to produce discs in china . "
a fast growing market in india , bertelsmann ’ s random house publishing arm , as well as the printing subsidiary arvato , is already active .
still , business there is only just starting for the media group and the future looks promising , as india currently has growth rates of 7-8 percent per year - nearly comparable to those in china .
both are markets that bring euros to the eyes of bertelsmann managers .
" together they have a population of 2.4 billion people thus representing a third of the world population , " he said .
" this must become a market one day .
of course if you compare these countries to america , they are still dwarfs .
but if you look at their growth rates it ’ s clear that we must closely watch these markets .
and i am positive that we will increasingly position ourselves there . "

on wednesday , international leaders will meet in berlin to take stock of rebuilding efforts in afghanistan .
reconstruction financing and a booming opium trade remain major challenges . afghan leader hamid karzai and his trademark head covering will take center stage in berlin on wednesday , when 54 nations meet to analyze the progress and problems in afghanistan three years after the fall of the taliban . karzai , in the german capital on tuesday , highlighted his country 's battle with drug lords and dwindling financial resources as the major talking points at the two-day conference , which will be attended by u.s. secretary of state colin powell . " we will be asking -lrb- the international community -rrb- to increase their assistance to afghanistan in order for all of us to succeed in bringing about a safer , better , standing-on-its-own-feet afghanistan , " karzai told reporters after meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder , according to reuters . germany ready for the long haul the afghan leader has already picked up important pledges from german officials .
schröder , whose country has 1,900 peacekeeping troops in kabul and the northern city of kunduz , said germany was prepared to stay in the war-torn country for the long haul . bildunterschrift : schröder and karzai met on tuesday , on the eve of the two-day conference . germany has provided roughly € 80 million -lrb- $ 97 million -rrb- in aid each year since 2002 .
on wednesday , german officials are expected to announce that they will continue their aid program until 2008 . the united states , the biggest donor ahead of germany and japan , will most likely offer $ 1 billion on top of the $ 1.2 billion it has already pledged this year .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said tuesday that the leading donor countries hope other countries will pledge more aid . afghan leaders estimate that $ 27.5 billion is needed over the next seven years for reconstruction .
donors worldwide have so far pledged $ 4.2 billion through 2004 . " we obviously hope we will gather as large a sum as possible , " fischer told reporters . afghan opium flooding world markets not only financial woes , but the country 's growing drug problem are likely to be major discussion points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poppy field in afghanistan far more lucrative than wheat fields and growable even in the substandard afghani soil , experts estimate opium production makes up roughly half of the country 's € 4.4 billion gross domestic product and poses a significant security problem . " through that , warlords and terrorist finance themselves , " says general rick hillier , who commands the nato stability force in the region .
" that means they lag even more in giving up power to the central government . " most of the opium produced in afghanistan ends up in european markets as heroin , according to the un drugs authority .
as a result , governments have been more open recently to helping the afghan government , suggesting crop alternatives for farmers and pledging to invest in sectors that will create more jobs . isaf troops not ready to fight drug trade problems remain .
the international security assistance force has so far refused to involve itself in the fight against drug production and smuggling , leaving an ill-equipped afghan police force and army to fend for themselves .
in the past year , a few kilos of heroin have fallen into afghan law enforcement 's hands .
that 's a drop in the bucket compared to the estimated 3,600 tons of opium that left the country last year , according to un drug authorities . " the fight against drugs is the fight for afghanistan , " karzai said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern alliance fighters afghan police plan a major offensive in the coming weeks to burn 75 percent of the poppy fields in three afghan provinces .
the offensive will later be extended to all 32 provinces .
the u.s. government has pledged $ 40 million exclusively for creating and financing anti-drug troop units . but karzai said alternatives need to be found for the farmers , who make far more money producing opium poppies , the raw material for heroin , than any other crop . speaking before a roomful of business people on tuesday , including representatives of the world bank , karzai pushed raisins and saffron as possible options for weaning farmers off of drug production .

reconstruction financing and a booming opium trade remain major challenges . afghan leader hamid karzai and his trademark head covering will take center stage in berlin on wednesday , when 54 nations meet to analyze the progress and problems in afghanistan three years after the fall of the taliban . karzai , in the german capital on tuesday , highlighted his country 's battle with drug lords and dwindling financial resources as the major talking points at the two-day conference , which will be attended by u.s. secretary of state colin powell . " we will be asking -lrb- the international community -rrb- to increase their assistance to afghanistan in order for all of us to succeed in bringing about a safer , better , standing-on-its-own-feet afghanistan , " karzai told reporters after meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder , according to reuters . germany ready for the long haul the afghan leader has already picked up important pledges from german officials .
schröder , whose country has 1,900 peacekeeping troops in kabul and the northern city of kunduz , said germany was prepared to stay in the war-torn country for the long haul . bildunterschrift : schröder and karzai met on tuesday , on the eve of the two-day conference . germany has provided roughly € 80 million -lrb- $ 97 million -rrb- in aid each year since 2002 .
on wednesday , german officials are expected to announce that they will continue their aid program until 2008 . the united states , the biggest donor ahead of germany and japan , will most likely offer $ 1 billion on top of the $ 1.2 billion it has already pledged this year .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said tuesday that the leading donor countries hope other countries will pledge more aid . afghan leaders estimate that $ 27.5 billion is needed over the next seven years for reconstruction .
donors worldwide have so far pledged $ 4.2 billion through 2004 . " we obviously hope we will gather as large a sum as possible , " fischer told reporters . afghan opium flooding world markets not only financial woes , but the country 's growing drug problem are likely to be major discussion points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poppy field in afghanistan far more lucrative than wheat fields and growable even in the substandard afghani soil , experts estimate opium production makes up roughly half of the country 's € 4.4 billion gross domestic product and poses a significant security problem . " through that , warlords and terrorist finance themselves , " says general rick hillier , who commands the nato stability force in the region .
" that means they lag even more in giving up power to the central government . " most of the opium produced in afghanistan ends up in european markets as heroin , according to the un drugs authority .
as a result , governments have been more open recently to helping the afghan government , suggesting crop alternatives for farmers and pledging to invest in sectors that will create more jobs . isaf troops not ready to fight drug trade problems remain .
the international security assistance force has so far refused to involve itself in the fight against drug production and smuggling , leaving an ill-equipped afghan police force and army to fend for themselves .
in the past year , a few kilos of heroin have fallen into afghan law enforcement 's hands .
that 's a drop in the bucket compared to the estimated 3,600 tons of opium that left the country last year , according to un drug authorities . " the fight against drugs is the fight for afghanistan , " karzai said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern alliance fighters afghan police plan a major offensive in the coming weeks to burn 75 percent of the poppy fields in three afghan provinces .
the offensive will later be extended to all 32 provinces .
the u.s. government has pledged $ 40 million exclusively for creating and financing anti-drug troop units . but karzai said alternatives need to be found for the farmers , who make far more money producing opium poppies , the raw material for heroin , than any other crop . speaking before a roomful of business people on tuesday , including representatives of the world bank , karzai pushed raisins and saffron as possible options for weaning farmers off of drug production .

schröder , whose country has 1,900 peacekeeping troops in kabul and the northern city of kunduz , said germany was prepared to stay in the war-torn country for the long haul . bildunterschrift : schröder and karzai met on tuesday , on the eve of the two-day conference . germany has provided roughly € 80 million -lrb- $ 97 million -rrb- in aid each year since 2002 .
on wednesday , german officials are expected to announce that they will continue their aid program until 2008 . the united states , the biggest donor ahead of germany and japan , will most likely offer $ 1 billion on top of the $ 1.2 billion it has already pledged this year .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said tuesday that the leading donor countries hope other countries will pledge more aid . afghan leaders estimate that $ 27.5 billion is needed over the next seven years for reconstruction .
donors worldwide have so far pledged $ 4.2 billion through 2004 . " we obviously hope we will gather as large a sum as possible , " fischer told reporters . afghan opium flooding world markets not only financial woes , but the country 's growing drug problem are likely to be major discussion points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poppy field in afghanistan far more lucrative than wheat fields and growable even in the substandard afghani soil , experts estimate opium production makes up roughly half of the country 's € 4.4 billion gross domestic product and poses a significant security problem . " through that , warlords and terrorist finance themselves , " says general rick hillier , who commands the nato stability force in the region .
" that means they lag even more in giving up power to the central government . " most of the opium produced in afghanistan ends up in european markets as heroin , according to the un drugs authority .
as a result , governments have been more open recently to helping the afghan government , suggesting crop alternatives for farmers and pledging to invest in sectors that will create more jobs . isaf troops not ready to fight drug trade problems remain .
the international security assistance force has so far refused to involve itself in the fight against drug production and smuggling , leaving an ill-equipped afghan police force and army to fend for themselves .
in the past year , a few kilos of heroin have fallen into afghan law enforcement 's hands .
that 's a drop in the bucket compared to the estimated 3,600 tons of opium that left the country last year , according to un drug authorities . " the fight against drugs is the fight for afghanistan , " karzai said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern alliance fighters afghan police plan a major offensive in the coming weeks to burn 75 percent of the poppy fields in three afghan provinces .
the offensive will later be extended to all 32 provinces .
the u.s. government has pledged $ 40 million exclusively for creating and financing anti-drug troop units . but karzai said alternatives need to be found for the farmers , who make far more money producing opium poppies , the raw material for heroin , than any other crop . speaking before a roomful of business people on tuesday , including representatives of the world bank , karzai pushed raisins and saffron as possible options for weaning farmers off of drug production .

the judge , brigitte koppenhoefer , made the statement on wednesday , following a mid-trial review .
she said prosecutors had yet to prove that ackermann offered excessive bonuses amounting to bribes to the top executives at mannesmann in order to smooth over a takeover bid by vodaphone in early 2000 .
koppenhoefer said there was not enough evidence to support the central criminal charge of breach of trust to shareholders , though there was some evidence of lesser violations of share law .
the trial , which has been underway for two months , will continue . more briefs 31.03.2004 -pipe- siemens plays hard ball with unions 31.03.2004 -pipe- eu warns germany over " vw law " 30.03.2004 -pipe- eu warns germany over parmesan knockoffs 30.03.2004 -pipe- deutsche bank rules out friendly merger 30.03.2004 -pipe- bertelsmann plans major acquisitions 29.03.2004 -pipe- no more stock options for telekom brass 29.03.2004 -pipe- german consumer confidence stays low 26.03.2004 -pipe- german business confidence dips in march 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

after chancellor schröder settled a months-long cabinet dispute over greenhouse gas cuts , germany has submitted its plans for reducing carbon dioxide emissions to brussels .
other eu countries are much further behind . germany was n't the first country to hand in plans for curbing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions to the european commission - that honor went to finland .
but berlin was n't far behind .
considering the deeply entrenched dispute between industry and environmental groups , the fact that europe 's largest producer of greenhouse gases was among the first three to send its proposals for cutting the pollutants is surprising .
it was n't clear until late monday evening whether germany would be in a position to make wednesday 's eu deadline for emissions reductions plans .
only after chancellor gerhard schröder stepped in to broker a last-minute deal between the environment and economics ministers , was berlin able to put together a proposal worthy of sending to brussels .
germany calls for slight reduction just hours before the eu deadline ran out , germany 's cabinet passed a plan to cut industrial emissions of co2 from 505 million to 503 million tons per year by 2007 .
in a second phase , emissions are set to be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 .
the carbon caps are part of germany 's strategy to cut its greenhouse gases by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 .
the reduction is only slight compared to the 488 million tons requested by environment minister jürgen trittin .
as a member of the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition , he had pushed hard for further emission reductions , arguing german industry needed to do more to fulfil its contribution to the kyoto protocol .
economics minister wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , unflinchingly resisted major emissions cuts .
further reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry at a time when it is trying to shake off economic stagnation , he insisted .
european goal the dispute between industry and environment is not unique to germany .
throughout the european union , member states are struggling to lay such disagreements to rest in order to submit plans for cutting emissions .
by midnight wednesday all 15 eu states must set their co2 limits and the distribution of reductions between industrial sectors , with ceilings set on a company-by-company basis .
the reductions are part of a two-prong strategy brussels has devised in order to meet its commitments to the kyoto protocol .
in addition to capping emissions from industry and utilities , the eu plans to launch an emissions trading system -lrb- ets -rrb- in january that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from those who have remained under their pollution cap and thus create an exchange across borders , where the greener industries would stand to profit economically through the sale of their credits .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 .
several major industrial states , including britain , france and belgium , have already said they will miss the march 31 deadline .
italy , too , has conceded it is uncertain whether it will have a list of its emissions limits ready by the eu deadline .
spain will ask the european commission for " understanding " for failing to meet the deadline as the country is undergoing a change of government .
" the picture we have today does n't say that january 1 -lrb- the start of ets -rrb- is in any danger - not at all , not yet , " ewa hedlund , the commission 's environment spokeswoman , told a news briefing .
" next week , we 'll have more detail on what we 've received and what action we are going to take , " she said referring to a possible " infringement letter " from the commission and impending legal action against those members who fail to supply the eu executive with their emissions plans .
waiting for germany ?
according to analysts , europe 's biggest polluters had held back on submitting their plans until germany handed over its limits .
as the largest producer of co2 emissions , germany 's reduction rate dominated discussion in several capitals .
" germany is important , " john molloy of the brokerage firm tfs in london told german wire service dpa .
" great britain was the strictest up until now in terms of restriction , but they ca n't hold onto that position when everyone else is more lenient and risk jeopardizing the british industry . "
britain has denied it had purposefully waited for a german decision before drawing up its own plans .
but on tuesday london announced it may impose less cuts on industry than slated in january - a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 - and return to a limit closer to the 16 percent committed to under the kyoto protocol . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ministers reach agreement in emissions fight germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions .

after chancellor schröder settled a months-long cabinet dispute over greenhouse gas cuts , germany has submitted its plans for reducing carbon dioxide emissions to brussels .
other eu countries are much further behind . germany was n't the first country to hand in plans for curbing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions to the european commission - that honor went to finland .
but berlin was n't far behind .
considering the deeply entrenched dispute between industry and environmental groups , the fact that europe 's largest producer of greenhouse gases was among the first three to send its proposals for cutting the pollutants is surprising .
it was n't clear until late monday evening whether germany would be in a position to make wednesday 's eu deadline for emissions reductions plans .
only after chancellor gerhard schröder stepped in to broker a last-minute deal between the environment and economics ministers , was berlin able to put together a proposal worthy of sending to brussels .
germany calls for slight reduction just hours before the eu deadline ran out , germany 's cabinet passed a plan to cut industrial emissions of co2 from 505 million to 503 million tons per year by 2007 .
in a second phase , emissions are set to be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 .
the carbon caps are part of germany 's strategy to cut its greenhouse gases by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 .
the reduction is only slight compared to the 488 million tons requested by environment minister jürgen trittin .
as a member of the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition , he had pushed hard for further emission reductions , arguing german industry needed to do more to fulfil its contribution to the kyoto protocol .
economics minister wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , unflinchingly resisted major emissions cuts .
further reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry at a time when it is trying to shake off economic stagnation , he insisted .
european goal the dispute between industry and environment is not unique to germany .
throughout the european union , member states are struggling to lay such disagreements to rest in order to submit plans for cutting emissions .
by midnight wednesday all 15 eu states must set their co2 limits and the distribution of reductions between industrial sectors , with ceilings set on a company-by-company basis .
the reductions are part of a two-prong strategy brussels has devised in order to meet its commitments to the kyoto protocol .
in addition to capping emissions from industry and utilities , the eu plans to launch an emissions trading system -lrb- ets -rrb- in january that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from those who have remained under their pollution cap and thus create an exchange across borders , where the greener industries would stand to profit economically through the sale of their credits .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 .
several major industrial states , including britain , france and belgium , have already said they will miss the march 31 deadline .
italy , too , has conceded it is uncertain whether it will have a list of its emissions limits ready by the eu deadline .
spain will ask the european commission for " understanding " for failing to meet the deadline as the country is undergoing a change of government .
" the picture we have today does n't say that january 1 -lrb- the start of ets -rrb- is in any danger - not at all , not yet , " ewa hedlund , the commission 's environment spokeswoman , told a news briefing .
" next week , we 'll have more detail on what we 've received and what action we are going to take , " she said referring to a possible " infringement letter " from the commission and impending legal action against those members who fail to supply the eu executive with their emissions plans .
waiting for germany ?
according to analysts , europe 's biggest polluters had held back on submitting their plans until germany handed over its limits .
as the largest producer of co2 emissions , germany 's reduction rate dominated discussion in several capitals .
" germany is important , " john molloy of the brokerage firm tfs in london told german wire service dpa .
" great britain was the strictest up until now in terms of restriction , but they ca n't hold onto that position when everyone else is more lenient and risk jeopardizing the british industry . "
britain has denied it had purposefully waited for a german decision before drawing up its own plans .
but on tuesday london announced it may impose less cuts on industry than slated in january - a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 - and return to a limit closer to the 16 percent committed to under the kyoto protocol . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ministers reach agreement in emissions fight germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions .

eu interior ministers have acheived partial success on controversial plans to create a europe-wide asylum policy .
human rights groups however remain troubled over the unresolved elements . eu interior ministers met in brussels on tuesday to make yet another effort to hammer out a europe-wide asylum policy .
the meeting took on an added sense of urgency with the ministers struggling to comply with a self-imposed may 1 deadline , the date on which ten new countries join the eu .
ending almost six years of acrimonious negotiations , they reached a partial breakthrough on key aspects of the legislation . the ministers agreed on a set of criteria establishing who can apply for asylum .
however , they could not agree on some procedural points determining how such requests should be handled .
certain aspects of the latter , including a proposed plan to allow for the deportation of asylum seekers to " safe " third countries , have come under heavy fire from human rights organizations .
the ministers will meet again at the end of april to take up the issue again , but according to the german interior minister otto schily , " it could be close " .
germany drops opposition to asylum criteria the breakthrough came after the german government dropped its long-standing opposition to a policy determining who is eligible to apply for asylum , specifically the recognition of asylum seekers who are fleeing non-state persecution , like men who are being pursued by drug cartels or women who face female genital mutilation .
the expected approval of a sweeping new immigration law in germany , which has led to a compromise on key issues between the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and the conservative christian democratic opposition , cleared the way for schily to adopt a more conciliatory tone .
under the rules agreed on tuesday , the eu will not only offer protection to people who are refugees according to the 1951 geneva convention , they will also offer so-called subsidiary protection to victims of non-state persecution .

eu interior ministers have acheived partial success on controversial plans to create a europe-wide asylum policy .
human rights groups however remain troubled over the unresolved elements . eu interior ministers met in brussels on tuesday to make yet another effort to hammer out a europe-wide asylum policy .
the meeting took on an added sense of urgency with the ministers struggling to comply with a self-imposed may 1 deadline , the date on which ten new countries join the eu .
ending almost six years of acrimonious negotiations , they reached a partial breakthrough on key aspects of the legislation . the ministers agreed on a set of criteria establishing who can apply for asylum .
however , they could not agree on some procedural points determining how such requests should be handled .
certain aspects of the latter , including a proposed plan to allow for the deportation of asylum seekers to " safe " third countries , have come under heavy fire from human rights organizations .
the ministers will meet again at the end of april to take up the issue again , but according to the german interior minister otto schily , " it could be close " .
germany drops opposition to asylum criteria the breakthrough came after the german government dropped its long-standing opposition to a policy determining who is eligible to apply for asylum , specifically the recognition of asylum seekers who are fleeing non-state persecution , like men who are being pursued by drug cartels or women who face female genital mutilation .
the expected approval of a sweeping new immigration law in germany , which has led to a compromise on key issues between the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and the conservative christian democratic opposition , cleared the way for schily to adopt a more conciliatory tone .
under the rules agreed on tuesday , the eu will not only offer protection to people who are refugees according to the 1951 geneva convention , they will also offer so-called subsidiary protection to victims of non-state persecution .

the third international conference on afghanistan opened in berlin on wednesday with an inaugural speech by german chancellor schröder promising more financial aid to the war-torn country . german chancellor gerhard schröder opened the afghanistan conference in berlin on wednesday by pledging to afghan president hamid karzai that the international community would not abandon his country , one of the world 's poorest and the biggest opium supplier . karzai , who was seated next to the chancellor at the top table , which also included the u.n. afghanistan envoy jean arnault , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and the foreign ministers of britain , china , germany , pakistan and russia , listened intently as schröder delivered his opening speech . " a peaceful afghanistan is an anchor for greater political stability in the region and a sign of hope for us all , " schröder told the assembled dignitaries and press .
" it is proof that it is worth fighting against terror and violence . " the two-day conference is the third such international meeting on afghanistan since the end of the u.s.-led war .
the conference will address ways to stabilize the country 's political and economic reconstruction .
it will also tackle the problems of insecurity and drugs production plaguing the country despite the ousting of the taliban regime more than two years ago . chancellor schröder highlighted the three main goals of the conference : to support the political progress , including elections planned for september ; to increase aid for the country 's reconstruction ; and to help the kabul government establish security and the rule of law . schröder rallies international community he also used the speech to rally those countries that had already supported reconstruction efforts in afghanistan by reminding the hundreds of delegates , including 20 foreign ministers and officials from more than 60 countries and organizations , that there had been many successes in spite of the difficult conditions that still prevailed . " the positive developments in afghanistan show what can be achieved when we combine our efforts , " he said .
" every success that we score in bringing afghanistan on a path towards more freedom and security is not only progress for people in the country .
it is a success for us all . " in his speech later in the day , karzai said his country had come a long way since the fall of the taliban , with a constitution that reflected a desire to be partners with the international community and no longer " threatened by drugs and terrorism . " " what we have achieved is very promising , but let me be frank and say that the reconstruction has only begun , " karzai told the gathering . federal government extends financial aid bildunterschrift : on the subject of financial assistance , schröder vowed that germany would contribute € 320 million -lrb- $ 389.5 million -rrb- over the next four years to boost the reconstruction process in afghanistan .
the amount of financial aid by the german government since september 2001 will eventually total € 7.4 billion . sadako ogata , japan 's envoy to afghanistan , followed schröder 's lead by pledging $ 400 million -lrb- € 328.6 million -rrb- over the next two years .
" i am pleased to announce that japan is prepared to make further grant assistance amounting to $ 400 million over the coming two years , which brings japan 's contribution since september 2001 to over $ 1 billion , " she said .
earlier this month , japan said its financial assistance to afghanistan had reached $ 683 million , exceeding an initial pledge of $ 500 million . reconstruction funds a priority before the conference began , officials from participating countries and organizations spoke hopefully of raising $ 4 billion after afghan ministers called for more direct aid and investment .
afghan finance minister ashraf ghani told the handelsblatt business daily on tuesday that he was content with the international commitment so far , but more was necessary . he said earlier this month that $ 27.5 billion would be needed in the next seven years and previous promises " vastly underestimated " afghanistan 's needs . reconstruction minister amin farhang added in an interview with germany 's inforadio that he hoped the promised money would go directly to the kabul government instead of mainly to non-governmental organizations .
farhang told the radio station that afghanistan needed around $ 4.5 billion for this year , which would help train the afghan army and police force to tackle the rampant drugs problem controlled largely by influential provincial warlords . germany 's pledge of more financial aid came hours after u.s. secretary of state colin powell praised german efforts in aiding afghanistan . powell praises german efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : powell praised german efforts .
in an article in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , powell said , " it is in no small part thanks to germany 's engagement that afghanistan has made the progress it has that we want to pay tribute to at this international conference . "
" germany has shown vision and leadership quality , " he added .
" germany can be especially proud of the stationing of bundeswehr soldiers in kunduz , where the german soldiers were the first to lead a provincial reconstruction team in the framework of isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- .

eu interior ministers have acheived partial success on controversial plans to create a europe-wide asylum policy .
human rights groups however remain troubled over the unresolved elements . eu interior ministers met in brussels on tuesday to make yet another effort to hammer out a europe-wide asylum policy .
the meeting took on an added sense of urgency with the ministers struggling to comply with a self-imposed may 1 deadline , the date on which ten new countries join the eu .
ending almost six years of acrimonious negotiations , they reached a partial breakthrough on key aspects of the legislation . the ministers agreed on a set of criteria establishing who can apply for asylum .
however , they could not agree on some procedural points determining how such requests should be handled .
certain aspects of the latter , including a proposed plan to allow for the deportation of asylum seekers to " safe " third countries , have come under heavy fire from human rights organizations .
the ministers will meet again at the end of april to take up the issue again , but according to the german interior minister otto schily , " it could be close " .
germany drops opposition to asylum criteria the breakthrough came after the german government dropped its long-standing opposition to a policy determining who is eligible to apply for asylum , specifically the recognition of asylum seekers who are fleeing non-state persecution , like men who are being pursued by drug cartels or women who face female genital mutilation .
the expected approval of a sweeping new immigration law in germany , which has led to a compromise on key issues between the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and the conservative christian democratic opposition , cleared the way for schily to adopt a more conciliatory tone .
under the rules agreed on tuesday , the eu will not only offer protection to people who are refugees according to the 1951 geneva convention , they will also offer so-called subsidiary protection to victims of non-state persecution .
human rights groups protest key points not good enough , say some human rights groups .
following the recent election of anti-immigration parties in several european countries , asylum policy remains a politically loaded and divisive issue .
human rights groups - citing the increasingly restrictive nature of the eu policies - have publicly objected to key aspects of the draft , namely the still unresolved questions over how asylum requests will be handled .
in an unprecedented move , several groups , including human rights watch , amnesty international , and the european council for refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , jointly called on the eu to scrap the agreement , claiming it violates international law .
at issue are two aspects of the proposed agreement .
the first deals with a suggestion in the directive on the use of a " safe country of origin " concept , which means the eu would compile a list of " safe countries " and asylum requests from persons originating from these countries would be considered illegitimate .
the second issue is a so-called " safe third county " concept , which means asylum seekers can be deported to a third country deemed safe .
neither was resolved at the meeting on tuesday and has been put off until the end of april .
" these proposals would deny some asylum seekers access to full and fair procedures , and it would transfer them to countries outside europe , " said ben ward of human rights watch .

german organizations are at the forefront of this afghan renaissance . while the diplomats and dignitaries at the afghanistan conference in berlin begin to discuss efforts to rebuild , refinance and stabilize the war-torn country , one area of reconstruction is already well underway - the cultural aspect of afghan life is thriving despite very difficult conditions thanks to efforts from german organizations . germany ’ s cultural flagship in afghanistan is the goethe institute .
the head office in the capital kabul had been closed for 12 years until it became the first foreign cultural institute to be reopened last september .
the demand for german-language classes is enormous , and the goethe institute also supports art exhibitions and theater and film productions .
people love the goethe institute , says wilfried grolig , director-general of the department for culture and education at the german foreign office . “ people here in kabul are culturally starved - they ’ re interested in everything ! ” he said .

a member of the european parliament has accused hundreds of his colleagues of pocketing allowances for parliamentary sessions they have not attended .
the parliament says it could investigate as many as 200 members . hans-peter martin told germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper on monday that he has collected detailed records over the past two years that show that many of his colleagues in the european parliament habitually enter their names in the parliamentary register , but then skip meetings .
for signing the register , based on the understanding that they attend the sessions , members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- receive a € 262 -lrb- $ 320 -rrb- per diem .
martin , an mep from austria , claimed many either sign the register , which is accessible between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. , before flying home or send " front men " to sign on their behalf .
he said he had discovered 7,200 instances of fraud through what he alleged were forged per diem claims and attendance records to claim expenses .
wide-spread abuse ?
" brussel 's enormous expense system is being abused , " he said , " especially when delegates come in early , quickly sign in and then leave the city . "
martin also claimed that a favorite practice among meps has been to take an evening flight to brussels , sign the register before 10 p.m. , sign again the following day and attend a session before signing again the next morning and flying home .
this would earn them around € 795 in supplements on top of travel costs and the usual salary for spending just one session in parliament .
-lrb- meps are given salaries that are equivalent to those of members of their national parliaments and can range anywhere from just over € 2,000 a month to nearly € 10,000 .
efforts to reform the pay system and implement a single salary for members of the european parliament have repeatedly stalled since they began to be discussed earnestly in 1998 . -rrb-
allowance may be legitimate david harley , spokesman for the european parliament , said meps could legitimately claim their daily allowance if they were present in parliament , whether or not they took part in debates .
he said members could be working in their offices , writing reports or talking to journalists and also complex travel arrangements meant they often arrived late and left early .
but martin has described the practices as a " scam , " and he claimed nearly half of all german meps and several from other countries including britain are part of it .
the allegations of misuse of funds have shaken parliament , and many have stepped up to defend their fellow parliamentarians .
german mep hans-gert pöttering said meps are conscientious and work long hours .
" the vast majority of our colleagues do their work conscientiously , with a workload of 60 to 70 hours a week , " he said .
meanwhile , ireland 's mary banotti , a conservative , said martin ’ s allegations are causing immense distress to many colleagues .
daniel cohn-bendit , a prominent german green party member who is also in parliament , criticized martin for revealing his allegations to a german tabloid newspaper .
" to reveal this issue in this way is simply mobbing , " he said , referring to the practice of bullying workers until they leave a company .
parliament expenses under the loop members of the european parliament are currently paid a salary and expenses under an oft-criticized system set up in the 1960s that , among other things , allows meps to pocket the difference between full fare air tickets and discount fares when traveling between brussels , strasbourg and their constituencies . anita purcell -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany blocks eu parliament pay reform germany and three other eu states have blocked an attempt to reform the pay system for european parliamentarians , meaning it 's now unlikely that a reform package will be passed before eu-wide elections in june .

the hunger for culture in afghanistan is overcoming the physical challenges of bringing art , film , theater and education to the people .
german organizations are at the forefront of this afghan renaissance . while the diplomats and dignitaries at the afghanistan conference in berlin begin to discuss efforts to rebuild , refinance and stabilize the war-torn country , one area of reconstruction is already well underway - the cultural aspect of afghan life is thriving despite very difficult conditions thanks to efforts from german organizations . germany ’ s cultural flagship in afghanistan is the goethe institute .
the head office in the capital kabul had been closed for 12 years until it became the first foreign cultural institute to be reopened last september .
the demand for german-language classes is enormous , and the goethe institute also supports art exhibitions and theater and film productions .
people love the goethe institute , says wilfried grolig , director-general of the department for culture and education at the german foreign office . “ people here in kabul are culturally starved - they ’ re interested in everything ! ” he said .
“ so opening up windows of opportunity and importing culture from the outside world , especially from germany , is the right idea , ” grolig told deutsche welle . germany supports new schools windows of opportunity also includes opening up two schools , financed by the german foreign office .
the schools , one for boys and one for girls , teach over 4,000 pupils . the daad , a german academic program , is also very active in kabul .
it provides german university lecturers with additional training and sends them to colleges in afghanistan .
but the conditions under which teachers must educate and students must learn are often horrendous , according to wilfried grolig . “ when i was in kabul , i was invited to watch a theater group rehearse for the play " antigone , " which is about betrayal and death , set in a really dilapidated room .

the guiding principles behind all the projects are democracy , human rights , and freedom of opinion , says grolig , but that doesn ’ t mean transposing german culture onto afghanistan . “ it ’ s not about forcing our culture onto other people .
it ’ s about creating a forum for dialogue , ” he says . the german government intends to further support cultural and educational programs in afghanistan , and grolig says he hopes the international conference will clearly show that the international community is still on afghanistan ’ s side in helping to rebuild the country . louisa schaefer -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beating the drug lords and rebuilding a country on wednesday , international leaders will meet in berlin to take stock of rebuilding efforts in afghanistan .

by the time he returned , he had made up his mind : europe ’ s biggest media group must immediately boost its position on the asian markets in order to profit from the dynamic growth in the region .
in china and india , bertelsmann has already set up shop . in the beijing region , for example , the group has already brought in 1.5 million members for its chinese-language book club .
and that 's only the beginning .
a million served bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gunter thielen " our team currently sells 20 million books in china , " thielen said tuesday at the company 's board meeting .
" that ’ s the same amount of books as we sell in france .
the turnover , however , is only a tenth in china , because there a book costs $ 1.5 while it costs $ 15 in france .
that ’ s the big difference and the reason for this is that the chinese market is still being regulated , " thielen said . " but once that starts changing , the prices will increase and so will our turnover .
in a long term perspective of 10 or 15 years , we will multiply our sales in asia and at some point it will represent at least 10 percent of our revenues , " he added .
the company still has a long way to go .
of its approximately € 17 billion in revenues last year , just € 2 billion came from sales in asia .
with a string of new investments , bertelsmann is seeking to increase its market share .
in china , bertelsmann wants to invest heavily in printing and publishing houses .
" we will stay away from the music sector , " he said .
" the bootleg system is so sophisticated in china , you can purchase a disc for $ 1 at any corner there .
that ’ s why it doesn ’ t make sense for us to produce discs in china . "
a fast growing market in india , bertelsmann ’ s random house publishing arm , as well as the printing subsidiary arvato , is already active .
still , business there is only just starting for the media group and the future looks promising , as india currently has growth rates of 7-8 percent per year - nearly comparable to those in china .
both are markets that bring euros to the eyes of bertelsmann managers .
" together they have a population of 2.4 billion people thus representing a third of the world population , " he said .
" this must become a market one day .
of course if you compare these countries to america , they are still dwarfs .
but if you look at their growth rates it ’ s clear that we must closely watch these markets .
and i am positive that we will increasingly position ourselves there . "
today the media giant only makes 3 percent of its turnover in asia , that ’ s around € 600 million per year .
and only 1 percent - about € 200 million - are being earned in eastern europe , which bertelsmann also views as a promising market for its television , publishing and printing operations .
currently , germany remains one of bertelsmann 's most important markets .
a third of the company 's overall turnover is made here , with 40 percent coming from the rest of europe and 25 percent in the united states and canada .
only 3 percent of revenues are currently derived from its asian units .
preparing for a mega-merger the company 's book publishing division , based in new york , is the market leader in the united states and britain .
new york is also the headquarters for its worldwide music business , which will soon be merging with sony 's music operations .

the third international conference on afghanistan opened in berlin on wednesday with an inaugural speech by german chancellor schröder promising more financial aid to the war-torn country . german chancellor gerhard schröder opened the afghanistan conference in berlin on wednesday by pledging to afghan president hamid karzai that the international community would not abandon his country , one of the world 's poorest and the biggest opium supplier . karzai , who was seated next to the chancellor at the top table , which also included the u.n. afghanistan envoy jean arnault , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and the foreign ministers of britain , china , germany , pakistan and russia , listened intently as schröder delivered his opening speech . " a peaceful afghanistan is an anchor for greater political stability in the region and a sign of hope for us all , " schröder told the assembled dignitaries and press .
" it is proof that it is worth fighting against terror and violence . " the two-day conference is the third such international meeting on afghanistan since the end of the u.s.-led war .
the conference will address ways to stabilize the country 's political and economic reconstruction .
it will also tackle the problems of insecurity and drugs production plaguing the country despite the ousting of the taliban regime more than two years ago . chancellor schröder highlighted the three main goals of the conference : to support the political progress , including elections planned for september ; to increase aid for the country 's reconstruction ; and to help the kabul government establish security and the rule of law . schröder rallies international community he also used the speech to rally those countries that had already supported reconstruction efforts in afghanistan by reminding the hundreds of delegates , including 20 foreign ministers and officials from more than 60 countries and organizations , that there had been many successes in spite of the difficult conditions that still prevailed . " the positive developments in afghanistan show what can be achieved when we combine our efforts , " he said .
" every success that we score in bringing afghanistan on a path towards more freedom and security is not only progress for people in the country .
it is a success for us all . " in his speech later in the day , karzai said his country had come a long way since the fall of the taliban , with a constitution that reflected a desire to be partners with the international community and no longer " threatened by drugs and terrorism . " " what we have achieved is very promising , but let me be frank and say that the reconstruction has only begun , " karzai told the gathering . federal government extends financial aid bildunterschrift : on the subject of financial assistance , schröder vowed that germany would contribute € 320 million -lrb- $ 389.5 million -rrb- over the next four years to boost the reconstruction process in afghanistan .

by the time he returned , he had made up his mind : europe ’ s biggest media group must immediately boost its position on the asian markets in order to profit from the dynamic growth in the region .
in china and india , bertelsmann has already set up shop . in the beijing region , for example , the group has already brought in 1.5 million members for its chinese-language book club .
and that 's only the beginning .
a million served bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gunter thielen " our team currently sells 20 million books in china , " thielen said tuesday at the company 's board meeting .
" that ’ s the same amount of books as we sell in france .
the turnover , however , is only a tenth in china , because there a book costs $ 1.5 while it costs $ 15 in france .
that ’ s the big difference and the reason for this is that the chinese market is still being regulated , " thielen said . " but once that starts changing , the prices will increase and so will our turnover .
in a long term perspective of 10 or 15 years , we will multiply our sales in asia and at some point it will represent at least 10 percent of our revenues , " he added .
the company still has a long way to go .
of its approximately € 17 billion in revenues last year , just € 2 billion came from sales in asia .
with a string of new investments , bertelsmann is seeking to increase its market share .
in china , bertelsmann wants to invest heavily in printing and publishing houses .
" we will stay away from the music sector , " he said .
" the bootleg system is so sophisticated in china , you can purchase a disc for $ 1 at any corner there .
that ’ s why it doesn ’ t make sense for us to produce discs in china . "
a fast growing market in india , bertelsmann ’ s random house publishing arm , as well as the printing subsidiary arvato , is already active .
still , business there is only just starting for the media group and the future looks promising , as india currently has growth rates of 7-8 percent per year - nearly comparable to those in china .
both are markets that bring euros to the eyes of bertelsmann managers .
" together they have a population of 2.4 billion people thus representing a third of the world population , " he said .
" this must become a market one day .
of course if you compare these countries to america , they are still dwarfs .
but if you look at their growth rates it ’ s clear that we must closely watch these markets .
and i am positive that we will increasingly position ourselves there . "
today the media giant only makes 3 percent of its turnover in asia , that ’ s around € 600 million per year .
and only 1 percent - about € 200 million - are being earned in eastern europe , which bertelsmann also views as a promising market for its television , publishing and printing operations .
currently , germany remains one of bertelsmann 's most important markets .
a third of the company 's overall turnover is made here , with 40 percent coming from the rest of europe and 25 percent in the united states and canada .
only 3 percent of revenues are currently derived from its asian units .
preparing for a mega-merger the company 's book publishing division , based in new york , is the market leader in the united states and britain .
new york is also the headquarters for its worldwide music business , which will soon be merging with sony 's music operations .
with a world music market share of approximately 12 percent , bertelsmann is expected to be the dominant partner in the joint venture .
last year , bertelsmann artists including britney spears and justin timberlake won 22 grammy awards .

the third international conference on afghanistan opened in berlin on wednesday with an inaugural speech by german chancellor schröder promising more financial aid to the war-torn country . german chancellor gerhard schröder opened the afghanistan conference in berlin on wednesday by pledging to afghan president hamid karzai that the international community would not abandon his country , one of the world 's poorest and the biggest opium supplier . karzai , who was seated next to the chancellor at the top table , which also included the u.n. afghanistan envoy jean arnault , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and the foreign ministers of britain , china , germany , pakistan and russia , listened intently as schröder delivered his opening speech . " a peaceful afghanistan is an anchor for greater political stability in the region and a sign of hope for us all , " schröder told the assembled dignitaries and press .
" it is proof that it is worth fighting against terror and violence . " the two-day conference is the third such international meeting on afghanistan since the end of the u.s.-led war .
the conference will address ways to stabilize the country 's political and economic reconstruction .
it will also tackle the problems of insecurity and drugs production plaguing the country despite the ousting of the taliban regime more than two years ago . chancellor schröder highlighted the three main goals of the conference : to support the political progress , including elections planned for september ; to increase aid for the country 's reconstruction ; and to help the kabul government establish security and the rule of law . schröder rallies international community he also used the speech to rally those countries that had already supported reconstruction efforts in afghanistan by reminding the hundreds of delegates , including 20 foreign ministers and officials from more than 60 countries and organizations , that there had been many successes in spite of the difficult conditions that still prevailed . " the positive developments in afghanistan show what can be achieved when we combine our efforts , " he said .
" every success that we score in bringing afghanistan on a path towards more freedom and security is not only progress for people in the country .
it is a success for us all . " in his speech later in the day , karzai said his country had come a long way since the fall of the taliban , with a constitution that reflected a desire to be partners with the international community and no longer " threatened by drugs and terrorism . " " what we have achieved is very promising , but let me be frank and say that the reconstruction has only begun , " karzai told the gathering . federal government extends financial aid bildunterschrift : on the subject of financial assistance , schröder vowed that germany would contribute € 320 million -lrb- $ 389.5 million -rrb- over the next four years to boost the reconstruction process in afghanistan .
the amount of financial aid by the german government since september 2001 will eventually total € 7.4 billion . sadako ogata , japan 's envoy to afghanistan , followed schröder 's lead by pledging $ 400 million -lrb- € 328.6 million -rrb- over the next two years .
" i am pleased to announce that japan is prepared to make further grant assistance amounting to $ 400 million over the coming two years , which brings japan 's contribution since september 2001 to over $ 1 billion , " she said .
earlier this month , japan said its financial assistance to afghanistan had reached $ 683 million , exceeding an initial pledge of $ 500 million . reconstruction funds a priority before the conference began , officials from participating countries and organizations spoke hopefully of raising $ 4 billion after afghan ministers called for more direct aid and investment .
afghan finance minister ashraf ghani told the handelsblatt business daily on tuesday that he was content with the international commitment so far , but more was necessary . he said earlier this month that $ 27.5 billion would be needed in the next seven years and previous promises " vastly underestimated " afghanistan 's needs . reconstruction minister amin farhang added in an interview with germany 's inforadio that he hoped the promised money would go directly to the kabul government instead of mainly to non-governmental organizations .
farhang told the radio station that afghanistan needed around $ 4.5 billion for this year , which would help train the afghan army and police force to tackle the rampant drugs problem controlled largely by influential provincial warlords . germany 's pledge of more financial aid came hours after u.s. secretary of state colin powell praised german efforts in aiding afghanistan . powell praises german efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : powell praised german efforts .
in an article in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , powell said , " it is in no small part thanks to germany 's engagement that afghanistan has made the progress it has that we want to pay tribute to at this international conference . "
" germany has shown vision and leadership quality , " he added .
" germany can be especially proud of the stationing of bundeswehr soldiers in kunduz , where the german soldiers were the first to lead a provincial reconstruction team in the framework of isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- .

europe 's new counter-terrorism chief gijs de vries reported to work this week amid enduring questions over the exact nature of his work and his plans to keep europe safe . gijs de vries , a relatively low-profile former dutch interior minister and member of the european parliament , was appointed europe 's first " anti-terrorism czar " last week .
the post , created amid a surge of european unity following the madrid bombings and after years of talks on the necessity of such a position , is a strong sign that european anti-terrorism efforts have taken on a new urgency .
introduced at a packed news briefing in brussels on tuesday this week , the eu 's new counter-terorism chief has attracted much attention .
but by his second day on the job , otto schily , germany 's interior minister - who was in brussels for a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers - was asking for further clarification of de vries ' new duties and his future plans .
indeed , the appointment of this experienced yet relatively unknown european politician has left many raising the same questions .
an experienced european technocrat the 48-year-old gijs de vries was born in new york and has a respected career in european politics behind him .
de vries served as a liberal member of the european parliament for fourteen years , before taking the position of interior minister in the netherlands .
the dual u.s.-dutch citizen is fluent in several languages , including french , german and english , and he holds degrees from the university of leiden and the european university institute in florence , italy .
though de vries has relatively little experience in security and intelligence matters , which has given some commentators food for thought , he is described by others as an experienced technocrat .
de vries will have to call upon all of his faculties , which include a diplomatic and businesslike manner as well as extensive political knowledge , to implement the task he has been charged with : helping to safeguard europe 's security in an ever-more insecure world .
officially , de vries will be responsible for seeing that the various government bodies of eu member states and eu institutions in brussels work together to pool resources and intelligence .
namely , he has been charged with what romano prodi , the president of the european commission , has described as " breaking down the cultural obstacles to cooperation " .
what 's more , de vries can use his position to apply political pressure to eu members who lag behind in implementing the anti-terror measures that have already been agreed upon .
de vries has already promised to improve cooperation between european countries .
' ' terror is not just the concern of an intelligence agency in one nation , so the information gained must be shared by all nations , " he said .
a higher profile in the coming months how this still somewhat vague job description will translate into action remains to be seen during the coming months .
de vries ' plans will become more apparent in june , when he presents more specific proposals to eu heads of state at the next eu-wide summit in june .
but in his first days on the job , de vries has made some statements indicating his position on certain key issues .
notably , while pushing for the better exchange of resources and analysis , de vries said that increased efforts to fight terror in europe can not forfeit civil liberties .
" there can never be , in any society , a guarantee of 100 percent security , " de vries told reporters on tuesday after meeting with his boss , javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief . " we are living in an open society in europe , an open society in which people can enjoy many liberties , " he added .

by the time he returned , he had made up his mind : europe ’ s biggest media group must immediately boost its position on the asian markets in order to profit from the dynamic growth in the region .
in china and india , bertelsmann has already set up shop . in the beijing region , for example , the group has already brought in 1.5 million members for its chinese-language book club .
and that 's only the beginning .
a million served bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gunter thielen " our team currently sells 20 million books in china , " thielen said tuesday at the company 's board meeting .
" that ’ s the same amount of books as we sell in france .
the turnover , however , is only a tenth in china , because there a book costs $ 1.5 while it costs $ 15 in france .
that ’ s the big difference and the reason for this is that the chinese market is still being regulated , " thielen said . " but once that starts changing , the prices will increase and so will our turnover .
in a long term perspective of 10 or 15 years , we will multiply our sales in asia and at some point it will represent at least 10 percent of our revenues , " he added .
the company still has a long way to go .
of its approximately € 17 billion in revenues last year , just € 2 billion came from sales in asia .
with a string of new investments , bertelsmann is seeking to increase its market share .
in china , bertelsmann wants to invest heavily in printing and publishing houses .
" we will stay away from the music sector , " he said .
" the bootleg system is so sophisticated in china , you can purchase a disc for $ 1 at any corner there .
that ’ s why it doesn ’ t make sense for us to produce discs in china . "
a fast growing market in india , bertelsmann ’ s random house publishing arm , as well as the printing subsidiary arvato , is already active .
still , business there is only just starting for the media group and the future looks promising , as india currently has growth rates of 7-8 percent per year - nearly comparable to those in china .
both are markets that bring euros to the eyes of bertelsmann managers .
" together they have a population of 2.4 billion people thus representing a third of the world population , " he said .
" this must become a market one day .
of course if you compare these countries to america , they are still dwarfs .
but if you look at their growth rates it ’ s clear that we must closely watch these markets .
and i am positive that we will increasingly position ourselves there . "
today the media giant only makes 3 percent of its turnover in asia , that ’ s around € 600 million per year .
and only 1 percent - about € 200 million - are being earned in eastern europe , which bertelsmann also views as a promising market for its television , publishing and printing operations .
currently , germany remains one of bertelsmann 's most important markets .
a third of the company 's overall turnover is made here , with 40 percent coming from the rest of europe and 25 percent in the united states and canada .
only 3 percent of revenues are currently derived from its asian units .
preparing for a mega-merger the company 's book publishing division , based in new york , is the market leader in the united states and britain .
new york is also the headquarters for its worldwide music business , which will soon be merging with sony 's music operations .
with a world music market share of approximately 12 percent , bertelsmann is expected to be the dominant partner in the joint venture .
last year , bertelsmann artists including britney spears and justin timberlake won 22 grammy awards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 31.03.2004 europe 's anti-terror czar reports to work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : may look easygoing , but he 's serious about combating terrorism in europe .
europe 's new counter-terrorism chief gijs de vries reported to work this week amid enduring questions over the exact nature of his work and his plans to keep europe safe . gijs de vries , a relatively low-profile former dutch interior minister and member of the european parliament , was appointed europe 's first " anti-terrorism czar " last week .
the post , created amid a surge of european unity following the madrid bombings and after years of talks on the necessity of such a position , is a strong sign that european anti-terrorism efforts have taken on a new urgency .
introduced at a packed news briefing in brussels on tuesday this week , the eu 's new counter-terorism chief has attracted much attention .
but by his second day on the job , otto schily , germany 's interior minister - who was in brussels for a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers - was asking for further clarification of de vries ' new duties and his future plans .
indeed , the appointment of this experienced yet relatively unknown european politician has left many raising the same questions .
an experienced european technocrat the 48-year-old gijs de vries was born in new york and has a respected career in european politics behind him .
de vries served as a liberal member of the european parliament for fourteen years , before taking the position of interior minister in the netherlands .
the dual u.s.-dutch citizen is fluent in several languages , including french , german and english , and he holds degrees from the university of leiden and the european university institute in florence , italy .
though de vries has relatively little experience in security and intelligence matters , which has given some commentators food for thought , he is described by others as an experienced technocrat .
de vries will have to call upon all of his faculties , which include a diplomatic and businesslike manner as well as extensive political knowledge , to implement the task he has been charged with : helping to safeguard europe 's security in an ever-more insecure world .
officially , de vries will be responsible for seeing that the various government bodies of eu member states and eu institutions in brussels work together to pool resources and intelligence .
namely , he has been charged with what romano prodi , the president of the european commission , has described as " breaking down the cultural obstacles to cooperation " .
what 's more , de vries can use his position to apply political pressure to eu members who lag behind in implementing the anti-terror measures that have already been agreed upon .
de vries has already promised to improve cooperation between european countries .
' ' terror is not just the concern of an intelligence agency in one nation , so the information gained must be shared by all nations , " he said .
a higher profile in the coming months how this still somewhat vague job description will translate into action remains to be seen during the coming months .
de vries ' plans will become more apparent in june , when he presents more specific proposals to eu heads of state at the next eu-wide summit in june .
but in his first days on the job , de vries has made some statements indicating his position on certain key issues .
notably , while pushing for the better exchange of resources and analysis , de vries said that increased efforts to fight terror in europe can not forfeit civil liberties .
" there can never be , in any society , a guarantee of 100 percent security , " de vries told reporters on tuesday after meeting with his boss , javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief . " we are living in an open society in europe , an open society in which people can enjoy many liberties , " he added .
" it is important to preserve those liberties , to build on them . " dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops agenda at eu summit european union leaders arrived in brussels on thursday for their annual spring summit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 31.03.2004 europe 's anti-terror czar reports to work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : may look easygoing , but he 's serious about combating terrorism in europe .
europe 's new counter-terrorism chief gijs de vries reported to work this week amid enduring questions over the exact nature of his work and his plans to keep europe safe . gijs de vries , a relatively low-profile former dutch interior minister and member of the european parliament , was appointed europe 's first " anti-terrorism czar " last week .
the post , created amid a surge of european unity following the madrid bombings and after years of talks on the necessity of such a position , is a strong sign that european anti-terrorism efforts have taken on a new urgency .
introduced at a packed news briefing in brussels on tuesday this week , the eu 's new counter-terorism chief has attracted much attention .
but by his second day on the job , otto schily , germany 's interior minister - who was in brussels for a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers - was asking for further clarification of de vries ' new duties and his future plans .
indeed , the appointment of this experienced yet relatively unknown european politician has left many raising the same questions .
an experienced european technocrat the 48-year-old gijs de vries was born in new york and has a respected career in european politics behind him .
de vries served as a liberal member of the european parliament for fourteen years , before taking the position of interior minister in the netherlands .
the dual u.s.-dutch citizen is fluent in several languages , including french , german and english , and he holds degrees from the university of leiden and the european university institute in florence , italy .
though de vries has relatively little experience in security and intelligence matters , which has given some commentators food for thought , he is described by others as an experienced technocrat .
de vries will have to call upon all of his faculties , which include a diplomatic and businesslike manner as well as extensive political knowledge , to implement the task he has been charged with : helping to safeguard europe 's security in an ever-more insecure world .
officially , de vries will be responsible for seeing that the various government bodies of eu member states and eu institutions in brussels work together to pool resources and intelligence .
namely , he has been charged with what romano prodi , the president of the european commission , has described as " breaking down the cultural obstacles to cooperation " .
what 's more , de vries can use his position to apply political pressure to eu members who lag behind in implementing the anti-terror measures that have already been agreed upon .
de vries has already promised to improve cooperation between european countries .
' ' terror is not just the concern of an intelligence agency in one nation , so the information gained must be shared by all nations , " he said .
a higher profile in the coming months how this still somewhat vague job description will translate into action remains to be seen during the coming months .
de vries ' plans will become more apparent in june , when he presents more specific proposals to eu heads of state at the next eu-wide summit in june .
but in his first days on the job , de vries has made some statements indicating his position on certain key issues .
notably , while pushing for the better exchange of resources and analysis , de vries said that increased efforts to fight terror in europe can not forfeit civil liberties .
" there can never be , in any society , a guarantee of 100 percent security , " de vries told reporters on tuesday after meeting with his boss , javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief . " we are living in an open society in europe , an open society in which people can enjoy many liberties , " he added .
" it is important to preserve those liberties , to build on them . " dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops agenda at eu summit european union leaders arrived in brussels on thursday for their annual spring summit .

on wednesday , international leaders will meet in berlin to take stock of rebuilding efforts in afghanistan .
reconstruction financing and a booming opium trade remain major challenges . afghan leader hamid karzai and his trademark head covering will take center stage in berlin on wednesday , when 54 nations meet to analyze the progress and problems in afghanistan three years after the fall of the taliban . karzai , in the german capital on tuesday , highlighted his country 's battle with drug lords and dwindling financial resources as the major talking points at the two-day conference , which will be attended by u.s. secretary of state colin powell . " we will be asking -lrb- the international community -rrb- to increase their assistance to afghanistan in order for all of us to succeed in bringing about a safer , better , standing-on-its-own-feet afghanistan , " karzai told reporters after meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder , according to reuters . germany ready for the long haul the afghan leader has already picked up important pledges from german officials .
schröder , whose country has 1,900 peacekeeping troops in kabul and the northern city of kunduz , said germany was prepared to stay in the war-torn country for the long haul . bildunterschrift : schröder and karzai met on tuesday , on the eve of the two-day conference . germany has provided roughly € 80 million -lrb- $ 97 million -rrb- in aid each year since 2002 .
on wednesday , german officials are expected to announce that they will continue their aid program until 2008 . the united states , the biggest donor ahead of germany and japan , will most likely offer $ 1 billion on top of the $ 1.2 billion it has already pledged this year .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said tuesday that the leading donor countries hope other countries will pledge more aid . afghan leaders estimate that $ 27.5 billion is needed over the next seven years for reconstruction .
donors worldwide have so far pledged $ 4.2 billion through 2004 . " we obviously hope we will gather as large a sum as possible , " fischer told reporters . afghan opium flooding world markets not only financial woes , but the country 's growing drug problem are likely to be major discussion points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poppy field in afghanistan far more lucrative than wheat fields and growable even in the substandard afghani soil , experts estimate opium production makes up roughly half of the country 's € 4.4 billion gross domestic product and poses a significant security problem . " through that , warlords and terrorist finance themselves , " says general rick hillier , who commands the nato stability force in the region .
" that means they lag even more in giving up power to the central government . " most of the opium produced in afghanistan ends up in european markets as heroin , according to the un drugs authority .
as a result , governments have been more open recently to helping the afghan government , suggesting crop alternatives for farmers and pledging to invest in sectors that will create more jobs . isaf troops not ready to fight drug trade problems remain .
the international security assistance force has so far refused to involve itself in the fight against drug production and smuggling , leaving an ill-equipped afghan police force and army to fend for themselves .
in the past year , a few kilos of heroin have fallen into afghan law enforcement 's hands .
that 's a drop in the bucket compared to the estimated 3,600 tons of opium that left the country last year , according to un drug authorities . " the fight against drugs is the fight for afghanistan , " karzai said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern alliance fighters afghan police plan a major offensive in the coming weeks to burn 75 percent of the poppy fields in three afghan provinces .
the offensive will later be extended to all 32 provinces .
the u.s. government has pledged $ 40 million exclusively for creating and financing anti-drug troop units . but karzai said alternatives need to be found for the farmers , who make far more money producing opium poppies , the raw material for heroin , than any other crop . speaking before a roomful of business people on tuesday , including representatives of the world bank , karzai pushed raisins and saffron as possible options for weaning farmers off of drug production .
" if we want to have afghanistan , " said karzai .

after chancellor schröder settled a months-long cabinet dispute over greenhouse gas cuts , germany has submitted its plans for reducing carbon dioxide emissions to brussels .
other eu countries are much further behind . germany was n't the first country to hand in plans for curbing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions to the european commission - that honor went to finland .
but berlin was n't far behind .
considering the deeply entrenched dispute between industry and environmental groups , the fact that europe 's largest producer of greenhouse gases was among the first three to send its proposals for cutting the pollutants is surprising .
it was n't clear until late monday evening whether germany would be in a position to make wednesday 's eu deadline for emissions reductions plans .
only after chancellor gerhard schröder stepped in to broker a last-minute deal between the environment and economics ministers , was berlin able to put together a proposal worthy of sending to brussels .
germany calls for slight reduction just hours before the eu deadline ran out , germany 's cabinet passed a plan to cut industrial emissions of co2 from 505 million to 503 million tons per year by 2007 .
in a second phase , emissions are set to be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 .
the carbon caps are part of germany 's strategy to cut its greenhouse gases by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 .
the reduction is only slight compared to the 488 million tons requested by environment minister jürgen trittin .
as a member of the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition , he had pushed hard for further emission reductions , arguing german industry needed to do more to fulfil its contribution to the kyoto protocol .
economics minister wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , unflinchingly resisted major emissions cuts .
further reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry at a time when it is trying to shake off economic stagnation , he insisted .
european goal the dispute between industry and environment is not unique to germany .
throughout the european union , member states are struggling to lay such disagreements to rest in order to submit plans for cutting emissions .
by midnight wednesday all 15 eu states must set their co2 limits and the distribution of reductions between industrial sectors , with ceilings set on a company-by-company basis .
the reductions are part of a two-prong strategy brussels has devised in order to meet its commitments to the kyoto protocol .
in addition to capping emissions from industry and utilities , the eu plans to launch an emissions trading system -lrb- ets -rrb- in january that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from those who have remained under their pollution cap and thus create an exchange across borders , where the greener industries would stand to profit economically through the sale of their credits .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 .
several major industrial states , including britain , france and belgium , have already said they will miss the march 31 deadline .
italy , too , has conceded it is uncertain whether it will have a list of its emissions limits ready by the eu deadline .
spain will ask the european commission for " understanding " for failing to meet the deadline as the country is undergoing a change of government .
" the picture we have today does n't say that january 1 -lrb- the start of ets -rrb- is in any danger - not at all , not yet , " ewa hedlund , the commission 's environment spokeswoman , told a news briefing .
" next week , we 'll have more detail on what we 've received and what action we are going to take , " she said referring to a possible " infringement letter " from the commission and impending legal action against those members who fail to supply the eu executive with their emissions plans .
waiting for germany ?
according to analysts , europe 's biggest polluters had held back on submitting their plans until germany handed over its limits .
as the largest producer of co2 emissions , germany 's reduction rate dominated discussion in several capitals .
" germany is important , " john molloy of the brokerage firm tfs in london told german wire service dpa .
" great britain was the strictest up until now in terms of restriction , but they ca n't hold onto that position when everyone else is more lenient and risk jeopardizing the british industry . "
britain has denied it had purposefully waited for a german decision before drawing up its own plans .
but on tuesday london announced it may impose less cuts on industry than slated in january - a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 - and return to a limit closer to the 16 percent committed to under the kyoto protocol . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ministers reach agreement in emissions fight germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions .

according to ukrainian and eu officials , the deal was provisionally signed by both sides on tuesday .
the european commission has been demanding the automatic extension of the political and cooperation agreement , which forms the legal basis of bilateral relations , to cover the new member states .
ukraine , however , has asked for compensation for the enlargement of the eu , which it says will hurt trade .
both sides have said discussions on ukraine 's concerns will continue , while the european commission has been playing down the link between the talks and the full endorsement of the agreement .
with russia continuing to press for concessions before signing a similar agreement , ukraine is keen to point out its apparently cooperative stance .
kiev wants to see talks continue on steel quotas , anti-dumping and tariffs on pipe products .

eu interior ministers have acheived partial success on controversial plans to create a europe-wide asylum policy .
human rights groups however remain troubled over the unresolved elements . eu interior ministers met in brussels on tuesday to make yet another effort to hammer out a europe-wide asylum policy .
the meeting took on an added sense of urgency with the ministers struggling to comply with a self-imposed may 1 deadline , the date on which ten new countries join the eu .
ending almost six years of acrimonious negotiations , they reached a partial breakthrough on key aspects of the legislation . the ministers agreed on a set of criteria establishing who can apply for asylum .
however , they could not agree on some procedural points determining how such requests should be handled .
certain aspects of the latter , including a proposed plan to allow for the deportation of asylum seekers to " safe " third countries , have come under heavy fire from human rights organizations .
the ministers will meet again at the end of april to take up the issue again , but according to the german interior minister otto schily , " it could be close " .
germany drops opposition to asylum criteria the breakthrough came after the german government dropped its long-standing opposition to a policy determining who is eligible to apply for asylum , specifically the recognition of asylum seekers who are fleeing non-state persecution , like men who are being pursued by drug cartels or women who face female genital mutilation .
the expected approval of a sweeping new immigration law in germany , which has led to a compromise on key issues between the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and the conservative christian democratic opposition , cleared the way for schily to adopt a more conciliatory tone .
under the rules agreed on tuesday , the eu will not only offer protection to people who are refugees according to the 1951 geneva convention , they will also offer so-called subsidiary protection to victims of non-state persecution .
human rights groups protest key points not good enough , say some human rights groups .
following the recent election of anti-immigration parties in several european countries , asylum policy remains a politically loaded and divisive issue .
human rights groups - citing the increasingly restrictive nature of the eu policies - have publicly objected to key aspects of the draft , namely the still unresolved questions over how asylum requests will be handled .
in an unprecedented move , several groups , including human rights watch , amnesty international , and the european council for refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , jointly called on the eu to scrap the agreement , claiming it violates international law .
at issue are two aspects of the proposed agreement .
the first deals with a suggestion in the directive on the use of a " safe country of origin " concept , which means the eu would compile a list of " safe countries " and asylum requests from persons originating from these countries would be considered illegitimate .
the second issue is a so-called " safe third county " concept , which means asylum seekers can be deported to a third country deemed safe .
neither was resolved at the meeting on tuesday and has been put off until the end of april .
" these proposals would deny some asylum seekers access to full and fair procedures , and it would transfer them to countries outside europe , " said ben ward of human rights watch .
" we 're deeply concerned that the eu is trying to get other countries to shoulder its responsibilities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum-seekers in hamburg daphne bouteillet paquet said the ministers should forget the proposals and start again .
" we feel we have no option but to call on the eu to scrap this proposal on asylum procedures , which has been shaped in reaction to populist pressures and fears whipped up about a non-existent flood of refugees into the eu , " she said .
schily rebuffs criticism schily responded to the human rights organization 's criticism , saying that the creation of a safe third country concept would allow the eu to avoid the processing costs associated with questionable claims , while those who are truly victims of oppression would be offered asylum .
the ministers will meet again on april 29 to resolve remaining concerns . dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no breakthrough yet on immigration law germany 's ruling social democrats and opposition conservatives thrashed out the details of long-debated immigration legislation on monday .

eu interior ministers have acheived partial success on controversial plans to create a europe-wide asylum policy .
human rights groups however remain troubled over the unresolved elements . eu interior ministers met in brussels on tuesday to make yet another effort to hammer out a europe-wide asylum policy .
the meeting took on an added sense of urgency with the ministers struggling to comply with a self-imposed may 1 deadline , the date on which ten new countries join the eu .
ending almost six years of acrimonious negotiations , they reached a partial breakthrough on key aspects of the legislation . the ministers agreed on a set of criteria establishing who can apply for asylum .
however , they could not agree on some procedural points determining how such requests should be handled .
certain aspects of the latter , including a proposed plan to allow for the deportation of asylum seekers to " safe " third countries , have come under heavy fire from human rights organizations .
the ministers will meet again at the end of april to take up the issue again , but according to the german interior minister otto schily , " it could be close " .
germany drops opposition to asylum criteria the breakthrough came after the german government dropped its long-standing opposition to a policy determining who is eligible to apply for asylum , specifically the recognition of asylum seekers who are fleeing non-state persecution , like men who are being pursued by drug cartels or women who face female genital mutilation .
the expected approval of a sweeping new immigration law in germany , which has led to a compromise on key issues between the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and the conservative christian democratic opposition , cleared the way for schily to adopt a more conciliatory tone .
under the rules agreed on tuesday , the eu will not only offer protection to people who are refugees according to the 1951 geneva convention , they will also offer so-called subsidiary protection to victims of non-state persecution .
human rights groups protest key points not good enough , say some human rights groups .
following the recent election of anti-immigration parties in several european countries , asylum policy remains a politically loaded and divisive issue .
human rights groups - citing the increasingly restrictive nature of the eu policies - have publicly objected to key aspects of the draft , namely the still unresolved questions over how asylum requests will be handled .
in an unprecedented move , several groups , including human rights watch , amnesty international , and the european council for refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , jointly called on the eu to scrap the agreement , claiming it violates international law .
at issue are two aspects of the proposed agreement .
the first deals with a suggestion in the directive on the use of a " safe country of origin " concept , which means the eu would compile a list of " safe countries " and asylum requests from persons originating from these countries would be considered illegitimate .
the second issue is a so-called " safe third county " concept , which means asylum seekers can be deported to a third country deemed safe .
neither was resolved at the meeting on tuesday and has been put off until the end of april .
" these proposals would deny some asylum seekers access to full and fair procedures , and it would transfer them to countries outside europe , " said ben ward of human rights watch .
" we 're deeply concerned that the eu is trying to get other countries to shoulder its responsibilities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum-seekers in hamburg daphne bouteillet paquet said the ministers should forget the proposals and start again .
" we feel we have no option but to call on the eu to scrap this proposal on asylum procedures , which has been shaped in reaction to populist pressures and fears whipped up about a non-existent flood of refugees into the eu , " she said .
schily rebuffs criticism schily responded to the human rights organization 's criticism , saying that the creation of a safe third country concept would allow the eu to avoid the processing costs associated with questionable claims , while those who are truly victims of oppression would be offered asylum .
the ministers will meet again on april 29 to resolve remaining concerns . dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no breakthrough yet on immigration law germany 's ruling social democrats and opposition conservatives thrashed out the details of long-debated immigration legislation on monday .

on wednesday , international leaders will meet in berlin to take stock of rebuilding efforts in afghanistan .
reconstruction financing and a booming opium trade remain major challenges . afghan leader hamid karzai and his trademark head covering will take center stage in berlin on wednesday , when 54 nations meet to analyze the progress and problems in afghanistan three years after the fall of the taliban . karzai , in the german capital on tuesday , highlighted his country 's battle with drug lords and dwindling financial resources as the major talking points at the two-day conference , which will be attended by u.s. secretary of state colin powell . " we will be asking -lrb- the international community -rrb- to increase their assistance to afghanistan in order for all of us to succeed in bringing about a safer , better , standing-on-its-own-feet afghanistan , " karzai told reporters after meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder , according to reuters . germany ready for the long haul the afghan leader has already picked up important pledges from german officials .
schröder , whose country has 1,900 peacekeeping troops in kabul and the northern city of kunduz , said germany was prepared to stay in the war-torn country for the long haul . bildunterschrift : schröder and karzai met on tuesday , on the eve of the two-day conference . germany has provided roughly € 80 million -lrb- $ 97 million -rrb- in aid each year since 2002 .
on wednesday , german officials are expected to announce that they will continue their aid program until 2008 . the united states , the biggest donor ahead of germany and japan , will most likely offer $ 1 billion on top of the $ 1.2 billion it has already pledged this year .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said tuesday that the leading donor countries hope other countries will pledge more aid . afghan leaders estimate that $ 27.5 billion is needed over the next seven years for reconstruction .
donors worldwide have so far pledged $ 4.2 billion through 2004 . " we obviously hope we will gather as large a sum as possible , " fischer told reporters . afghan opium flooding world markets not only financial woes , but the country 's growing drug problem are likely to be major discussion points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poppy field in afghanistan far more lucrative than wheat fields and growable even in the substandard afghani soil , experts estimate opium production makes up roughly half of the country 's € 4.4 billion gross domestic product and poses a significant security problem . " through that , warlords and terrorist finance themselves , " says general rick hillier , who commands the nato stability force in the region .
" that means they lag even more in giving up power to the central government . " most of the opium produced in afghanistan ends up in european markets as heroin , according to the un drugs authority .
as a result , governments have been more open recently to helping the afghan government , suggesting crop alternatives for farmers and pledging to invest in sectors that will create more jobs . isaf troops not ready to fight drug trade problems remain .
the international security assistance force has so far refused to involve itself in the fight against drug production and smuggling , leaving an ill-equipped afghan police force and army to fend for themselves .
in the past year , a few kilos of heroin have fallen into afghan law enforcement 's hands .
that 's a drop in the bucket compared to the estimated 3,600 tons of opium that left the country last year , according to un drug authorities . " the fight against drugs is the fight for afghanistan , " karzai said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern alliance fighters afghan police plan a major offensive in the coming weeks to burn 75 percent of the poppy fields in three afghan provinces .
the offensive will later be extended to all 32 provinces .
the u.s. government has pledged $ 40 million exclusively for creating and financing anti-drug troop units . but karzai said alternatives need to be found for the farmers , who make far more money producing opium poppies , the raw material for heroin , than any other crop . speaking before a roomful of business people on tuesday , including representatives of the world bank , karzai pushed raisins and saffron as possible options for weaning farmers off of drug production .

according to ukrainian and eu officials , the deal was provisionally signed by both sides on tuesday .
the european commission has been demanding the automatic extension of the political and cooperation agreement , which forms the legal basis of bilateral relations , to cover the new member states .
ukraine , however , has asked for compensation for the enlargement of the eu , which it says will hurt trade .
both sides have said discussions on ukraine 's concerns will continue , while the european commission has been playing down the link between the talks and the full endorsement of the agreement .
with russia continuing to press for concessions before signing a similar agreement , ukraine is keen to point out its apparently cooperative stance .
kiev wants to see talks continue on steel quotas , anti-dumping and tariffs on pipe products .

after chancellor schröder settled a months-long cabinet dispute over greenhouse gas cuts , germany has submitted its plans for reducing carbon dioxide emissions to brussels .
other eu countries are much further behind . germany was n't the first country to hand in plans for curbing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions to the european commission - that honor went to finland .
but berlin was n't far behind .
considering the deeply entrenched dispute between industry and environmental groups , the fact that europe 's largest producer of greenhouse gases was among the first three to send its proposals for cutting the pollutants is surprising .
it was n't clear until late monday evening whether germany would be in a position to make wednesday 's eu deadline for emissions reductions plans .
only after chancellor gerhard schröder stepped in to broker a last-minute deal between the environment and economics ministers , was berlin able to put together a proposal worthy of sending to brussels .
germany calls for slight reduction just hours before the eu deadline ran out , germany 's cabinet passed a plan to cut industrial emissions of co2 from 505 million to 503 million tons per year by 2007 .
in a second phase , emissions are set to be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 .
the carbon caps are part of germany 's strategy to cut its greenhouse gases by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 .
the reduction is only slight compared to the 488 million tons requested by environment minister jürgen trittin .
as a member of the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition , he had pushed hard for further emission reductions , arguing german industry needed to do more to fulfil its contribution to the kyoto protocol .
economics minister wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , unflinchingly resisted major emissions cuts .
further reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry at a time when it is trying to shake off economic stagnation , he insisted .
european goal the dispute between industry and environment is not unique to germany .
throughout the european union , member states are struggling to lay such disagreements to rest in order to submit plans for cutting emissions .
by midnight wednesday all 15 eu states must set their co2 limits and the distribution of reductions between industrial sectors , with ceilings set on a company-by-company basis .
the reductions are part of a two-prong strategy brussels has devised in order to meet its commitments to the kyoto protocol .
in addition to capping emissions from industry and utilities , the eu plans to launch an emissions trading system -lrb- ets -rrb- in january that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from those who have remained under their pollution cap and thus create an exchange across borders , where the greener industries would stand to profit economically through the sale of their credits .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 .
several major industrial states , including britain , france and belgium , have already said they will miss the march 31 deadline .
italy , too , has conceded it is uncertain whether it will have a list of its emissions limits ready by the eu deadline .
spain will ask the european commission for " understanding " for failing to meet the deadline as the country is undergoing a change of government .
" the picture we have today does n't say that january 1 -lrb- the start of ets -rrb- is in any danger - not at all , not yet , " ewa hedlund , the commission 's environment spokeswoman , told a news briefing .
" next week , we 'll have more detail on what we 've received and what action we are going to take , " she said referring to a possible " infringement letter " from the commission and impending legal action against those members who fail to supply the eu executive with their emissions plans .
waiting for germany ?
according to analysts , europe 's biggest polluters had held back on submitting their plans until germany handed over its limits .
as the largest producer of co2 emissions , germany 's reduction rate dominated discussion in several capitals .
" germany is important , " john molloy of the brokerage firm tfs in london told german wire service dpa .
" great britain was the strictest up until now in terms of restriction , but they ca n't hold onto that position when everyone else is more lenient and risk jeopardizing the british industry . "
britain has denied it had purposefully waited for a german decision before drawing up its own plans .
but on tuesday london announced it may impose less cuts on industry than slated in january - a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 - and return to a limit closer to the 16 percent committed to under the kyoto protocol . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ministers reach agreement in emissions fight germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions .

eu interior ministers have acheived partial success on controversial plans to create a europe-wide asylum policy .
human rights groups however remain troubled over the unresolved elements . eu interior ministers met in brussels on tuesday to make yet another effort to hammer out a europe-wide asylum policy .
the meeting took on an added sense of urgency with the ministers struggling to comply with a self-imposed may 1 deadline , the date on which ten new countries join the eu .
ending almost six years of acrimonious negotiations , they reached a partial breakthrough on key aspects of the legislation . the ministers agreed on a set of criteria establishing who can apply for asylum .
however , they could not agree on some procedural points determining how such requests should be handled .
certain aspects of the latter , including a proposed plan to allow for the deportation of asylum seekers to " safe " third countries , have come under heavy fire from human rights organizations .
the ministers will meet again at the end of april to take up the issue again , but according to the german interior minister otto schily , " it could be close " .
germany drops opposition to asylum criteria the breakthrough came after the german government dropped its long-standing opposition to a policy determining who is eligible to apply for asylum , specifically the recognition of asylum seekers who are fleeing non-state persecution , like men who are being pursued by drug cartels or women who face female genital mutilation .
the expected approval of a sweeping new immigration law in germany , which has led to a compromise on key issues between the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and the conservative christian democratic opposition , cleared the way for schily to adopt a more conciliatory tone .
under the rules agreed on tuesday , the eu will not only offer protection to people who are refugees according to the 1951 geneva convention , they will also offer so-called subsidiary protection to victims of non-state persecution .
human rights groups protest key points not good enough , say some human rights groups .
following the recent election of anti-immigration parties in several european countries , asylum policy remains a politically loaded and divisive issue .
human rights groups - citing the increasingly restrictive nature of the eu policies - have publicly objected to key aspects of the draft , namely the still unresolved questions over how asylum requests will be handled .
in an unprecedented move , several groups , including human rights watch , amnesty international , and the european council for refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , jointly called on the eu to scrap the agreement , claiming it violates international law .
at issue are two aspects of the proposed agreement .
the first deals with a suggestion in the directive on the use of a " safe country of origin " concept , which means the eu would compile a list of " safe countries " and asylum requests from persons originating from these countries would be considered illegitimate .
the second issue is a so-called " safe third county " concept , which means asylum seekers can be deported to a third country deemed safe .
neither was resolved at the meeting on tuesday and has been put off until the end of april .
" these proposals would deny some asylum seekers access to full and fair procedures , and it would transfer them to countries outside europe , " said ben ward of human rights watch .
" we 're deeply concerned that the eu is trying to get other countries to shoulder its responsibilities . "

eu interior ministers have acheived partial success on controversial plans to create a europe-wide asylum policy .
human rights groups however remain troubled over the unresolved elements . eu interior ministers met in brussels on tuesday to make yet another effort to hammer out a europe-wide asylum policy .
the meeting took on an added sense of urgency with the ministers struggling to comply with a self-imposed may 1 deadline , the date on which ten new countries join the eu .
ending almost six years of acrimonious negotiations , they reached a partial breakthrough on key aspects of the legislation . the ministers agreed on a set of criteria establishing who can apply for asylum .
however , they could not agree on some procedural points determining how such requests should be handled .
certain aspects of the latter , including a proposed plan to allow for the deportation of asylum seekers to " safe " third countries , have come under heavy fire from human rights organizations .
the ministers will meet again at the end of april to take up the issue again , but according to the german interior minister otto schily , " it could be close " .
germany drops opposition to asylum criteria the breakthrough came after the german government dropped its long-standing opposition to a policy determining who is eligible to apply for asylum , specifically the recognition of asylum seekers who are fleeing non-state persecution , like men who are being pursued by drug cartels or women who face female genital mutilation .
the expected approval of a sweeping new immigration law in germany , which has led to a compromise on key issues between the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and the conservative christian democratic opposition , cleared the way for schily to adopt a more conciliatory tone .
under the rules agreed on tuesday , the eu will not only offer protection to people who are refugees according to the 1951 geneva convention , they will also offer so-called subsidiary protection to victims of non-state persecution .
human rights groups protest key points not good enough , say some human rights groups .
following the recent election of anti-immigration parties in several european countries , asylum policy remains a politically loaded and divisive issue .
human rights groups - citing the increasingly restrictive nature of the eu policies - have publicly objected to key aspects of the draft , namely the still unresolved questions over how asylum requests will be handled .
in an unprecedented move , several groups , including human rights watch , amnesty international , and the european council for refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , jointly called on the eu to scrap the agreement , claiming it violates international law .
at issue are two aspects of the proposed agreement .
the first deals with a suggestion in the directive on the use of a " safe country of origin " concept , which means the eu would compile a list of " safe countries " and asylum requests from persons originating from these countries would be considered illegitimate .
the second issue is a so-called " safe third county " concept , which means asylum seekers can be deported to a third country deemed safe .
neither was resolved at the meeting on tuesday and has been put off until the end of april .
" these proposals would deny some asylum seekers access to full and fair procedures , and it would transfer them to countries outside europe , " said ben ward of human rights watch .
" we 're deeply concerned that the eu is trying to get other countries to shoulder its responsibilities . "

the hunger for culture in afghanistan is overcoming the physical challenges of bringing art , film , theater and education to the people .
german organizations are at the forefront of this afghan renaissance . while the diplomats and dignitaries at the afghanistan conference in berlin begin to discuss efforts to rebuild , refinance and stabilize the war-torn country , one area of reconstruction is already well underway - the cultural aspect of afghan life is thriving despite very difficult conditions thanks to efforts from german organizations . germany ’ s cultural flagship in afghanistan is the goethe institute .
the head office in the capital kabul had been closed for 12 years until it became the first foreign cultural institute to be reopened last september .
the demand for german-language classes is enormous , and the goethe institute also supports art exhibitions and theater and film productions .
people love the goethe institute , says wilfried grolig , director-general of the department for culture and education at the german foreign office . “ people here in kabul are culturally starved - they ’ re interested in everything ! ” he said .
“ so opening up windows of opportunity and importing culture from the outside world , especially from germany , is the right idea , ” grolig told deutsche welle . germany supports new schools windows of opportunity also includes opening up two schools , financed by the german foreign office .
the schools , one for boys and one for girls , teach over 4,000 pupils . the daad , a german academic program , is also very active in kabul .
it provides german university lecturers with additional training and sends them to colleges in afghanistan .
but the conditions under which teachers must educate and students must learn are often horrendous , according to wilfried grolig . “ when i was in kabul , i was invited to watch a theater group rehearse for the play " antigone , " which is about betrayal and death , set in a really dilapidated room .
had it been for a performance in berlin , we would have said ‘ wow , the director ’ s had a brainstorm for the stage scenery . ’
but in kabul , that ’ s not stage scenery — it ’ s reality . ” wide range of re-training schemes the german government supports projects in other parts of afghanistan too , especially projects for women .
and german specialists train lawyers and judges , while also helping to set up a new media system in the country .
the guiding principles behind all the projects are democracy , human rights , and freedom of opinion , says grolig , but that doesn ’ t mean transposing german culture onto afghanistan . “ it ’ s not about forcing our culture onto other people .
it ’ s about creating a forum for dialogue , ” he says . the german government intends to further support cultural and educational programs in afghanistan , and grolig says he hopes the international conference will clearly show that the international community is still on afghanistan ’ s side in helping to rebuild the country . louisa schaefer -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beating the drug lords and rebuilding a country on wednesday , international leaders will meet in berlin to take stock of rebuilding efforts in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.03.2004 bertelsmann plans asia push großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's biggest media company wants to become a household name in asia despite a global slump on the advertising and music market , europe ’ s biggest media group , germany-based bertelsmann , is looking towards black ink and a major expansion in asia this year . earlier this year bertelsmann chairman gunter thielen traveled to china , india and vietnam to explore business opportunities there .
by the time he returned , he had made up his mind : europe ’ s biggest media group must immediately boost its position on the asian markets in order to profit from the dynamic growth in the region .
in china and india , bertelsmann has already set up shop . in the beijing region , for example , the group has already brought in 1.5 million members for its chinese-language book club .
and that 's only the beginning .
a million served bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gunter thielen " our team currently sells 20 million books in china , " thielen said tuesday at the company 's board meeting .
" that ’ s the same amount of books as we sell in france .
the turnover , however , is only a tenth in china , because there a book costs $ 1.5 while it costs $ 15 in france .
that ’ s the big difference and the reason for this is that the chinese market is still being regulated , " thielen said . " but once that starts changing , the prices will increase and so will our turnover .
in a long term perspective of 10 or 15 years , we will multiply our sales in asia and at some point it will represent at least 10 percent of our revenues , " he added .
the company still has a long way to go .
of its approximately € 17 billion in revenues last year , just € 2 billion came from sales in asia .
with a string of new investments , bertelsmann is seeking to increase its market share .
in china , bertelsmann wants to invest heavily in printing and publishing houses .
" we will stay away from the music sector , " he said .
" the bootleg system is so sophisticated in china , you can purchase a disc for $ 1 at any corner there .
that ’ s why it doesn ’ t make sense for us to produce discs in china . "
a fast growing market in india , bertelsmann ’ s random house publishing arm , as well as the printing subsidiary arvato , is already active .
still , business there is only just starting for the media group and the future looks promising , as india currently has growth rates of 7-8 percent per year - nearly comparable to those in china .
both are markets that bring euros to the eyes of bertelsmann managers .
" together they have a population of 2.4 billion people thus representing a third of the world population , " he said .
" this must become a market one day .
of course if you compare these countries to america , they are still dwarfs .
but if you look at their growth rates it ’ s clear that we must closely watch these markets .
and i am positive that we will increasingly position ourselves there . "
today the media giant only makes 3 percent of its turnover in asia , that ’ s around € 600 million per year .
and only 1 percent - about € 200 million - are being earned in eastern europe , which bertelsmann also views as a promising market for its television , publishing and printing operations .
currently , germany remains one of bertelsmann 's most important markets .
a third of the company 's overall turnover is made here , with 40 percent coming from the rest of europe and 25 percent in the united states and canada .
only 3 percent of revenues are currently derived from its asian units .
preparing for a mega-merger the company 's book publishing division , based in new york , is the market leader in the united states and britain .
new york is also the headquarters for its worldwide music business , which will soon be merging with sony 's music operations .
with a world music market share of approximately 12 percent , bertelsmann is expected to be the dominant partner in the joint venture .
last year , bertelsmann artists including britney spears and justin timberlake won 22 grammy awards .
and the company 's gruner + jahr magazine publishing division , the market leader in germany and france and a strong presence in the u.s. , is planning on introducing 20 new glossy magazines around the world . dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a victory for the old in berlin with the opening of bertelsmann ’ s new berlin headquarters and plans to reconstruct hohenzollern palace , someday , germany 's capital is looking back to the future .

a member of the european parliament has accused hundreds of his colleagues of pocketing allowances for parliamentary sessions they have not attended .
the parliament says it could investigate as many as 200 members . hans-peter martin told germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper on monday that he has collected detailed records over the past two years that show that many of his colleagues in the european parliament habitually enter their names in the parliamentary register , but then skip meetings .
for signing the register , based on the understanding that they attend the sessions , members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- receive a € 262 -lrb- $ 320 -rrb- per diem .
martin , an mep from austria , claimed many either sign the register , which is accessible between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. , before flying home or send " front men " to sign on their behalf .
he said he had discovered 7,200 instances of fraud through what he alleged were forged per diem claims and attendance records to claim expenses .
wide-spread abuse ?
" brussel 's enormous expense system is being abused , " he said , " especially when delegates come in early , quickly sign in and then leave the city . "
martin also claimed that a favorite practice among meps has been to take an evening flight to brussels , sign the register before 10 p.m. , sign again the following day and attend a session before signing again the next morning and flying home .
this would earn them around € 795 in supplements on top of travel costs and the usual salary for spending just one session in parliament .
-lrb- meps are given salaries that are equivalent to those of members of their national parliaments and can range anywhere from just over € 2,000 a month to nearly € 10,000 .
efforts to reform the pay system and implement a single salary for members of the european parliament have repeatedly stalled since they began to be discussed earnestly in 1998 . -rrb-
allowance may be legitimate david harley , spokesman for the european parliament , said meps could legitimately claim their daily allowance if they were present in parliament , whether or not they took part in debates .
he said members could be working in their offices , writing reports or talking to journalists and also complex travel arrangements meant they often arrived late and left early .
but martin has described the practices as a " scam , " and he claimed nearly half of all german meps and several from other countries including britain are part of it .
the allegations of misuse of funds have shaken parliament , and many have stepped up to defend their fellow parliamentarians .
german mep hans-gert pöttering said meps are conscientious and work long hours .
" the vast majority of our colleagues do their work conscientiously , with a workload of 60 to 70 hours a week , " he said .
meanwhile , ireland 's mary banotti , a conservative , said martin ’ s allegations are causing immense distress to many colleagues .
daniel cohn-bendit , a prominent german green party member who is also in parliament , criticized martin for revealing his allegations to a german tabloid newspaper .
" to reveal this issue in this way is simply mobbing , " he said , referring to the practice of bullying workers until they leave a company .
parliament expenses under the loop members of the european parliament are currently paid a salary and expenses under an oft-criticized system set up in the 1960s that , among other things , allows meps to pocket the difference between full fare air tickets and discount fares when traveling between brussels , strasbourg and their constituencies . anita purcell -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany blocks eu parliament pay reform germany and three other eu states have blocked an attempt to reform the pay system for european parliamentarians , meaning it 's now unlikely that a reform package will be passed before eu-wide elections in june .

the third international conference on afghanistan opened in berlin on wednesday with an inaugural speech by german chancellor schröder promising more financial aid to the war-torn country . german chancellor gerhard schröder opened the afghanistan conference in berlin on wednesday by pledging to afghan president hamid karzai that the international community would not abandon his country , one of the world 's poorest and the biggest opium supplier . karzai , who was seated next to the chancellor at the top table , which also included the u.n. afghanistan envoy jean arnault , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and the foreign ministers of britain , china , germany , pakistan and russia , listened intently as schröder delivered his opening speech . " a peaceful afghanistan is an anchor for greater political stability in the region and a sign of hope for us all , " schröder told the assembled dignitaries and press .
" it is proof that it is worth fighting against terror and violence . " the two-day conference is the third such international meeting on afghanistan since the end of the u.s.-led war .
the conference will address ways to stabilize the country 's political and economic reconstruction .
it will also tackle the problems of insecurity and drugs production plaguing the country despite the ousting of the taliban regime more than two years ago . chancellor schröder highlighted the three main goals of the conference : to support the political progress , including elections planned for september ; to increase aid for the country 's reconstruction ; and to help the kabul government establish security and the rule of law . schröder rallies international community he also used the speech to rally those countries that had already supported reconstruction efforts in afghanistan by reminding the hundreds of delegates , including 20 foreign ministers and officials from more than 60 countries and organizations , that there had been many successes in spite of the difficult conditions that still prevailed . " the positive developments in afghanistan show what can be achieved when we combine our efforts , " he said .
" every success that we score in bringing afghanistan on a path towards more freedom and security is not only progress for people in the country .
it is a success for us all . " in his speech later in the day , karzai said his country had come a long way since the fall of the taliban , with a constitution that reflected a desire to be partners with the international community and no longer " threatened by drugs and terrorism . " " what we have achieved is very promising , but let me be frank and say that the reconstruction has only begun , " karzai told the gathering . federal government extends financial aid bildunterschrift : on the subject of financial assistance , schröder vowed that germany would contribute € 320 million -lrb- $ 389.5 million -rrb- over the next four years to boost the reconstruction process in afghanistan .
the amount of financial aid by the german government since september 2001 will eventually total € 7.4 billion . sadako ogata , japan 's envoy to afghanistan , followed schröder 's lead by pledging $ 400 million -lrb- € 328.6 million -rrb- over the next two years .
" i am pleased to announce that japan is prepared to make further grant assistance amounting to $ 400 million over the coming two years , which brings japan 's contribution since september 2001 to over $ 1 billion , " she said .

afghan finance minister ashraf ghani told the handelsblatt business daily on tuesday that he was content with the international commitment so far , but more was necessary . he said earlier this month that $ 27.5 billion would be needed in the next seven years and previous promises " vastly underestimated " afghanistan 's needs . reconstruction minister amin farhang added in an interview with germany 's inforadio that he hoped the promised money would go directly to the kabul government instead of mainly to non-governmental organizations .
farhang told the radio station that afghanistan needed around $ 4.5 billion for this year , which would help train the afghan army and police force to tackle the rampant drugs problem controlled largely by influential provincial warlords . germany 's pledge of more financial aid came hours after u.s. secretary of state colin powell praised german efforts in aiding afghanistan . powell praises german efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : powell praised german efforts .
in an article in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , powell said , " it is in no small part thanks to germany 's engagement that afghanistan has made the progress it has that we want to pay tribute to at this international conference . "
" germany has shown vision and leadership quality , " he added .

they fear the information will not be properly safeguarded . members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- have threatened to take the european commission to the eu 's top court if it does not withdraw its decision to transfer air passenger data to u.s. authorities .
they fear there are insufficient guarantees that the data will be protected .
dutch liberal mep johanna boogerd-quaak presented the resolution which was approved by meps with 229 votes in favor , 202 against and 19 abstentions .
" we are not satisfied with the privacy safeguards secured by the commission , and we now expect them to withdraw their decision and come back with better safeguards , " boogerd-quaak said .
" if they do not , parliament has indicated that we are willing to go to the european court of justice , " she added .
boogerd-quaak said only 19 categories of data should be relayed to the united states , instead of the current 34 , and the three and a half year period for which data can be retained should be shortened .
the eu agreed in december to allow the u.s. access to passenger data on transatlantic flights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.03.2004 bertelsmann plans asia push großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's biggest media company wants to become a household name in asia despite a global slump on the advertising and music market , europe ’ s biggest media group , germany-based bertelsmann , is looking towards black ink and a major expansion in asia this year . earlier this year bertelsmann chairman gunter thielen traveled to china , india and vietnam to explore business opportunities there .
by the time he returned , he had made up his mind : europe ’ s biggest media group must immediately boost its position on the asian markets in order to profit from the dynamic growth in the region .
in china and india , bertelsmann has already set up shop . in the beijing region , for example , the group has already brought in 1.5 million members for its chinese-language book club .
and that 's only the beginning .
a million served bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gunter thielen " our team currently sells 20 million books in china , " thielen said tuesday at the company 's board meeting .
" that ’ s the same amount of books as we sell in france .
the turnover , however , is only a tenth in china , because there a book costs $ 1.5 while it costs $ 15 in france .
that ’ s the big difference and the reason for this is that the chinese market is still being regulated , " thielen said . " but once that starts changing , the prices will increase and so will our turnover .
in a long term perspective of 10 or 15 years , we will multiply our sales in asia and at some point it will represent at least 10 percent of our revenues , " he added .
the company still has a long way to go .
of its approximately € 17 billion in revenues last year , just € 2 billion came from sales in asia .
with a string of new investments , bertelsmann is seeking to increase its market share .
in china , bertelsmann wants to invest heavily in printing and publishing houses .
" we will stay away from the music sector , " he said .
" the bootleg system is so sophisticated in china , you can purchase a disc for $ 1 at any corner there .
that ’ s why it doesn ’ t make sense for us to produce discs in china . "
a fast growing market in india , bertelsmann ’ s random house publishing arm , as well as the printing subsidiary arvato , is already active .
still , business there is only just starting for the media group and the future looks promising , as india currently has growth rates of 7-8 percent per year - nearly comparable to those in china .
both are markets that bring euros to the eyes of bertelsmann managers .
" together they have a population of 2.4 billion people thus representing a third of the world population , " he said .
" this must become a market one day .
of course if you compare these countries to america , they are still dwarfs .
but if you look at their growth rates it ’ s clear that we must closely watch these markets .
and i am positive that we will increasingly position ourselves there . "
today the media giant only makes 3 percent of its turnover in asia , that ’ s around € 600 million per year .
and only 1 percent - about € 200 million - are being earned in eastern europe , which bertelsmann also views as a promising market for its television , publishing and printing operations .
currently , germany remains one of bertelsmann 's most important markets .
a third of the company 's overall turnover is made here , with 40 percent coming from the rest of europe and 25 percent in the united states and canada .
only 3 percent of revenues are currently derived from its asian units .
preparing for a mega-merger the company 's book publishing division , based in new york , is the market leader in the united states and britain .
new york is also the headquarters for its worldwide music business , which will soon be merging with sony 's music operations .
with a world music market share of approximately 12 percent , bertelsmann is expected to be the dominant partner in the joint venture .
last year , bertelsmann artists including britney spears and justin timberlake won 22 grammy awards .
and the company 's gruner + jahr magazine publishing division , the market leader in germany and france and a strong presence in the u.s. , is planning on introducing 20 new glossy magazines around the world . dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a victory for the old in berlin with the opening of bertelsmann ’ s new berlin headquarters and plans to reconstruct hohenzollern palace , someday , germany 's capital is looking back to the future .

the hunger for culture in afghanistan is overcoming the physical challenges of bringing art , film , theater and education to the people .
german organizations are at the forefront of this afghan renaissance . while the diplomats and dignitaries at the afghanistan conference in berlin begin to discuss efforts to rebuild , refinance and stabilize the war-torn country , one area of reconstruction is already well underway - the cultural aspect of afghan life is thriving despite very difficult conditions thanks to efforts from german organizations . germany ’ s cultural flagship in afghanistan is the goethe institute .
the head office in the capital kabul had been closed for 12 years until it became the first foreign cultural institute to be reopened last september .
the demand for german-language classes is enormous , and the goethe institute also supports art exhibitions and theater and film productions .
people love the goethe institute , says wilfried grolig , director-general of the department for culture and education at the german foreign office . “ people here in kabul are culturally starved - they ’ re interested in everything ! ” he said .

the schools , one for boys and one for girls , teach over 4,000 pupils . the daad , a german academic program , is also very active in kabul .
it provides german university lecturers with additional training and sends them to colleges in afghanistan .

the judge , brigitte koppenhoefer , made the statement on wednesday , following a mid-trial review .
she said prosecutors had yet to prove that ackermann offered excessive bonuses amounting to bribes to the top executives at mannesmann in order to smooth over a takeover bid by vodaphone in early 2000 .
koppenhoefer said there was not enough evidence to support the central criminal charge of breach of trust to shareholders , though there was some evidence of lesser violations of share law .

according to ukrainian and eu officials , the deal was provisionally signed by both sides on tuesday .
the european commission has been demanding the automatic extension of the political and cooperation agreement , which forms the legal basis of bilateral relations , to cover the new member states .
ukraine , however , has asked for compensation for the enlargement of the eu , which it says will hurt trade .
both sides have said discussions on ukraine 's concerns will continue , while the european commission has been playing down the link between the talks and the full endorsement of the agreement .
with russia continuing to press for concessions before signing a similar agreement , ukraine is keen to point out its apparently cooperative stance .
kiev wants to see talks continue on steel quotas , anti-dumping and tariffs on pipe products .

a member of the european parliament has accused hundreds of his colleagues of pocketing allowances for parliamentary sessions they have not attended .
the parliament says it could investigate as many as 200 members . hans-peter martin told germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper on monday that he has collected detailed records over the past two years that show that many of his colleagues in the european parliament habitually enter their names in the parliamentary register , but then skip meetings .
for signing the register , based on the understanding that they attend the sessions , members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- receive a € 262 -lrb- $ 320 -rrb- per diem .
martin , an mep from austria , claimed many either sign the register , which is accessible between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. , before flying home or send " front men " to sign on their behalf .
he said he had discovered 7,200 instances of fraud through what he alleged were forged per diem claims and attendance records to claim expenses .
wide-spread abuse ?
" brussel 's enormous expense system is being abused , " he said , " especially when delegates come in early , quickly sign in and then leave the city . "
martin also claimed that a favorite practice among meps has been to take an evening flight to brussels , sign the register before 10 p.m. , sign again the following day and attend a session before signing again the next morning and flying home .
this would earn them around € 795 in supplements on top of travel costs and the usual salary for spending just one session in parliament .
-lrb- meps are given salaries that are equivalent to those of members of their national parliaments and can range anywhere from just over € 2,000 a month to nearly € 10,000 .
efforts to reform the pay system and implement a single salary for members of the european parliament have repeatedly stalled since they began to be discussed earnestly in 1998 . -rrb-
allowance may be legitimate david harley , spokesman for the european parliament , said meps could legitimately claim their daily allowance if they were present in parliament , whether or not they took part in debates .
he said members could be working in their offices , writing reports or talking to journalists and also complex travel arrangements meant they often arrived late and left early .
but martin has described the practices as a " scam , " and he claimed nearly half of all german meps and several from other countries including britain are part of it .
the allegations of misuse of funds have shaken parliament , and many have stepped up to defend their fellow parliamentarians .
german mep hans-gert pöttering said meps are conscientious and work long hours .
" the vast majority of our colleagues do their work conscientiously , with a workload of 60 to 70 hours a week , " he said .
meanwhile , ireland 's mary banotti , a conservative , said martin ’ s allegations are causing immense distress to many colleagues .
daniel cohn-bendit , a prominent german green party member who is also in parliament , criticized martin for revealing his allegations to a german tabloid newspaper .
" to reveal this issue in this way is simply mobbing , " he said , referring to the practice of bullying workers until they leave a company .
parliament expenses under the loop members of the european parliament are currently paid a salary and expenses under an oft-criticized system set up in the 1960s that , among other things , allows meps to pocket the difference between full fare air tickets and discount fares when traveling between brussels , strasbourg and their constituencies . anita purcell -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany blocks eu parliament pay reform germany and three other eu states have blocked an attempt to reform the pay system for european parliamentarians , meaning it 's now unlikely that a reform package will be passed before eu-wide elections in june .

on wednesday , international leaders will meet in berlin to take stock of rebuilding efforts in afghanistan .
reconstruction financing and a booming opium trade remain major challenges . afghan leader hamid karzai and his trademark head covering will take center stage in berlin on wednesday , when 54 nations meet to analyze the progress and problems in afghanistan three years after the fall of the taliban . karzai , in the german capital on tuesday , highlighted his country 's battle with drug lords and dwindling financial resources as the major talking points at the two-day conference , which will be attended by u.s. secretary of state colin powell . " we will be asking -lrb- the international community -rrb- to increase their assistance to afghanistan in order for all of us to succeed in bringing about a safer , better , standing-on-its-own-feet afghanistan , " karzai told reporters after meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder , according to reuters . germany ready for the long haul the afghan leader has already picked up important pledges from german officials .
schröder , whose country has 1,900 peacekeeping troops in kabul and the northern city of kunduz , said germany was prepared to stay in the war-torn country for the long haul . bildunterschrift : schröder and karzai met on tuesday , on the eve of the two-day conference . germany has provided roughly € 80 million -lrb- $ 97 million -rrb- in aid each year since 2002 .
on wednesday , german officials are expected to announce that they will continue their aid program until 2008 . the united states , the biggest donor ahead of germany and japan , will most likely offer $ 1 billion on top of the $ 1.2 billion it has already pledged this year .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said tuesday that the leading donor countries hope other countries will pledge more aid . afghan leaders estimate that $ 27.5 billion is needed over the next seven years for reconstruction .
donors worldwide have so far pledged $ 4.2 billion through 2004 . " we obviously hope we will gather as large a sum as possible , " fischer told reporters . afghan opium flooding world markets not only financial woes , but the country 's growing drug problem are likely to be major discussion points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poppy field in afghanistan far more lucrative than wheat fields and growable even in the substandard afghani soil , experts estimate opium production makes up roughly half of the country 's € 4.4 billion gross domestic product and poses a significant security problem . " through that , warlords and terrorist finance themselves , " says general rick hillier , who commands the nato stability force in the region .
" that means they lag even more in giving up power to the central government . " most of the opium produced in afghanistan ends up in european markets as heroin , according to the un drugs authority .
as a result , governments have been more open recently to helping the afghan government , suggesting crop alternatives for farmers and pledging to invest in sectors that will create more jobs . isaf troops not ready to fight drug trade problems remain .
the international security assistance force has so far refused to involve itself in the fight against drug production and smuggling , leaving an ill-equipped afghan police force and army to fend for themselves .
in the past year , a few kilos of heroin have fallen into afghan law enforcement 's hands .
that 's a drop in the bucket compared to the estimated 3,600 tons of opium that left the country last year , according to un drug authorities . " the fight against drugs is the fight for afghanistan , " karzai said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern alliance fighters afghan police plan a major offensive in the coming weeks to burn 75 percent of the poppy fields in three afghan provinces .
the offensive will later be extended to all 32 provinces .
the u.s. government has pledged $ 40 million exclusively for creating and financing anti-drug troop units . but karzai said alternatives need to be found for the farmers , who make far more money producing opium poppies , the raw material for heroin , than any other crop . speaking before a roomful of business people on tuesday , including representatives of the world bank , karzai pushed raisins and saffron as possible options for weaning farmers off of drug production .

a member of the european parliament has accused hundreds of his colleagues of pocketing allowances for parliamentary sessions they have not attended .
the parliament says it could investigate as many as 200 members . hans-peter martin told germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper on monday that he has collected detailed records over the past two years that show that many of his colleagues in the european parliament habitually enter their names in the parliamentary register , but then skip meetings .
for signing the register , based on the understanding that they attend the sessions , members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- receive a € 262 -lrb- $ 320 -rrb- per diem .
martin , an mep from austria , claimed many either sign the register , which is accessible between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. , before flying home or send " front men " to sign on their behalf .
he said he had discovered 7,200 instances of fraud through what he alleged were forged per diem claims and attendance records to claim expenses .
wide-spread abuse ?
" brussel 's enormous expense system is being abused , " he said , " especially when delegates come in early , quickly sign in and then leave the city . "
martin also claimed that a favorite practice among meps has been to take an evening flight to brussels , sign the register before 10 p.m. , sign again the following day and attend a session before signing again the next morning and flying home .
this would earn them around € 795 in supplements on top of travel costs and the usual salary for spending just one session in parliament .
-lrb- meps are given salaries that are equivalent to those of members of their national parliaments and can range anywhere from just over € 2,000 a month to nearly € 10,000 .
efforts to reform the pay system and implement a single salary for members of the european parliament have repeatedly stalled since they began to be discussed earnestly in 1998 . -rrb-
allowance may be legitimate david harley , spokesman for the european parliament , said meps could legitimately claim their daily allowance if they were present in parliament , whether or not they took part in debates .
he said members could be working in their offices , writing reports or talking to journalists and also complex travel arrangements meant they often arrived late and left early .

on wednesday , international leaders will meet in berlin to take stock of rebuilding efforts in afghanistan .
reconstruction financing and a booming opium trade remain major challenges . afghan leader hamid karzai and his trademark head covering will take center stage in berlin on wednesday , when 54 nations meet to analyze the progress and problems in afghanistan three years after the fall of the taliban . karzai , in the german capital on tuesday , highlighted his country 's battle with drug lords and dwindling financial resources as the major talking points at the two-day conference , which will be attended by u.s. secretary of state colin powell . " we will be asking -lrb- the international community -rrb- to increase their assistance to afghanistan in order for all of us to succeed in bringing about a safer , better , standing-on-its-own-feet afghanistan , " karzai told reporters after meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder , according to reuters . germany ready for the long haul the afghan leader has already picked up important pledges from german officials .
schröder , whose country has 1,900 peacekeeping troops in kabul and the northern city of kunduz , said germany was prepared to stay in the war-torn country for the long haul . bildunterschrift : schröder and karzai met on tuesday , on the eve of the two-day conference . germany has provided roughly € 80 million -lrb- $ 97 million -rrb- in aid each year since 2002 .
on wednesday , german officials are expected to announce that they will continue their aid program until 2008 . the united states , the biggest donor ahead of germany and japan , will most likely offer $ 1 billion on top of the $ 1.2 billion it has already pledged this year .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said tuesday that the leading donor countries hope other countries will pledge more aid . afghan leaders estimate that $ 27.5 billion is needed over the next seven years for reconstruction .
donors worldwide have so far pledged $ 4.2 billion through 2004 . " we obviously hope we will gather as large a sum as possible , " fischer told reporters . afghan opium flooding world markets not only financial woes , but the country 's growing drug problem are likely to be major discussion points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poppy field in afghanistan far more lucrative than wheat fields and growable even in the substandard afghani soil , experts estimate opium production makes up roughly half of the country 's € 4.4 billion gross domestic product and poses a significant security problem . " through that , warlords and terrorist finance themselves , " says general rick hillier , who commands the nato stability force in the region .
" that means they lag even more in giving up power to the central government . " most of the opium produced in afghanistan ends up in european markets as heroin , according to the un drugs authority .
as a result , governments have been more open recently to helping the afghan government , suggesting crop alternatives for farmers and pledging to invest in sectors that will create more jobs . isaf troops not ready to fight drug trade problems remain .
the international security assistance force has so far refused to involve itself in the fight against drug production and smuggling , leaving an ill-equipped afghan police force and army to fend for themselves .
in the past year , a few kilos of heroin have fallen into afghan law enforcement 's hands .
that 's a drop in the bucket compared to the estimated 3,600 tons of opium that left the country last year , according to un drug authorities .

the hunger for culture in afghanistan is overcoming the physical challenges of bringing art , film , theater and education to the people .
german organizations are at the forefront of this afghan renaissance . while the diplomats and dignitaries at the afghanistan conference in berlin begin to discuss efforts to rebuild , refinance and stabilize the war-torn country , one area of reconstruction is already well underway - the cultural aspect of afghan life is thriving despite very difficult conditions thanks to efforts from german organizations . germany ’ s cultural flagship in afghanistan is the goethe institute .
the head office in the capital kabul had been closed for 12 years until it became the first foreign cultural institute to be reopened last september .
the demand for german-language classes is enormous , and the goethe institute also supports art exhibitions and theater and film productions .
people love the goethe institute , says wilfried grolig , director-general of the department for culture and education at the german foreign office . “ people here in kabul are culturally starved - they ’ re interested in everything ! ” he said .
“ so opening up windows of opportunity and importing culture from the outside world , especially from germany , is the right idea , ” grolig told deutsche welle . germany supports new schools windows of opportunity also includes opening up two schools , financed by the german foreign office .
the schools , one for boys and one for girls , teach over 4,000 pupils . the daad , a german academic program , is also very active in kabul .
it provides german university lecturers with additional training and sends them to colleges in afghanistan .
but the conditions under which teachers must educate and students must learn are often horrendous , according to wilfried grolig . “ when i was in kabul , i was invited to watch a theater group rehearse for the play " antigone , " which is about betrayal and death , set in a really dilapidated room .
had it been for a performance in berlin , we would have said ‘ wow , the director ’ s had a brainstorm for the stage scenery . ’
but in kabul , that ’ s not stage scenery — it ’ s reality . ” wide range of re-training schemes the german government supports projects in other parts of afghanistan too , especially projects for women .
and german specialists train lawyers and judges , while also helping to set up a new media system in the country .
the guiding principles behind all the projects are democracy , human rights , and freedom of opinion , says grolig , but that doesn ’ t mean transposing german culture onto afghanistan . “ it ’ s not about forcing our culture onto other people .
it ’ s about creating a forum for dialogue , ” he says . the german government intends to further support cultural and educational programs in afghanistan , and grolig says he hopes the international conference will clearly show that the international community is still on afghanistan ’ s side in helping to rebuild the country . louisa schaefer -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beating the drug lords and rebuilding a country on wednesday , international leaders will meet in berlin to take stock of rebuilding efforts in afghanistan .

europe 's new counter-terrorism chief gijs de vries reported to work this week amid enduring questions over the exact nature of his work and his plans to keep europe safe . gijs de vries , a relatively low-profile former dutch interior minister and member of the european parliament , was appointed europe 's first " anti-terrorism czar " last week .
the post , created amid a surge of european unity following the madrid bombings and after years of talks on the necessity of such a position , is a strong sign that european anti-terrorism efforts have taken on a new urgency .
introduced at a packed news briefing in brussels on tuesday this week , the eu 's new counter-terorism chief has attracted much attention .
but by his second day on the job , otto schily , germany 's interior minister - who was in brussels for a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers - was asking for further clarification of de vries ' new duties and his future plans .
indeed , the appointment of this experienced yet relatively unknown european politician has left many raising the same questions .
an experienced european technocrat the 48-year-old gijs de vries was born in new york and has a respected career in european politics behind him .
de vries served as a liberal member of the european parliament for fourteen years , before taking the position of interior minister in the netherlands .
the dual u.s.-dutch citizen is fluent in several languages , including french , german and english , and he holds degrees from the university of leiden and the european university institute in florence , italy .
though de vries has relatively little experience in security and intelligence matters , which has given some commentators food for thought , he is described by others as an experienced technocrat .
de vries will have to call upon all of his faculties , which include a diplomatic and businesslike manner as well as extensive political knowledge , to implement the task he has been charged with : helping to safeguard europe 's security in an ever-more insecure world .
officially , de vries will be responsible for seeing that the various government bodies of eu member states and eu institutions in brussels work together to pool resources and intelligence .
namely , he has been charged with what romano prodi , the president of the european commission , has described as " breaking down the cultural obstacles to cooperation " .
what 's more , de vries can use his position to apply political pressure to eu members who lag behind in implementing the anti-terror measures that have already been agreed upon .
de vries has already promised to improve cooperation between european countries .
' ' terror is not just the concern of an intelligence agency in one nation , so the information gained must be shared by all nations , " he said .
a higher profile in the coming months how this still somewhat vague job description will translate into action remains to be seen during the coming months .
de vries ' plans will become more apparent in june , when he presents more specific proposals to eu heads of state at the next eu-wide summit in june .
but in his first days on the job , de vries has made some statements indicating his position on certain key issues .
notably , while pushing for the better exchange of resources and analysis , de vries said that increased efforts to fight terror in europe can not forfeit civil liberties .
" there can never be , in any society , a guarantee of 100 percent security , " de vries told reporters on tuesday after meeting with his boss , javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief . " we are living in an open society in europe , an open society in which people can enjoy many liberties , " he added .

europe 's new counter-terrorism chief gijs de vries reported to work this week amid enduring questions over the exact nature of his work and his plans to keep europe safe . gijs de vries , a relatively low-profile former dutch interior minister and member of the european parliament , was appointed europe 's first " anti-terrorism czar " last week .
the post , created amid a surge of european unity following the madrid bombings and after years of talks on the necessity of such a position , is a strong sign that european anti-terrorism efforts have taken on a new urgency .
introduced at a packed news briefing in brussels on tuesday this week , the eu 's new counter-terorism chief has attracted much attention .
but by his second day on the job , otto schily , germany 's interior minister - who was in brussels for a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers - was asking for further clarification of de vries ' new duties and his future plans .
indeed , the appointment of this experienced yet relatively unknown european politician has left many raising the same questions .
an experienced european technocrat the 48-year-old gijs de vries was born in new york and has a respected career in european politics behind him .
de vries served as a liberal member of the european parliament for fourteen years , before taking the position of interior minister in the netherlands .
the dual u.s.-dutch citizen is fluent in several languages , including french , german and english , and he holds degrees from the university of leiden and the european university institute in florence , italy .
though de vries has relatively little experience in security and intelligence matters , which has given some commentators food for thought , he is described by others as an experienced technocrat .
de vries will have to call upon all of his faculties , which include a diplomatic and businesslike manner as well as extensive political knowledge , to implement the task he has been charged with : helping to safeguard europe 's security in an ever-more insecure world .
officially , de vries will be responsible for seeing that the various government bodies of eu member states and eu institutions in brussels work together to pool resources and intelligence .
namely , he has been charged with what romano prodi , the president of the european commission , has described as " breaking down the cultural obstacles to cooperation " .
what 's more , de vries can use his position to apply political pressure to eu members who lag behind in implementing the anti-terror measures that have already been agreed upon .
de vries has already promised to improve cooperation between european countries .
' ' terror is not just the concern of an intelligence agency in one nation , so the information gained must be shared by all nations , " he said .
a higher profile in the coming months how this still somewhat vague job description will translate into action remains to be seen during the coming months .
de vries ' plans will become more apparent in june , when he presents more specific proposals to eu heads of state at the next eu-wide summit in june .
but in his first days on the job , de vries has made some statements indicating his position on certain key issues .
notably , while pushing for the better exchange of resources and analysis , de vries said that increased efforts to fight terror in europe can not forfeit civil liberties .
" there can never be , in any society , a guarantee of 100 percent security , " de vries told reporters on tuesday after meeting with his boss , javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief . " we are living in an open society in europe , an open society in which people can enjoy many liberties , " he added .
" it is important to preserve those liberties , to build on them . " dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops agenda at eu summit european union leaders arrived in brussels on thursday for their annual spring summit .

what 's more , de vries can use his position to apply political pressure to eu members who lag behind in implementing the anti-terror measures that have already been agreed upon .
de vries has already promised to improve cooperation between european countries .
' ' terror is not just the concern of an intelligence agency in one nation , so the information gained must be shared by all nations , " he said .
a higher profile in the coming months how this still somewhat vague job description will translate into action remains to be seen during the coming months .
de vries ' plans will become more apparent in june , when he presents more specific proposals to eu heads of state at the next eu-wide summit in june .
but in his first days on the job , de vries has made some statements indicating his position on certain key issues .
notably , while pushing for the better exchange of resources and analysis , de vries said that increased efforts to fight terror in europe can not forfeit civil liberties .
" there can never be , in any society , a guarantee of 100 percent security , " de vries told reporters on tuesday after meeting with his boss , javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief . " we are living in an open society in europe , an open society in which people can enjoy many liberties , " he added .
" it is important to preserve those liberties , to build on them . " dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops agenda at eu summit european union leaders arrived in brussels on thursday for their annual spring summit .

just weeks before entering into what has - until now - been western europe 's most exclusive club , a small polish town has decided its coat of arms needs to comply with western beauty standards . when the coastal town of ustka was mulling over ways to improve its image , talk turned to the mermaid on the city 's coat of arms .
looking a little plump around the edges , town officials apparently felt their mermaid was n't exactly in line with western beauty standards - and this with their country just weeks from joining the european union .
" one female councilor said jokingly that the mermaid 's breasts were too small and that she was a bit fat , " a town spokesman told reuters .
what began as a joke soon became a national story , prompting the town to examine the idea a little more closely .
their remedy : an immediate dieting plan and some serious plastic surgery around the chest area , according to the spokesman .

europe 's new counter-terrorism chief gijs de vries reported to work this week amid enduring questions over the exact nature of his work and his plans to keep europe safe . gijs de vries , a relatively low-profile former dutch interior minister and member of the european parliament , was appointed europe 's first " anti-terrorism czar " last week .
the post , created amid a surge of european unity following the madrid bombings and after years of talks on the necessity of such a position , is a strong sign that european anti-terrorism efforts have taken on a new urgency .
introduced at a packed news briefing in brussels on tuesday this week , the eu 's new counter-terorism chief has attracted much attention .
but by his second day on the job , otto schily , germany 's interior minister - who was in brussels for a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers - was asking for further clarification of de vries ' new duties and his future plans .
indeed , the appointment of this experienced yet relatively unknown european politician has left many raising the same questions .
an experienced european technocrat the 48-year-old gijs de vries was born in new york and has a respected career in european politics behind him .
de vries served as a liberal member of the european parliament for fourteen years , before taking the position of interior minister in the netherlands .
the dual u.s.-dutch citizen is fluent in several languages , including french , german and english , and he holds degrees from the university of leiden and the european university institute in florence , italy .
though de vries has relatively little experience in security and intelligence matters , which has given some commentators food for thought , he is described by others as an experienced technocrat .
de vries will have to call upon all of his faculties , which include a diplomatic and businesslike manner as well as extensive political knowledge , to implement the task he has been charged with : helping to safeguard europe 's security in an ever-more insecure world .
officially , de vries will be responsible for seeing that the various government bodies of eu member states and eu institutions in brussels work together to pool resources and intelligence .
namely , he has been charged with what romano prodi , the president of the european commission , has described as " breaking down the cultural obstacles to cooperation " .
what 's more , de vries can use his position to apply political pressure to eu members who lag behind in implementing the anti-terror measures that have already been agreed upon .
de vries has already promised to improve cooperation between european countries .
' ' terror is not just the concern of an intelligence agency in one nation , so the information gained must be shared by all nations , " he said .
a higher profile in the coming months how this still somewhat vague job description will translate into action remains to be seen during the coming months .
de vries ' plans will become more apparent in june , when he presents more specific proposals to eu heads of state at the next eu-wide summit in june .
but in his first days on the job , de vries has made some statements indicating his position on certain key issues .
notably , while pushing for the better exchange of resources and analysis , de vries said that increased efforts to fight terror in europe can not forfeit civil liberties .
" there can never be , in any society , a guarantee of 100 percent security , " de vries told reporters on tuesday after meeting with his boss , javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief . " we are living in an open society in europe , an open society in which people can enjoy many liberties , " he added .

eu interior ministers have acheived partial success on controversial plans to create a europe-wide asylum policy .
human rights groups however remain troubled over the unresolved elements . eu interior ministers met in brussels on tuesday to make yet another effort to hammer out a europe-wide asylum policy .
the meeting took on an added sense of urgency with the ministers struggling to comply with a self-imposed may 1 deadline , the date on which ten new countries join the eu .
ending almost six years of acrimonious negotiations , they reached a partial breakthrough on key aspects of the legislation . the ministers agreed on a set of criteria establishing who can apply for asylum .
however , they could not agree on some procedural points determining how such requests should be handled .
certain aspects of the latter , including a proposed plan to allow for the deportation of asylum seekers to " safe " third countries , have come under heavy fire from human rights organizations .
the ministers will meet again at the end of april to take up the issue again , but according to the german interior minister otto schily , " it could be close " .
germany drops opposition to asylum criteria the breakthrough came after the german government dropped its long-standing opposition to a policy determining who is eligible to apply for asylum , specifically the recognition of asylum seekers who are fleeing non-state persecution , like men who are being pursued by drug cartels or women who face female genital mutilation .
the expected approval of a sweeping new immigration law in germany , which has led to a compromise on key issues between the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and the conservative christian democratic opposition , cleared the way for schily to adopt a more conciliatory tone .
under the rules agreed on tuesday , the eu will not only offer protection to people who are refugees according to the 1951 geneva convention , they will also offer so-called subsidiary protection to victims of non-state persecution .
human rights groups protest key points not good enough , say some human rights groups .
following the recent election of anti-immigration parties in several european countries , asylum policy remains a politically loaded and divisive issue .
human rights groups - citing the increasingly restrictive nature of the eu policies - have publicly objected to key aspects of the draft , namely the still unresolved questions over how asylum requests will be handled .
in an unprecedented move , several groups , including human rights watch , amnesty international , and the european council for refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , jointly called on the eu to scrap the agreement , claiming it violates international law .
at issue are two aspects of the proposed agreement .
the first deals with a suggestion in the directive on the use of a " safe country of origin " concept , which means the eu would compile a list of " safe countries " and asylum requests from persons originating from these countries would be considered illegitimate .
the second issue is a so-called " safe third county " concept , which means asylum seekers can be deported to a third country deemed safe .
neither was resolved at the meeting on tuesday and has been put off until the end of april .
" these proposals would deny some asylum seekers access to full and fair procedures , and it would transfer them to countries outside europe , " said ben ward of human rights watch .
" we 're deeply concerned that the eu is trying to get other countries to shoulder its responsibilities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum-seekers in hamburg daphne bouteillet paquet said the ministers should forget the proposals and start again .
" we feel we have no option but to call on the eu to scrap this proposal on asylum procedures , which has been shaped in reaction to populist pressures and fears whipped up about a non-existent flood of refugees into the eu , " she said .
schily rebuffs criticism schily responded to the human rights organization 's criticism , saying that the creation of a safe third country concept would allow the eu to avoid the processing costs associated with questionable claims , while those who are truly victims of oppression would be offered asylum .

eu interior ministers have acheived partial success on controversial plans to create a europe-wide asylum policy .
human rights groups however remain troubled over the unresolved elements . eu interior ministers met in brussels on tuesday to make yet another effort to hammer out a europe-wide asylum policy .
the meeting took on an added sense of urgency with the ministers struggling to comply with a self-imposed may 1 deadline , the date on which ten new countries join the eu .
ending almost six years of acrimonious negotiations , they reached a partial breakthrough on key aspects of the legislation . the ministers agreed on a set of criteria establishing who can apply for asylum .
however , they could not agree on some procedural points determining how such requests should be handled .
certain aspects of the latter , including a proposed plan to allow for the deportation of asylum seekers to " safe " third countries , have come under heavy fire from human rights organizations .
the ministers will meet again at the end of april to take up the issue again , but according to the german interior minister otto schily , " it could be close " .
germany drops opposition to asylum criteria the breakthrough came after the german government dropped its long-standing opposition to a policy determining who is eligible to apply for asylum , specifically the recognition of asylum seekers who are fleeing non-state persecution , like men who are being pursued by drug cartels or women who face female genital mutilation .
the expected approval of a sweeping new immigration law in germany , which has led to a compromise on key issues between the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and the conservative christian democratic opposition , cleared the way for schily to adopt a more conciliatory tone .
under the rules agreed on tuesday , the eu will not only offer protection to people who are refugees according to the 1951 geneva convention , they will also offer so-called subsidiary protection to victims of non-state persecution .
human rights groups protest key points not good enough , say some human rights groups .
following the recent election of anti-immigration parties in several european countries , asylum policy remains a politically loaded and divisive issue .
human rights groups - citing the increasingly restrictive nature of the eu policies - have publicly objected to key aspects of the draft , namely the still unresolved questions over how asylum requests will be handled .
in an unprecedented move , several groups , including human rights watch , amnesty international , and the european council for refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , jointly called on the eu to scrap the agreement , claiming it violates international law .
at issue are two aspects of the proposed agreement .
the first deals with a suggestion in the directive on the use of a " safe country of origin " concept , which means the eu would compile a list of " safe countries " and asylum requests from persons originating from these countries would be considered illegitimate .
the second issue is a so-called " safe third county " concept , which means asylum seekers can be deported to a third country deemed safe .
neither was resolved at the meeting on tuesday and has been put off until the end of april .
" these proposals would deny some asylum seekers access to full and fair procedures , and it would transfer them to countries outside europe , " said ben ward of human rights watch .
" we 're deeply concerned that the eu is trying to get other countries to shoulder its responsibilities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum-seekers in hamburg daphne bouteillet paquet said the ministers should forget the proposals and start again .
" we feel we have no option but to call on the eu to scrap this proposal on asylum procedures , which has been shaped in reaction to populist pressures and fears whipped up about a non-existent flood of refugees into the eu , " she said .
schily rebuffs criticism schily responded to the human rights organization 's criticism , saying that the creation of a safe third country concept would allow the eu to avoid the processing costs associated with questionable claims , while those who are truly victims of oppression would be offered asylum .
the ministers will meet again on april 29 to resolve remaining concerns . dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no breakthrough yet on immigration law germany 's ruling social democrats and opposition conservatives thrashed out the details of long-debated immigration legislation on monday .

just weeks before entering into what has - until now - been western europe 's most exclusive club , a small polish town has decided its coat of arms needs to comply with western beauty standards . when the coastal town of ustka was mulling over ways to improve its image , talk turned to the mermaid on the city 's coat of arms .
looking a little plump around the edges , town officials apparently felt their mermaid was n't exactly in line with western beauty standards - and this with their country just weeks from joining the european union .
" one female councilor said jokingly that the mermaid 's breasts were too small and that she was a bit fat , " a town spokesman told reuters .
what began as a joke soon became a national story , prompting the town to examine the idea a little more closely .
their remedy : an immediate dieting plan and some serious plastic surgery around the chest area , according to the spokesman .
" she will become more attractive and ustka will gain publicity , " said the spokesman .

by the time he returned , he had made up his mind : europe ’ s biggest media group must immediately boost its position on the asian markets in order to profit from the dynamic growth in the region .
in china and india , bertelsmann has already set up shop . in the beijing region , for example , the group has already brought in 1.5 million members for its chinese-language book club .
and that 's only the beginning .
a million served bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gunter thielen " our team currently sells 20 million books in china , " thielen said tuesday at the company 's board meeting .
" that ’ s the same amount of books as we sell in france .
the turnover , however , is only a tenth in china , because there a book costs $ 1.5 while it costs $ 15 in france .
that ’ s the big difference and the reason for this is that the chinese market is still being regulated , " thielen said . " but once that starts changing , the prices will increase and so will our turnover .
in a long term perspective of 10 or 15 years , we will multiply our sales in asia and at some point it will represent at least 10 percent of our revenues , " he added .
the company still has a long way to go .
of its approximately € 17 billion in revenues last year , just € 2 billion came from sales in asia .
with a string of new investments , bertelsmann is seeking to increase its market share .
in china , bertelsmann wants to invest heavily in printing and publishing houses .
" we will stay away from the music sector , " he said .
" the bootleg system is so sophisticated in china , you can purchase a disc for $ 1 at any corner there .
that ’ s why it doesn ’ t make sense for us to produce discs in china . "
a fast growing market in india , bertelsmann ’ s random house publishing arm , as well as the printing subsidiary arvato , is already active .
still , business there is only just starting for the media group and the future looks promising , as india currently has growth rates of 7-8 percent per year - nearly comparable to those in china .
both are markets that bring euros to the eyes of bertelsmann managers .
" together they have a population of 2.4 billion people thus representing a third of the world population , " he said .
" this must become a market one day .
of course if you compare these countries to america , they are still dwarfs .
but if you look at their growth rates it ’ s clear that we must closely watch these markets .
and i am positive that we will increasingly position ourselves there . "
today the media giant only makes 3 percent of its turnover in asia , that ’ s around € 600 million per year .
and only 1 percent - about € 200 million - are being earned in eastern europe , which bertelsmann also views as a promising market for its television , publishing and printing operations .
currently , germany remains one of bertelsmann 's most important markets .
a third of the company 's overall turnover is made here , with 40 percent coming from the rest of europe and 25 percent in the united states and canada .
only 3 percent of revenues are currently derived from its asian units .
preparing for a mega-merger the company 's book publishing division , based in new york , is the market leader in the united states and britain .
new york is also the headquarters for its worldwide music business , which will soon be merging with sony 's music operations .
with a world music market share of approximately 12 percent , bertelsmann is expected to be the dominant partner in the joint venture .
last year , bertelsmann artists including britney spears and justin timberlake won 22 grammy awards .
and the company 's gruner + jahr magazine publishing division , the market leader in germany and france and a strong presence in the u.s. , is planning on introducing 20 new glossy magazines around the world . dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a victory for the old in berlin with the opening of bertelsmann ’ s new berlin headquarters and plans to reconstruct hohenzollern palace , someday , germany 's capital is looking back to the future .

the third international conference on afghanistan opened in berlin on wednesday with an inaugural speech by german chancellor schröder promising more financial aid to the war-torn country . german chancellor gerhard schröder opened the afghanistan conference in berlin on wednesday by pledging to afghan president hamid karzai that the international community would not abandon his country , one of the world 's poorest and the biggest opium supplier . karzai , who was seated next to the chancellor at the top table , which also included the u.n. afghanistan envoy jean arnault , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and the foreign ministers of britain , china , germany , pakistan and russia , listened intently as schröder delivered his opening speech . " a peaceful afghanistan is an anchor for greater political stability in the region and a sign of hope for us all , " schröder told the assembled dignitaries and press .
" it is proof that it is worth fighting against terror and violence . " the two-day conference is the third such international meeting on afghanistan since the end of the u.s.-led war .
the conference will address ways to stabilize the country 's political and economic reconstruction .
it will also tackle the problems of insecurity and drugs production plaguing the country despite the ousting of the taliban regime more than two years ago . chancellor schröder highlighted the three main goals of the conference : to support the political progress , including elections planned for september ; to increase aid for the country 's reconstruction ; and to help the kabul government establish security and the rule of law . schröder rallies international community he also used the speech to rally those countries that had already supported reconstruction efforts in afghanistan by reminding the hundreds of delegates , including 20 foreign ministers and officials from more than 60 countries and organizations , that there had been many successes in spite of the difficult conditions that still prevailed . " the positive developments in afghanistan show what can be achieved when we combine our efforts , " he said .
" every success that we score in bringing afghanistan on a path towards more freedom and security is not only progress for people in the country .
it is a success for us all . " in his speech later in the day , karzai said his country had come a long way since the fall of the taliban , with a constitution that reflected a desire to be partners with the international community and no longer " threatened by drugs and terrorism . " " what we have achieved is very promising , but let me be frank and say that the reconstruction has only begun , " karzai told the gathering . federal government extends financial aid bildunterschrift : on the subject of financial assistance , schröder vowed that germany would contribute € 320 million -lrb- $ 389.5 million -rrb- over the next four years to boost the reconstruction process in afghanistan .
the amount of financial aid by the german government since september 2001 will eventually total € 7.4 billion . sadako ogata , japan 's envoy to afghanistan , followed schröder 's lead by pledging $ 400 million -lrb- € 328.6 million -rrb- over the next two years .
" i am pleased to announce that japan is prepared to make further grant assistance amounting to $ 400 million over the coming two years , which brings japan 's contribution since september 2001 to over $ 1 billion , " she said .
earlier this month , japan said its financial assistance to afghanistan had reached $ 683 million , exceeding an initial pledge of $ 500 million . reconstruction funds a priority before the conference began , officials from participating countries and organizations spoke hopefully of raising $ 4 billion after afghan ministers called for more direct aid and investment .
afghan finance minister ashraf ghani told the handelsblatt business daily on tuesday that he was content with the international commitment so far , but more was necessary . he said earlier this month that $ 27.5 billion would be needed in the next seven years and previous promises " vastly underestimated " afghanistan 's needs . reconstruction minister amin farhang added in an interview with germany 's inforadio that he hoped the promised money would go directly to the kabul government instead of mainly to non-governmental organizations .
farhang told the radio station that afghanistan needed around $ 4.5 billion for this year , which would help train the afghan army and police force to tackle the rampant drugs problem controlled largely by influential provincial warlords . germany 's pledge of more financial aid came hours after u.s. secretary of state colin powell praised german efforts in aiding afghanistan . powell praises german efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : powell praised german efforts .
in an article in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , powell said , " it is in no small part thanks to germany 's engagement that afghanistan has made the progress it has that we want to pay tribute to at this international conference . "
" germany has shown vision and leadership quality , " he added .
" germany can be especially proud of the stationing of bundeswehr soldiers in kunduz , where the german soldiers were the first to lead a provincial reconstruction team in the framework of isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- .

the third international conference on afghanistan opened in berlin on wednesday with an inaugural speech by german chancellor schröder promising more financial aid to the war-torn country . german chancellor gerhard schröder opened the afghanistan conference in berlin on wednesday by pledging to afghan president hamid karzai that the international community would not abandon his country , one of the world 's poorest and the biggest opium supplier . karzai , who was seated next to the chancellor at the top table , which also included the u.n. afghanistan envoy jean arnault , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and the foreign ministers of britain , china , germany , pakistan and russia , listened intently as schröder delivered his opening speech . " a peaceful afghanistan is an anchor for greater political stability in the region and a sign of hope for us all , " schröder told the assembled dignitaries and press .
" it is proof that it is worth fighting against terror and violence . " the two-day conference is the third such international meeting on afghanistan since the end of the u.s.-led war .
the conference will address ways to stabilize the country 's political and economic reconstruction .
it will also tackle the problems of insecurity and drugs production plaguing the country despite the ousting of the taliban regime more than two years ago . chancellor schröder highlighted the three main goals of the conference : to support the political progress , including elections planned for september ; to increase aid for the country 's reconstruction ; and to help the kabul government establish security and the rule of law . schröder rallies international community he also used the speech to rally those countries that had already supported reconstruction efforts in afghanistan by reminding the hundreds of delegates , including 20 foreign ministers and officials from more than 60 countries and organizations , that there had been many successes in spite of the difficult conditions that still prevailed . " the positive developments in afghanistan show what can be achieved when we combine our efforts , " he said .
" every success that we score in bringing afghanistan on a path towards more freedom and security is not only progress for people in the country .
it is a success for us all . " in his speech later in the day , karzai said his country had come a long way since the fall of the taliban , with a constitution that reflected a desire to be partners with the international community and no longer " threatened by drugs and terrorism . " " what we have achieved is very promising , but let me be frank and say that the reconstruction has only begun , " karzai told the gathering . federal government extends financial aid bildunterschrift : on the subject of financial assistance , schröder vowed that germany would contribute € 320 million -lrb- $ 389.5 million -rrb- over the next four years to boost the reconstruction process in afghanistan .

farhang told the radio station that afghanistan needed around $ 4.5 billion for this year , which would help train the afghan army and police force to tackle the rampant drugs problem controlled largely by influential provincial warlords . germany 's pledge of more financial aid came hours after u.s. secretary of state colin powell praised german efforts in aiding afghanistan . powell praises german efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : powell praised german efforts .
in an article in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , powell said , " it is in no small part thanks to germany 's engagement that afghanistan has made the progress it has that we want to pay tribute to at this international conference . "

" it is proof that it is worth fighting against terror and violence . " the two-day conference is the third such international meeting on afghanistan since the end of the u.s.-led war .
the conference will address ways to stabilize the country 's political and economic reconstruction .
it will also tackle the problems of insecurity and drugs production plaguing the country despite the ousting of the taliban regime more than two years ago . chancellor schröder highlighted the three main goals of the conference : to support the political progress , including elections planned for september ; to increase aid for the country 's reconstruction ; and to help the kabul government establish security and the rule of law . schröder rallies international community he also used the speech to rally those countries that had already supported reconstruction efforts in afghanistan by reminding the hundreds of delegates , including 20 foreign ministers and officials from more than 60 countries and organizations , that there had been many successes in spite of the difficult conditions that still prevailed . " the positive developments in afghanistan show what can be achieved when we combine our efforts , " he said .
" every success that we score in bringing afghanistan on a path towards more freedom and security is not only progress for people in the country .
it is a success for us all . " in his speech later in the day , karzai said his country had come a long way since the fall of the taliban , with a constitution that reflected a desire to be partners with the international community and no longer " threatened by drugs and terrorism . " " what we have achieved is very promising , but let me be frank and say that the reconstruction has only begun , " karzai told the gathering . federal government extends financial aid bildunterschrift : on the subject of financial assistance , schröder vowed that germany would contribute € 320 million -lrb- $ 389.5 million -rrb- over the next four years to boost the reconstruction process in afghanistan .
the amount of financial aid by the german government since september 2001 will eventually total € 7.4 billion . sadako ogata , japan 's envoy to afghanistan , followed schröder 's lead by pledging $ 400 million -lrb- € 328.6 million -rrb- over the next two years .
" i am pleased to announce that japan is prepared to make further grant assistance amounting to $ 400 million over the coming two years , which brings japan 's contribution since september 2001 to over $ 1 billion , " she said .
earlier this month , japan said its financial assistance to afghanistan had reached $ 683 million , exceeding an initial pledge of $ 500 million . reconstruction funds a priority before the conference began , officials from participating countries and organizations spoke hopefully of raising $ 4 billion after afghan ministers called for more direct aid and investment .
afghan finance minister ashraf ghani told the handelsblatt business daily on tuesday that he was content with the international commitment so far , but more was necessary . he said earlier this month that $ 27.5 billion would be needed in the next seven years and previous promises " vastly underestimated " afghanistan 's needs . reconstruction minister amin farhang added in an interview with germany 's inforadio that he hoped the promised money would go directly to the kabul government instead of mainly to non-governmental organizations .
farhang told the radio station that afghanistan needed around $ 4.5 billion for this year , which would help train the afghan army and police force to tackle the rampant drugs problem controlled largely by influential provincial warlords . germany 's pledge of more financial aid came hours after u.s. secretary of state colin powell praised german efforts in aiding afghanistan . powell praises german efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : powell praised german efforts .
in an article in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , powell said , " it is in no small part thanks to germany 's engagement that afghanistan has made the progress it has that we want to pay tribute to at this international conference . "
" germany has shown vision and leadership quality , " he added .
" germany can be especially proud of the stationing of bundeswehr soldiers in kunduz , where the german soldiers were the first to lead a provincial reconstruction team in the framework of isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- .

eu interior ministers have acheived partial success on controversial plans to create a europe-wide asylum policy .
human rights groups however remain troubled over the unresolved elements . eu interior ministers met in brussels on tuesday to make yet another effort to hammer out a europe-wide asylum policy .
the meeting took on an added sense of urgency with the ministers struggling to comply with a self-imposed may 1 deadline , the date on which ten new countries join the eu .
ending almost six years of acrimonious negotiations , they reached a partial breakthrough on key aspects of the legislation . the ministers agreed on a set of criteria establishing who can apply for asylum .
however , they could not agree on some procedural points determining how such requests should be handled .
certain aspects of the latter , including a proposed plan to allow for the deportation of asylum seekers to " safe " third countries , have come under heavy fire from human rights organizations .
the ministers will meet again at the end of april to take up the issue again , but according to the german interior minister otto schily , " it could be close " .
germany drops opposition to asylum criteria the breakthrough came after the german government dropped its long-standing opposition to a policy determining who is eligible to apply for asylum , specifically the recognition of asylum seekers who are fleeing non-state persecution , like men who are being pursued by drug cartels or women who face female genital mutilation .
the expected approval of a sweeping new immigration law in germany , which has led to a compromise on key issues between the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and the conservative christian democratic opposition , cleared the way for schily to adopt a more conciliatory tone .
under the rules agreed on tuesday , the eu will not only offer protection to people who are refugees according to the 1951 geneva convention , they will also offer so-called subsidiary protection to victims of non-state persecution .
human rights groups protest key points not good enough , say some human rights groups .
following the recent election of anti-immigration parties in several european countries , asylum policy remains a politically loaded and divisive issue .
human rights groups - citing the increasingly restrictive nature of the eu policies - have publicly objected to key aspects of the draft , namely the still unresolved questions over how asylum requests will be handled .
in an unprecedented move , several groups , including human rights watch , amnesty international , and the european council for refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , jointly called on the eu to scrap the agreement , claiming it violates international law .
at issue are two aspects of the proposed agreement .
the first deals with a suggestion in the directive on the use of a " safe country of origin " concept , which means the eu would compile a list of " safe countries " and asylum requests from persons originating from these countries would be considered illegitimate .
the second issue is a so-called " safe third county " concept , which means asylum seekers can be deported to a third country deemed safe .
neither was resolved at the meeting on tuesday and has been put off until the end of april .
" these proposals would deny some asylum seekers access to full and fair procedures , and it would transfer them to countries outside europe , " said ben ward of human rights watch .
" we 're deeply concerned that the eu is trying to get other countries to shoulder its responsibilities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum-seekers in hamburg daphne bouteillet paquet said the ministers should forget the proposals and start again .
" we feel we have no option but to call on the eu to scrap this proposal on asylum procedures , which has been shaped in reaction to populist pressures and fears whipped up about a non-existent flood of refugees into the eu , " she said .
schily rebuffs criticism schily responded to the human rights organization 's criticism , saying that the creation of a safe third country concept would allow the eu to avoid the processing costs associated with questionable claims , while those who are truly victims of oppression would be offered asylum .

the judge , brigitte koppenhoefer , made the statement on wednesday , following a mid-trial review .
she said prosecutors had yet to prove that ackermann offered excessive bonuses amounting to bribes to the top executives at mannesmann in order to smooth over a takeover bid by vodaphone in early 2000 .
koppenhoefer said there was not enough evidence to support the central criminal charge of breach of trust to shareholders , though there was some evidence of lesser violations of share law .

they fear the information will not be properly safeguarded . members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- have threatened to take the european commission to the eu 's top court if it does not withdraw its decision to transfer air passenger data to u.s. authorities .
they fear there are insufficient guarantees that the data will be protected .
dutch liberal mep johanna boogerd-quaak presented the resolution which was approved by meps with 229 votes in favor , 202 against and 19 abstentions .
" we are not satisfied with the privacy safeguards secured by the commission , and we now expect them to withdraw their decision and come back with better safeguards , " boogerd-quaak said .
" if they do not , parliament has indicated that we are willing to go to the european court of justice , " she added .
boogerd-quaak said only 19 categories of data should be relayed to the united states , instead of the current 34 , and the three and a half year period for which data can be retained should be shortened .
the eu agreed in december to allow the u.s. access to passenger data on transatlantic flights .

just weeks before entering into what has - until now - been western europe 's most exclusive club , a small polish town has decided its coat of arms needs to comply with western beauty standards . when the coastal town of ustka was mulling over ways to improve its image , talk turned to the mermaid on the city 's coat of arms .
looking a little plump around the edges , town officials apparently felt their mermaid was n't exactly in line with western beauty standards - and this with their country just weeks from joining the european union .
" one female councilor said jokingly that the mermaid 's breasts were too small and that she was a bit fat , " a town spokesman told reuters .
what began as a joke soon became a national story , prompting the town to examine the idea a little more closely .
their remedy : an immediate dieting plan and some serious plastic surgery around the chest area , according to the spokesman .

on wednesday , international leaders will meet in berlin to take stock of rebuilding efforts in afghanistan .
reconstruction financing and a booming opium trade remain major challenges . afghan leader hamid karzai and his trademark head covering will take center stage in berlin on wednesday , when 54 nations meet to analyze the progress and problems in afghanistan three years after the fall of the taliban . karzai , in the german capital on tuesday , highlighted his country 's battle with drug lords and dwindling financial resources as the major talking points at the two-day conference , which will be attended by u.s. secretary of state colin powell . " we will be asking -lrb- the international community -rrb- to increase their assistance to afghanistan in order for all of us to succeed in bringing about a safer , better , standing-on-its-own-feet afghanistan , " karzai told reporters after meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder , according to reuters . germany ready for the long haul the afghan leader has already picked up important pledges from german officials .
schröder , whose country has 1,900 peacekeeping troops in kabul and the northern city of kunduz , said germany was prepared to stay in the war-torn country for the long haul . bildunterschrift : schröder and karzai met on tuesday , on the eve of the two-day conference . germany has provided roughly € 80 million -lrb- $ 97 million -rrb- in aid each year since 2002 .
on wednesday , german officials are expected to announce that they will continue their aid program until 2008 . the united states , the biggest donor ahead of germany and japan , will most likely offer $ 1 billion on top of the $ 1.2 billion it has already pledged this year .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said tuesday that the leading donor countries hope other countries will pledge more aid . afghan leaders estimate that $ 27.5 billion is needed over the next seven years for reconstruction .
donors worldwide have so far pledged $ 4.2 billion through 2004 . " we obviously hope we will gather as large a sum as possible , " fischer told reporters . afghan opium flooding world markets not only financial woes , but the country 's growing drug problem are likely to be major discussion points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poppy field in afghanistan far more lucrative than wheat fields and growable even in the substandard afghani soil , experts estimate opium production makes up roughly half of the country 's € 4.4 billion gross domestic product and poses a significant security problem . " through that , warlords and terrorist finance themselves , " says general rick hillier , who commands the nato stability force in the region .
" that means they lag even more in giving up power to the central government . " most of the opium produced in afghanistan ends up in european markets as heroin , according to the un drugs authority .
as a result , governments have been more open recently to helping the afghan government , suggesting crop alternatives for farmers and pledging to invest in sectors that will create more jobs . isaf troops not ready to fight drug trade problems remain .
the international security assistance force has so far refused to involve itself in the fight against drug production and smuggling , leaving an ill-equipped afghan police force and army to fend for themselves .
in the past year , a few kilos of heroin have fallen into afghan law enforcement 's hands .
that 's a drop in the bucket compared to the estimated 3,600 tons of opium that left the country last year , according to un drug authorities . " the fight against drugs is the fight for afghanistan , " karzai said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern alliance fighters afghan police plan a major offensive in the coming weeks to burn 75 percent of the poppy fields in three afghan provinces .
the offensive will later be extended to all 32 provinces .
the u.s. government has pledged $ 40 million exclusively for creating and financing anti-drug troop units . but karzai said alternatives need to be found for the farmers , who make far more money producing opium poppies , the raw material for heroin , than any other crop . speaking before a roomful of business people on tuesday , including representatives of the world bank , karzai pushed raisins and saffron as possible options for weaning farmers off of drug production .

reconstruction financing and a booming opium trade remain major challenges . afghan leader hamid karzai and his trademark head covering will take center stage in berlin on wednesday , when 54 nations meet to analyze the progress and problems in afghanistan three years after the fall of the taliban . karzai , in the german capital on tuesday , highlighted his country 's battle with drug lords and dwindling financial resources as the major talking points at the two-day conference , which will be attended by u.s. secretary of state colin powell . " we will be asking -lrb- the international community -rrb- to increase their assistance to afghanistan in order for all of us to succeed in bringing about a safer , better , standing-on-its-own-feet afghanistan , " karzai told reporters after meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder , according to reuters . germany ready for the long haul the afghan leader has already picked up important pledges from german officials .
schröder , whose country has 1,900 peacekeeping troops in kabul and the northern city of kunduz , said germany was prepared to stay in the war-torn country for the long haul . bildunterschrift : schröder and karzai met on tuesday , on the eve of the two-day conference . germany has provided roughly € 80 million -lrb- $ 97 million -rrb- in aid each year since 2002 .
on wednesday , german officials are expected to announce that they will continue their aid program until 2008 . the united states , the biggest donor ahead of germany and japan , will most likely offer $ 1 billion on top of the $ 1.2 billion it has already pledged this year .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said tuesday that the leading donor countries hope other countries will pledge more aid . afghan leaders estimate that $ 27.5 billion is needed over the next seven years for reconstruction .
donors worldwide have so far pledged $ 4.2 billion through 2004 . " we obviously hope we will gather as large a sum as possible , " fischer told reporters . afghan opium flooding world markets not only financial woes , but the country 's growing drug problem are likely to be major discussion points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poppy field in afghanistan far more lucrative than wheat fields and growable even in the substandard afghani soil , experts estimate opium production makes up roughly half of the country 's € 4.4 billion gross domestic product and poses a significant security problem . " through that , warlords and terrorist finance themselves , " says general rick hillier , who commands the nato stability force in the region .
" that means they lag even more in giving up power to the central government . " most of the opium produced in afghanistan ends up in european markets as heroin , according to the un drugs authority .
as a result , governments have been more open recently to helping the afghan government , suggesting crop alternatives for farmers and pledging to invest in sectors that will create more jobs . isaf troops not ready to fight drug trade problems remain .
the international security assistance force has so far refused to involve itself in the fight against drug production and smuggling , leaving an ill-equipped afghan police force and army to fend for themselves .
in the past year , a few kilos of heroin have fallen into afghan law enforcement 's hands .
that 's a drop in the bucket compared to the estimated 3,600 tons of opium that left the country last year , according to un drug authorities . " the fight against drugs is the fight for afghanistan , " karzai said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern alliance fighters afghan police plan a major offensive in the coming weeks to burn 75 percent of the poppy fields in three afghan provinces .
the offensive will later be extended to all 32 provinces .
the u.s. government has pledged $ 40 million exclusively for creating and financing anti-drug troop units . but karzai said alternatives need to be found for the farmers , who make far more money producing opium poppies , the raw material for heroin , than any other crop . speaking before a roomful of business people on tuesday , including representatives of the world bank , karzai pushed raisins and saffron as possible options for weaning farmers off of drug production .
" if we want to have afghanistan , " said karzai .

the law , which was implemented 40 years ago when the company was privatized , gives the state government of lower saxony , where the company is headquartered , a veto right to fend of foreign buyers .
the commission says the law violates the principle of the free movement of capital by giving a " special blocking minority right " to the state government .
germany has been given two months to act on the warning or face a battle in the european court of justice .
however , the final decision to proceed with the suit will not be taken until november , after european elections may create a commission more sympathetic to the counter arguments offered by the german government . more briefs 30.03.2004 -pipe- eu warns germany over parmesan knockoffs 30.03.2004 -pipe- deutsche bank rules out friendly merger 30.03.2004 -pipe- bertelsmann plans major acquisitions 29.03.2004 -pipe- no more stock options for telekom brass 29.03.2004 -pipe- german consumer confidence stays low 26.03.2004 -pipe- german business confidence dips in march 26.03.2004 -pipe- deutsche telekom denies major revamp 26.03.2004 -pipe- infineon drops plans to move abroad radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

after chancellor schröder settled a months-long cabinet dispute over greenhouse gas cuts , germany has submitted its plans for reducing carbon dioxide emissions to brussels .
other eu countries are much further behind . germany was n't the first country to hand in plans for curbing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions to the european commission - that honor went to finland .
but berlin was n't far behind .
considering the deeply entrenched dispute between industry and environmental groups , the fact that europe 's largest producer of greenhouse gases was among the first three to send its proposals for cutting the pollutants is surprising .
it was n't clear until late monday evening whether germany would be in a position to make wednesday 's eu deadline for emissions reductions plans .
only after chancellor gerhard schröder stepped in to broker a last-minute deal between the environment and economics ministers , was berlin able to put together a proposal worthy of sending to brussels .
germany calls for slight reduction just hours before the eu deadline ran out , germany 's cabinet passed a plan to cut industrial emissions of co2 from 505 million to 503 million tons per year by 2007 .
in a second phase , emissions are set to be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 .
the carbon caps are part of germany 's strategy to cut its greenhouse gases by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 .
the reduction is only slight compared to the 488 million tons requested by environment minister jürgen trittin .
as a member of the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition , he had pushed hard for further emission reductions , arguing german industry needed to do more to fulfil its contribution to the kyoto protocol .
economics minister wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , unflinchingly resisted major emissions cuts .
further reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry at a time when it is trying to shake off economic stagnation , he insisted .
european goal the dispute between industry and environment is not unique to germany .
throughout the european union , member states are struggling to lay such disagreements to rest in order to submit plans for cutting emissions .
by midnight wednesday all 15 eu states must set their co2 limits and the distribution of reductions between industrial sectors , with ceilings set on a company-by-company basis .
the reductions are part of a two-prong strategy brussels has devised in order to meet its commitments to the kyoto protocol .
in addition to capping emissions from industry and utilities , the eu plans to launch an emissions trading system -lrb- ets -rrb- in january that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from those who have remained under their pollution cap and thus create an exchange across borders , where the greener industries would stand to profit economically through the sale of their credits .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 .
several major industrial states , including britain , france and belgium , have already said they will miss the march 31 deadline .
italy , too , has conceded it is uncertain whether it will have a list of its emissions limits ready by the eu deadline .
spain will ask the european commission for " understanding " for failing to meet the deadline as the country is undergoing a change of government .
" the picture we have today does n't say that january 1 -lrb- the start of ets -rrb- is in any danger - not at all , not yet , " ewa hedlund , the commission 's environment spokeswoman , told a news briefing .
" next week , we 'll have more detail on what we 've received and what action we are going to take , " she said referring to a possible " infringement letter " from the commission and impending legal action against those members who fail to supply the eu executive with their emissions plans .
waiting for germany ?
according to analysts , europe 's biggest polluters had held back on submitting their plans until germany handed over its limits .
as the largest producer of co2 emissions , germany 's reduction rate dominated discussion in several capitals .
" germany is important , " john molloy of the brokerage firm tfs in london told german wire service dpa .
" great britain was the strictest up until now in terms of restriction , but they ca n't hold onto that position when everyone else is more lenient and risk jeopardizing the british industry . "
britain has denied it had purposefully waited for a german decision before drawing up its own plans .
but on tuesday london announced it may impose less cuts on industry than slated in january - a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 - and return to a limit closer to the 16 percent committed to under the kyoto protocol . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ministers reach agreement in emissions fight germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions .

the reduction is only slight compared to the 488 million tons requested by environment minister jürgen trittin .
as a member of the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition , he had pushed hard for further emission reductions , arguing german industry needed to do more to fulfil its contribution to the kyoto protocol .
economics minister wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , unflinchingly resisted major emissions cuts .
further reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry at a time when it is trying to shake off economic stagnation , he insisted .
european goal the dispute between industry and environment is not unique to germany .
throughout the european union , member states are struggling to lay such disagreements to rest in order to submit plans for cutting emissions .
by midnight wednesday all 15 eu states must set their co2 limits and the distribution of reductions between industrial sectors , with ceilings set on a company-by-company basis .
the reductions are part of a two-prong strategy brussels has devised in order to meet its commitments to the kyoto protocol .
in addition to capping emissions from industry and utilities , the eu plans to launch an emissions trading system -lrb- ets -rrb- in january that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from those who have remained under their pollution cap and thus create an exchange across borders , where the greener industries would stand to profit economically through the sale of their credits .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 .
several major industrial states , including britain , france and belgium , have already said they will miss the march 31 deadline .
italy , too , has conceded it is uncertain whether it will have a list of its emissions limits ready by the eu deadline .
spain will ask the european commission for " understanding " for failing to meet the deadline as the country is undergoing a change of government .
" the picture we have today does n't say that january 1 -lrb- the start of ets -rrb- is in any danger - not at all , not yet , " ewa hedlund , the commission 's environment spokeswoman , told a news briefing .
" next week , we 'll have more detail on what we 've received and what action we are going to take , " she said referring to a possible " infringement letter " from the commission and impending legal action against those members who fail to supply the eu executive with their emissions plans .
waiting for germany ?
according to analysts , europe 's biggest polluters had held back on submitting their plans until germany handed over its limits .
as the largest producer of co2 emissions , germany 's reduction rate dominated discussion in several capitals .
" germany is important , " john molloy of the brokerage firm tfs in london told german wire service dpa .
" great britain was the strictest up until now in terms of restriction , but they ca n't hold onto that position when everyone else is more lenient and risk jeopardizing the british industry . "
britain has denied it had purposefully waited for a german decision before drawing up its own plans .
but on tuesday london announced it may impose less cuts on industry than slated in january - a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 - and return to a limit closer to the 16 percent committed to under the kyoto protocol . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ministers reach agreement in emissions fight germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions .

a member of the european parliament has accused hundreds of his colleagues of pocketing allowances for parliamentary sessions they have not attended .
the parliament says it could investigate as many as 200 members . hans-peter martin told germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper on monday that he has collected detailed records over the past two years that show that many of his colleagues in the european parliament habitually enter their names in the parliamentary register , but then skip meetings .
for signing the register , based on the understanding that they attend the sessions , members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- receive a € 262 -lrb- $ 320 -rrb- per diem .
martin , an mep from austria , claimed many either sign the register , which is accessible between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. , before flying home or send " front men " to sign on their behalf .
he said he had discovered 7,200 instances of fraud through what he alleged were forged per diem claims and attendance records to claim expenses .
wide-spread abuse ?
" brussel 's enormous expense system is being abused , " he said , " especially when delegates come in early , quickly sign in and then leave the city . "
martin also claimed that a favorite practice among meps has been to take an evening flight to brussels , sign the register before 10 p.m. , sign again the following day and attend a session before signing again the next morning and flying home .
this would earn them around € 795 in supplements on top of travel costs and the usual salary for spending just one session in parliament .
-lrb- meps are given salaries that are equivalent to those of members of their national parliaments and can range anywhere from just over € 2,000 a month to nearly € 10,000 .
efforts to reform the pay system and implement a single salary for members of the european parliament have repeatedly stalled since they began to be discussed earnestly in 1998 . -rrb-
allowance may be legitimate david harley , spokesman for the european parliament , said meps could legitimately claim their daily allowance if they were present in parliament , whether or not they took part in debates .
he said members could be working in their offices , writing reports or talking to journalists and also complex travel arrangements meant they often arrived late and left early .
but martin has described the practices as a " scam , " and he claimed nearly half of all german meps and several from other countries including britain are part of it .
the allegations of misuse of funds have shaken parliament , and many have stepped up to defend their fellow parliamentarians .
german mep hans-gert pöttering said meps are conscientious and work long hours .
" the vast majority of our colleagues do their work conscientiously , with a workload of 60 to 70 hours a week , " he said .
meanwhile , ireland 's mary banotti , a conservative , said martin ’ s allegations are causing immense distress to many colleagues .
daniel cohn-bendit , a prominent german green party member who is also in parliament , criticized martin for revealing his allegations to a german tabloid newspaper .
" to reveal this issue in this way is simply mobbing , " he said , referring to the practice of bullying workers until they leave a company .
parliament expenses under the loop members of the european parliament are currently paid a salary and expenses under an oft-criticized system set up in the 1960s that , among other things , allows meps to pocket the difference between full fare air tickets and discount fares when traveling between brussels , strasbourg and their constituencies . anita purcell -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany blocks eu parliament pay reform germany and three other eu states have blocked an attempt to reform the pay system for european parliamentarians , meaning it 's now unlikely that a reform package will be passed before eu-wide elections in june .

a member of the european parliament has accused hundreds of his colleagues of pocketing allowances for parliamentary sessions they have not attended .
the parliament says it could investigate as many as 200 members . hans-peter martin told germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper on monday that he has collected detailed records over the past two years that show that many of his colleagues in the european parliament habitually enter their names in the parliamentary register , but then skip meetings .
for signing the register , based on the understanding that they attend the sessions , members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- receive a € 262 -lrb- $ 320 -rrb- per diem .
martin , an mep from austria , claimed many either sign the register , which is accessible between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. , before flying home or send " front men " to sign on their behalf .
he said he had discovered 7,200 instances of fraud through what he alleged were forged per diem claims and attendance records to claim expenses .
wide-spread abuse ?
" brussel 's enormous expense system is being abused , " he said , " especially when delegates come in early , quickly sign in and then leave the city . "
martin also claimed that a favorite practice among meps has been to take an evening flight to brussels , sign the register before 10 p.m. , sign again the following day and attend a session before signing again the next morning and flying home .
this would earn them around € 795 in supplements on top of travel costs and the usual salary for spending just one session in parliament .
-lrb- meps are given salaries that are equivalent to those of members of their national parliaments and can range anywhere from just over € 2,000 a month to nearly € 10,000 .
efforts to reform the pay system and implement a single salary for members of the european parliament have repeatedly stalled since they began to be discussed earnestly in 1998 . -rrb-
allowance may be legitimate david harley , spokesman for the european parliament , said meps could legitimately claim their daily allowance if they were present in parliament , whether or not they took part in debates .
he said members could be working in their offices , writing reports or talking to journalists and also complex travel arrangements meant they often arrived late and left early .
but martin has described the practices as a " scam , " and he claimed nearly half of all german meps and several from other countries including britain are part of it .
the allegations of misuse of funds have shaken parliament , and many have stepped up to defend their fellow parliamentarians .
german mep hans-gert pöttering said meps are conscientious and work long hours .
" the vast majority of our colleagues do their work conscientiously , with a workload of 60 to 70 hours a week , " he said .
meanwhile , ireland 's mary banotti , a conservative , said martin ’ s allegations are causing immense distress to many colleagues .
daniel cohn-bendit , a prominent german green party member who is also in parliament , criticized martin for revealing his allegations to a german tabloid newspaper .
" to reveal this issue in this way is simply mobbing , " he said , referring to the practice of bullying workers until they leave a company .
parliament expenses under the loop members of the european parliament are currently paid a salary and expenses under an oft-criticized system set up in the 1960s that , among other things , allows meps to pocket the difference between full fare air tickets and discount fares when traveling between brussels , strasbourg and their constituencies . anita purcell -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany blocks eu parliament pay reform germany and three other eu states have blocked an attempt to reform the pay system for european parliamentarians , meaning it 's now unlikely that a reform package will be passed before eu-wide elections in june .

a member of the european parliament has accused hundreds of his colleagues of pocketing allowances for parliamentary sessions they have not attended .
the parliament says it could investigate as many as 200 members . hans-peter martin told germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper on monday that he has collected detailed records over the past two years that show that many of his colleagues in the european parliament habitually enter their names in the parliamentary register , but then skip meetings .
for signing the register , based on the understanding that they attend the sessions , members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- receive a € 262 -lrb- $ 320 -rrb- per diem .
martin , an mep from austria , claimed many either sign the register , which is accessible between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. , before flying home or send " front men " to sign on their behalf .
he said he had discovered 7,200 instances of fraud through what he alleged were forged per diem claims and attendance records to claim expenses .
wide-spread abuse ?
" brussel 's enormous expense system is being abused , " he said , " especially when delegates come in early , quickly sign in and then leave the city . "
martin also claimed that a favorite practice among meps has been to take an evening flight to brussels , sign the register before 10 p.m. , sign again the following day and attend a session before signing again the next morning and flying home .
this would earn them around € 795 in supplements on top of travel costs and the usual salary for spending just one session in parliament .
-lrb- meps are given salaries that are equivalent to those of members of their national parliaments and can range anywhere from just over € 2,000 a month to nearly € 10,000 .
efforts to reform the pay system and implement a single salary for members of the european parliament have repeatedly stalled since they began to be discussed earnestly in 1998 . -rrb-
allowance may be legitimate david harley , spokesman for the european parliament , said meps could legitimately claim their daily allowance if they were present in parliament , whether or not they took part in debates .
he said members could be working in their offices , writing reports or talking to journalists and also complex travel arrangements meant they often arrived late and left early .
but martin has described the practices as a " scam , " and he claimed nearly half of all german meps and several from other countries including britain are part of it .
the allegations of misuse of funds have shaken parliament , and many have stepped up to defend their fellow parliamentarians .
german mep hans-gert pöttering said meps are conscientious and work long hours .
" the vast majority of our colleagues do their work conscientiously , with a workload of 60 to 70 hours a week , " he said .
meanwhile , ireland 's mary banotti , a conservative , said martin ’ s allegations are causing immense distress to many colleagues .
daniel cohn-bendit , a prominent german green party member who is also in parliament , criticized martin for revealing his allegations to a german tabloid newspaper .
" to reveal this issue in this way is simply mobbing , " he said , referring to the practice of bullying workers until they leave a company .
parliament expenses under the loop members of the european parliament are currently paid a salary and expenses under an oft-criticized system set up in the 1960s that , among other things , allows meps to pocket the difference between full fare air tickets and discount fares when traveling between brussels , strasbourg and their constituencies . anita purcell -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany blocks eu parliament pay reform germany and three other eu states have blocked an attempt to reform the pay system for european parliamentarians , meaning it 's now unlikely that a reform package will be passed before eu-wide elections in june .

after chancellor schröder settled a months-long cabinet dispute over greenhouse gas cuts , germany has submitted its plans for reducing carbon dioxide emissions to brussels .
other eu countries are much further behind . germany was n't the first country to hand in plans for curbing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions to the european commission - that honor went to finland .
but berlin was n't far behind .
considering the deeply entrenched dispute between industry and environmental groups , the fact that europe 's largest producer of greenhouse gases was among the first three to send its proposals for cutting the pollutants is surprising .
it was n't clear until late monday evening whether germany would be in a position to make wednesday 's eu deadline for emissions reductions plans .
only after chancellor gerhard schröder stepped in to broker a last-minute deal between the environment and economics ministers , was berlin able to put together a proposal worthy of sending to brussels .
germany calls for slight reduction just hours before the eu deadline ran out , germany 's cabinet passed a plan to cut industrial emissions of co2 from 505 million to 503 million tons per year by 2007 .
in a second phase , emissions are set to be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 .
the carbon caps are part of germany 's strategy to cut its greenhouse gases by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 .
the reduction is only slight compared to the 488 million tons requested by environment minister jürgen trittin .
as a member of the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition , he had pushed hard for further emission reductions , arguing german industry needed to do more to fulfil its contribution to the kyoto protocol .
economics minister wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , unflinchingly resisted major emissions cuts .
further reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry at a time when it is trying to shake off economic stagnation , he insisted .
european goal the dispute between industry and environment is not unique to germany .
throughout the european union , member states are struggling to lay such disagreements to rest in order to submit plans for cutting emissions .
by midnight wednesday all 15 eu states must set their co2 limits and the distribution of reductions between industrial sectors , with ceilings set on a company-by-company basis .
the reductions are part of a two-prong strategy brussels has devised in order to meet its commitments to the kyoto protocol .
in addition to capping emissions from industry and utilities , the eu plans to launch an emissions trading system -lrb- ets -rrb- in january that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from those who have remained under their pollution cap and thus create an exchange across borders , where the greener industries would stand to profit economically through the sale of their credits .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 .
several major industrial states , including britain , france and belgium , have already said they will miss the march 31 deadline .
italy , too , has conceded it is uncertain whether it will have a list of its emissions limits ready by the eu deadline .
spain will ask the european commission for " understanding " for failing to meet the deadline as the country is undergoing a change of government .
" the picture we have today does n't say that january 1 -lrb- the start of ets -rrb- is in any danger - not at all , not yet , " ewa hedlund , the commission 's environment spokeswoman , told a news briefing .
" next week , we 'll have more detail on what we 've received and what action we are going to take , " she said referring to a possible " infringement letter " from the commission and impending legal action against those members who fail to supply the eu executive with their emissions plans .
waiting for germany ?
according to analysts , europe 's biggest polluters had held back on submitting their plans until germany handed over its limits .
as the largest producer of co2 emissions , germany 's reduction rate dominated discussion in several capitals .
" germany is important , " john molloy of the brokerage firm tfs in london told german wire service dpa .
" great britain was the strictest up until now in terms of restriction , but they ca n't hold onto that position when everyone else is more lenient and risk jeopardizing the british industry . "
britain has denied it had purposefully waited for a german decision before drawing up its own plans .
but on tuesday london announced it may impose less cuts on industry than slated in january - a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 - and return to a limit closer to the 16 percent committed to under the kyoto protocol . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ministers reach agreement in emissions fight germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions .

after chancellor schröder settled a months-long cabinet dispute over greenhouse gas cuts , germany has submitted its plans for reducing carbon dioxide emissions to brussels .
other eu countries are much further behind . germany was n't the first country to hand in plans for curbing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions to the european commission - that honor went to finland .
but berlin was n't far behind .
considering the deeply entrenched dispute between industry and environmental groups , the fact that europe 's largest producer of greenhouse gases was among the first three to send its proposals for cutting the pollutants is surprising .
it was n't clear until late monday evening whether germany would be in a position to make wednesday 's eu deadline for emissions reductions plans .
only after chancellor gerhard schröder stepped in to broker a last-minute deal between the environment and economics ministers , was berlin able to put together a proposal worthy of sending to brussels .
germany calls for slight reduction just hours before the eu deadline ran out , germany 's cabinet passed a plan to cut industrial emissions of co2 from 505 million to 503 million tons per year by 2007 .
in a second phase , emissions are set to be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 .
the carbon caps are part of germany 's strategy to cut its greenhouse gases by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 .
the reduction is only slight compared to the 488 million tons requested by environment minister jürgen trittin .
as a member of the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition , he had pushed hard for further emission reductions , arguing german industry needed to do more to fulfil its contribution to the kyoto protocol .
economics minister wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , unflinchingly resisted major emissions cuts .
further reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry at a time when it is trying to shake off economic stagnation , he insisted .
european goal the dispute between industry and environment is not unique to germany .
throughout the european union , member states are struggling to lay such disagreements to rest in order to submit plans for cutting emissions .
by midnight wednesday all 15 eu states must set their co2 limits and the distribution of reductions between industrial sectors , with ceilings set on a company-by-company basis .
the reductions are part of a two-prong strategy brussels has devised in order to meet its commitments to the kyoto protocol .
in addition to capping emissions from industry and utilities , the eu plans to launch an emissions trading system -lrb- ets -rrb- in january that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from those who have remained under their pollution cap and thus create an exchange across borders , where the greener industries would stand to profit economically through the sale of their credits .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 .
several major industrial states , including britain , france and belgium , have already said they will miss the march 31 deadline .
italy , too , has conceded it is uncertain whether it will have a list of its emissions limits ready by the eu deadline .
spain will ask the european commission for " understanding " for failing to meet the deadline as the country is undergoing a change of government .
" the picture we have today does n't say that january 1 -lrb- the start of ets -rrb- is in any danger - not at all , not yet , " ewa hedlund , the commission 's environment spokeswoman , told a news briefing .
" next week , we 'll have more detail on what we 've received and what action we are going to take , " she said referring to a possible " infringement letter " from the commission and impending legal action against those members who fail to supply the eu executive with their emissions plans .
waiting for germany ?
according to analysts , europe 's biggest polluters had held back on submitting their plans until germany handed over its limits .
as the largest producer of co2 emissions , germany 's reduction rate dominated discussion in several capitals .
" germany is important , " john molloy of the brokerage firm tfs in london told german wire service dpa .
" great britain was the strictest up until now in terms of restriction , but they ca n't hold onto that position when everyone else is more lenient and risk jeopardizing the british industry . "
britain has denied it had purposefully waited for a german decision before drawing up its own plans .

eu interior ministers have acheived partial success on controversial plans to create a europe-wide asylum policy .
human rights groups however remain troubled over the unresolved elements . eu interior ministers met in brussels on tuesday to make yet another effort to hammer out a europe-wide asylum policy .
the meeting took on an added sense of urgency with the ministers struggling to comply with a self-imposed may 1 deadline , the date on which ten new countries join the eu .
ending almost six years of acrimonious negotiations , they reached a partial breakthrough on key aspects of the legislation . the ministers agreed on a set of criteria establishing who can apply for asylum .
however , they could not agree on some procedural points determining how such requests should be handled .
certain aspects of the latter , including a proposed plan to allow for the deportation of asylum seekers to " safe " third countries , have come under heavy fire from human rights organizations .
the ministers will meet again at the end of april to take up the issue again , but according to the german interior minister otto schily , " it could be close " .
germany drops opposition to asylum criteria the breakthrough came after the german government dropped its long-standing opposition to a policy determining who is eligible to apply for asylum , specifically the recognition of asylum seekers who are fleeing non-state persecution , like men who are being pursued by drug cartels or women who face female genital mutilation .
the expected approval of a sweeping new immigration law in germany , which has led to a compromise on key issues between the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and the conservative christian democratic opposition , cleared the way for schily to adopt a more conciliatory tone .
under the rules agreed on tuesday , the eu will not only offer protection to people who are refugees according to the 1951 geneva convention , they will also offer so-called subsidiary protection to victims of non-state persecution .
human rights groups protest key points not good enough , say some human rights groups .
following the recent election of anti-immigration parties in several european countries , asylum policy remains a politically loaded and divisive issue .
human rights groups - citing the increasingly restrictive nature of the eu policies - have publicly objected to key aspects of the draft , namely the still unresolved questions over how asylum requests will be handled .
in an unprecedented move , several groups , including human rights watch , amnesty international , and the european council for refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , jointly called on the eu to scrap the agreement , claiming it violates international law .
at issue are two aspects of the proposed agreement .
the first deals with a suggestion in the directive on the use of a " safe country of origin " concept , which means the eu would compile a list of " safe countries " and asylum requests from persons originating from these countries would be considered illegitimate .
the second issue is a so-called " safe third county " concept , which means asylum seekers can be deported to a third country deemed safe .
neither was resolved at the meeting on tuesday and has been put off until the end of april .
" these proposals would deny some asylum seekers access to full and fair procedures , and it would transfer them to countries outside europe , " said ben ward of human rights watch .
" we 're deeply concerned that the eu is trying to get other countries to shoulder its responsibilities . "

eu interior ministers have acheived partial success on controversial plans to create a europe-wide asylum policy .
human rights groups however remain troubled over the unresolved elements . eu interior ministers met in brussels on tuesday to make yet another effort to hammer out a europe-wide asylum policy .
the meeting took on an added sense of urgency with the ministers struggling to comply with a self-imposed may 1 deadline , the date on which ten new countries join the eu .
ending almost six years of acrimonious negotiations , they reached a partial breakthrough on key aspects of the legislation . the ministers agreed on a set of criteria establishing who can apply for asylum .
however , they could not agree on some procedural points determining how such requests should be handled .
certain aspects of the latter , including a proposed plan to allow for the deportation of asylum seekers to " safe " third countries , have come under heavy fire from human rights organizations .
the ministers will meet again at the end of april to take up the issue again , but according to the german interior minister otto schily , " it could be close " .
germany drops opposition to asylum criteria the breakthrough came after the german government dropped its long-standing opposition to a policy determining who is eligible to apply for asylum , specifically the recognition of asylum seekers who are fleeing non-state persecution , like men who are being pursued by drug cartels or women who face female genital mutilation .
the expected approval of a sweeping new immigration law in germany , which has led to a compromise on key issues between the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and the conservative christian democratic opposition , cleared the way for schily to adopt a more conciliatory tone .
under the rules agreed on tuesday , the eu will not only offer protection to people who are refugees according to the 1951 geneva convention , they will also offer so-called subsidiary protection to victims of non-state persecution .
human rights groups protest key points not good enough , say some human rights groups .
following the recent election of anti-immigration parties in several european countries , asylum policy remains a politically loaded and divisive issue .
human rights groups - citing the increasingly restrictive nature of the eu policies - have publicly objected to key aspects of the draft , namely the still unresolved questions over how asylum requests will be handled .
in an unprecedented move , several groups , including human rights watch , amnesty international , and the european council for refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , jointly called on the eu to scrap the agreement , claiming it violates international law .
at issue are two aspects of the proposed agreement .
the first deals with a suggestion in the directive on the use of a " safe country of origin " concept , which means the eu would compile a list of " safe countries " and asylum requests from persons originating from these countries would be considered illegitimate .
the second issue is a so-called " safe third county " concept , which means asylum seekers can be deported to a third country deemed safe .
neither was resolved at the meeting on tuesday and has been put off until the end of april .
" these proposals would deny some asylum seekers access to full and fair procedures , and it would transfer them to countries outside europe , " said ben ward of human rights watch .
" we 're deeply concerned that the eu is trying to get other countries to shoulder its responsibilities . "

after chancellor schröder settled a months-long cabinet dispute over greenhouse gas cuts , germany has submitted its plans for reducing carbon dioxide emissions to brussels .
other eu countries are much further behind . germany was n't the first country to hand in plans for curbing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions to the european commission - that honor went to finland .
but berlin was n't far behind .
considering the deeply entrenched dispute between industry and environmental groups , the fact that europe 's largest producer of greenhouse gases was among the first three to send its proposals for cutting the pollutants is surprising .
it was n't clear until late monday evening whether germany would be in a position to make wednesday 's eu deadline for emissions reductions plans .
only after chancellor gerhard schröder stepped in to broker a last-minute deal between the environment and economics ministers , was berlin able to put together a proposal worthy of sending to brussels .
germany calls for slight reduction just hours before the eu deadline ran out , germany 's cabinet passed a plan to cut industrial emissions of co2 from 505 million to 503 million tons per year by 2007 .
in a second phase , emissions are set to be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 .
the carbon caps are part of germany 's strategy to cut its greenhouse gases by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 .
the reduction is only slight compared to the 488 million tons requested by environment minister jürgen trittin .
as a member of the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition , he had pushed hard for further emission reductions , arguing german industry needed to do more to fulfil its contribution to the kyoto protocol .
economics minister wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , unflinchingly resisted major emissions cuts .
further reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry at a time when it is trying to shake off economic stagnation , he insisted .
european goal the dispute between industry and environment is not unique to germany .
throughout the european union , member states are struggling to lay such disagreements to rest in order to submit plans for cutting emissions .
by midnight wednesday all 15 eu states must set their co2 limits and the distribution of reductions between industrial sectors , with ceilings set on a company-by-company basis .
the reductions are part of a two-prong strategy brussels has devised in order to meet its commitments to the kyoto protocol .
in addition to capping emissions from industry and utilities , the eu plans to launch an emissions trading system -lrb- ets -rrb- in january that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from those who have remained under their pollution cap and thus create an exchange across borders , where the greener industries would stand to profit economically through the sale of their credits .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 .
several major industrial states , including britain , france and belgium , have already said they will miss the march 31 deadline .
italy , too , has conceded it is uncertain whether it will have a list of its emissions limits ready by the eu deadline .
spain will ask the european commission for " understanding " for failing to meet the deadline as the country is undergoing a change of government .
" the picture we have today does n't say that january 1 -lrb- the start of ets -rrb- is in any danger - not at all , not yet , " ewa hedlund , the commission 's environment spokeswoman , told a news briefing .
" next week , we 'll have more detail on what we 've received and what action we are going to take , " she said referring to a possible " infringement letter " from the commission and impending legal action against those members who fail to supply the eu executive with their emissions plans .
waiting for germany ?
according to analysts , europe 's biggest polluters had held back on submitting their plans until germany handed over its limits .
as the largest producer of co2 emissions , germany 's reduction rate dominated discussion in several capitals .
" germany is important , " john molloy of the brokerage firm tfs in london told german wire service dpa .
" great britain was the strictest up until now in terms of restriction , but they ca n't hold onto that position when everyone else is more lenient and risk jeopardizing the british industry . "
britain has denied it had purposefully waited for a german decision before drawing up its own plans .
but on tuesday london announced it may impose less cuts on industry than slated in january - a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 - and return to a limit closer to the 16 percent committed to under the kyoto protocol . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ministers reach agreement in emissions fight germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions .

the third international conference on afghanistan opened in berlin on wednesday with an inaugural speech by german chancellor schröder promising more financial aid to the war-torn country . german chancellor gerhard schröder opened the afghanistan conference in berlin on wednesday by pledging to afghan president hamid karzai that the international community would not abandon his country , one of the world 's poorest and the biggest opium supplier . karzai , who was seated next to the chancellor at the top table , which also included the u.n. afghanistan envoy jean arnault , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and the foreign ministers of britain , china , germany , pakistan and russia , listened intently as schröder delivered his opening speech . " a peaceful afghanistan is an anchor for greater political stability in the region and a sign of hope for us all , " schröder told the assembled dignitaries and press .
" it is proof that it is worth fighting against terror and violence . " the two-day conference is the third such international meeting on afghanistan since the end of the u.s.-led war .
the conference will address ways to stabilize the country 's political and economic reconstruction .
it will also tackle the problems of insecurity and drugs production plaguing the country despite the ousting of the taliban regime more than two years ago . chancellor schröder highlighted the three main goals of the conference : to support the political progress , including elections planned for september ; to increase aid for the country 's reconstruction ; and to help the kabul government establish security and the rule of law . schröder rallies international community he also used the speech to rally those countries that had already supported reconstruction efforts in afghanistan by reminding the hundreds of delegates , including 20 foreign ministers and officials from more than 60 countries and organizations , that there had been many successes in spite of the difficult conditions that still prevailed . " the positive developments in afghanistan show what can be achieved when we combine our efforts , " he said .
" every success that we score in bringing afghanistan on a path towards more freedom and security is not only progress for people in the country .
it is a success for us all .

the third international conference on afghanistan opened in berlin on wednesday with an inaugural speech by german chancellor schröder promising more financial aid to the war-torn country . german chancellor gerhard schröder opened the afghanistan conference in berlin on wednesday by pledging to afghan president hamid karzai that the international community would not abandon his country , one of the world 's poorest and the biggest opium supplier . karzai , who was seated next to the chancellor at the top table , which also included the u.n. afghanistan envoy jean arnault , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and the foreign ministers of britain , china , germany , pakistan and russia , listened intently as schröder delivered his opening speech . " a peaceful afghanistan is an anchor for greater political stability in the region and a sign of hope for us all , " schröder told the assembled dignitaries and press .
" it is proof that it is worth fighting against terror and violence . " the two-day conference is the third such international meeting on afghanistan since the end of the u.s.-led war .
the conference will address ways to stabilize the country 's political and economic reconstruction .
it will also tackle the problems of insecurity and drugs production plaguing the country despite the ousting of the taliban regime more than two years ago . chancellor schröder highlighted the three main goals of the conference : to support the political progress , including elections planned for september ; to increase aid for the country 's reconstruction ; and to help the kabul government establish security and the rule of law . schröder rallies international community he also used the speech to rally those countries that had already supported reconstruction efforts in afghanistan by reminding the hundreds of delegates , including 20 foreign ministers and officials from more than 60 countries and organizations , that there had been many successes in spite of the difficult conditions that still prevailed . " the positive developments in afghanistan show what can be achieved when we combine our efforts , " he said .
" every success that we score in bringing afghanistan on a path towards more freedom and security is not only progress for people in the country .
it is a success for us all . " in his speech later in the day , karzai said his country had come a long way since the fall of the taliban , with a constitution that reflected a desire to be partners with the international community and no longer " threatened by drugs and terrorism . " " what we have achieved is very promising , but let me be frank and say that the reconstruction has only begun , " karzai told the gathering . federal government extends financial aid bildunterschrift : on the subject of financial assistance , schröder vowed that germany would contribute € 320 million -lrb- $ 389.5 million -rrb- over the next four years to boost the reconstruction process in afghanistan .
the amount of financial aid by the german government since september 2001 will eventually total € 7.4 billion . sadako ogata , japan 's envoy to afghanistan , followed schröder 's lead by pledging $ 400 million -lrb- € 328.6 million -rrb- over the next two years .
" i am pleased to announce that japan is prepared to make further grant assistance amounting to $ 400 million over the coming two years , which brings japan 's contribution since september 2001 to over $ 1 billion , " she said .
earlier this month , japan said its financial assistance to afghanistan had reached $ 683 million , exceeding an initial pledge of $ 500 million . reconstruction funds a priority before the conference began , officials from participating countries and organizations spoke hopefully of raising $ 4 billion after afghan ministers called for more direct aid and investment .
afghan finance minister ashraf ghani told the handelsblatt business daily on tuesday that he was content with the international commitment so far , but more was necessary . he said earlier this month that $ 27.5 billion would be needed in the next seven years and previous promises " vastly underestimated " afghanistan 's needs . reconstruction minister amin farhang added in an interview with germany 's inforadio that he hoped the promised money would go directly to the kabul government instead of mainly to non-governmental organizations .
farhang told the radio station that afghanistan needed around $ 4.5 billion for this year , which would help train the afghan army and police force to tackle the rampant drugs problem controlled largely by influential provincial warlords . germany 's pledge of more financial aid came hours after u.s. secretary of state colin powell praised german efforts in aiding afghanistan . powell praises german efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : powell praised german efforts .
in an article in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , powell said , " it is in no small part thanks to germany 's engagement that afghanistan has made the progress it has that we want to pay tribute to at this international conference . "
" germany has shown vision and leadership quality , " he added .

the judge , brigitte koppenhoefer , made the statement on wednesday , following a mid-trial review .

koppenhoefer said there was not enough evidence to support the central criminal charge of breach of trust to shareholders , though there was some evidence of lesser violations of share law .

the third international conference on afghanistan opened in berlin on wednesday with an inaugural speech by german chancellor schröder promising more financial aid to the war-torn country . german chancellor gerhard schröder opened the afghanistan conference in berlin on wednesday by pledging to afghan president hamid karzai that the international community would not abandon his country , one of the world 's poorest and the biggest opium supplier . karzai , who was seated next to the chancellor at the top table , which also included the u.n. afghanistan envoy jean arnault , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and the foreign ministers of britain , china , germany , pakistan and russia , listened intently as schröder delivered his opening speech . " a peaceful afghanistan is an anchor for greater political stability in the region and a sign of hope for us all , " schröder told the assembled dignitaries and press .
" it is proof that it is worth fighting against terror and violence . " the two-day conference is the third such international meeting on afghanistan since the end of the u.s.-led war .
the conference will address ways to stabilize the country 's political and economic reconstruction .
it will also tackle the problems of insecurity and drugs production plaguing the country despite the ousting of the taliban regime more than two years ago . chancellor schröder highlighted the three main goals of the conference : to support the political progress , including elections planned for september ; to increase aid for the country 's reconstruction ; and to help the kabul government establish security and the rule of law . schröder rallies international community he also used the speech to rally those countries that had already supported reconstruction efforts in afghanistan by reminding the hundreds of delegates , including 20 foreign ministers and officials from more than 60 countries and organizations , that there had been many successes in spite of the difficult conditions that still prevailed . " the positive developments in afghanistan show what can be achieved when we combine our efforts , " he said .
" every success that we score in bringing afghanistan on a path towards more freedom and security is not only progress for people in the country .
it is a success for us all . " in his speech later in the day , karzai said his country had come a long way since the fall of the taliban , with a constitution that reflected a desire to be partners with the international community and no longer " threatened by drugs and terrorism . " " what we have achieved is very promising , but let me be frank and say that the reconstruction has only begun , " karzai told the gathering . federal government extends financial aid bildunterschrift : on the subject of financial assistance , schröder vowed that germany would contribute € 320 million -lrb- $ 389.5 million -rrb- over the next four years to boost the reconstruction process in afghanistan .
the amount of financial aid by the german government since september 2001 will eventually total € 7.4 billion . sadako ogata , japan 's envoy to afghanistan , followed schröder 's lead by pledging $ 400 million -lrb- € 328.6 million -rrb- over the next two years .
" i am pleased to announce that japan is prepared to make further grant assistance amounting to $ 400 million over the coming two years , which brings japan 's contribution since september 2001 to over $ 1 billion , " she said .
earlier this month , japan said its financial assistance to afghanistan had reached $ 683 million , exceeding an initial pledge of $ 500 million . reconstruction funds a priority before the conference began , officials from participating countries and organizations spoke hopefully of raising $ 4 billion after afghan ministers called for more direct aid and investment .
afghan finance minister ashraf ghani told the handelsblatt business daily on tuesday that he was content with the international commitment so far , but more was necessary . he said earlier this month that $ 27.5 billion would be needed in the next seven years and previous promises " vastly underestimated " afghanistan 's needs . reconstruction minister amin farhang added in an interview with germany 's inforadio that he hoped the promised money would go directly to the kabul government instead of mainly to non-governmental organizations .
farhang told the radio station that afghanistan needed around $ 4.5 billion for this year , which would help train the afghan army and police force to tackle the rampant drugs problem controlled largely by influential provincial warlords . germany 's pledge of more financial aid came hours after u.s. secretary of state colin powell praised german efforts in aiding afghanistan . powell praises german efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : powell praised german efforts .
in an article in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , powell said , " it is in no small part thanks to germany 's engagement that afghanistan has made the progress it has that we want to pay tribute to at this international conference . "
" germany has shown vision and leadership quality , " he added .
" germany can be especially proud of the stationing of bundeswehr soldiers in kunduz , where the german soldiers were the first to lead a provincial reconstruction team in the framework of isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- .

europe 's new counter-terrorism chief gijs de vries reported to work this week amid enduring questions over the exact nature of his work and his plans to keep europe safe . gijs de vries , a relatively low-profile former dutch interior minister and member of the european parliament , was appointed europe 's first " anti-terrorism czar " last week .
the post , created amid a surge of european unity following the madrid bombings and after years of talks on the necessity of such a position , is a strong sign that european anti-terrorism efforts have taken on a new urgency .
introduced at a packed news briefing in brussels on tuesday this week , the eu 's new counter-terorism chief has attracted much attention .
but by his second day on the job , otto schily , germany 's interior minister - who was in brussels for a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers - was asking for further clarification of de vries ' new duties and his future plans .
indeed , the appointment of this experienced yet relatively unknown european politician has left many raising the same questions .
an experienced european technocrat the 48-year-old gijs de vries was born in new york and has a respected career in european politics behind him .
de vries served as a liberal member of the european parliament for fourteen years , before taking the position of interior minister in the netherlands .
the dual u.s.-dutch citizen is fluent in several languages , including french , german and english , and he holds degrees from the university of leiden and the european university institute in florence , italy .
though de vries has relatively little experience in security and intelligence matters , which has given some commentators food for thought , he is described by others as an experienced technocrat .
de vries will have to call upon all of his faculties , which include a diplomatic and businesslike manner as well as extensive political knowledge , to implement the task he has been charged with : helping to safeguard europe 's security in an ever-more insecure world .
officially , de vries will be responsible for seeing that the various government bodies of eu member states and eu institutions in brussels work together to pool resources and intelligence .
namely , he has been charged with what romano prodi , the president of the european commission , has described as " breaking down the cultural obstacles to cooperation " .
what 's more , de vries can use his position to apply political pressure to eu members who lag behind in implementing the anti-terror measures that have already been agreed upon .
de vries has already promised to improve cooperation between european countries .
' ' terror is not just the concern of an intelligence agency in one nation , so the information gained must be shared by all nations , " he said .
a higher profile in the coming months how this still somewhat vague job description will translate into action remains to be seen during the coming months .
de vries ' plans will become more apparent in june , when he presents more specific proposals to eu heads of state at the next eu-wide summit in june .
but in his first days on the job , de vries has made some statements indicating his position on certain key issues .
notably , while pushing for the better exchange of resources and analysis , de vries said that increased efforts to fight terror in europe can not forfeit civil liberties .
" there can never be , in any society , a guarantee of 100 percent security , " de vries told reporters on tuesday after meeting with his boss , javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief . " we are living in an open society in europe , an open society in which people can enjoy many liberties , " he added .

eu interior ministers have acheived partial success on controversial plans to create a europe-wide asylum policy .
human rights groups however remain troubled over the unresolved elements . eu interior ministers met in brussels on tuesday to make yet another effort to hammer out a europe-wide asylum policy .
the meeting took on an added sense of urgency with the ministers struggling to comply with a self-imposed may 1 deadline , the date on which ten new countries join the eu .
ending almost six years of acrimonious negotiations , they reached a partial breakthrough on key aspects of the legislation . the ministers agreed on a set of criteria establishing who can apply for asylum .
however , they could not agree on some procedural points determining how such requests should be handled .
certain aspects of the latter , including a proposed plan to allow for the deportation of asylum seekers to " safe " third countries , have come under heavy fire from human rights organizations .
the ministers will meet again at the end of april to take up the issue again , but according to the german interior minister otto schily , " it could be close " .
germany drops opposition to asylum criteria the breakthrough came after the german government dropped its long-standing opposition to a policy determining who is eligible to apply for asylum , specifically the recognition of asylum seekers who are fleeing non-state persecution , like men who are being pursued by drug cartels or women who face female genital mutilation .
the expected approval of a sweeping new immigration law in germany , which has led to a compromise on key issues between the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and the conservative christian democratic opposition , cleared the way for schily to adopt a more conciliatory tone .
under the rules agreed on tuesday , the eu will not only offer protection to people who are refugees according to the 1951 geneva convention , they will also offer so-called subsidiary protection to victims of non-state persecution .
human rights groups protest key points not good enough , say some human rights groups .
following the recent election of anti-immigration parties in several european countries , asylum policy remains a politically loaded and divisive issue .
human rights groups - citing the increasingly restrictive nature of the eu policies - have publicly objected to key aspects of the draft , namely the still unresolved questions over how asylum requests will be handled .
in an unprecedented move , several groups , including human rights watch , amnesty international , and the european council for refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , jointly called on the eu to scrap the agreement , claiming it violates international law .
at issue are two aspects of the proposed agreement .
the first deals with a suggestion in the directive on the use of a " safe country of origin " concept , which means the eu would compile a list of " safe countries " and asylum requests from persons originating from these countries would be considered illegitimate .
the second issue is a so-called " safe third county " concept , which means asylum seekers can be deported to a third country deemed safe .
neither was resolved at the meeting on tuesday and has been put off until the end of april .
" these proposals would deny some asylum seekers access to full and fair procedures , and it would transfer them to countries outside europe , " said ben ward of human rights watch .
" we 're deeply concerned that the eu is trying to get other countries to shoulder its responsibilities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum-seekers in hamburg daphne bouteillet paquet said the ministers should forget the proposals and start again .
" we feel we have no option but to call on the eu to scrap this proposal on asylum procedures , which has been shaped in reaction to populist pressures and fears whipped up about a non-existent flood of refugees into the eu , " she said .
schily rebuffs criticism schily responded to the human rights organization 's criticism , saying that the creation of a safe third country concept would allow the eu to avoid the processing costs associated with questionable claims , while those who are truly victims of oppression would be offered asylum .
the ministers will meet again on april 29 to resolve remaining concerns . dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no breakthrough yet on immigration law germany 's ruling social democrats and opposition conservatives thrashed out the details of long-debated immigration legislation on monday .

germany drops opposition to asylum criteria the breakthrough came after the german government dropped its long-standing opposition to a policy determining who is eligible to apply for asylum , specifically the recognition of asylum seekers who are fleeing non-state persecution , like men who are being pursued by drug cartels or women who face female genital mutilation .
the expected approval of a sweeping new immigration law in germany , which has led to a compromise on key issues between the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and the conservative christian democratic opposition , cleared the way for schily to adopt a more conciliatory tone .
under the rules agreed on tuesday , the eu will not only offer protection to people who are refugees according to the 1951 geneva convention , they will also offer so-called subsidiary protection to victims of non-state persecution .
human rights groups protest key points not good enough , say some human rights groups .
following the recent election of anti-immigration parties in several european countries , asylum policy remains a politically loaded and divisive issue .
human rights groups - citing the increasingly restrictive nature of the eu policies - have publicly objected to key aspects of the draft , namely the still unresolved questions over how asylum requests will be handled .
in an unprecedented move , several groups , including human rights watch , amnesty international , and the european council for refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , jointly called on the eu to scrap the agreement , claiming it violates international law .
at issue are two aspects of the proposed agreement .
the first deals with a suggestion in the directive on the use of a " safe country of origin " concept , which means the eu would compile a list of " safe countries " and asylum requests from persons originating from these countries would be considered illegitimate .
the second issue is a so-called " safe third county " concept , which means asylum seekers can be deported to a third country deemed safe .
neither was resolved at the meeting on tuesday and has been put off until the end of april .
" these proposals would deny some asylum seekers access to full and fair procedures , and it would transfer them to countries outside europe , " said ben ward of human rights watch .
" we 're deeply concerned that the eu is trying to get other countries to shoulder its responsibilities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum-seekers in hamburg daphne bouteillet paquet said the ministers should forget the proposals and start again .
" we feel we have no option but to call on the eu to scrap this proposal on asylum procedures , which has been shaped in reaction to populist pressures and fears whipped up about a non-existent flood of refugees into the eu , " she said .
schily rebuffs criticism schily responded to the human rights organization 's criticism , saying that the creation of a safe third country concept would allow the eu to avoid the processing costs associated with questionable claims , while those who are truly victims of oppression would be offered asylum .
the ministers will meet again on april 29 to resolve remaining concerns . dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no breakthrough yet on immigration law germany 's ruling social democrats and opposition conservatives thrashed out the details of long-debated immigration legislation on monday .
though there 's no talk of a breakthrough , the two sides did make progress .

by the time he returned , he had made up his mind : europe ’ s biggest media group must immediately boost its position on the asian markets in order to profit from the dynamic growth in the region .
in china and india , bertelsmann has already set up shop . in the beijing region , for example , the group has already brought in 1.5 million members for its chinese-language book club .
and that 's only the beginning .
a million served bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gunter thielen " our team currently sells 20 million books in china , " thielen said tuesday at the company 's board meeting .
" that ’ s the same amount of books as we sell in france .
the turnover , however , is only a tenth in china , because there a book costs $ 1.5 while it costs $ 15 in france .
that ’ s the big difference and the reason for this is that the chinese market is still being regulated , " thielen said . " but once that starts changing , the prices will increase and so will our turnover .
in a long term perspective of 10 or 15 years , we will multiply our sales in asia and at some point it will represent at least 10 percent of our revenues , " he added .
the company still has a long way to go .
of its approximately € 17 billion in revenues last year , just € 2 billion came from sales in asia .
with a string of new investments , bertelsmann is seeking to increase its market share .
in china , bertelsmann wants to invest heavily in printing and publishing houses .
" we will stay away from the music sector , " he said .
" the bootleg system is so sophisticated in china , you can purchase a disc for $ 1 at any corner there .
that ’ s why it doesn ’ t make sense for us to produce discs in china . "
a fast growing market in india , bertelsmann ’ s random house publishing arm , as well as the printing subsidiary arvato , is already active .
still , business there is only just starting for the media group and the future looks promising , as india currently has growth rates of 7-8 percent per year - nearly comparable to those in china .
both are markets that bring euros to the eyes of bertelsmann managers .
" together they have a population of 2.4 billion people thus representing a third of the world population , " he said .
" this must become a market one day .
of course if you compare these countries to america , they are still dwarfs .
but if you look at their growth rates it ’ s clear that we must closely watch these markets .
and i am positive that we will increasingly position ourselves there . "
today the media giant only makes 3 percent of its turnover in asia , that ’ s around € 600 million per year .
and only 1 percent - about € 200 million - are being earned in eastern europe , which bertelsmann also views as a promising market for its television , publishing and printing operations .
currently , germany remains one of bertelsmann 's most important markets .
a third of the company 's overall turnover is made here , with 40 percent coming from the rest of europe and 25 percent in the united states and canada .
only 3 percent of revenues are currently derived from its asian units .
preparing for a mega-merger the company 's book publishing division , based in new york , is the market leader in the united states and britain .
new york is also the headquarters for its worldwide music business , which will soon be merging with sony 's music operations .

europe 's new counter-terrorism chief gijs de vries reported to work this week amid enduring questions over the exact nature of his work and his plans to keep europe safe . gijs de vries , a relatively low-profile former dutch interior minister and member of the european parliament , was appointed europe 's first " anti-terrorism czar " last week .
the post , created amid a surge of european unity following the madrid bombings and after years of talks on the necessity of such a position , is a strong sign that european anti-terrorism efforts have taken on a new urgency .
introduced at a packed news briefing in brussels on tuesday this week , the eu 's new counter-terorism chief has attracted much attention .
but by his second day on the job , otto schily , germany 's interior minister - who was in brussels for a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers - was asking for further clarification of de vries ' new duties and his future plans .
indeed , the appointment of this experienced yet relatively unknown european politician has left many raising the same questions .
an experienced european technocrat the 48-year-old gijs de vries was born in new york and has a respected career in european politics behind him .
de vries served as a liberal member of the european parliament for fourteen years , before taking the position of interior minister in the netherlands .
the dual u.s.-dutch citizen is fluent in several languages , including french , german and english , and he holds degrees from the university of leiden and the european university institute in florence , italy .
though de vries has relatively little experience in security and intelligence matters , which has given some commentators food for thought , he is described by others as an experienced technocrat .
de vries will have to call upon all of his faculties , which include a diplomatic and businesslike manner as well as extensive political knowledge , to implement the task he has been charged with : helping to safeguard europe 's security in an ever-more insecure world .
officially , de vries will be responsible for seeing that the various government bodies of eu member states and eu institutions in brussels work together to pool resources and intelligence .
namely , he has been charged with what romano prodi , the president of the european commission , has described as " breaking down the cultural obstacles to cooperation " .
what 's more , de vries can use his position to apply political pressure to eu members who lag behind in implementing the anti-terror measures that have already been agreed upon .
de vries has already promised to improve cooperation between european countries .
' ' terror is not just the concern of an intelligence agency in one nation , so the information gained must be shared by all nations , " he said .
a higher profile in the coming months how this still somewhat vague job description will translate into action remains to be seen during the coming months .
de vries ' plans will become more apparent in june , when he presents more specific proposals to eu heads of state at the next eu-wide summit in june .
but in his first days on the job , de vries has made some statements indicating his position on certain key issues .
notably , while pushing for the better exchange of resources and analysis , de vries said that increased efforts to fight terror in europe can not forfeit civil liberties .
" there can never be , in any society , a guarantee of 100 percent security , " de vries told reporters on tuesday after meeting with his boss , javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief . " we are living in an open society in europe , an open society in which people can enjoy many liberties , " he added .

europe 's new counter-terrorism chief gijs de vries reported to work this week amid enduring questions over the exact nature of his work and his plans to keep europe safe . gijs de vries , a relatively low-profile former dutch interior minister and member of the european parliament , was appointed europe 's first " anti-terrorism czar " last week .
the post , created amid a surge of european unity following the madrid bombings and after years of talks on the necessity of such a position , is a strong sign that european anti-terrorism efforts have taken on a new urgency .
introduced at a packed news briefing in brussels on tuesday this week , the eu 's new counter-terorism chief has attracted much attention .
but by his second day on the job , otto schily , germany 's interior minister - who was in brussels for a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers - was asking for further clarification of de vries ' new duties and his future plans .
indeed , the appointment of this experienced yet relatively unknown european politician has left many raising the same questions .
an experienced european technocrat the 48-year-old gijs de vries was born in new york and has a respected career in european politics behind him .
de vries served as a liberal member of the european parliament for fourteen years , before taking the position of interior minister in the netherlands .
the dual u.s.-dutch citizen is fluent in several languages , including french , german and english , and he holds degrees from the university of leiden and the european university institute in florence , italy .
though de vries has relatively little experience in security and intelligence matters , which has given some commentators food for thought , he is described by others as an experienced technocrat .
de vries will have to call upon all of his faculties , which include a diplomatic and businesslike manner as well as extensive political knowledge , to implement the task he has been charged with : helping to safeguard europe 's security in an ever-more insecure world .
officially , de vries will be responsible for seeing that the various government bodies of eu member states and eu institutions in brussels work together to pool resources and intelligence .
namely , he has been charged with what romano prodi , the president of the european commission , has described as " breaking down the cultural obstacles to cooperation " .
what 's more , de vries can use his position to apply political pressure to eu members who lag behind in implementing the anti-terror measures that have already been agreed upon .
de vries has already promised to improve cooperation between european countries .
' ' terror is not just the concern of an intelligence agency in one nation , so the information gained must be shared by all nations , " he said .
a higher profile in the coming months how this still somewhat vague job description will translate into action remains to be seen during the coming months .
de vries ' plans will become more apparent in june , when he presents more specific proposals to eu heads of state at the next eu-wide summit in june .
but in his first days on the job , de vries has made some statements indicating his position on certain key issues .
notably , while pushing for the better exchange of resources and analysis , de vries said that increased efforts to fight terror in europe can not forfeit civil liberties .
" there can never be , in any society , a guarantee of 100 percent security , " de vries told reporters on tuesday after meeting with his boss , javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief . " we are living in an open society in europe , an open society in which people can enjoy many liberties , " he added .
" it is important to preserve those liberties , to build on them . " dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops agenda at eu summit european union leaders arrived in brussels on thursday for their annual spring summit .

the law , which was implemented 40 years ago when the company was privatized , gives the state government of lower saxony , where the company is headquartered , a veto right to fend of foreign buyers .
the commission says the law violates the principle of the free movement of capital by giving a " special blocking minority right " to the state government .
germany has been given two months to act on the warning or face a battle in the european court of justice .
however , the final decision to proceed with the suit will not be taken until november , after european elections may create a commission more sympathetic to the counter arguments offered by the german government . more briefs 30.03.2004 -pipe- eu warns germany over parmesan knockoffs 30.03.2004 -pipe- deutsche bank rules out friendly merger 30.03.2004 -pipe- bertelsmann plans major acquisitions 29.03.2004 -pipe- no more stock options for telekom brass 29.03.2004 -pipe- german consumer confidence stays low 26.03.2004 -pipe- german business confidence dips in march 26.03.2004 -pipe- deutsche telekom denies major revamp 26.03.2004 -pipe- infineon drops plans to move abroad radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

on wednesday , international leaders will meet in berlin to take stock of rebuilding efforts in afghanistan .
reconstruction financing and a booming opium trade remain major challenges . afghan leader hamid karzai and his trademark head covering will take center stage in berlin on wednesday , when 54 nations meet to analyze the progress and problems in afghanistan three years after the fall of the taliban . karzai , in the german capital on tuesday , highlighted his country 's battle with drug lords and dwindling financial resources as the major talking points at the two-day conference , which will be attended by u.s. secretary of state colin powell . " we will be asking -lrb- the international community -rrb- to increase their assistance to afghanistan in order for all of us to succeed in bringing about a safer , better , standing-on-its-own-feet afghanistan , " karzai told reporters after meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder , according to reuters . germany ready for the long haul the afghan leader has already picked up important pledges from german officials .
schröder , whose country has 1,900 peacekeeping troops in kabul and the northern city of kunduz , said germany was prepared to stay in the war-torn country for the long haul . bildunterschrift : schröder and karzai met on tuesday , on the eve of the two-day conference . germany has provided roughly € 80 million -lrb- $ 97 million -rrb- in aid each year since 2002 .
on wednesday , german officials are expected to announce that they will continue their aid program until 2008 . the united states , the biggest donor ahead of germany and japan , will most likely offer $ 1 billion on top of the $ 1.2 billion it has already pledged this year .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said tuesday that the leading donor countries hope other countries will pledge more aid . afghan leaders estimate that $ 27.5 billion is needed over the next seven years for reconstruction .
donors worldwide have so far pledged $ 4.2 billion through 2004 . " we obviously hope we will gather as large a sum as possible , " fischer told reporters . afghan opium flooding world markets not only financial woes , but the country 's growing drug problem are likely to be major discussion points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poppy field in afghanistan far more lucrative than wheat fields and growable even in the substandard afghani soil , experts estimate opium production makes up roughly half of the country 's € 4.4 billion gross domestic product and poses a significant security problem . " through that , warlords and terrorist finance themselves , " says general rick hillier , who commands the nato stability force in the region .
" that means they lag even more in giving up power to the central government . " most of the opium produced in afghanistan ends up in european markets as heroin , according to the un drugs authority .
as a result , governments have been more open recently to helping the afghan government , suggesting crop alternatives for farmers and pledging to invest in sectors that will create more jobs . isaf troops not ready to fight drug trade problems remain .
the international security assistance force has so far refused to involve itself in the fight against drug production and smuggling , leaving an ill-equipped afghan police force and army to fend for themselves .
in the past year , a few kilos of heroin have fallen into afghan law enforcement 's hands .
that 's a drop in the bucket compared to the estimated 3,600 tons of opium that left the country last year , according to un drug authorities . " the fight against drugs is the fight for afghanistan , " karzai said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern alliance fighters afghan police plan a major offensive in the coming weeks to burn 75 percent of the poppy fields in three afghan provinces .
the offensive will later be extended to all 32 provinces .
the u.s. government has pledged $ 40 million exclusively for creating and financing anti-drug troop units . but karzai said alternatives need to be found for the farmers , who make far more money producing opium poppies , the raw material for heroin , than any other crop . speaking before a roomful of business people on tuesday , including representatives of the world bank , karzai pushed raisins and saffron as possible options for weaning farmers off of drug production .
" if we want to have afghanistan , " said karzai .
" we must fight drugs .

on wednesday , international leaders will meet in berlin to take stock of rebuilding efforts in afghanistan .
reconstruction financing and a booming opium trade remain major challenges . afghan leader hamid karzai and his trademark head covering will take center stage in berlin on wednesday , when 54 nations meet to analyze the progress and problems in afghanistan three years after the fall of the taliban . karzai , in the german capital on tuesday , highlighted his country 's battle with drug lords and dwindling financial resources as the major talking points at the two-day conference , which will be attended by u.s. secretary of state colin powell . " we will be asking -lrb- the international community -rrb- to increase their assistance to afghanistan in order for all of us to succeed in bringing about a safer , better , standing-on-its-own-feet afghanistan , " karzai told reporters after meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder , according to reuters . germany ready for the long haul the afghan leader has already picked up important pledges from german officials .
schröder , whose country has 1,900 peacekeeping troops in kabul and the northern city of kunduz , said germany was prepared to stay in the war-torn country for the long haul . bildunterschrift : schröder and karzai met on tuesday , on the eve of the two-day conference . germany has provided roughly € 80 million -lrb- $ 97 million -rrb- in aid each year since 2002 .
on wednesday , german officials are expected to announce that they will continue their aid program until 2008 . the united states , the biggest donor ahead of germany and japan , will most likely offer $ 1 billion on top of the $ 1.2 billion it has already pledged this year .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said tuesday that the leading donor countries hope other countries will pledge more aid . afghan leaders estimate that $ 27.5 billion is needed over the next seven years for reconstruction .
donors worldwide have so far pledged $ 4.2 billion through 2004 . " we obviously hope we will gather as large a sum as possible , " fischer told reporters . afghan opium flooding world markets not only financial woes , but the country 's growing drug problem are likely to be major discussion points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poppy field in afghanistan far more lucrative than wheat fields and growable even in the substandard afghani soil , experts estimate opium production makes up roughly half of the country 's € 4.4 billion gross domestic product and poses a significant security problem . " through that , warlords and terrorist finance themselves , " says general rick hillier , who commands the nato stability force in the region .
" that means they lag even more in giving up power to the central government . " most of the opium produced in afghanistan ends up in european markets as heroin , according to the un drugs authority .
as a result , governments have been more open recently to helping the afghan government , suggesting crop alternatives for farmers and pledging to invest in sectors that will create more jobs . isaf troops not ready to fight drug trade problems remain .
the international security assistance force has so far refused to involve itself in the fight against drug production and smuggling , leaving an ill-equipped afghan police force and army to fend for themselves .
in the past year , a few kilos of heroin have fallen into afghan law enforcement 's hands .
that 's a drop in the bucket compared to the estimated 3,600 tons of opium that left the country last year , according to un drug authorities . " the fight against drugs is the fight for afghanistan , " karzai said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern alliance fighters afghan police plan a major offensive in the coming weeks to burn 75 percent of the poppy fields in three afghan provinces .
the offensive will later be extended to all 32 provinces .
the u.s. government has pledged $ 40 million exclusively for creating and financing anti-drug troop units . but karzai said alternatives need to be found for the farmers , who make far more money producing opium poppies , the raw material for heroin , than any other crop . speaking before a roomful of business people on tuesday , including representatives of the world bank , karzai pushed raisins and saffron as possible options for weaning farmers off of drug production .

" through that , warlords and terrorist finance themselves , " says general rick hillier , who commands the nato stability force in the region .
" that means they lag even more in giving up power to the central government . " most of the opium produced in afghanistan ends up in european markets as heroin , according to the un drugs authority .
as a result , governments have been more open recently to helping the afghan government , suggesting crop alternatives for farmers and pledging to invest in sectors that will create more jobs . isaf troops not ready to fight drug trade problems remain .
the international security assistance force has so far refused to involve itself in the fight against drug production and smuggling , leaving an ill-equipped afghan police force and army to fend for themselves .
in the past year , a few kilos of heroin have fallen into afghan law enforcement 's hands .
that 's a drop in the bucket compared to the estimated 3,600 tons of opium that left the country last year , according to un drug authorities . " the fight against drugs is the fight for afghanistan , " karzai said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern alliance fighters afghan police plan a major offensive in the coming weeks to burn 75 percent of the poppy fields in three afghan provinces .
the offensive will later be extended to all 32 provinces .
the u.s. government has pledged $ 40 million exclusively for creating and financing anti-drug troop units . but karzai said alternatives need to be found for the farmers , who make far more money producing opium poppies , the raw material for heroin , than any other crop . speaking before a roomful of business people on tuesday , including representatives of the world bank , karzai pushed raisins and saffron as possible options for weaning farmers off of drug production .
" if we want to have afghanistan , " said karzai .
" we must fight drugs .

by the time he returned , he had made up his mind : europe ’ s biggest media group must immediately boost its position on the asian markets in order to profit from the dynamic growth in the region .
in china and india , bertelsmann has already set up shop . in the beijing region , for example , the group has already brought in 1.5 million members for its chinese-language book club .
and that 's only the beginning .
a million served bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gunter thielen " our team currently sells 20 million books in china , " thielen said tuesday at the company 's board meeting .
" that ’ s the same amount of books as we sell in france .
the turnover , however , is only a tenth in china , because there a book costs $ 1.5 while it costs $ 15 in france .
that ’ s the big difference and the reason for this is that the chinese market is still being regulated , " thielen said . " but once that starts changing , the prices will increase and so will our turnover .
in a long term perspective of 10 or 15 years , we will multiply our sales in asia and at some point it will represent at least 10 percent of our revenues , " he added .
the company still has a long way to go .
of its approximately € 17 billion in revenues last year , just € 2 billion came from sales in asia .
with a string of new investments , bertelsmann is seeking to increase its market share .
in china , bertelsmann wants to invest heavily in printing and publishing houses .
" we will stay away from the music sector , " he said .
" the bootleg system is so sophisticated in china , you can purchase a disc for $ 1 at any corner there .
that ’ s why it doesn ’ t make sense for us to produce discs in china . "
a fast growing market in india , bertelsmann ’ s random house publishing arm , as well as the printing subsidiary arvato , is already active .
still , business there is only just starting for the media group and the future looks promising , as india currently has growth rates of 7-8 percent per year - nearly comparable to those in china .
both are markets that bring euros to the eyes of bertelsmann managers .
" together they have a population of 2.4 billion people thus representing a third of the world population , " he said .
" this must become a market one day .
of course if you compare these countries to america , they are still dwarfs .
but if you look at their growth rates it ’ s clear that we must closely watch these markets .
and i am positive that we will increasingly position ourselves there . "
today the media giant only makes 3 percent of its turnover in asia , that ’ s around € 600 million per year .
and only 1 percent - about € 200 million - are being earned in eastern europe , which bertelsmann also views as a promising market for its television , publishing and printing operations .
currently , germany remains one of bertelsmann 's most important markets .
a third of the company 's overall turnover is made here , with 40 percent coming from the rest of europe and 25 percent in the united states and canada .
only 3 percent of revenues are currently derived from its asian units .
preparing for a mega-merger the company 's book publishing division , based in new york , is the market leader in the united states and britain .
new york is also the headquarters for its worldwide music business , which will soon be merging with sony 's music operations .

by the time he returned , he had made up his mind : europe ’ s biggest media group must immediately boost its position on the asian markets in order to profit from the dynamic growth in the region .
in china and india , bertelsmann has already set up shop . in the beijing region , for example , the group has already brought in 1.5 million members for its chinese-language book club .
and that 's only the beginning .
a million served bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gunter thielen " our team currently sells 20 million books in china , " thielen said tuesday at the company 's board meeting .
" that ’ s the same amount of books as we sell in france .
the turnover , however , is only a tenth in china , because there a book costs $ 1.5 while it costs $ 15 in france .
that ’ s the big difference and the reason for this is that the chinese market is still being regulated , " thielen said . " but once that starts changing , the prices will increase and so will our turnover .
in a long term perspective of 10 or 15 years , we will multiply our sales in asia and at some point it will represent at least 10 percent of our revenues , " he added .
the company still has a long way to go .
of its approximately € 17 billion in revenues last year , just € 2 billion came from sales in asia .
with a string of new investments , bertelsmann is seeking to increase its market share .
in china , bertelsmann wants to invest heavily in printing and publishing houses .
" we will stay away from the music sector , " he said .
" the bootleg system is so sophisticated in china , you can purchase a disc for $ 1 at any corner there .
that ’ s why it doesn ’ t make sense for us to produce discs in china . "
a fast growing market in india , bertelsmann ’ s random house publishing arm , as well as the printing subsidiary arvato , is already active .
still , business there is only just starting for the media group and the future looks promising , as india currently has growth rates of 7-8 percent per year - nearly comparable to those in china .
both are markets that bring euros to the eyes of bertelsmann managers .
" together they have a population of 2.4 billion people thus representing a third of the world population , " he said .
" this must become a market one day .
of course if you compare these countries to america , they are still dwarfs .
but if you look at their growth rates it ’ s clear that we must closely watch these markets .
and i am positive that we will increasingly position ourselves there . "
today the media giant only makes 3 percent of its turnover in asia , that ’ s around € 600 million per year .
and only 1 percent - about € 200 million - are being earned in eastern europe , which bertelsmann also views as a promising market for its television , publishing and printing operations .
currently , germany remains one of bertelsmann 's most important markets .
a third of the company 's overall turnover is made here , with 40 percent coming from the rest of europe and 25 percent in the united states and canada .
only 3 percent of revenues are currently derived from its asian units .
preparing for a mega-merger the company 's book publishing division , based in new york , is the market leader in the united states and britain .
new york is also the headquarters for its worldwide music business , which will soon be merging with sony 's music operations .
with a world music market share of approximately 12 percent , bertelsmann is expected to be the dominant partner in the joint venture .
last year , bertelsmann artists including britney spears and justin timberlake won 22 grammy awards .
and the company 's gruner + jahr magazine publishing division , the market leader in germany and france and a strong presence in the u.s. , is planning on introducing 20 new glossy magazines around the world . dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a victory for the old in berlin with the opening of bertelsmann ’ s new berlin headquarters and plans to reconstruct hohenzollern palace , someday , germany 's capital is looking back to the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 31.03.2004 passenger data transfer irks eu parliament eu parliamentarians have rejected european commission plans to provide the united states with passenger data .
they fear the information will not be properly safeguarded . members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- have threatened to take the european commission to the eu 's top court if it does not withdraw its decision to transfer air passenger data to u.s. authorities .
they fear there are insufficient guarantees that the data will be protected .
dutch liberal mep johanna boogerd-quaak presented the resolution which was approved by meps with 229 votes in favor , 202 against and 19 abstentions .
" we are not satisfied with the privacy safeguards secured by the commission , and we now expect them to withdraw their decision and come back with better safeguards , " boogerd-quaak said .
" if they do not , parliament has indicated that we are willing to go to the european court of justice , " she added .
boogerd-quaak said only 19 categories of data should be relayed to the united states , instead of the current 34 , and the three and a half year period for which data can be retained should be shortened .
the eu agreed in december to allow the u.s. access to passenger data on transatlantic flights .

they fear the information will not be properly safeguarded . members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- have threatened to take the european commission to the eu 's top court if it does not withdraw its decision to transfer air passenger data to u.s. authorities .
they fear there are insufficient guarantees that the data will be protected .
dutch liberal mep johanna boogerd-quaak presented the resolution which was approved by meps with 229 votes in favor , 202 against and 19 abstentions .
" we are not satisfied with the privacy safeguards secured by the commission , and we now expect them to withdraw their decision and come back with better safeguards , " boogerd-quaak said .
" if they do not , parliament has indicated that we are willing to go to the european court of justice , " she added .
boogerd-quaak said only 19 categories of data should be relayed to the united states , instead of the current 34 , and the three and a half year period for which data can be retained should be shortened .
the eu agreed in december to allow the u.s. access to passenger data on transatlantic flights .

the hunger for culture in afghanistan is overcoming the physical challenges of bringing art , film , theater and education to the people .
german organizations are at the forefront of this afghan renaissance . while the diplomats and dignitaries at the afghanistan conference in berlin begin to discuss efforts to rebuild , refinance and stabilize the war-torn country , one area of reconstruction is already well underway - the cultural aspect of afghan life is thriving despite very difficult conditions thanks to efforts from german organizations . germany ’ s cultural flagship in afghanistan is the goethe institute .
the head office in the capital kabul had been closed for 12 years until it became the first foreign cultural institute to be reopened last september .
the demand for german-language classes is enormous , and the goethe institute also supports art exhibitions and theater and film productions .
people love the goethe institute , says wilfried grolig , director-general of the department for culture and education at the german foreign office . “ people here in kabul are culturally starved - they ’ re interested in everything ! ” he said .
“ so opening up windows of opportunity and importing culture from the outside world , especially from germany , is the right idea , ” grolig told deutsche welle . germany supports new schools windows of opportunity also includes opening up two schools , financed by the german foreign office .
the schools , one for boys and one for girls , teach over 4,000 pupils . the daad , a german academic program , is also very active in kabul .
it provides german university lecturers with additional training and sends them to colleges in afghanistan .
but the conditions under which teachers must educate and students must learn are often horrendous , according to wilfried grolig . “ when i was in kabul , i was invited to watch a theater group rehearse for the play " antigone , " which is about betrayal and death , set in a really dilapidated room .

and german specialists train lawyers and judges , while also helping to set up a new media system in the country .
the guiding principles behind all the projects are democracy , human rights , and freedom of opinion , says grolig , but that doesn ’ t mean transposing german culture onto afghanistan . “ it ’ s not about forcing our culture onto other people .
it ’ s about creating a forum for dialogue , ” he says . the german government intends to further support cultural and educational programs in afghanistan , and grolig says he hopes the international conference will clearly show that the international community is still on afghanistan ’ s side in helping to rebuild the country . louisa schaefer -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beating the drug lords and rebuilding a country on wednesday , international leaders will meet in berlin to take stock of rebuilding efforts in afghanistan .

" one female councilor said jokingly that the mermaid 's breasts were too small and that she was a bit fat , " a town spokesman told reuters .
what began as a joke soon became a national story , prompting the town to examine the idea a little more closely .

just weeks before entering into what has - until now - been western europe 's most exclusive club , a small polish town has decided its coat of arms needs to comply with western beauty standards . when the coastal town of ustka was mulling over ways to improve its image , talk turned to the mermaid on the city 's coat of arms .
looking a little plump around the edges , town officials apparently felt their mermaid was n't exactly in line with western beauty standards - and this with their country just weeks from joining the european union .
" one female councilor said jokingly that the mermaid 's breasts were too small and that she was a bit fat , " a town spokesman told reuters .
what began as a joke soon became a national story , prompting the town to examine the idea a little more closely .

after chancellor schröder settled a months-long cabinet dispute over greenhouse gas cuts , germany has submitted its plans for reducing carbon dioxide emissions to brussels .
other eu countries are much further behind . germany was n't the first country to hand in plans for curbing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions to the european commission - that honor went to finland .
but berlin was n't far behind .
considering the deeply entrenched dispute between industry and environmental groups , the fact that europe 's largest producer of greenhouse gases was among the first three to send its proposals for cutting the pollutants is surprising .
it was n't clear until late monday evening whether germany would be in a position to make wednesday 's eu deadline for emissions reductions plans .
only after chancellor gerhard schröder stepped in to broker a last-minute deal between the environment and economics ministers , was berlin able to put together a proposal worthy of sending to brussels .
germany calls for slight reduction just hours before the eu deadline ran out , germany 's cabinet passed a plan to cut industrial emissions of co2 from 505 million to 503 million tons per year by 2007 .
in a second phase , emissions are set to be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 .
the carbon caps are part of germany 's strategy to cut its greenhouse gases by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 .
the reduction is only slight compared to the 488 million tons requested by environment minister jürgen trittin .
as a member of the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition , he had pushed hard for further emission reductions , arguing german industry needed to do more to fulfil its contribution to the kyoto protocol .
economics minister wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , unflinchingly resisted major emissions cuts .
further reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry at a time when it is trying to shake off economic stagnation , he insisted .
european goal the dispute between industry and environment is not unique to germany .
throughout the european union , member states are struggling to lay such disagreements to rest in order to submit plans for cutting emissions .
by midnight wednesday all 15 eu states must set their co2 limits and the distribution of reductions between industrial sectors , with ceilings set on a company-by-company basis .
the reductions are part of a two-prong strategy brussels has devised in order to meet its commitments to the kyoto protocol .
in addition to capping emissions from industry and utilities , the eu plans to launch an emissions trading system -lrb- ets -rrb- in january that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from those who have remained under their pollution cap and thus create an exchange across borders , where the greener industries would stand to profit economically through the sale of their credits .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 .
several major industrial states , including britain , france and belgium , have already said they will miss the march 31 deadline .
italy , too , has conceded it is uncertain whether it will have a list of its emissions limits ready by the eu deadline .
spain will ask the european commission for " understanding " for failing to meet the deadline as the country is undergoing a change of government .
" the picture we have today does n't say that january 1 -lrb- the start of ets -rrb- is in any danger - not at all , not yet , " ewa hedlund , the commission 's environment spokeswoman , told a news briefing .
" next week , we 'll have more detail on what we 've received and what action we are going to take , " she said referring to a possible " infringement letter " from the commission and impending legal action against those members who fail to supply the eu executive with their emissions plans .
waiting for germany ?
according to analysts , europe 's biggest polluters had held back on submitting their plans until germany handed over its limits .
as the largest producer of co2 emissions , germany 's reduction rate dominated discussion in several capitals .
" germany is important , " john molloy of the brokerage firm tfs in london told german wire service dpa .
" great britain was the strictest up until now in terms of restriction , but they ca n't hold onto that position when everyone else is more lenient and risk jeopardizing the british industry . "
britain has denied it had purposefully waited for a german decision before drawing up its own plans .
but on tuesday london announced it may impose less cuts on industry than slated in january - a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 - and return to a limit closer to the 16 percent committed to under the kyoto protocol . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ministers reach agreement in emissions fight germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions .

after chancellor schröder settled a months-long cabinet dispute over greenhouse gas cuts , germany has submitted its plans for reducing carbon dioxide emissions to brussels .
other eu countries are much further behind . germany was n't the first country to hand in plans for curbing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions to the european commission - that honor went to finland .
but berlin was n't far behind .
considering the deeply entrenched dispute between industry and environmental groups , the fact that europe 's largest producer of greenhouse gases was among the first three to send its proposals for cutting the pollutants is surprising .
it was n't clear until late monday evening whether germany would be in a position to make wednesday 's eu deadline for emissions reductions plans .
only after chancellor gerhard schröder stepped in to broker a last-minute deal between the environment and economics ministers , was berlin able to put together a proposal worthy of sending to brussels .
germany calls for slight reduction just hours before the eu deadline ran out , germany 's cabinet passed a plan to cut industrial emissions of co2 from 505 million to 503 million tons per year by 2007 .
in a second phase , emissions are set to be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 .
the carbon caps are part of germany 's strategy to cut its greenhouse gases by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 .
the reduction is only slight compared to the 488 million tons requested by environment minister jürgen trittin .
as a member of the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition , he had pushed hard for further emission reductions , arguing german industry needed to do more to fulfil its contribution to the kyoto protocol .
economics minister wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , unflinchingly resisted major emissions cuts .
further reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry at a time when it is trying to shake off economic stagnation , he insisted .
european goal the dispute between industry and environment is not unique to germany .
throughout the european union , member states are struggling to lay such disagreements to rest in order to submit plans for cutting emissions .
by midnight wednesday all 15 eu states must set their co2 limits and the distribution of reductions between industrial sectors , with ceilings set on a company-by-company basis .
the reductions are part of a two-prong strategy brussels has devised in order to meet its commitments to the kyoto protocol .
in addition to capping emissions from industry and utilities , the eu plans to launch an emissions trading system -lrb- ets -rrb- in january that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from those who have remained under their pollution cap and thus create an exchange across borders , where the greener industries would stand to profit economically through the sale of their credits .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 .
several major industrial states , including britain , france and belgium , have already said they will miss the march 31 deadline .
italy , too , has conceded it is uncertain whether it will have a list of its emissions limits ready by the eu deadline .
spain will ask the european commission for " understanding " for failing to meet the deadline as the country is undergoing a change of government .
" the picture we have today does n't say that january 1 -lrb- the start of ets -rrb- is in any danger - not at all , not yet , " ewa hedlund , the commission 's environment spokeswoman , told a news briefing .
" next week , we 'll have more detail on what we 've received and what action we are going to take , " she said referring to a possible " infringement letter " from the commission and impending legal action against those members who fail to supply the eu executive with their emissions plans .
waiting for germany ?
according to analysts , europe 's biggest polluters had held back on submitting their plans until germany handed over its limits .
as the largest producer of co2 emissions , germany 's reduction rate dominated discussion in several capitals .
" germany is important , " john molloy of the brokerage firm tfs in london told german wire service dpa .
" great britain was the strictest up until now in terms of restriction , but they ca n't hold onto that position when everyone else is more lenient and risk jeopardizing the british industry . "
britain has denied it had purposefully waited for a german decision before drawing up its own plans .
but on tuesday london announced it may impose less cuts on industry than slated in january - a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 - and return to a limit closer to the 16 percent committed to under the kyoto protocol . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ministers reach agreement in emissions fight germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions .

the third international conference on afghanistan opened in berlin on wednesday with an inaugural speech by german chancellor schröder promising more financial aid to the war-torn country . german chancellor gerhard schröder opened the afghanistan conference in berlin on wednesday by pledging to afghan president hamid karzai that the international community would not abandon his country , one of the world 's poorest and the biggest opium supplier . karzai , who was seated next to the chancellor at the top table , which also included the u.n. afghanistan envoy jean arnault , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and the foreign ministers of britain , china , germany , pakistan and russia , listened intently as schröder delivered his opening speech . " a peaceful afghanistan is an anchor for greater political stability in the region and a sign of hope for us all , " schröder told the assembled dignitaries and press .
" it is proof that it is worth fighting against terror and violence . " the two-day conference is the third such international meeting on afghanistan since the end of the u.s.-led war .
the conference will address ways to stabilize the country 's political and economic reconstruction .
it will also tackle the problems of insecurity and drugs production plaguing the country despite the ousting of the taliban regime more than two years ago . chancellor schröder highlighted the three main goals of the conference : to support the political progress , including elections planned for september ; to increase aid for the country 's reconstruction ; and to help the kabul government establish security and the rule of law . schröder rallies international community he also used the speech to rally those countries that had already supported reconstruction efforts in afghanistan by reminding the hundreds of delegates , including 20 foreign ministers and officials from more than 60 countries and organizations , that there had been many successes in spite of the difficult conditions that still prevailed . " the positive developments in afghanistan show what can be achieved when we combine our efforts , " he said .
" every success that we score in bringing afghanistan on a path towards more freedom and security is not only progress for people in the country .
it is a success for us all . " in his speech later in the day , karzai said his country had come a long way since the fall of the taliban , with a constitution that reflected a desire to be partners with the international community and no longer " threatened by drugs and terrorism . " " what we have achieved is very promising , but let me be frank and say that the reconstruction has only begun , " karzai told the gathering . federal government extends financial aid bildunterschrift : on the subject of financial assistance , schröder vowed that germany would contribute € 320 million -lrb- $ 389.5 million -rrb- over the next four years to boost the reconstruction process in afghanistan .
the amount of financial aid by the german government since september 2001 will eventually total € 7.4 billion . sadako ogata , japan 's envoy to afghanistan , followed schröder 's lead by pledging $ 400 million -lrb- € 328.6 million -rrb- over the next two years .
" i am pleased to announce that japan is prepared to make further grant assistance amounting to $ 400 million over the coming two years , which brings japan 's contribution since september 2001 to over $ 1 billion , " she said .
earlier this month , japan said its financial assistance to afghanistan had reached $ 683 million , exceeding an initial pledge of $ 500 million . reconstruction funds a priority before the conference began , officials from participating countries and organizations spoke hopefully of raising $ 4 billion after afghan ministers called for more direct aid and investment .
afghan finance minister ashraf ghani told the handelsblatt business daily on tuesday that he was content with the international commitment so far , but more was necessary . he said earlier this month that $ 27.5 billion would be needed in the next seven years and previous promises " vastly underestimated " afghanistan 's needs . reconstruction minister amin farhang added in an interview with germany 's inforadio that he hoped the promised money would go directly to the kabul government instead of mainly to non-governmental organizations .
farhang told the radio station that afghanistan needed around $ 4.5 billion for this year , which would help train the afghan army and police force to tackle the rampant drugs problem controlled largely by influential provincial warlords . germany 's pledge of more financial aid came hours after u.s. secretary of state colin powell praised german efforts in aiding afghanistan . powell praises german efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : powell praised german efforts .
in an article in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , powell said , " it is in no small part thanks to germany 's engagement that afghanistan has made the progress it has that we want to pay tribute to at this international conference . "
" germany has shown vision and leadership quality , " he added .
" germany can be especially proud of the stationing of bundeswehr soldiers in kunduz , where the german soldiers were the first to lead a provincial reconstruction team in the framework of isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- .

" the positive developments in afghanistan show what can be achieved when we combine our efforts , " he said .
" every success that we score in bringing afghanistan on a path towards more freedom and security is not only progress for people in the country .
it is a success for us all . " in his speech later in the day , karzai said his country had come a long way since the fall of the taliban , with a constitution that reflected a desire to be partners with the international community and no longer " threatened by drugs and terrorism . " " what we have achieved is very promising , but let me be frank and say that the reconstruction has only begun , " karzai told the gathering . federal government extends financial aid bildunterschrift : on the subject of financial assistance , schröder vowed that germany would contribute € 320 million -lrb- $ 389.5 million -rrb- over the next four years to boost the reconstruction process in afghanistan .
the amount of financial aid by the german government since september 2001 will eventually total € 7.4 billion . sadako ogata , japan 's envoy to afghanistan , followed schröder 's lead by pledging $ 400 million -lrb- € 328.6 million -rrb- over the next two years .
" i am pleased to announce that japan is prepared to make further grant assistance amounting to $ 400 million over the coming two years , which brings japan 's contribution since september 2001 to over $ 1 billion , " she said .
earlier this month , japan said its financial assistance to afghanistan had reached $ 683 million , exceeding an initial pledge of $ 500 million . reconstruction funds a priority before the conference began , officials from participating countries and organizations spoke hopefully of raising $ 4 billion after afghan ministers called for more direct aid and investment .
afghan finance minister ashraf ghani told the handelsblatt business daily on tuesday that he was content with the international commitment so far , but more was necessary . he said earlier this month that $ 27.5 billion would be needed in the next seven years and previous promises " vastly underestimated " afghanistan 's needs . reconstruction minister amin farhang added in an interview with germany 's inforadio that he hoped the promised money would go directly to the kabul government instead of mainly to non-governmental organizations .
farhang told the radio station that afghanistan needed around $ 4.5 billion for this year , which would help train the afghan army and police force to tackle the rampant drugs problem controlled largely by influential provincial warlords . germany 's pledge of more financial aid came hours after u.s. secretary of state colin powell praised german efforts in aiding afghanistan . powell praises german efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : powell praised german efforts .
in an article in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , powell said , " it is in no small part thanks to germany 's engagement that afghanistan has made the progress it has that we want to pay tribute to at this international conference . "
" germany has shown vision and leadership quality , " he added .
" germany can be especially proud of the stationing of bundeswehr soldiers in kunduz , where the german soldiers were the first to lead a provincial reconstruction team in the framework of isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- .

a member of the european parliament has accused hundreds of his colleagues of pocketing allowances for parliamentary sessions they have not attended .
the parliament says it could investigate as many as 200 members . hans-peter martin told germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper on monday that he has collected detailed records over the past two years that show that many of his colleagues in the european parliament habitually enter their names in the parliamentary register , but then skip meetings .
for signing the register , based on the understanding that they attend the sessions , members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- receive a € 262 -lrb- $ 320 -rrb- per diem .
martin , an mep from austria , claimed many either sign the register , which is accessible between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. , before flying home or send " front men " to sign on their behalf .
he said he had discovered 7,200 instances of fraud through what he alleged were forged per diem claims and attendance records to claim expenses .
wide-spread abuse ?
" brussel 's enormous expense system is being abused , " he said , " especially when delegates come in early , quickly sign in and then leave the city . "
martin also claimed that a favorite practice among meps has been to take an evening flight to brussels , sign the register before 10 p.m. , sign again the following day and attend a session before signing again the next morning and flying home .
this would earn them around € 795 in supplements on top of travel costs and the usual salary for spending just one session in parliament .
-lrb- meps are given salaries that are equivalent to those of members of their national parliaments and can range anywhere from just over € 2,000 a month to nearly € 10,000 .
efforts to reform the pay system and implement a single salary for members of the european parliament have repeatedly stalled since they began to be discussed earnestly in 1998 . -rrb-
allowance may be legitimate david harley , spokesman for the european parliament , said meps could legitimately claim their daily allowance if they were present in parliament , whether or not they took part in debates .
he said members could be working in their offices , writing reports or talking to journalists and also complex travel arrangements meant they often arrived late and left early .
but martin has described the practices as a " scam , " and he claimed nearly half of all german meps and several from other countries including britain are part of it .
the allegations of misuse of funds have shaken parliament , and many have stepped up to defend their fellow parliamentarians .
german mep hans-gert pöttering said meps are conscientious and work long hours .
" the vast majority of our colleagues do their work conscientiously , with a workload of 60 to 70 hours a week , " he said .
meanwhile , ireland 's mary banotti , a conservative , said martin ’ s allegations are causing immense distress to many colleagues .
daniel cohn-bendit , a prominent german green party member who is also in parliament , criticized martin for revealing his allegations to a german tabloid newspaper .
" to reveal this issue in this way is simply mobbing , " he said , referring to the practice of bullying workers until they leave a company .
parliament expenses under the loop members of the european parliament are currently paid a salary and expenses under an oft-criticized system set up in the 1960s that , among other things , allows meps to pocket the difference between full fare air tickets and discount fares when traveling between brussels , strasbourg and their constituencies . anita purcell -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany blocks eu parliament pay reform germany and three other eu states have blocked an attempt to reform the pay system for european parliamentarians , meaning it 's now unlikely that a reform package will be passed before eu-wide elections in june .

a member of the european parliament has accused hundreds of his colleagues of pocketing allowances for parliamentary sessions they have not attended .
the parliament says it could investigate as many as 200 members . hans-peter martin told germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper on monday that he has collected detailed records over the past two years that show that many of his colleagues in the european parliament habitually enter their names in the parliamentary register , but then skip meetings .
for signing the register , based on the understanding that they attend the sessions , members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- receive a € 262 -lrb- $ 320 -rrb- per diem .
martin , an mep from austria , claimed many either sign the register , which is accessible between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. , before flying home or send " front men " to sign on their behalf .
he said he had discovered 7,200 instances of fraud through what he alleged were forged per diem claims and attendance records to claim expenses .
wide-spread abuse ?
" brussel 's enormous expense system is being abused , " he said , " especially when delegates come in early , quickly sign in and then leave the city . "
martin also claimed that a favorite practice among meps has been to take an evening flight to brussels , sign the register before 10 p.m. , sign again the following day and attend a session before signing again the next morning and flying home .
this would earn them around € 795 in supplements on top of travel costs and the usual salary for spending just one session in parliament .
-lrb- meps are given salaries that are equivalent to those of members of their national parliaments and can range anywhere from just over € 2,000 a month to nearly € 10,000 .

the third international conference on afghanistan opened in berlin on wednesday with an inaugural speech by german chancellor schröder promising more financial aid to the war-torn country . german chancellor gerhard schröder opened the afghanistan conference in berlin on wednesday by pledging to afghan president hamid karzai that the international community would not abandon his country , one of the world 's poorest and the biggest opium supplier . karzai , who was seated next to the chancellor at the top table , which also included the u.n. afghanistan envoy jean arnault , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and the foreign ministers of britain , china , germany , pakistan and russia , listened intently as schröder delivered his opening speech . " a peaceful afghanistan is an anchor for greater political stability in the region and a sign of hope for us all , " schröder told the assembled dignitaries and press .
" it is proof that it is worth fighting against terror and violence . " the two-day conference is the third such international meeting on afghanistan since the end of the u.s.-led war .
the conference will address ways to stabilize the country 's political and economic reconstruction .
it will also tackle the problems of insecurity and drugs production plaguing the country despite the ousting of the taliban regime more than two years ago . chancellor schröder highlighted the three main goals of the conference : to support the political progress , including elections planned for september ; to increase aid for the country 's reconstruction ; and to help the kabul government establish security and the rule of law . schröder rallies international community he also used the speech to rally those countries that had already supported reconstruction efforts in afghanistan by reminding the hundreds of delegates , including 20 foreign ministers and officials from more than 60 countries and organizations , that there had been many successes in spite of the difficult conditions that still prevailed . " the positive developments in afghanistan show what can be achieved when we combine our efforts , " he said .
" every success that we score in bringing afghanistan on a path towards more freedom and security is not only progress for people in the country .
it is a success for us all . " in his speech later in the day , karzai said his country had come a long way since the fall of the taliban , with a constitution that reflected a desire to be partners with the international community and no longer " threatened by drugs and terrorism . " " what we have achieved is very promising , but let me be frank and say that the reconstruction has only begun , " karzai told the gathering . federal government extends financial aid bildunterschrift : on the subject of financial assistance , schröder vowed that germany would contribute € 320 million -lrb- $ 389.5 million -rrb- over the next four years to boost the reconstruction process in afghanistan .
the amount of financial aid by the german government since september 2001 will eventually total € 7.4 billion . sadako ogata , japan 's envoy to afghanistan , followed schröder 's lead by pledging $ 400 million -lrb- € 328.6 million -rrb- over the next two years .
" i am pleased to announce that japan is prepared to make further grant assistance amounting to $ 400 million over the coming two years , which brings japan 's contribution since september 2001 to over $ 1 billion , " she said .
earlier this month , japan said its financial assistance to afghanistan had reached $ 683 million , exceeding an initial pledge of $ 500 million . reconstruction funds a priority before the conference began , officials from participating countries and organizations spoke hopefully of raising $ 4 billion after afghan ministers called for more direct aid and investment .
afghan finance minister ashraf ghani told the handelsblatt business daily on tuesday that he was content with the international commitment so far , but more was necessary . he said earlier this month that $ 27.5 billion would be needed in the next seven years and previous promises " vastly underestimated " afghanistan 's needs . reconstruction minister amin farhang added in an interview with germany 's inforadio that he hoped the promised money would go directly to the kabul government instead of mainly to non-governmental organizations .
farhang told the radio station that afghanistan needed around $ 4.5 billion for this year , which would help train the afghan army and police force to tackle the rampant drugs problem controlled largely by influential provincial warlords . germany 's pledge of more financial aid came hours after u.s. secretary of state colin powell praised german efforts in aiding afghanistan . powell praises german efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : powell praised german efforts .
in an article in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , powell said , " it is in no small part thanks to germany 's engagement that afghanistan has made the progress it has that we want to pay tribute to at this international conference . "
" germany has shown vision and leadership quality , " he added .

the third international conference on afghanistan opened in berlin on wednesday with an inaugural speech by german chancellor schröder promising more financial aid to the war-torn country . german chancellor gerhard schröder opened the afghanistan conference in berlin on wednesday by pledging to afghan president hamid karzai that the international community would not abandon his country , one of the world 's poorest and the biggest opium supplier . karzai , who was seated next to the chancellor at the top table , which also included the u.n. afghanistan envoy jean arnault , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and the foreign ministers of britain , china , germany , pakistan and russia , listened intently as schröder delivered his opening speech . " a peaceful afghanistan is an anchor for greater political stability in the region and a sign of hope for us all , " schröder told the assembled dignitaries and press .
" it is proof that it is worth fighting against terror and violence . " the two-day conference is the third such international meeting on afghanistan since the end of the u.s.-led war .
the conference will address ways to stabilize the country 's political and economic reconstruction .
it will also tackle the problems of insecurity and drugs production plaguing the country despite the ousting of the taliban regime more than two years ago . chancellor schröder highlighted the three main goals of the conference : to support the political progress , including elections planned for september ; to increase aid for the country 's reconstruction ; and to help the kabul government establish security and the rule of law . schröder rallies international community he also used the speech to rally those countries that had already supported reconstruction efforts in afghanistan by reminding the hundreds of delegates , including 20 foreign ministers and officials from more than 60 countries and organizations , that there had been many successes in spite of the difficult conditions that still prevailed . " the positive developments in afghanistan show what can be achieved when we combine our efforts , " he said .
" every success that we score in bringing afghanistan on a path towards more freedom and security is not only progress for people in the country .
it is a success for us all . " in his speech later in the day , karzai said his country had come a long way since the fall of the taliban , with a constitution that reflected a desire to be partners with the international community and no longer " threatened by drugs and terrorism . " " what we have achieved is very promising , but let me be frank and say that the reconstruction has only begun , " karzai told the gathering . federal government extends financial aid bildunterschrift : on the subject of financial assistance , schröder vowed that germany would contribute € 320 million -lrb- $ 389.5 million -rrb- over the next four years to boost the reconstruction process in afghanistan .
the amount of financial aid by the german government since september 2001 will eventually total € 7.4 billion . sadako ogata , japan 's envoy to afghanistan , followed schröder 's lead by pledging $ 400 million -lrb- € 328.6 million -rrb- over the next two years .
" i am pleased to announce that japan is prepared to make further grant assistance amounting to $ 400 million over the coming two years , which brings japan 's contribution since september 2001 to over $ 1 billion , " she said .
earlier this month , japan said its financial assistance to afghanistan had reached $ 683 million , exceeding an initial pledge of $ 500 million . reconstruction funds a priority before the conference began , officials from participating countries and organizations spoke hopefully of raising $ 4 billion after afghan ministers called for more direct aid and investment .
afghan finance minister ashraf ghani told the handelsblatt business daily on tuesday that he was content with the international commitment so far , but more was necessary . he said earlier this month that $ 27.5 billion would be needed in the next seven years and previous promises " vastly underestimated " afghanistan 's needs . reconstruction minister amin farhang added in an interview with germany 's inforadio that he hoped the promised money would go directly to the kabul government instead of mainly to non-governmental organizations .
farhang told the radio station that afghanistan needed around $ 4.5 billion for this year , which would help train the afghan army and police force to tackle the rampant drugs problem controlled largely by influential provincial warlords . germany 's pledge of more financial aid came hours after u.s. secretary of state colin powell praised german efforts in aiding afghanistan . powell praises german efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : powell praised german efforts .
in an article in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , powell said , " it is in no small part thanks to germany 's engagement that afghanistan has made the progress it has that we want to pay tribute to at this international conference . "
" germany has shown vision and leadership quality , " he added .

after chancellor schröder settled a months-long cabinet dispute over greenhouse gas cuts , germany has submitted its plans for reducing carbon dioxide emissions to brussels .
other eu countries are much further behind . germany was n't the first country to hand in plans for curbing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions to the european commission - that honor went to finland .
but berlin was n't far behind .
considering the deeply entrenched dispute between industry and environmental groups , the fact that europe 's largest producer of greenhouse gases was among the first three to send its proposals for cutting the pollutants is surprising .
it was n't clear until late monday evening whether germany would be in a position to make wednesday 's eu deadline for emissions reductions plans .
only after chancellor gerhard schröder stepped in to broker a last-minute deal between the environment and economics ministers , was berlin able to put together a proposal worthy of sending to brussels .
germany calls for slight reduction just hours before the eu deadline ran out , germany 's cabinet passed a plan to cut industrial emissions of co2 from 505 million to 503 million tons per year by 2007 .
in a second phase , emissions are set to be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 .
the carbon caps are part of germany 's strategy to cut its greenhouse gases by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 .
the reduction is only slight compared to the 488 million tons requested by environment minister jürgen trittin .
as a member of the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition , he had pushed hard for further emission reductions , arguing german industry needed to do more to fulfil its contribution to the kyoto protocol .
economics minister wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , unflinchingly resisted major emissions cuts .
further reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry at a time when it is trying to shake off economic stagnation , he insisted .
european goal the dispute between industry and environment is not unique to germany .
throughout the european union , member states are struggling to lay such disagreements to rest in order to submit plans for cutting emissions .
by midnight wednesday all 15 eu states must set their co2 limits and the distribution of reductions between industrial sectors , with ceilings set on a company-by-company basis .
the reductions are part of a two-prong strategy brussels has devised in order to meet its commitments to the kyoto protocol .
in addition to capping emissions from industry and utilities , the eu plans to launch an emissions trading system -lrb- ets -rrb- in january that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from those who have remained under their pollution cap and thus create an exchange across borders , where the greener industries would stand to profit economically through the sale of their credits .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 .
several major industrial states , including britain , france and belgium , have already said they will miss the march 31 deadline .
italy , too , has conceded it is uncertain whether it will have a list of its emissions limits ready by the eu deadline .
spain will ask the european commission for " understanding " for failing to meet the deadline as the country is undergoing a change of government .
" the picture we have today does n't say that january 1 -lrb- the start of ets -rrb- is in any danger - not at all , not yet , " ewa hedlund , the commission 's environment spokeswoman , told a news briefing .
" next week , we 'll have more detail on what we 've received and what action we are going to take , " she said referring to a possible " infringement letter " from the commission and impending legal action against those members who fail to supply the eu executive with their emissions plans .
waiting for germany ?
according to analysts , europe 's biggest polluters had held back on submitting their plans until germany handed over its limits .
as the largest producer of co2 emissions , germany 's reduction rate dominated discussion in several capitals .
" germany is important , " john molloy of the brokerage firm tfs in london told german wire service dpa .
" great britain was the strictest up until now in terms of restriction , but they ca n't hold onto that position when everyone else is more lenient and risk jeopardizing the british industry . "
britain has denied it had purposefully waited for a german decision before drawing up its own plans .
but on tuesday london announced it may impose less cuts on industry than slated in january - a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 - and return to a limit closer to the 16 percent committed to under the kyoto protocol . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ministers reach agreement in emissions fight germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions .

the reduction is only slight compared to the 488 million tons requested by environment minister jürgen trittin .
as a member of the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition , he had pushed hard for further emission reductions , arguing german industry needed to do more to fulfil its contribution to the kyoto protocol .
economics minister wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , unflinchingly resisted major emissions cuts .
further reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry at a time when it is trying to shake off economic stagnation , he insisted .
european goal the dispute between industry and environment is not unique to germany .
throughout the european union , member states are struggling to lay such disagreements to rest in order to submit plans for cutting emissions .
by midnight wednesday all 15 eu states must set their co2 limits and the distribution of reductions between industrial sectors , with ceilings set on a company-by-company basis .
the reductions are part of a two-prong strategy brussels has devised in order to meet its commitments to the kyoto protocol .
in addition to capping emissions from industry and utilities , the eu plans to launch an emissions trading system -lrb- ets -rrb- in january that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from those who have remained under their pollution cap and thus create an exchange across borders , where the greener industries would stand to profit economically through the sale of their credits .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 .
several major industrial states , including britain , france and belgium , have already said they will miss the march 31 deadline .
italy , too , has conceded it is uncertain whether it will have a list of its emissions limits ready by the eu deadline .
spain will ask the european commission for " understanding " for failing to meet the deadline as the country is undergoing a change of government .
" the picture we have today does n't say that january 1 -lrb- the start of ets -rrb- is in any danger - not at all , not yet , " ewa hedlund , the commission 's environment spokeswoman , told a news briefing .
" next week , we 'll have more detail on what we 've received and what action we are going to take , " she said referring to a possible " infringement letter " from the commission and impending legal action against those members who fail to supply the eu executive with their emissions plans .
waiting for germany ?
according to analysts , europe 's biggest polluters had held back on submitting their plans until germany handed over its limits .

after chancellor schröder settled a months-long cabinet dispute over greenhouse gas cuts , germany has submitted its plans for reducing carbon dioxide emissions to brussels .
other eu countries are much further behind . germany was n't the first country to hand in plans for curbing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions to the european commission - that honor went to finland .
but berlin was n't far behind .
considering the deeply entrenched dispute between industry and environmental groups , the fact that europe 's largest producer of greenhouse gases was among the first three to send its proposals for cutting the pollutants is surprising .
it was n't clear until late monday evening whether germany would be in a position to make wednesday 's eu deadline for emissions reductions plans .
only after chancellor gerhard schröder stepped in to broker a last-minute deal between the environment and economics ministers , was berlin able to put together a proposal worthy of sending to brussels .
germany calls for slight reduction just hours before the eu deadline ran out , germany 's cabinet passed a plan to cut industrial emissions of co2 from 505 million to 503 million tons per year by 2007 .

the judge , brigitte koppenhoefer , made the statement on wednesday , following a mid-trial review .
she said prosecutors had yet to prove that ackermann offered excessive bonuses amounting to bribes to the top executives at mannesmann in order to smooth over a takeover bid by vodaphone in early 2000 .

eu interior ministers have acheived partial success on controversial plans to create a europe-wide asylum policy .
human rights groups however remain troubled over the unresolved elements . eu interior ministers met in brussels on tuesday to make yet another effort to hammer out a europe-wide asylum policy .
the meeting took on an added sense of urgency with the ministers struggling to comply with a self-imposed may 1 deadline , the date on which ten new countries join the eu .
ending almost six years of acrimonious negotiations , they reached a partial breakthrough on key aspects of the legislation . the ministers agreed on a set of criteria establishing who can apply for asylum .
however , they could not agree on some procedural points determining how such requests should be handled .
certain aspects of the latter , including a proposed plan to allow for the deportation of asylum seekers to " safe " third countries , have come under heavy fire from human rights organizations .
the ministers will meet again at the end of april to take up the issue again , but according to the german interior minister otto schily , " it could be close " .
germany drops opposition to asylum criteria the breakthrough came after the german government dropped its long-standing opposition to a policy determining who is eligible to apply for asylum , specifically the recognition of asylum seekers who are fleeing non-state persecution , like men who are being pursued by drug cartels or women who face female genital mutilation .
the expected approval of a sweeping new immigration law in germany , which has led to a compromise on key issues between the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and the conservative christian democratic opposition , cleared the way for schily to adopt a more conciliatory tone .
under the rules agreed on tuesday , the eu will not only offer protection to people who are refugees according to the 1951 geneva convention , they will also offer so-called subsidiary protection to victims of non-state persecution .
human rights groups protest key points not good enough , say some human rights groups .
following the recent election of anti-immigration parties in several european countries , asylum policy remains a politically loaded and divisive issue .
human rights groups - citing the increasingly restrictive nature of the eu policies - have publicly objected to key aspects of the draft , namely the still unresolved questions over how asylum requests will be handled .
in an unprecedented move , several groups , including human rights watch , amnesty international , and the european council for refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , jointly called on the eu to scrap the agreement , claiming it violates international law .
at issue are two aspects of the proposed agreement .
the first deals with a suggestion in the directive on the use of a " safe country of origin " concept , which means the eu would compile a list of " safe countries " and asylum requests from persons originating from these countries would be considered illegitimate .
the second issue is a so-called " safe third county " concept , which means asylum seekers can be deported to a third country deemed safe .
neither was resolved at the meeting on tuesday and has been put off until the end of april .
" these proposals would deny some asylum seekers access to full and fair procedures , and it would transfer them to countries outside europe , " said ben ward of human rights watch .
" we 're deeply concerned that the eu is trying to get other countries to shoulder its responsibilities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum-seekers in hamburg daphne bouteillet paquet said the ministers should forget the proposals and start again .
" we feel we have no option but to call on the eu to scrap this proposal on asylum procedures , which has been shaped in reaction to populist pressures and fears whipped up about a non-existent flood of refugees into the eu , " she said .
schily rebuffs criticism schily responded to the human rights organization 's criticism , saying that the creation of a safe third country concept would allow the eu to avoid the processing costs associated with questionable claims , while those who are truly victims of oppression would be offered asylum .
the ministers will meet again on april 29 to resolve remaining concerns . dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no breakthrough yet on immigration law germany 's ruling social democrats and opposition conservatives thrashed out the details of long-debated immigration legislation on monday .

eu interior ministers have acheived partial success on controversial plans to create a europe-wide asylum policy .
human rights groups however remain troubled over the unresolved elements . eu interior ministers met in brussels on tuesday to make yet another effort to hammer out a europe-wide asylum policy .
the meeting took on an added sense of urgency with the ministers struggling to comply with a self-imposed may 1 deadline , the date on which ten new countries join the eu .
ending almost six years of acrimonious negotiations , they reached a partial breakthrough on key aspects of the legislation . the ministers agreed on a set of criteria establishing who can apply for asylum .
however , they could not agree on some procedural points determining how such requests should be handled .
certain aspects of the latter , including a proposed plan to allow for the deportation of asylum seekers to " safe " third countries , have come under heavy fire from human rights organizations .
the ministers will meet again at the end of april to take up the issue again , but according to the german interior minister otto schily , " it could be close " .
germany drops opposition to asylum criteria the breakthrough came after the german government dropped its long-standing opposition to a policy determining who is eligible to apply for asylum , specifically the recognition of asylum seekers who are fleeing non-state persecution , like men who are being pursued by drug cartels or women who face female genital mutilation .
the expected approval of a sweeping new immigration law in germany , which has led to a compromise on key issues between the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and the conservative christian democratic opposition , cleared the way for schily to adopt a more conciliatory tone .
under the rules agreed on tuesday , the eu will not only offer protection to people who are refugees according to the 1951 geneva convention , they will also offer so-called subsidiary protection to victims of non-state persecution .
human rights groups protest key points not good enough , say some human rights groups .
following the recent election of anti-immigration parties in several european countries , asylum policy remains a politically loaded and divisive issue .
human rights groups - citing the increasingly restrictive nature of the eu policies - have publicly objected to key aspects of the draft , namely the still unresolved questions over how asylum requests will be handled .
in an unprecedented move , several groups , including human rights watch , amnesty international , and the european council for refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , jointly called on the eu to scrap the agreement , claiming it violates international law .
at issue are two aspects of the proposed agreement .
the first deals with a suggestion in the directive on the use of a " safe country of origin " concept , which means the eu would compile a list of " safe countries " and asylum requests from persons originating from these countries would be considered illegitimate .
the second issue is a so-called " safe third county " concept , which means asylum seekers can be deported to a third country deemed safe .
neither was resolved at the meeting on tuesday and has been put off until the end of april .
" these proposals would deny some asylum seekers access to full and fair procedures , and it would transfer them to countries outside europe , " said ben ward of human rights watch .
" we 're deeply concerned that the eu is trying to get other countries to shoulder its responsibilities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum-seekers in hamburg daphne bouteillet paquet said the ministers should forget the proposals and start again .
" we feel we have no option but to call on the eu to scrap this proposal on asylum procedures , which has been shaped in reaction to populist pressures and fears whipped up about a non-existent flood of refugees into the eu , " she said .
schily rebuffs criticism schily responded to the human rights organization 's criticism , saying that the creation of a safe third country concept would allow the eu to avoid the processing costs associated with questionable claims , while those who are truly victims of oppression would be offered asylum .

on wednesday , international leaders will meet in berlin to take stock of rebuilding efforts in afghanistan .
reconstruction financing and a booming opium trade remain major challenges . afghan leader hamid karzai and his trademark head covering will take center stage in berlin on wednesday , when 54 nations meet to analyze the progress and problems in afghanistan three years after the fall of the taliban . karzai , in the german capital on tuesday , highlighted his country 's battle with drug lords and dwindling financial resources as the major talking points at the two-day conference , which will be attended by u.s. secretary of state colin powell . " we will be asking -lrb- the international community -rrb- to increase their assistance to afghanistan in order for all of us to succeed in bringing about a safer , better , standing-on-its-own-feet afghanistan , " karzai told reporters after meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder , according to reuters . germany ready for the long haul the afghan leader has already picked up important pledges from german officials .
schröder , whose country has 1,900 peacekeeping troops in kabul and the northern city of kunduz , said germany was prepared to stay in the war-torn country for the long haul . bildunterschrift : schröder and karzai met on tuesday , on the eve of the two-day conference . germany has provided roughly € 80 million -lrb- $ 97 million -rrb- in aid each year since 2002 .
on wednesday , german officials are expected to announce that they will continue their aid program until 2008 . the united states , the biggest donor ahead of germany and japan , will most likely offer $ 1 billion on top of the $ 1.2 billion it has already pledged this year .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said tuesday that the leading donor countries hope other countries will pledge more aid . afghan leaders estimate that $ 27.5 billion is needed over the next seven years for reconstruction .
donors worldwide have so far pledged $ 4.2 billion through 2004 . " we obviously hope we will gather as large a sum as possible , " fischer told reporters . afghan opium flooding world markets not only financial woes , but the country 's growing drug problem are likely to be major discussion points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poppy field in afghanistan far more lucrative than wheat fields and growable even in the substandard afghani soil , experts estimate opium production makes up roughly half of the country 's € 4.4 billion gross domestic product and poses a significant security problem . " through that , warlords and terrorist finance themselves , " says general rick hillier , who commands the nato stability force in the region .
" that means they lag even more in giving up power to the central government . " most of the opium produced in afghanistan ends up in european markets as heroin , according to the un drugs authority .
as a result , governments have been more open recently to helping the afghan government , suggesting crop alternatives for farmers and pledging to invest in sectors that will create more jobs . isaf troops not ready to fight drug trade problems remain .
the international security assistance force has so far refused to involve itself in the fight against drug production and smuggling , leaving an ill-equipped afghan police force and army to fend for themselves .
in the past year , a few kilos of heroin have fallen into afghan law enforcement 's hands .
that 's a drop in the bucket compared to the estimated 3,600 tons of opium that left the country last year , according to un drug authorities . " the fight against drugs is the fight for afghanistan , " karzai said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern alliance fighters afghan police plan a major offensive in the coming weeks to burn 75 percent of the poppy fields in three afghan provinces .
the offensive will later be extended to all 32 provinces .
the u.s. government has pledged $ 40 million exclusively for creating and financing anti-drug troop units . but karzai said alternatives need to be found for the farmers , who make far more money producing opium poppies , the raw material for heroin , than any other crop . speaking before a roomful of business people on tuesday , including representatives of the world bank , karzai pushed raisins and saffron as possible options for weaning farmers off of drug production .
" if we want to have afghanistan , " said karzai .
" we must fight drugs .

on wednesday , international leaders will meet in berlin to take stock of rebuilding efforts in afghanistan .
reconstruction financing and a booming opium trade remain major challenges . afghan leader hamid karzai and his trademark head covering will take center stage in berlin on wednesday , when 54 nations meet to analyze the progress and problems in afghanistan three years after the fall of the taliban . karzai , in the german capital on tuesday , highlighted his country 's battle with drug lords and dwindling financial resources as the major talking points at the two-day conference , which will be attended by u.s. secretary of state colin powell . " we will be asking -lrb- the international community -rrb- to increase their assistance to afghanistan in order for all of us to succeed in bringing about a safer , better , standing-on-its-own-feet afghanistan , " karzai told reporters after meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder , according to reuters . germany ready for the long haul the afghan leader has already picked up important pledges from german officials .
schröder , whose country has 1,900 peacekeeping troops in kabul and the northern city of kunduz , said germany was prepared to stay in the war-torn country for the long haul . bildunterschrift : schröder and karzai met on tuesday , on the eve of the two-day conference . germany has provided roughly € 80 million -lrb- $ 97 million -rrb- in aid each year since 2002 .
on wednesday , german officials are expected to announce that they will continue their aid program until 2008 . the united states , the biggest donor ahead of germany and japan , will most likely offer $ 1 billion on top of the $ 1.2 billion it has already pledged this year .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said tuesday that the leading donor countries hope other countries will pledge more aid . afghan leaders estimate that $ 27.5 billion is needed over the next seven years for reconstruction .
donors worldwide have so far pledged $ 4.2 billion through 2004 . " we obviously hope we will gather as large a sum as possible , " fischer told reporters . afghan opium flooding world markets not only financial woes , but the country 's growing drug problem are likely to be major discussion points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poppy field in afghanistan far more lucrative than wheat fields and growable even in the substandard afghani soil , experts estimate opium production makes up roughly half of the country 's € 4.4 billion gross domestic product and poses a significant security problem . " through that , warlords and terrorist finance themselves , " says general rick hillier , who commands the nato stability force in the region .
" that means they lag even more in giving up power to the central government . " most of the opium produced in afghanistan ends up in european markets as heroin , according to the un drugs authority .
as a result , governments have been more open recently to helping the afghan government , suggesting crop alternatives for farmers and pledging to invest in sectors that will create more jobs . isaf troops not ready to fight drug trade problems remain .
the international security assistance force has so far refused to involve itself in the fight against drug production and smuggling , leaving an ill-equipped afghan police force and army to fend for themselves .
in the past year , a few kilos of heroin have fallen into afghan law enforcement 's hands .
that 's a drop in the bucket compared to the estimated 3,600 tons of opium that left the country last year , according to un drug authorities . " the fight against drugs is the fight for afghanistan , " karzai said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern alliance fighters afghan police plan a major offensive in the coming weeks to burn 75 percent of the poppy fields in three afghan provinces .
the offensive will later be extended to all 32 provinces .
the u.s. government has pledged $ 40 million exclusively for creating and financing anti-drug troop units . but karzai said alternatives need to be found for the farmers , who make far more money producing opium poppies , the raw material for heroin , than any other crop . speaking before a roomful of business people on tuesday , including representatives of the world bank , karzai pushed raisins and saffron as possible options for weaning farmers off of drug production .

on wednesday , international leaders will meet in berlin to take stock of rebuilding efforts in afghanistan .
reconstruction financing and a booming opium trade remain major challenges . afghan leader hamid karzai and his trademark head covering will take center stage in berlin on wednesday , when 54 nations meet to analyze the progress and problems in afghanistan three years after the fall of the taliban . karzai , in the german capital on tuesday , highlighted his country 's battle with drug lords and dwindling financial resources as the major talking points at the two-day conference , which will be attended by u.s. secretary of state colin powell . " we will be asking -lrb- the international community -rrb- to increase their assistance to afghanistan in order for all of us to succeed in bringing about a safer , better , standing-on-its-own-feet afghanistan , " karzai told reporters after meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder , according to reuters . germany ready for the long haul the afghan leader has already picked up important pledges from german officials .
schröder , whose country has 1,900 peacekeeping troops in kabul and the northern city of kunduz , said germany was prepared to stay in the war-torn country for the long haul . bildunterschrift : schröder and karzai met on tuesday , on the eve of the two-day conference . germany has provided roughly € 80 million -lrb- $ 97 million -rrb- in aid each year since 2002 .
on wednesday , german officials are expected to announce that they will continue their aid program until 2008 . the united states , the biggest donor ahead of germany and japan , will most likely offer $ 1 billion on top of the $ 1.2 billion it has already pledged this year .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said tuesday that the leading donor countries hope other countries will pledge more aid . afghan leaders estimate that $ 27.5 billion is needed over the next seven years for reconstruction .
donors worldwide have so far pledged $ 4.2 billion through 2004 . " we obviously hope we will gather as large a sum as possible , " fischer told reporters . afghan opium flooding world markets not only financial woes , but the country 's growing drug problem are likely to be major discussion points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poppy field in afghanistan far more lucrative than wheat fields and growable even in the substandard afghani soil , experts estimate opium production makes up roughly half of the country 's € 4.4 billion gross domestic product and poses a significant security problem . " through that , warlords and terrorist finance themselves , " says general rick hillier , who commands the nato stability force in the region .
" that means they lag even more in giving up power to the central government . " most of the opium produced in afghanistan ends up in european markets as heroin , according to the un drugs authority .

just weeks before entering into what has - until now - been western europe 's most exclusive club , a small polish town has decided its coat of arms needs to comply with western beauty standards . when the coastal town of ustka was mulling over ways to improve its image , talk turned to the mermaid on the city 's coat of arms .
looking a little plump around the edges , town officials apparently felt their mermaid was n't exactly in line with western beauty standards - and this with their country just weeks from joining the european union .
" one female councilor said jokingly that the mermaid 's breasts were too small and that she was a bit fat , " a town spokesman told reuters .
what began as a joke soon became a national story , prompting the town to examine the idea a little more closely .
their remedy : an immediate dieting plan and some serious plastic surgery around the chest area , according to the spokesman .
" she will become more attractive and ustka will gain publicity , " said the spokesman .

europe 's new counter-terrorism chief gijs de vries reported to work this week amid enduring questions over the exact nature of his work and his plans to keep europe safe . gijs de vries , a relatively low-profile former dutch interior minister and member of the european parliament , was appointed europe 's first " anti-terrorism czar " last week .
the post , created amid a surge of european unity following the madrid bombings and after years of talks on the necessity of such a position , is a strong sign that european anti-terrorism efforts have taken on a new urgency .
introduced at a packed news briefing in brussels on tuesday this week , the eu 's new counter-terorism chief has attracted much attention .
but by his second day on the job , otto schily , germany 's interior minister - who was in brussels for a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers - was asking for further clarification of de vries ' new duties and his future plans .
indeed , the appointment of this experienced yet relatively unknown european politician has left many raising the same questions .
an experienced european technocrat the 48-year-old gijs de vries was born in new york and has a respected career in european politics behind him .
de vries served as a liberal member of the european parliament for fourteen years , before taking the position of interior minister in the netherlands .
the dual u.s.-dutch citizen is fluent in several languages , including french , german and english , and he holds degrees from the university of leiden and the european university institute in florence , italy .
though de vries has relatively little experience in security and intelligence matters , which has given some commentators food for thought , he is described by others as an experienced technocrat .
de vries will have to call upon all of his faculties , which include a diplomatic and businesslike manner as well as extensive political knowledge , to implement the task he has been charged with : helping to safeguard europe 's security in an ever-more insecure world .
officially , de vries will be responsible for seeing that the various government bodies of eu member states and eu institutions in brussels work together to pool resources and intelligence .
namely , he has been charged with what romano prodi , the president of the european commission , has described as " breaking down the cultural obstacles to cooperation " .
what 's more , de vries can use his position to apply political pressure to eu members who lag behind in implementing the anti-terror measures that have already been agreed upon .
de vries has already promised to improve cooperation between european countries .
' ' terror is not just the concern of an intelligence agency in one nation , so the information gained must be shared by all nations , " he said .
a higher profile in the coming months how this still somewhat vague job description will translate into action remains to be seen during the coming months .
de vries ' plans will become more apparent in june , when he presents more specific proposals to eu heads of state at the next eu-wide summit in june .
but in his first days on the job , de vries has made some statements indicating his position on certain key issues .
notably , while pushing for the better exchange of resources and analysis , de vries said that increased efforts to fight terror in europe can not forfeit civil liberties .
" there can never be , in any society , a guarantee of 100 percent security , " de vries told reporters on tuesday after meeting with his boss , javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief . " we are living in an open society in europe , an open society in which people can enjoy many liberties , " he added .

europe 's new counter-terrorism chief gijs de vries reported to work this week amid enduring questions over the exact nature of his work and his plans to keep europe safe . gijs de vries , a relatively low-profile former dutch interior minister and member of the european parliament , was appointed europe 's first " anti-terrorism czar " last week .
the post , created amid a surge of european unity following the madrid bombings and after years of talks on the necessity of such a position , is a strong sign that european anti-terrorism efforts have taken on a new urgency .
introduced at a packed news briefing in brussels on tuesday this week , the eu 's new counter-terorism chief has attracted much attention .
but by his second day on the job , otto schily , germany 's interior minister - who was in brussels for a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers - was asking for further clarification of de vries ' new duties and his future plans .
indeed , the appointment of this experienced yet relatively unknown european politician has left many raising the same questions .
an experienced european technocrat the 48-year-old gijs de vries was born in new york and has a respected career in european politics behind him .
de vries served as a liberal member of the european parliament for fourteen years , before taking the position of interior minister in the netherlands .
the dual u.s.-dutch citizen is fluent in several languages , including french , german and english , and he holds degrees from the university of leiden and the european university institute in florence , italy .
though de vries has relatively little experience in security and intelligence matters , which has given some commentators food for thought , he is described by others as an experienced technocrat .
de vries will have to call upon all of his faculties , which include a diplomatic and businesslike manner as well as extensive political knowledge , to implement the task he has been charged with : helping to safeguard europe 's security in an ever-more insecure world .
officially , de vries will be responsible for seeing that the various government bodies of eu member states and eu institutions in brussels work together to pool resources and intelligence .
namely , he has been charged with what romano prodi , the president of the european commission , has described as " breaking down the cultural obstacles to cooperation " .
what 's more , de vries can use his position to apply political pressure to eu members who lag behind in implementing the anti-terror measures that have already been agreed upon .
de vries has already promised to improve cooperation between european countries .
' ' terror is not just the concern of an intelligence agency in one nation , so the information gained must be shared by all nations , " he said .
a higher profile in the coming months how this still somewhat vague job description will translate into action remains to be seen during the coming months .
de vries ' plans will become more apparent in june , when he presents more specific proposals to eu heads of state at the next eu-wide summit in june .
but in his first days on the job , de vries has made some statements indicating his position on certain key issues .
notably , while pushing for the better exchange of resources and analysis , de vries said that increased efforts to fight terror in europe can not forfeit civil liberties .
" there can never be , in any society , a guarantee of 100 percent security , " de vries told reporters on tuesday after meeting with his boss , javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief . " we are living in an open society in europe , an open society in which people can enjoy many liberties , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.03.2004 bertelsmann plans asia push großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's biggest media company wants to become a household name in asia despite a global slump on the advertising and music market , europe ’ s biggest media group , germany-based bertelsmann , is looking towards black ink and a major expansion in asia this year . earlier this year bertelsmann chairman gunter thielen traveled to china , india and vietnam to explore business opportunities there .
by the time he returned , he had made up his mind : europe ’ s biggest media group must immediately boost its position on the asian markets in order to profit from the dynamic growth in the region .
in china and india , bertelsmann has already set up shop . in the beijing region , for example , the group has already brought in 1.5 million members for its chinese-language book club .
and that 's only the beginning .
a million served bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gunter thielen " our team currently sells 20 million books in china , " thielen said tuesday at the company 's board meeting .
" that ’ s the same amount of books as we sell in france .
the turnover , however , is only a tenth in china , because there a book costs $ 1.5 while it costs $ 15 in france .
that ’ s the big difference and the reason for this is that the chinese market is still being regulated , " thielen said . " but once that starts changing , the prices will increase and so will our turnover .
in a long term perspective of 10 or 15 years , we will multiply our sales in asia and at some point it will represent at least 10 percent of our revenues , " he added .
the company still has a long way to go .
of its approximately € 17 billion in revenues last year , just € 2 billion came from sales in asia .
with a string of new investments , bertelsmann is seeking to increase its market share .
in china , bertelsmann wants to invest heavily in printing and publishing houses .
" we will stay away from the music sector , " he said .
" the bootleg system is so sophisticated in china , you can purchase a disc for $ 1 at any corner there .
that ’ s why it doesn ’ t make sense for us to produce discs in china . "
a fast growing market in india , bertelsmann ’ s random house publishing arm , as well as the printing subsidiary arvato , is already active .
still , business there is only just starting for the media group and the future looks promising , as india currently has growth rates of 7-8 percent per year - nearly comparable to those in china .
both are markets that bring euros to the eyes of bertelsmann managers .
" together they have a population of 2.4 billion people thus representing a third of the world population , " he said .
" this must become a market one day .
of course if you compare these countries to america , they are still dwarfs .
but if you look at their growth rates it ’ s clear that we must closely watch these markets .
and i am positive that we will increasingly position ourselves there . "
today the media giant only makes 3 percent of its turnover in asia , that ’ s around € 600 million per year .
and only 1 percent - about € 200 million - are being earned in eastern europe , which bertelsmann also views as a promising market for its television , publishing and printing operations .
currently , germany remains one of bertelsmann 's most important markets .
a third of the company 's overall turnover is made here , with 40 percent coming from the rest of europe and 25 percent in the united states and canada .
only 3 percent of revenues are currently derived from its asian units .
preparing for a mega-merger the company 's book publishing division , based in new york , is the market leader in the united states and britain .
new york is also the headquarters for its worldwide music business , which will soon be merging with sony 's music operations .
with a world music market share of approximately 12 percent , bertelsmann is expected to be the dominant partner in the joint venture .
last year , bertelsmann artists including britney spears and justin timberlake won 22 grammy awards .
and the company 's gruner + jahr magazine publishing division , the market leader in germany and france and a strong presence in the u.s. , is planning on introducing 20 new glossy magazines around the world . dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a victory for the old in berlin with the opening of bertelsmann ’ s new berlin headquarters and plans to reconstruct hohenzollern palace , someday , germany 's capital is looking back to the future .

of its approximately € 17 billion in revenues last year , just € 2 billion came from sales in asia .
with a string of new investments , bertelsmann is seeking to increase its market share .
in china , bertelsmann wants to invest heavily in printing and publishing houses .
" we will stay away from the music sector , " he said .
" the bootleg system is so sophisticated in china , you can purchase a disc for $ 1 at any corner there .
that ’ s why it doesn ’ t make sense for us to produce discs in china . "
a fast growing market in india , bertelsmann ’ s random house publishing arm , as well as the printing subsidiary arvato , is already active .
still , business there is only just starting for the media group and the future looks promising , as india currently has growth rates of 7-8 percent per year - nearly comparable to those in china .

" together they have a population of 2.4 billion people thus representing a third of the world population , " he said .
" this must become a market one day .
of course if you compare these countries to america , they are still dwarfs .
but if you look at their growth rates it ’ s clear that we must closely watch these markets .
and i am positive that we will increasingly position ourselves there . "
today the media giant only makes 3 percent of its turnover in asia , that ’ s around € 600 million per year .
and only 1 percent - about € 200 million - are being earned in eastern europe , which bertelsmann also views as a promising market for its television , publishing and printing operations .
currently , germany remains one of bertelsmann 's most important markets .
a third of the company 's overall turnover is made here , with 40 percent coming from the rest of europe and 25 percent in the united states and canada .
only 3 percent of revenues are currently derived from its asian units .
preparing for a mega-merger the company 's book publishing division , based in new york , is the market leader in the united states and britain .
new york is also the headquarters for its worldwide music business , which will soon be merging with sony 's music operations .
with a world music market share of approximately 12 percent , bertelsmann is expected to be the dominant partner in the joint venture .
last year , bertelsmann artists including britney spears and justin timberlake won 22 grammy awards .

by the time he returned , he had made up his mind : europe ’ s biggest media group must immediately boost its position on the asian markets in order to profit from the dynamic growth in the region .
in china and india , bertelsmann has already set up shop . in the beijing region , for example , the group has already brought in 1.5 million members for its chinese-language book club .
and that 's only the beginning .
a million served bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gunter thielen " our team currently sells 20 million books in china , " thielen said tuesday at the company 's board meeting .
" that ’ s the same amount of books as we sell in france .
the turnover , however , is only a tenth in china , because there a book costs $ 1.5 while it costs $ 15 in france .
that ’ s the big difference and the reason for this is that the chinese market is still being regulated , " thielen said . " but once that starts changing , the prices will increase and so will our turnover .
in a long term perspective of 10 or 15 years , we will multiply our sales in asia and at some point it will represent at least 10 percent of our revenues , " he added .
the company still has a long way to go .
of its approximately € 17 billion in revenues last year , just € 2 billion came from sales in asia .
with a string of new investments , bertelsmann is seeking to increase its market share .
in china , bertelsmann wants to invest heavily in printing and publishing houses .
" we will stay away from the music sector , " he said .
" the bootleg system is so sophisticated in china , you can purchase a disc for $ 1 at any corner there .
that ’ s why it doesn ’ t make sense for us to produce discs in china . "
a fast growing market in india , bertelsmann ’ s random house publishing arm , as well as the printing subsidiary arvato , is already active .
still , business there is only just starting for the media group and the future looks promising , as india currently has growth rates of 7-8 percent per year - nearly comparable to those in china .
both are markets that bring euros to the eyes of bertelsmann managers .
" together they have a population of 2.4 billion people thus representing a third of the world population , " he said .
" this must become a market one day .
of course if you compare these countries to america , they are still dwarfs .
but if you look at their growth rates it ’ s clear that we must closely watch these markets .
and i am positive that we will increasingly position ourselves there . "
today the media giant only makes 3 percent of its turnover in asia , that ’ s around € 600 million per year .
and only 1 percent - about € 200 million - are being earned in eastern europe , which bertelsmann also views as a promising market for its television , publishing and printing operations .
currently , germany remains one of bertelsmann 's most important markets .
a third of the company 's overall turnover is made here , with 40 percent coming from the rest of europe and 25 percent in the united states and canada .
only 3 percent of revenues are currently derived from its asian units .
preparing for a mega-merger the company 's book publishing division , based in new york , is the market leader in the united states and britain .
new york is also the headquarters for its worldwide music business , which will soon be merging with sony 's music operations .
with a world music market share of approximately 12 percent , bertelsmann is expected to be the dominant partner in the joint venture .
last year , bertelsmann artists including britney spears and justin timberlake won 22 grammy awards .
and the company 's gruner + jahr magazine publishing division , the market leader in germany and france and a strong presence in the u.s. , is planning on introducing 20 new glossy magazines around the world . dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a victory for the old in berlin with the opening of bertelsmann ’ s new berlin headquarters and plans to reconstruct hohenzollern palace , someday , germany 's capital is looking back to the future .

after chancellor schröder settled a months-long cabinet dispute over greenhouse gas cuts , germany has submitted its plans for reducing carbon dioxide emissions to brussels .
other eu countries are much further behind . germany was n't the first country to hand in plans for curbing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions to the european commission - that honor went to finland .
but berlin was n't far behind .
considering the deeply entrenched dispute between industry and environmental groups , the fact that europe 's largest producer of greenhouse gases was among the first three to send its proposals for cutting the pollutants is surprising .
it was n't clear until late monday evening whether germany would be in a position to make wednesday 's eu deadline for emissions reductions plans .
only after chancellor gerhard schröder stepped in to broker a last-minute deal between the environment and economics ministers , was berlin able to put together a proposal worthy of sending to brussels .
germany calls for slight reduction just hours before the eu deadline ran out , germany 's cabinet passed a plan to cut industrial emissions of co2 from 505 million to 503 million tons per year by 2007 .
in a second phase , emissions are set to be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 .
the carbon caps are part of germany 's strategy to cut its greenhouse gases by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 .
the reduction is only slight compared to the 488 million tons requested by environment minister jürgen trittin .
as a member of the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition , he had pushed hard for further emission reductions , arguing german industry needed to do more to fulfil its contribution to the kyoto protocol .
economics minister wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , unflinchingly resisted major emissions cuts .
further reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry at a time when it is trying to shake off economic stagnation , he insisted .
european goal the dispute between industry and environment is not unique to germany .
throughout the european union , member states are struggling to lay such disagreements to rest in order to submit plans for cutting emissions .
by midnight wednesday all 15 eu states must set their co2 limits and the distribution of reductions between industrial sectors , with ceilings set on a company-by-company basis .
the reductions are part of a two-prong strategy brussels has devised in order to meet its commitments to the kyoto protocol .
in addition to capping emissions from industry and utilities , the eu plans to launch an emissions trading system -lrb- ets -rrb- in january that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from those who have remained under their pollution cap and thus create an exchange across borders , where the greener industries would stand to profit economically through the sale of their credits .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 .
several major industrial states , including britain , france and belgium , have already said they will miss the march 31 deadline .
italy , too , has conceded it is uncertain whether it will have a list of its emissions limits ready by the eu deadline .
spain will ask the european commission for " understanding " for failing to meet the deadline as the country is undergoing a change of government .
" the picture we have today does n't say that january 1 -lrb- the start of ets -rrb- is in any danger - not at all , not yet , " ewa hedlund , the commission 's environment spokeswoman , told a news briefing .
" next week , we 'll have more detail on what we 've received and what action we are going to take , " she said referring to a possible " infringement letter " from the commission and impending legal action against those members who fail to supply the eu executive with their emissions plans .
waiting for germany ?
according to analysts , europe 's biggest polluters had held back on submitting their plans until germany handed over its limits .
as the largest producer of co2 emissions , germany 's reduction rate dominated discussion in several capitals .
" germany is important , " john molloy of the brokerage firm tfs in london told german wire service dpa .
" great britain was the strictest up until now in terms of restriction , but they ca n't hold onto that position when everyone else is more lenient and risk jeopardizing the british industry . "
britain has denied it had purposefully waited for a german decision before drawing up its own plans .
but on tuesday london announced it may impose less cuts on industry than slated in january - a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 - and return to a limit closer to the 16 percent committed to under the kyoto protocol . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ministers reach agreement in emissions fight germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions .

the judge , brigitte koppenhoefer , made the statement on wednesday , following a mid-trial review .
she said prosecutors had yet to prove that ackermann offered excessive bonuses amounting to bribes to the top executives at mannesmann in order to smooth over a takeover bid by vodaphone in early 2000 .
koppenhoefer said there was not enough evidence to support the central criminal charge of breach of trust to shareholders , though there was some evidence of lesser violations of share law .
the trial , which has been underway for two months , will continue . more briefs 31.03.2004 -pipe- siemens plays hard ball with unions 31.03.2004 -pipe- eu warns germany over " vw law " 30.03.2004 -pipe- eu warns germany over parmesan knockoffs 30.03.2004 -pipe- deutsche bank rules out friendly merger 30.03.2004 -pipe- bertelsmann plans major acquisitions 29.03.2004 -pipe- no more stock options for telekom brass 29.03.2004 -pipe- german consumer confidence stays low 26.03.2004 -pipe- german business confidence dips in march 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

europe 's new counter-terrorism chief gijs de vries reported to work this week amid enduring questions over the exact nature of his work and his plans to keep europe safe . gijs de vries , a relatively low-profile former dutch interior minister and member of the european parliament , was appointed europe 's first " anti-terrorism czar " last week .
the post , created amid a surge of european unity following the madrid bombings and after years of talks on the necessity of such a position , is a strong sign that european anti-terrorism efforts have taken on a new urgency .
introduced at a packed news briefing in brussels on tuesday this week , the eu 's new counter-terorism chief has attracted much attention .
but by his second day on the job , otto schily , germany 's interior minister - who was in brussels for a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers - was asking for further clarification of de vries ' new duties and his future plans .
indeed , the appointment of this experienced yet relatively unknown european politician has left many raising the same questions .
an experienced european technocrat the 48-year-old gijs de vries was born in new york and has a respected career in european politics behind him .
de vries served as a liberal member of the european parliament for fourteen years , before taking the position of interior minister in the netherlands .
the dual u.s.-dutch citizen is fluent in several languages , including french , german and english , and he holds degrees from the university of leiden and the european university institute in florence , italy .
though de vries has relatively little experience in security and intelligence matters , which has given some commentators food for thought , he is described by others as an experienced technocrat .
de vries will have to call upon all of his faculties , which include a diplomatic and businesslike manner as well as extensive political knowledge , to implement the task he has been charged with : helping to safeguard europe 's security in an ever-more insecure world .
officially , de vries will be responsible for seeing that the various government bodies of eu member states and eu institutions in brussels work together to pool resources and intelligence .
namely , he has been charged with what romano prodi , the president of the european commission , has described as " breaking down the cultural obstacles to cooperation " .
what 's more , de vries can use his position to apply political pressure to eu members who lag behind in implementing the anti-terror measures that have already been agreed upon .
de vries has already promised to improve cooperation between european countries .
' ' terror is not just the concern of an intelligence agency in one nation , so the information gained must be shared by all nations , " he said .
a higher profile in the coming months how this still somewhat vague job description will translate into action remains to be seen during the coming months .
de vries ' plans will become more apparent in june , when he presents more specific proposals to eu heads of state at the next eu-wide summit in june .
but in his first days on the job , de vries has made some statements indicating his position on certain key issues .
notably , while pushing for the better exchange of resources and analysis , de vries said that increased efforts to fight terror in europe can not forfeit civil liberties .
" there can never be , in any society , a guarantee of 100 percent security , " de vries told reporters on tuesday after meeting with his boss , javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief . " we are living in an open society in europe , an open society in which people can enjoy many liberties , " he added .

europe 's new counter-terrorism chief gijs de vries reported to work this week amid enduring questions over the exact nature of his work and his plans to keep europe safe . gijs de vries , a relatively low-profile former dutch interior minister and member of the european parliament , was appointed europe 's first " anti-terrorism czar " last week .
the post , created amid a surge of european unity following the madrid bombings and after years of talks on the necessity of such a position , is a strong sign that european anti-terrorism efforts have taken on a new urgency .
introduced at a packed news briefing in brussels on tuesday this week , the eu 's new counter-terorism chief has attracted much attention .
but by his second day on the job , otto schily , germany 's interior minister - who was in brussels for a meeting of eu justice and interior ministers - was asking for further clarification of de vries ' new duties and his future plans .
indeed , the appointment of this experienced yet relatively unknown european politician has left many raising the same questions .
an experienced european technocrat the 48-year-old gijs de vries was born in new york and has a respected career in european politics behind him .
de vries served as a liberal member of the european parliament for fourteen years , before taking the position of interior minister in the netherlands .
the dual u.s.-dutch citizen is fluent in several languages , including french , german and english , and he holds degrees from the university of leiden and the european university institute in florence , italy .
though de vries has relatively little experience in security and intelligence matters , which has given some commentators food for thought , he is described by others as an experienced technocrat .
de vries will have to call upon all of his faculties , which include a diplomatic and businesslike manner as well as extensive political knowledge , to implement the task he has been charged with : helping to safeguard europe 's security in an ever-more insecure world .
officially , de vries will be responsible for seeing that the various government bodies of eu member states and eu institutions in brussels work together to pool resources and intelligence .
namely , he has been charged with what romano prodi , the president of the european commission , has described as " breaking down the cultural obstacles to cooperation " .
what 's more , de vries can use his position to apply political pressure to eu members who lag behind in implementing the anti-terror measures that have already been agreed upon .
de vries has already promised to improve cooperation between european countries .
' ' terror is not just the concern of an intelligence agency in one nation , so the information gained must be shared by all nations , " he said .
a higher profile in the coming months how this still somewhat vague job description will translate into action remains to be seen during the coming months .
de vries ' plans will become more apparent in june , when he presents more specific proposals to eu heads of state at the next eu-wide summit in june .
but in his first days on the job , de vries has made some statements indicating his position on certain key issues .
notably , while pushing for the better exchange of resources and analysis , de vries said that increased efforts to fight terror in europe can not forfeit civil liberties .
" there can never be , in any society , a guarantee of 100 percent security , " de vries told reporters on tuesday after meeting with his boss , javier solana , the eu foreign policy chief . " we are living in an open society in europe , an open society in which people can enjoy many liberties , " he added .
" it is important to preserve those liberties , to build on them . " dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops agenda at eu summit european union leaders arrived in brussels on thursday for their annual spring summit .

the third international conference on afghanistan opened in berlin on wednesday with an inaugural speech by german chancellor schröder promising more financial aid to the war-torn country . german chancellor gerhard schröder opened the afghanistan conference in berlin on wednesday by pledging to afghan president hamid karzai that the international community would not abandon his country , one of the world 's poorest and the biggest opium supplier . karzai , who was seated next to the chancellor at the top table , which also included the u.n. afghanistan envoy jean arnault , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and the foreign ministers of britain , china , germany , pakistan and russia , listened intently as schröder delivered his opening speech . " a peaceful afghanistan is an anchor for greater political stability in the region and a sign of hope for us all , " schröder told the assembled dignitaries and press .
" it is proof that it is worth fighting against terror and violence . " the two-day conference is the third such international meeting on afghanistan since the end of the u.s.-led war .

" the positive developments in afghanistan show what can be achieved when we combine our efforts , " he said .
" every success that we score in bringing afghanistan on a path towards more freedom and security is not only progress for people in the country .
it is a success for us all . " in his speech later in the day , karzai said his country had come a long way since the fall of the taliban , with a constitution that reflected a desire to be partners with the international community and no longer " threatened by drugs and terrorism . " " what we have achieved is very promising , but let me be frank and say that the reconstruction has only begun , " karzai told the gathering . federal government extends financial aid bildunterschrift : on the subject of financial assistance , schröder vowed that germany would contribute € 320 million -lrb- $ 389.5 million -rrb- over the next four years to boost the reconstruction process in afghanistan .
the amount of financial aid by the german government since september 2001 will eventually total € 7.4 billion . sadako ogata , japan 's envoy to afghanistan , followed schröder 's lead by pledging $ 400 million -lrb- € 328.6 million -rrb- over the next two years .
" i am pleased to announce that japan is prepared to make further grant assistance amounting to $ 400 million over the coming two years , which brings japan 's contribution since september 2001 to over $ 1 billion , " she said .
earlier this month , japan said its financial assistance to afghanistan had reached $ 683 million , exceeding an initial pledge of $ 500 million . reconstruction funds a priority before the conference began , officials from participating countries and organizations spoke hopefully of raising $ 4 billion after afghan ministers called for more direct aid and investment .
afghan finance minister ashraf ghani told the handelsblatt business daily on tuesday that he was content with the international commitment so far , but more was necessary . he said earlier this month that $ 27.5 billion would be needed in the next seven years and previous promises " vastly underestimated " afghanistan 's needs . reconstruction minister amin farhang added in an interview with germany 's inforadio that he hoped the promised money would go directly to the kabul government instead of mainly to non-governmental organizations .
farhang told the radio station that afghanistan needed around $ 4.5 billion for this year , which would help train the afghan army and police force to tackle the rampant drugs problem controlled largely by influential provincial warlords . germany 's pledge of more financial aid came hours after u.s. secretary of state colin powell praised german efforts in aiding afghanistan . powell praises german efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : powell praised german efforts .

the third international conference on afghanistan opened in berlin on wednesday with an inaugural speech by german chancellor schröder promising more financial aid to the war-torn country . german chancellor gerhard schröder opened the afghanistan conference in berlin on wednesday by pledging to afghan president hamid karzai that the international community would not abandon his country , one of the world 's poorest and the biggest opium supplier . karzai , who was seated next to the chancellor at the top table , which also included the u.n. afghanistan envoy jean arnault , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and the foreign ministers of britain , china , germany , pakistan and russia , listened intently as schröder delivered his opening speech . " a peaceful afghanistan is an anchor for greater political stability in the region and a sign of hope for us all , " schröder told the assembled dignitaries and press .

" the positive developments in afghanistan show what can be achieved when we combine our efforts , " he said .
" every success that we score in bringing afghanistan on a path towards more freedom and security is not only progress for people in the country .
it is a success for us all . " in his speech later in the day , karzai said his country had come a long way since the fall of the taliban , with a constitution that reflected a desire to be partners with the international community and no longer " threatened by drugs and terrorism .

a member of the european parliament has accused hundreds of his colleagues of pocketing allowances for parliamentary sessions they have not attended .
the parliament says it could investigate as many as 200 members . hans-peter martin told germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper on monday that he has collected detailed records over the past two years that show that many of his colleagues in the european parliament habitually enter their names in the parliamentary register , but then skip meetings .
for signing the register , based on the understanding that they attend the sessions , members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- receive a € 262 -lrb- $ 320 -rrb- per diem .
martin , an mep from austria , claimed many either sign the register , which is accessible between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. , before flying home or send " front men " to sign on their behalf .
he said he had discovered 7,200 instances of fraud through what he alleged were forged per diem claims and attendance records to claim expenses .
wide-spread abuse ?
" brussel 's enormous expense system is being abused , " he said , " especially when delegates come in early , quickly sign in and then leave the city . "
martin also claimed that a favorite practice among meps has been to take an evening flight to brussels , sign the register before 10 p.m. , sign again the following day and attend a session before signing again the next morning and flying home .
this would earn them around € 795 in supplements on top of travel costs and the usual salary for spending just one session in parliament .
-lrb- meps are given salaries that are equivalent to those of members of their national parliaments and can range anywhere from just over € 2,000 a month to nearly € 10,000 .
efforts to reform the pay system and implement a single salary for members of the european parliament have repeatedly stalled since they began to be discussed earnestly in 1998 . -rrb-
allowance may be legitimate david harley , spokesman for the european parliament , said meps could legitimately claim their daily allowance if they were present in parliament , whether or not they took part in debates .
he said members could be working in their offices , writing reports or talking to journalists and also complex travel arrangements meant they often arrived late and left early .
but martin has described the practices as a " scam , " and he claimed nearly half of all german meps and several from other countries including britain are part of it .
the allegations of misuse of funds have shaken parliament , and many have stepped up to defend their fellow parliamentarians .
german mep hans-gert pöttering said meps are conscientious and work long hours .
" the vast majority of our colleagues do their work conscientiously , with a workload of 60 to 70 hours a week , " he said .
meanwhile , ireland 's mary banotti , a conservative , said martin ’ s allegations are causing immense distress to many colleagues .
daniel cohn-bendit , a prominent german green party member who is also in parliament , criticized martin for revealing his allegations to a german tabloid newspaper .
" to reveal this issue in this way is simply mobbing , " he said , referring to the practice of bullying workers until they leave a company .
parliament expenses under the loop members of the european parliament are currently paid a salary and expenses under an oft-criticized system set up in the 1960s that , among other things , allows meps to pocket the difference between full fare air tickets and discount fares when traveling between brussels , strasbourg and their constituencies . anita purcell -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany blocks eu parliament pay reform germany and three other eu states have blocked an attempt to reform the pay system for european parliamentarians , meaning it 's now unlikely that a reform package will be passed before eu-wide elections in june .

according to ukrainian and eu officials , the deal was provisionally signed by both sides on tuesday .
the european commission has been demanding the automatic extension of the political and cooperation agreement , which forms the legal basis of bilateral relations , to cover the new member states .
ukraine , however , has asked for compensation for the enlargement of the eu , which it says will hurt trade .
both sides have said discussions on ukraine 's concerns will continue , while the european commission has been playing down the link between the talks and the full endorsement of the agreement .
with russia continuing to press for concessions before signing a similar agreement , ukraine is keen to point out its apparently cooperative stance .
kiev wants to see talks continue on steel quotas , anti-dumping and tariffs on pipe products .

according to ukrainian and eu officials , the deal was provisionally signed by both sides on tuesday .
the european commission has been demanding the automatic extension of the political and cooperation agreement , which forms the legal basis of bilateral relations , to cover the new member states .
ukraine , however , has asked for compensation for the enlargement of the eu , which it says will hurt trade .
both sides have said discussions on ukraine 's concerns will continue , while the european commission has been playing down the link between the talks and the full endorsement of the agreement .
with russia continuing to press for concessions before signing a similar agreement , ukraine is keen to point out its apparently cooperative stance .
kiev wants to see talks continue on steel quotas , anti-dumping and tariffs on pipe products .

by the time he returned , he had made up his mind : europe ’ s biggest media group must immediately boost its position on the asian markets in order to profit from the dynamic growth in the region .
in china and india , bertelsmann has already set up shop . in the beijing region , for example , the group has already brought in 1.5 million members for its chinese-language book club .
and that 's only the beginning .
a million served bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gunter thielen " our team currently sells 20 million books in china , " thielen said tuesday at the company 's board meeting .
" that ’ s the same amount of books as we sell in france .
the turnover , however , is only a tenth in china , because there a book costs $ 1.5 while it costs $ 15 in france .
that ’ s the big difference and the reason for this is that the chinese market is still being regulated , " thielen said . " but once that starts changing , the prices will increase and so will our turnover .
in a long term perspective of 10 or 15 years , we will multiply our sales in asia and at some point it will represent at least 10 percent of our revenues , " he added .
the company still has a long way to go .
of its approximately € 17 billion in revenues last year , just € 2 billion came from sales in asia .
with a string of new investments , bertelsmann is seeking to increase its market share .
in china , bertelsmann wants to invest heavily in printing and publishing houses .
" we will stay away from the music sector , " he said .
" the bootleg system is so sophisticated in china , you can purchase a disc for $ 1 at any corner there .
that ’ s why it doesn ’ t make sense for us to produce discs in china . "
a fast growing market in india , bertelsmann ’ s random house publishing arm , as well as the printing subsidiary arvato , is already active .
still , business there is only just starting for the media group and the future looks promising , as india currently has growth rates of 7-8 percent per year - nearly comparable to those in china .
both are markets that bring euros to the eyes of bertelsmann managers .
" together they have a population of 2.4 billion people thus representing a third of the world population , " he said .
" this must become a market one day .
of course if you compare these countries to america , they are still dwarfs .
but if you look at their growth rates it ’ s clear that we must closely watch these markets .
and i am positive that we will increasingly position ourselves there . "
today the media giant only makes 3 percent of its turnover in asia , that ’ s around € 600 million per year .
and only 1 percent - about € 200 million - are being earned in eastern europe , which bertelsmann also views as a promising market for its television , publishing and printing operations .
currently , germany remains one of bertelsmann 's most important markets .
a third of the company 's overall turnover is made here , with 40 percent coming from the rest of europe and 25 percent in the united states and canada .
only 3 percent of revenues are currently derived from its asian units .
preparing for a mega-merger the company 's book publishing division , based in new york , is the market leader in the united states and britain .
new york is also the headquarters for its worldwide music business , which will soon be merging with sony 's music operations .
with a world music market share of approximately 12 percent , bertelsmann is expected to be the dominant partner in the joint venture .
last year , bertelsmann artists including britney spears and justin timberlake won 22 grammy awards .
and the company 's gruner + jahr magazine publishing division , the market leader in germany and france and a strong presence in the u.s. , is planning on introducing 20 new glossy magazines around the world . dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a victory for the old in berlin with the opening of bertelsmann ’ s new berlin headquarters and plans to reconstruct hohenzollern palace , someday , germany 's capital is looking back to the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.03.2004 bertelsmann plans asia push großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's biggest media company wants to become a household name in asia despite a global slump on the advertising and music market , europe ’ s biggest media group , germany-based bertelsmann , is looking towards black ink and a major expansion in asia this year . earlier this year bertelsmann chairman gunter thielen traveled to china , india and vietnam to explore business opportunities there .
by the time he returned , he had made up his mind : europe ’ s biggest media group must immediately boost its position on the asian markets in order to profit from the dynamic growth in the region .
in china and india , bertelsmann has already set up shop . in the beijing region , for example , the group has already brought in 1.5 million members for its chinese-language book club .
and that 's only the beginning .
a million served bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gunter thielen " our team currently sells 20 million books in china , " thielen said tuesday at the company 's board meeting .
" that ’ s the same amount of books as we sell in france .
the turnover , however , is only a tenth in china , because there a book costs $ 1.5 while it costs $ 15 in france .
that ’ s the big difference and the reason for this is that the chinese market is still being regulated , " thielen said . " but once that starts changing , the prices will increase and so will our turnover .
in a long term perspective of 10 or 15 years , we will multiply our sales in asia and at some point it will represent at least 10 percent of our revenues , " he added .
the company still has a long way to go .
of its approximately € 17 billion in revenues last year , just € 2 billion came from sales in asia .
with a string of new investments , bertelsmann is seeking to increase its market share .
in china , bertelsmann wants to invest heavily in printing and publishing houses .
" we will stay away from the music sector , " he said .
" the bootleg system is so sophisticated in china , you can purchase a disc for $ 1 at any corner there .
that ’ s why it doesn ’ t make sense for us to produce discs in china . "
a fast growing market in india , bertelsmann ’ s random house publishing arm , as well as the printing subsidiary arvato , is already active .
still , business there is only just starting for the media group and the future looks promising , as india currently has growth rates of 7-8 percent per year - nearly comparable to those in china .
both are markets that bring euros to the eyes of bertelsmann managers .
" together they have a population of 2.4 billion people thus representing a third of the world population , " he said .
" this must become a market one day .
of course if you compare these countries to america , they are still dwarfs .
but if you look at their growth rates it ’ s clear that we must closely watch these markets .
and i am positive that we will increasingly position ourselves there . "
today the media giant only makes 3 percent of its turnover in asia , that ’ s around € 600 million per year .
and only 1 percent - about € 200 million - are being earned in eastern europe , which bertelsmann also views as a promising market for its television , publishing and printing operations .
currently , germany remains one of bertelsmann 's most important markets .
a third of the company 's overall turnover is made here , with 40 percent coming from the rest of europe and 25 percent in the united states and canada .
only 3 percent of revenues are currently derived from its asian units .
preparing for a mega-merger the company 's book publishing division , based in new york , is the market leader in the united states and britain .
new york is also the headquarters for its worldwide music business , which will soon be merging with sony 's music operations .
with a world music market share of approximately 12 percent , bertelsmann is expected to be the dominant partner in the joint venture .
last year , bertelsmann artists including britney spears and justin timberlake won 22 grammy awards .

on wednesday , international leaders will meet in berlin to take stock of rebuilding efforts in afghanistan .
reconstruction financing and a booming opium trade remain major challenges . afghan leader hamid karzai and his trademark head covering will take center stage in berlin on wednesday , when 54 nations meet to analyze the progress and problems in afghanistan three years after the fall of the taliban . karzai , in the german capital on tuesday , highlighted his country 's battle with drug lords and dwindling financial resources as the major talking points at the two-day conference , which will be attended by u.s. secretary of state colin powell . " we will be asking -lrb- the international community -rrb- to increase their assistance to afghanistan in order for all of us to succeed in bringing about a safer , better , standing-on-its-own-feet afghanistan , " karzai told reporters after meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder , according to reuters . germany ready for the long haul the afghan leader has already picked up important pledges from german officials .
schröder , whose country has 1,900 peacekeeping troops in kabul and the northern city of kunduz , said germany was prepared to stay in the war-torn country for the long haul . bildunterschrift : schröder and karzai met on tuesday , on the eve of the two-day conference . germany has provided roughly € 80 million -lrb- $ 97 million -rrb- in aid each year since 2002 .
on wednesday , german officials are expected to announce that they will continue their aid program until 2008 . the united states , the biggest donor ahead of germany and japan , will most likely offer $ 1 billion on top of the $ 1.2 billion it has already pledged this year .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said tuesday that the leading donor countries hope other countries will pledge more aid . afghan leaders estimate that $ 27.5 billion is needed over the next seven years for reconstruction .
donors worldwide have so far pledged $ 4.2 billion through 2004 . " we obviously hope we will gather as large a sum as possible , " fischer told reporters . afghan opium flooding world markets not only financial woes , but the country 's growing drug problem are likely to be major discussion points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poppy field in afghanistan far more lucrative than wheat fields and growable even in the substandard afghani soil , experts estimate opium production makes up roughly half of the country 's € 4.4 billion gross domestic product and poses a significant security problem . " through that , warlords and terrorist finance themselves , " says general rick hillier , who commands the nato stability force in the region .
" that means they lag even more in giving up power to the central government . " most of the opium produced in afghanistan ends up in european markets as heroin , according to the un drugs authority .
as a result , governments have been more open recently to helping the afghan government , suggesting crop alternatives for farmers and pledging to invest in sectors that will create more jobs . isaf troops not ready to fight drug trade problems remain .
the international security assistance force has so far refused to involve itself in the fight against drug production and smuggling , leaving an ill-equipped afghan police force and army to fend for themselves .
in the past year , a few kilos of heroin have fallen into afghan law enforcement 's hands .
that 's a drop in the bucket compared to the estimated 3,600 tons of opium that left the country last year , according to un drug authorities . " the fight against drugs is the fight for afghanistan , " karzai said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern alliance fighters afghan police plan a major offensive in the coming weeks to burn 75 percent of the poppy fields in three afghan provinces .
the offensive will later be extended to all 32 provinces .
the u.s. government has pledged $ 40 million exclusively for creating and financing anti-drug troop units . but karzai said alternatives need to be found for the farmers , who make far more money producing opium poppies , the raw material for heroin , than any other crop . speaking before a roomful of business people on tuesday , including representatives of the world bank , karzai pushed raisins and saffron as possible options for weaning farmers off of drug production .
" if we want to have afghanistan , " said karzai .
" we must fight drugs .

on wednesday , international leaders will meet in berlin to take stock of rebuilding efforts in afghanistan .
reconstruction financing and a booming opium trade remain major challenges . afghan leader hamid karzai and his trademark head covering will take center stage in berlin on wednesday , when 54 nations meet to analyze the progress and problems in afghanistan three years after the fall of the taliban . karzai , in the german capital on tuesday , highlighted his country 's battle with drug lords and dwindling financial resources as the major talking points at the two-day conference , which will be attended by u.s. secretary of state colin powell . " we will be asking -lrb- the international community -rrb- to increase their assistance to afghanistan in order for all of us to succeed in bringing about a safer , better , standing-on-its-own-feet afghanistan , " karzai told reporters after meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder , according to reuters . germany ready for the long haul the afghan leader has already picked up important pledges from german officials .
schröder , whose country has 1,900 peacekeeping troops in kabul and the northern city of kunduz , said germany was prepared to stay in the war-torn country for the long haul . bildunterschrift : schröder and karzai met on tuesday , on the eve of the two-day conference . germany has provided roughly € 80 million -lrb- $ 97 million -rrb- in aid each year since 2002 .
on wednesday , german officials are expected to announce that they will continue their aid program until 2008 . the united states , the biggest donor ahead of germany and japan , will most likely offer $ 1 billion on top of the $ 1.2 billion it has already pledged this year .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said tuesday that the leading donor countries hope other countries will pledge more aid . afghan leaders estimate that $ 27.5 billion is needed over the next seven years for reconstruction .
donors worldwide have so far pledged $ 4.2 billion through 2004 . " we obviously hope we will gather as large a sum as possible , " fischer told reporters . afghan opium flooding world markets not only financial woes , but the country 's growing drug problem are likely to be major discussion points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poppy field in afghanistan far more lucrative than wheat fields and growable even in the substandard afghani soil , experts estimate opium production makes up roughly half of the country 's € 4.4 billion gross domestic product and poses a significant security problem . " through that , warlords and terrorist finance themselves , " says general rick hillier , who commands the nato stability force in the region .
" that means they lag even more in giving up power to the central government . " most of the opium produced in afghanistan ends up in european markets as heroin , according to the un drugs authority .
as a result , governments have been more open recently to helping the afghan government , suggesting crop alternatives for farmers and pledging to invest in sectors that will create more jobs . isaf troops not ready to fight drug trade problems remain .
the international security assistance force has so far refused to involve itself in the fight against drug production and smuggling , leaving an ill-equipped afghan police force and army to fend for themselves .
in the past year , a few kilos of heroin have fallen into afghan law enforcement 's hands .
that 's a drop in the bucket compared to the estimated 3,600 tons of opium that left the country last year , according to un drug authorities . " the fight against drugs is the fight for afghanistan , " karzai said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern alliance fighters afghan police plan a major offensive in the coming weeks to burn 75 percent of the poppy fields in three afghan provinces .
the offensive will later be extended to all 32 provinces .
the u.s. government has pledged $ 40 million exclusively for creating and financing anti-drug troop units . but karzai said alternatives need to be found for the farmers , who make far more money producing opium poppies , the raw material for heroin , than any other crop . speaking before a roomful of business people on tuesday , including representatives of the world bank , karzai pushed raisins and saffron as possible options for weaning farmers off of drug production .

" we obviously hope we will gather as large a sum as possible , " fischer told reporters . afghan opium flooding world markets not only financial woes , but the country 's growing drug problem are likely to be major discussion points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poppy field in afghanistan far more lucrative than wheat fields and growable even in the substandard afghani soil , experts estimate opium production makes up roughly half of the country 's € 4.4 billion gross domestic product and poses a significant security problem . " through that , warlords and terrorist finance themselves , " says general rick hillier , who commands the nato stability force in the region .
" that means they lag even more in giving up power to the central government . " most of the opium produced in afghanistan ends up in european markets as heroin , according to the un drugs authority .
as a result , governments have been more open recently to helping the afghan government , suggesting crop alternatives for farmers and pledging to invest in sectors that will create more jobs . isaf troops not ready to fight drug trade problems remain .
the international security assistance force has so far refused to involve itself in the fight against drug production and smuggling , leaving an ill-equipped afghan police force and army to fend for themselves .
in the past year , a few kilos of heroin have fallen into afghan law enforcement 's hands .
that 's a drop in the bucket compared to the estimated 3,600 tons of opium that left the country last year , according to un drug authorities . " the fight against drugs is the fight for afghanistan , " karzai said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern alliance fighters afghan police plan a major offensive in the coming weeks to burn 75 percent of the poppy fields in three afghan provinces .
the offensive will later be extended to all 32 provinces .
the u.s. government has pledged $ 40 million exclusively for creating and financing anti-drug troop units . but karzai said alternatives need to be found for the farmers , who make far more money producing opium poppies , the raw material for heroin , than any other crop . speaking before a roomful of business people on tuesday , including representatives of the world bank , karzai pushed raisins and saffron as possible options for weaning farmers off of drug production .
" if we want to have afghanistan , " said karzai .
" we must fight drugs .

after chancellor schröder settled a months-long cabinet dispute over greenhouse gas cuts , germany has submitted its plans for reducing carbon dioxide emissions to brussels .
other eu countries are much further behind . germany was n't the first country to hand in plans for curbing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions to the european commission - that honor went to finland .
but berlin was n't far behind .
considering the deeply entrenched dispute between industry and environmental groups , the fact that europe 's largest producer of greenhouse gases was among the first three to send its proposals for cutting the pollutants is surprising .
it was n't clear until late monday evening whether germany would be in a position to make wednesday 's eu deadline for emissions reductions plans .
only after chancellor gerhard schröder stepped in to broker a last-minute deal between the environment and economics ministers , was berlin able to put together a proposal worthy of sending to brussels .
germany calls for slight reduction just hours before the eu deadline ran out , germany 's cabinet passed a plan to cut industrial emissions of co2 from 505 million to 503 million tons per year by 2007 .
in a second phase , emissions are set to be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 .
the carbon caps are part of germany 's strategy to cut its greenhouse gases by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 .
the reduction is only slight compared to the 488 million tons requested by environment minister jürgen trittin .
as a member of the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition , he had pushed hard for further emission reductions , arguing german industry needed to do more to fulfil its contribution to the kyoto protocol .
economics minister wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , unflinchingly resisted major emissions cuts .
further reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry at a time when it is trying to shake off economic stagnation , he insisted .
european goal the dispute between industry and environment is not unique to germany .
throughout the european union , member states are struggling to lay such disagreements to rest in order to submit plans for cutting emissions .
by midnight wednesday all 15 eu states must set their co2 limits and the distribution of reductions between industrial sectors , with ceilings set on a company-by-company basis .
the reductions are part of a two-prong strategy brussels has devised in order to meet its commitments to the kyoto protocol .
in addition to capping emissions from industry and utilities , the eu plans to launch an emissions trading system -lrb- ets -rrb- in january that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from those who have remained under their pollution cap and thus create an exchange across borders , where the greener industries would stand to profit economically through the sale of their credits .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 .
several major industrial states , including britain , france and belgium , have already said they will miss the march 31 deadline .
italy , too , has conceded it is uncertain whether it will have a list of its emissions limits ready by the eu deadline .
spain will ask the european commission for " understanding " for failing to meet the deadline as the country is undergoing a change of government .
" the picture we have today does n't say that january 1 -lrb- the start of ets -rrb- is in any danger - not at all , not yet , " ewa hedlund , the commission 's environment spokeswoman , told a news briefing .
" next week , we 'll have more detail on what we 've received and what action we are going to take , " she said referring to a possible " infringement letter " from the commission and impending legal action against those members who fail to supply the eu executive with their emissions plans .
waiting for germany ?
according to analysts , europe 's biggest polluters had held back on submitting their plans until germany handed over its limits .
as the largest producer of co2 emissions , germany 's reduction rate dominated discussion in several capitals .
" germany is important , " john molloy of the brokerage firm tfs in london told german wire service dpa .
" great britain was the strictest up until now in terms of restriction , but they ca n't hold onto that position when everyone else is more lenient and risk jeopardizing the british industry . "
britain has denied it had purposefully waited for a german decision before drawing up its own plans .
but on tuesday london announced it may impose less cuts on industry than slated in january - a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 - and return to a limit closer to the 16 percent committed to under the kyoto protocol . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ministers reach agreement in emissions fight germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions .

after chancellor schröder settled a months-long cabinet dispute over greenhouse gas cuts , germany has submitted its plans for reducing carbon dioxide emissions to brussels .
other eu countries are much further behind . germany was n't the first country to hand in plans for curbing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions to the european commission - that honor went to finland .
but berlin was n't far behind .
considering the deeply entrenched dispute between industry and environmental groups , the fact that europe 's largest producer of greenhouse gases was among the first three to send its proposals for cutting the pollutants is surprising .
it was n't clear until late monday evening whether germany would be in a position to make wednesday 's eu deadline for emissions reductions plans .
only after chancellor gerhard schröder stepped in to broker a last-minute deal between the environment and economics ministers , was berlin able to put together a proposal worthy of sending to brussels .
germany calls for slight reduction just hours before the eu deadline ran out , germany 's cabinet passed a plan to cut industrial emissions of co2 from 505 million to 503 million tons per year by 2007 .
in a second phase , emissions are set to be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 .
the carbon caps are part of germany 's strategy to cut its greenhouse gases by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 .
the reduction is only slight compared to the 488 million tons requested by environment minister jürgen trittin .
as a member of the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition , he had pushed hard for further emission reductions , arguing german industry needed to do more to fulfil its contribution to the kyoto protocol .
economics minister wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , unflinchingly resisted major emissions cuts .
further reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry at a time when it is trying to shake off economic stagnation , he insisted .
european goal the dispute between industry and environment is not unique to germany .
throughout the european union , member states are struggling to lay such disagreements to rest in order to submit plans for cutting emissions .
by midnight wednesday all 15 eu states must set their co2 limits and the distribution of reductions between industrial sectors , with ceilings set on a company-by-company basis .
the reductions are part of a two-prong strategy brussels has devised in order to meet its commitments to the kyoto protocol .
in addition to capping emissions from industry and utilities , the eu plans to launch an emissions trading system -lrb- ets -rrb- in january that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from those who have remained under their pollution cap and thus create an exchange across borders , where the greener industries would stand to profit economically through the sale of their credits .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 .
several major industrial states , including britain , france and belgium , have already said they will miss the march 31 deadline .
italy , too , has conceded it is uncertain whether it will have a list of its emissions limits ready by the eu deadline .
spain will ask the european commission for " understanding " for failing to meet the deadline as the country is undergoing a change of government .
" the picture we have today does n't say that january 1 -lrb- the start of ets -rrb- is in any danger - not at all , not yet , " ewa hedlund , the commission 's environment spokeswoman , told a news briefing .
" next week , we 'll have more detail on what we 've received and what action we are going to take , " she said referring to a possible " infringement letter " from the commission and impending legal action against those members who fail to supply the eu executive with their emissions plans .
waiting for germany ?
according to analysts , europe 's biggest polluters had held back on submitting their plans until germany handed over its limits .
as the largest producer of co2 emissions , germany 's reduction rate dominated discussion in several capitals .
" germany is important , " john molloy of the brokerage firm tfs in london told german wire service dpa .
" great britain was the strictest up until now in terms of restriction , but they ca n't hold onto that position when everyone else is more lenient and risk jeopardizing the british industry . "
britain has denied it had purposefully waited for a german decision before drawing up its own plans .
but on tuesday london announced it may impose less cuts on industry than slated in january - a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 - and return to a limit closer to the 16 percent committed to under the kyoto protocol . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ministers reach agreement in emissions fight germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions .

eu interior ministers have acheived partial success on controversial plans to create a europe-wide asylum policy .
human rights groups however remain troubled over the unresolved elements . eu interior ministers met in brussels on tuesday to make yet another effort to hammer out a europe-wide asylum policy .
the meeting took on an added sense of urgency with the ministers struggling to comply with a self-imposed may 1 deadline , the date on which ten new countries join the eu .
ending almost six years of acrimonious negotiations , they reached a partial breakthrough on key aspects of the legislation . the ministers agreed on a set of criteria establishing who can apply for asylum .
however , they could not agree on some procedural points determining how such requests should be handled .
certain aspects of the latter , including a proposed plan to allow for the deportation of asylum seekers to " safe " third countries , have come under heavy fire from human rights organizations .
the ministers will meet again at the end of april to take up the issue again , but according to the german interior minister otto schily , " it could be close " .
germany drops opposition to asylum criteria the breakthrough came after the german government dropped its long-standing opposition to a policy determining who is eligible to apply for asylum , specifically the recognition of asylum seekers who are fleeing non-state persecution , like men who are being pursued by drug cartels or women who face female genital mutilation .
the expected approval of a sweeping new immigration law in germany , which has led to a compromise on key issues between the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and the conservative christian democratic opposition , cleared the way for schily to adopt a more conciliatory tone .
under the rules agreed on tuesday , the eu will not only offer protection to people who are refugees according to the 1951 geneva convention , they will also offer so-called subsidiary protection to victims of non-state persecution .
human rights groups protest key points not good enough , say some human rights groups .
following the recent election of anti-immigration parties in several european countries , asylum policy remains a politically loaded and divisive issue .
human rights groups - citing the increasingly restrictive nature of the eu policies - have publicly objected to key aspects of the draft , namely the still unresolved questions over how asylum requests will be handled .
in an unprecedented move , several groups , including human rights watch , amnesty international , and the european council for refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , jointly called on the eu to scrap the agreement , claiming it violates international law .
at issue are two aspects of the proposed agreement .
the first deals with a suggestion in the directive on the use of a " safe country of origin " concept , which means the eu would compile a list of " safe countries " and asylum requests from persons originating from these countries would be considered illegitimate .
the second issue is a so-called " safe third county " concept , which means asylum seekers can be deported to a third country deemed safe .
neither was resolved at the meeting on tuesday and has been put off until the end of april .
" these proposals would deny some asylum seekers access to full and fair procedures , and it would transfer them to countries outside europe , " said ben ward of human rights watch .
" we 're deeply concerned that the eu is trying to get other countries to shoulder its responsibilities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum-seekers in hamburg daphne bouteillet paquet said the ministers should forget the proposals and start again .
" we feel we have no option but to call on the eu to scrap this proposal on asylum procedures , which has been shaped in reaction to populist pressures and fears whipped up about a non-existent flood of refugees into the eu , " she said .
schily rebuffs criticism schily responded to the human rights organization 's criticism , saying that the creation of a safe third country concept would allow the eu to avoid the processing costs associated with questionable claims , while those who are truly victims of oppression would be offered asylum .

eu interior ministers have acheived partial success on controversial plans to create a europe-wide asylum policy .
human rights groups however remain troubled over the unresolved elements . eu interior ministers met in brussels on tuesday to make yet another effort to hammer out a europe-wide asylum policy .
the meeting took on an added sense of urgency with the ministers struggling to comply with a self-imposed may 1 deadline , the date on which ten new countries join the eu .
ending almost six years of acrimonious negotiations , they reached a partial breakthrough on key aspects of the legislation . the ministers agreed on a set of criteria establishing who can apply for asylum .
however , they could not agree on some procedural points determining how such requests should be handled .
certain aspects of the latter , including a proposed plan to allow for the deportation of asylum seekers to " safe " third countries , have come under heavy fire from human rights organizations .
the ministers will meet again at the end of april to take up the issue again , but according to the german interior minister otto schily , " it could be close " .
germany drops opposition to asylum criteria the breakthrough came after the german government dropped its long-standing opposition to a policy determining who is eligible to apply for asylum , specifically the recognition of asylum seekers who are fleeing non-state persecution , like men who are being pursued by drug cartels or women who face female genital mutilation .
the expected approval of a sweeping new immigration law in germany , which has led to a compromise on key issues between the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and the conservative christian democratic opposition , cleared the way for schily to adopt a more conciliatory tone .
under the rules agreed on tuesday , the eu will not only offer protection to people who are refugees according to the 1951 geneva convention , they will also offer so-called subsidiary protection to victims of non-state persecution .
human rights groups protest key points not good enough , say some human rights groups .
following the recent election of anti-immigration parties in several european countries , asylum policy remains a politically loaded and divisive issue .
human rights groups - citing the increasingly restrictive nature of the eu policies - have publicly objected to key aspects of the draft , namely the still unresolved questions over how asylum requests will be handled .
in an unprecedented move , several groups , including human rights watch , amnesty international , and the european council for refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , jointly called on the eu to scrap the agreement , claiming it violates international law .
at issue are two aspects of the proposed agreement .
the first deals with a suggestion in the directive on the use of a " safe country of origin " concept , which means the eu would compile a list of " safe countries " and asylum requests from persons originating from these countries would be considered illegitimate .
the second issue is a so-called " safe third county " concept , which means asylum seekers can be deported to a third country deemed safe .
neither was resolved at the meeting on tuesday and has been put off until the end of april .
" these proposals would deny some asylum seekers access to full and fair procedures , and it would transfer them to countries outside europe , " said ben ward of human rights watch .
" we 're deeply concerned that the eu is trying to get other countries to shoulder its responsibilities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum-seekers in hamburg daphne bouteillet paquet said the ministers should forget the proposals and start again .
" we feel we have no option but to call on the eu to scrap this proposal on asylum procedures , which has been shaped in reaction to populist pressures and fears whipped up about a non-existent flood of refugees into the eu , " she said .
schily rebuffs criticism schily responded to the human rights organization 's criticism , saying that the creation of a safe third country concept would allow the eu to avoid the processing costs associated with questionable claims , while those who are truly victims of oppression would be offered asylum .

after chancellor schröder settled a months-long cabinet dispute over greenhouse gas cuts , germany has submitted its plans for reducing carbon dioxide emissions to brussels .
other eu countries are much further behind . germany was n't the first country to hand in plans for curbing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions to the european commission - that honor went to finland .
but berlin was n't far behind .
considering the deeply entrenched dispute between industry and environmental groups , the fact that europe 's largest producer of greenhouse gases was among the first three to send its proposals for cutting the pollutants is surprising .
it was n't clear until late monday evening whether germany would be in a position to make wednesday 's eu deadline for emissions reductions plans .
only after chancellor gerhard schröder stepped in to broker a last-minute deal between the environment and economics ministers , was berlin able to put together a proposal worthy of sending to brussels .
germany calls for slight reduction just hours before the eu deadline ran out , germany 's cabinet passed a plan to cut industrial emissions of co2 from 505 million to 503 million tons per year by 2007 .
in a second phase , emissions are set to be limited to 495 million tons by 2012 .
the carbon caps are part of germany 's strategy to cut its greenhouse gases by 21 percent of 1990 levels by 2008-2012 .
the reduction is only slight compared to the 488 million tons requested by environment minister jürgen trittin .
as a member of the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition , he had pushed hard for further emission reductions , arguing german industry needed to do more to fulfil its contribution to the kyoto protocol .
economics minister wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , unflinchingly resisted major emissions cuts .
further reduction requirements would put an undue burden on industry at a time when it is trying to shake off economic stagnation , he insisted .
european goal the dispute between industry and environment is not unique to germany .
throughout the european union , member states are struggling to lay such disagreements to rest in order to submit plans for cutting emissions .
by midnight wednesday all 15 eu states must set their co2 limits and the distribution of reductions between industrial sectors , with ceilings set on a company-by-company basis .
the reductions are part of a two-prong strategy brussels has devised in order to meet its commitments to the kyoto protocol .
in addition to capping emissions from industry and utilities , the eu plans to launch an emissions trading system -lrb- ets -rrb- in january that would allow companies to buy and sell pollution " credits " from one another .
companies exceeding prescribed co2 emissions limit could buy credits from those who have remained under their pollution cap and thus create an exchange across borders , where the greener industries would stand to profit economically through the sale of their credits .
according to norwegian research firm point carbon , emissions trading is estimated to reach $ 10 billion a year by 2007 .
several major industrial states , including britain , france and belgium , have already said they will miss the march 31 deadline .
italy , too , has conceded it is uncertain whether it will have a list of its emissions limits ready by the eu deadline .
spain will ask the european commission for " understanding " for failing to meet the deadline as the country is undergoing a change of government .
" the picture we have today does n't say that january 1 -lrb- the start of ets -rrb- is in any danger - not at all , not yet , " ewa hedlund , the commission 's environment spokeswoman , told a news briefing .
" next week , we 'll have more detail on what we 've received and what action we are going to take , " she said referring to a possible " infringement letter " from the commission and impending legal action against those members who fail to supply the eu executive with their emissions plans .
waiting for germany ?
according to analysts , europe 's biggest polluters had held back on submitting their plans until germany handed over its limits .
as the largest producer of co2 emissions , germany 's reduction rate dominated discussion in several capitals .
" germany is important , " john molloy of the brokerage firm tfs in london told german wire service dpa .
" great britain was the strictest up until now in terms of restriction , but they ca n't hold onto that position when everyone else is more lenient and risk jeopardizing the british industry . "
britain has denied it had purposefully waited for a german decision before drawing up its own plans .
but on tuesday london announced it may impose less cuts on industry than slated in january - a reduction of 20 percent by 2010 - and return to a limit closer to the 16 percent committed to under the kyoto protocol . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ministers reach agreement in emissions fight germany 's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions .

the french conglomerate is under investigation for illegally buying back its own stock in the aftermath of the september 11 attacks in america .
it is claimed the company , which has previously faced fraud charges in the us , wanted to maintain its share price .
its former chief executive jean-marie messier said he acted in best interest .
mr messier , who was in charge at the time , insisted in a statement that the decision was both within the bounds of the law and in the interests of shareholders .
complicity claim two executives from deutsche bank , who carried out the repurchases for vivendi universal , have also been questioned by french investigators .
the french financial markets authority -lrb- fma -rrb- has acknowledged that its president michel prada wrote to mr messier in the month after september 11 to say he did not intend to take any action against the company 's share buyback , despite it breaking french rules .
it said it decided to take no action against vivendi universal " because of the completely exceptional nature of the period in question , which came after the september 11 attacks . "
yet this has not washed with appac , the small shareholder group that has accused the -lrb- fma -rrb- of complicity , and had led the calls for an investigation .
mr messier was forced to leave his top job at vivendi universal in july 2002 after he ran up debts of $ 42bn after an over-ambitious spending spree .
book balancing he was then forced to give up a 21m euro -lrb- $ 26m ; £ 15m -rrb- severance package which shareholders said was a reward for failure .
mr messier also reached a deal with the us securities and exchange commission to settle a separate investigation into alleged financial irregularities at the firm .
the company has since returned to profitability - 131m euro -lrb- $ 157m ; £ 91m -rrb- in the three months to september 2003 - after cost cutting and selling off its us entertainment arm .
it maintains telecoms , pay tv and other entertainment concerns .

it produced a leaflet and fact sheet which predicted that there would be a large fall in house prices .
it also claimed that wind farms caused illness - but the allegations were dismissed as misleading by the asa .
the authority was responding to a complaint from a member of the public .
the unnamed complainer challenged a claim that wind farms create inaudible sound frequencies which cause stress-related illness .
wildlife impact the group 's leaflet also said that house prices fall by up to a third where the outlook or amenity is affected by a wind farm .
these claims were dismissed by the asa , along with others about the impact on wildlife .
protesters ' spokeswoman ginny stacy-marks said : " i 'm rather cross about it but it 's not going to make me , or any of the people living in our community in the ochils give up our fight .
" i would actually dispute the fact that what was contained in the leaflets was incorrect . "
she added : " the so-called judgement against us does not hold water .
had we been a political group they would not have been able to touch us . "

eu officials say the county has spent the money wisely so far and it will now get an extra £ 17m to spend .
this makes cornwall the best objective one area in england .
but critics of the scheme claim the difference it can make to the cornish economy is limited .
an official announcement about the further funding is due on wednesday .
objective one has so far channelled nearly £ 200m from a £ 300m pot of european money into the county since 1999 .
some money has gone into traditional flagship construction projects such as the tolvaddon energy park and the combined universities in cornwall .
other projects that have benefited include infrastructure projects improving links within the cornish economy , such as the act now scheme to roll out broadband computer services .
the european commission said in february that the county will get further development funding until 2013 because it is still relatively poor and the sums will be similar to the amount of objective one money .

workers at the site in broughton , north wales say they fear for jobs because of a block on dredging in the dee estuary .
the company wanted to use mostyn docks to transport its ' superjumbo ' wings to its plant in france .
without dredging , barges can not use the docks all day .
local mps and ams are supporting the petition .
the petition has been organised by a local paper and many airbus workers are among hundreds who have signed it .
the aerospace giant 's £ 11bn deal has been questioned after the environment agency refused the port of mostyn permission to carry out dredging .
however , last week , it emerged that airbus has been in talks with the port of liverpool to use its docks to transport the wings .
bosses at mostyn docks want dredging to go ahead a company spokesman said that liverpool could only be used as a back-up to mostyn , not an alternative .
the environment agency has argued dredging could have a negative environmental effect on the estuary .
wildlife recorder mike griffiths has said mustard gas bombs thrown overboard after world war ii could be dislodged and pollute beaches as far away as llandudno .

workers at the site in broughton , north wales say they fear for jobs because of a block on dredging in the dee estuary .
the company wanted to use mostyn docks to transport its ' superjumbo ' wings to its plant in france .
without dredging , barges can not use the docks all day .
local mps and ams are supporting the petition .
the petition has been organised by a local paper and many airbus workers are among hundreds who have signed it .
the aerospace giant 's £ 11bn deal has been questioned after the environment agency refused the port of mostyn permission to carry out dredging .
however , last week , it emerged that airbus has been in talks with the port of liverpool to use its docks to transport the wings .
bosses at mostyn docks want dredging to go ahead a company spokesman said that liverpool could only be used as a back-up to mostyn , not an alternative .
the environment agency has argued dredging could have a negative environmental effect on the estuary .
wildlife recorder mike griffiths has said mustard gas bombs thrown overboard after world war ii could be dislodged and pollute beaches as far away as llandudno .
the petition to downing street will be presented by alyn and deeside mp mark tami and neighbour delyn mp mark hanson at 0830 bst .

experts from the animal welfare charity the sspca have been trying to clean up the birds , but so far it has been possible to release only two of them .
dozens of eider ducks , cormorants and guillemots have all been found with contaminated plumage .
an investigation into the source of the pollution is continuing .
among the birds that have not survived are rare red and black throated divers .
the sspca 's doreen graham said : " i 'm afraid sea birds , it does n't appear that they actually treat very well for being oiled .
" in fact , any of the birds that are being found now , because they will have ingested a great deal of oil , it will have started to burn their insides so we are actually putting them down . "
investigators say they are bemused because hardly any of the oil itself has been washed up , nor have there been any complaints from fishermen working in the firth .
one possible cause of the pollution is a leak from a tanker out in the north sea with the contaminated birds being blown into the estuary by high winds .
samples of the oil have also been sent for testing to try and trace its source .

investigators say they are bemused because hardly any of the oil itself has been washed up , nor have there been any complaints from fishermen working in the firth .
one possible cause of the pollution is a leak from a tanker out in the north sea with the contaminated birds being blown into the estuary by high winds .
samples of the oil have also been sent for testing to try and trace its source .

the richard report , to be published on wednesday , has called for the institution to be given law-making powers in devolved areas such as health and education by 2011 .
it also wants to increase the number of ams from 60 to 80 because of the extra responsibilities which would come with additional powers .
it seems the report has gone much further than political observers had expected , and will recommend that a process of change should begin without delay .
barrister robert buckland , who campaigned against an assembly for wales in 1999 , said on wednesday that he would be " happy " if the assembly was given more primary powers .
" i welcome the inquiry , " he said , " and i gave evidence to it myself , and i just hope we get far more of a balance in the constitution as a result of it - as long as westminster still has a say . "
i 'd like this report to be turned into something permanent " mari james " i do n't think the people of wales want a mirror image of the scottish parliament , " he added .
the report is the work of an independent commission led by the labour peer lord richard of ammanford which has been investigating the future powers and electoral arrangements of the current welsh assembly .
there is no guarantee that all or some of the report 's recommendations will be implemented , and the process would take several years .
elections would be carried out by the single transferable vote system of proportional representation , with between four and six ams per constituency .
that suggests anything between 13 and 20 constituencies for the assembly , as opposed to the 40 which elect mps to westminster and presently elect two-thirds of the ams to cardiff bay .
the labour mp for wrexham ian lucas is opposed to the assembly receiving full law-making powers without a referendum .
he said he would like to see a system which encourages back bench ams and mps " to work together . "
" it 's a very important way of integrating the system of government for wales , " he said . "
i do think the present voting system has been totally discredited so there has to be a change to the system " brian gibbons labour am for aberavon , brian gibbons , said that if primary powers were devolved to the assembly a referendum would not be needed .
" i do n't think the average person in the street would see a difference with the present set up we have and what we would have if the assembly had primary legislative powers .
" i do think the present voting system has been totally discredited so there has to be a change to the system .
it would be up to the boundary commission to decide the shape of the new constituencies .
lord richard is expected to accept criticism of the current closed party list system for selecting ams for the regional lists .
the report is said to hint that tax-raising powers may be desirable , without endorsing them .
it also calls for the assembly to use its current powers fully and more effectively , and says ministers should continue to devolve powers from westminster .
it is understood the report says giving the assembly more powers would not necessarily demand a referendum but that the final decision on such a matter should be left to the uk parliament .
richard commission members lord richard of ammanford eira davies , publishing manager tom jones , farmer dr laura mcallister , lecturer peter price , ex-mep ted rowlands , ex-merthyr mp vivienne sugar , consultant huw thomas , company director sir michael wheeler-booth , ex-parliamentary official paul valerio , ex-swansea lord mayor it also recommends that the assembly government - the executive arm of the body - should be made more distinct from the rest of the assembly - the legislature .
mari james , the former vice-chair of the yes for wales campaign , said she would like the report to be turned into something " permanent . "
" it 's very useful to have a review of the process as we go along , " she said .
" how to reform and progress any part of the democratic process is always a dilemma .
i 'd like this report to be turned into something permanent so the system is constantly under review . "
the report is likely to surprise many by setting out a clear timetable for any changes , beginning next year with a new draft government of wales bill , immediately after a uk general election .
the bill would then be introduced to parliament in 2007 , the same year as the next assembly elections , and receive royal assent in 2008 , triggering constituency reviews by the boundary commission .
the 2011 assembly elections would see the new system being put in place .
however , whether these recommendations are accepted will rest largely with the labour party , the uk government and parliament itself .
it appears that there is not much support under labour for a change to the voting system under stv .
the party is holding a special conference to discuss the recommendations in september , which means the timescale for getting any firm pledges into the 2005 general election manifesto will be very tight .
a special extended edition of the bbc2 wales programme am.pm will be broadcast on wednesday , 31 march from 1035 bst with live coverage of the richard report and political reaction from wales and westminster .

the report is likely to surprise many by setting out a clear timetable for any changes , beginning next year with a new draft government of wales bill , immediately after a uk general election .

the richard report , to be published on wednesday , has called for the institution to be given law-making powers in devolved areas such as health and education by 2011 .
it also wants to increase the number of ams from 60 to 80 because of the extra responsibilities which would come with additional powers .
it seems the report has gone much further than political observers had expected , and will recommend that a process of change should begin without delay .
barrister robert buckland , who campaigned against an assembly for wales in 1999 , said on wednesday that he would be " happy " if the assembly was given more primary powers .
" i welcome the inquiry , " he said , " and i gave evidence to it myself , and i just hope we get far more of a balance in the constitution as a result of it - as long as westminster still has a say .
i 'd like this report to be turned into something permanent mari james " i do n't think the people of wales want a mirror image of the scottish parliament , " he added .
the report is the work of an independent commission led by the labour peer lord richard of ammanford which has been investigating the future powers and electoral arrangements of the current welsh assembly .
there is no guarantee that all or some of the report 's recommendations will be implemented , and the process would take several years .
elections would be carried out by the single transferable vote system of proportional representation , with between four and six ams per constituency .
twenty extra ams could sit in the assembly that suggests anything between 13 and 20 constituencies for the assembly , as opposed to the 40 which elect mps to westminster and presently elect two-thirds of the ams to cardiff bay .
the labour mp for wrexham ian lucas is opposed to the assembly receiving full law-making powers without a referendum .
he said he would like to see a system which encourages back bench ams and mps " to work together . "
" it 's a very important way of integrating the system of government for wales , " he said .
i do think the present voting system has been totally discredited so there has to be a change to the system brian gibbons labour am for aberavon , brian gibbons , said that if primary powers were devolved to the assembly a referendum would not be needed .
" i do n't think the average person in the street would see a difference with the present set up we have and what we would have if the assembly had primary legislative powers .
" i do think the present voting system has been totally discredited so there has to be a change to the system .
it would be up to the boundary commission to decide the shape of the new constituencies .
lord richard is expected to accept criticism of the current closed party list system for selecting ams for the regional lists .
the report is said to hint that tax-raising powers may be desirable , without endorsing them .
it also calls for the assembly to use its current powers fully and more effectively , and says ministers should continue to devolve powers from westminster .

administrators called in to south shields-based circuit board maker circatex , said 350 of its 520 workforce were to lose their jobs .
it follows a cash crisis at the company , which received £ 3m in taxpayers ' money to fund a management buy-out in 2001 .
now the amicus union has launched claims for unfair dismissal .
the union says it has also launched protective award claims for lack of consultation against the administrators of the factory .
on monday , ian kings and simon thomas , directors of tenon recovery , were appointed joint administrators .
they were brought in after company bosses revealed a severe cash flow crisis prompted by a slump in orders and tough foreign competition .
on tuesday afternoon , 350 job losses were announced , leaving around 180 staff at the site .
in a statement , mel barras , amicus regional officer , said : " amicus are disgusted at the way these redundancies have been handled .
mr miliband has promised government support " we are looking to the government to alter laws that allow administrators to make redundancies without the normal consultation periods .
" these job losses are yet another example of the crises facing manufacturing in this country due to laws that offer uk workers lower levels of protection than in the rest of europe . "
the union is planning a demonstration in newcastle on 2 april to highlight the decline of manufacturing and to call for the introduction of stronger employment protection to make redundancies a more difficult and expensive option .
union officials are also due to meet south shields mp david miliband to ask what help the government can offer .
last year , 37 jobs were lost at the plant after workers voted for a 10 % pay cut and job losses in order to keep the struggling plant open .
' no alternative ' earlier on tuesday , mr miliband pledged the government would " step in " if required .
he said : " what i can completely pledge ... is not only that i will be working closely with the trade unions and meeting them on friday to talk about what 's happening .
" but obviously if there is anything that can be done , the government will be stepping in to do it . "
ian kings of tenon recovery , said : " in recent months the company has been working with its creditors to try and find a solution to its problems .
" however , the expected level of future orders has not been achieved and consequently the directors feel that they are left with no alternative but to seek the protection afforded by an administration order .
" as administrators it is our intention to continue to trade the business with a view to obtaining a sale as a going concern and obtaining the best realisation for creditors and a continuation of employment for employees . "
circatex was given a £ 3.75m grant to aid a management buy-out in 2001 , when previous owners viasystems decided to close the plant and a sister factory in north tyneside .

administrators called in to south shields-based circuit board maker circatex , said 350 of its 520 workforce were to lose their jobs .
it follows a cash crisis at the company , which received £ 3m in taxpayers ' money to fund a management buy-out in 2001 .
now the amicus union has launched claims for unfair dismissal .
the union says it has also launched protective award claims for lack of consultation against the administrators of the factory .
on monday , ian kings and simon thomas , directors of tenon recovery , were appointed joint administrators .
they were brought in after company bosses revealed a severe cash flow crisis prompted by a slump in orders and tough foreign competition .
on tuesday afternoon , 350 job losses were announced , leaving around 180 staff at the site .
in a statement , mel barras , amicus regional officer , said : " amicus are disgusted at the way these redundancies have been handled .
mr miliband has promised government support " we are looking to the government to alter laws that allow administrators to make redundancies without the normal consultation periods .
" these job losses are yet another example of the crises facing manufacturing in this country due to laws that offer uk workers lower levels of protection than in the rest of europe . "
the union is planning a demonstration in newcastle on 2 april to highlight the decline of manufacturing and to call for the introduction of stronger employment protection to make redundancies a more difficult and expensive option .
union officials are also due to meet south shields mp david miliband to ask what help the government can offer .
last year , 37 jobs were lost at the plant after workers voted for a 10 % pay cut and job losses in order to keep the struggling plant open .
' no alternative ' earlier on tuesday , mr miliband pledged the government would " step in " if required .
he said : " what i can completely pledge ... is not only that i will be working closely with the trade unions and meeting them on friday to talk about what 's happening .
" but obviously if there is anything that can be done , the government will be stepping in to do it . "
ian kings of tenon recovery , said : " in recent months the company has been working with its creditors to try and find a solution to its problems .
" however , the expected level of future orders has not been achieved and consequently the directors feel that they are left with no alternative but to seek the protection afforded by an administration order .
" as administrators it is our intention to continue to trade the business with a view to obtaining a sale as a going concern and obtaining the best realisation for creditors and a continuation of employment for employees . "
circatex was given a £ 3.75m grant to aid a management buy-out in 2001 , when previous owners viasystems decided to close the plant and a sister factory in north tyneside .
