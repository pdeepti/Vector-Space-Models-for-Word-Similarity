in a telephone conversation with the deputy head of dfb , franz beckenbauer , on saturday , the coach who brought greece to victory in the euro 2004 soccer championships in lisbon , said he was not available for the job .
rehhagel told beckenbauer that during his three years with the greek team , he had really built something , and that he wanted to stay true to his word and stick with the team through the 2006 world cup , when his contract expires .
by rejecting , rehhagel also turned down a huge chunk of cash .
in greece , the 65-year-old has earned € 600,000 for his work as top coach , but in germany he could have earned up to € 5 million between now and the world cup , according to media reports .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.07.2004 germany remembers plot to kill hitler großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler honors stauffenberg and the others tuesday marks the 60th anniversary of claus schenk graf von stauffenberg 's attempt to assassinate hitler .
while some debate whether he acted out of personal interest or altruism , most germans are taking a positive view . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , an aristocratic colonel in the nazi army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military , including friedrich olbricht and henning von tresckow , plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power . shortly after noon on a hot summer day , stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's " wolf 's lair " hideaway -lrb- in what is today poland -rrb- , where the dictator was seated around a large wooden table with 22 other nazi officials . stauffenberg placed the briefcase under the table , made an excuse to leave , and watched the explosion from afar as he raced towards his getaway car .
confident he had completed his mission and an impending coup would soon place him and like-minded co-conspirators in power , stauffenberg made haste to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shortly after the botched assassination attempt against adolf hitler , july 20 , 1944 .
behind hitler to the left is martin bormann , to the far left is otto skorzeny .
on the right with the bandaged head is alfred jodl .
but , in what is largely viewed as one of the greatest tragedies in history , things did not work out that way .
miraculously , hitler survived the blast that killed four others , and the opposition 's poor planning , lack of support and hesitation at crucial moments played into the führer 's hands . by midnight - just twelve hours later - hitler had regained the upper hand and squashed the rebellion .
stauffenberg and three others were executed by firing squad in berlin .
in the coming weeks , an additional 140 people implicated in the plot were killed and more than 5,000 conspirators and political opponents were rounded-up . hero or traitor ? had stauffenberg been successful , the final phase of the war would certainly have gone differently .
the fact remains that more people died between the july assassination attempt and the end of the war than in the four-and-a-half years prior to that .
few doubt that hitler 's demise would not have seriously affected the german army 's ability to go on fighting , if not ended hostilities sooner and saved thousands of lives .
yet , stauffenberg 's place in history as a hero of the german resistance has not been so easily established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claus graf schenk von stauffenberg in 1940 with his children berthold , franz-ludwig und haimeran . in the initial decade after the end of the war , the german public largely viewed him as a traitor .
his wife was denied a pension , and no memorials were erected to mark the bravery of those within hitler 's own military establishment who risked their lives to set the country on a different course . in the 1960 's , as a younger generation of germans confronted their parents over their country 's nazi past , stauffenberg was not necessarily rehabilitated into an honorable symbol of the german resistance .
some were suspicious of his motives , accusing him of acting more out of self-interest , and less out of benevolent concern for the plight of the jews and other victims of nazi war crimes . a surge of new interest but as the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt approached , a number of new films , documentaries and books enlivened the debate and once again drew attention to stauffenberg and his band of subversives .
german public broadcaster swr produced a film by director jo baier entitled " stauffenberg , " which topped prime time ratings with a 23 percent audience share .
another german broadcaster produced a four-part documentary entitled " they wanted to kill hitler , " which proved equally popular .
numerous new autobiographies and books chronicling the event hit the shelves in bookstores . along with this surge of interest , the german public 's view , it seems , has also shifted .
according to a recent poll in the german news weekly spiegel more than 75 percent of germans surveyed said they esteem or admire stauffenberg and his co-conspirators . in what is perhaps a final nod of approval , german chancellor gerhard schröder presides over a ceremony on tuesday to mark the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt . perspectives change over time the german public 's growing esteem for stauffenberg and company begs the question : what 's changed ?
according to johannes tuchel , director of the german resistance memorial center in berlin , most germans were - implicitly , at least - hitler supporters , and those in the resistance were in the minority . " after the war , germany did not change its population , " he said in an interview with dw-world .
" now we have a new generation , and they are interested in what happened on july 20 , 1944 . " that interest has manifested itself in the spate of recent movies and books .
many are drawn to the material in the hopes of learning how a group of military officers changed their view of hitler radically enough to plot a coup . for that question , however , there is no easy answer .
" they had a broad spectrum of motivations , " says tuchel of those involved in the plot .
" some were social democrats , some former labor union activists , some had authoritarian goals . " two things , according to tuchel , united them : they wanted to re-establish the rule of law and end the war .
in the case of stauffenberg , tuchel says historical evidence proves that a growing disgust for nazi war crimes was his primary motivating factor . the german resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel jonah goldhagen , u.s. author of the book " hitler 's willing executioners . "
academics have long debated whether the guilt for nazi crimes should be borne individually , by those who committed the crimes , or collectively , by the german people .
in the 1997 book " hitler 's willing executioners , " us historian daniel goldhagen -lrb- photo -rrb- argued in favor of the theory of collective guilt .
not surprisingly , his theory proved highly controversial in germany .
it 's no wonder that the german public is fascinated by more inspiring tales of resistance . the german resistance memorial center in berlin features exhibitions on stauffenberg , as well as others like the " white rose " student movement which sprung up in munich .
but tuchel is careful not to exaggerate the size of the resistance , pointing out that hitler 's opponents - those willing to take action - were always in the minority .
" this was such a small operation , that the same man -lrb- stauffenberg -rrb- who planted the bomb , had to run back to berlin on the same day to help organize the coup , " he said . on tuesday afternoon , schröder will urge germans to remember stauffenberg and his network of co-conspirators .

while some debate whether he acted out of personal interest or altruism , most germans are taking a positive view . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , an aristocratic colonel in the nazi army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military , including friedrich olbricht and henning von tresckow , plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power . shortly after noon on a hot summer day , stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's " wolf 's lair " hideaway -lrb- in what is today poland -rrb- , where the dictator was seated around a large wooden table with 22 other nazi officials . stauffenberg placed the briefcase under the table , made an excuse to leave , and watched the explosion from afar as he raced towards his getaway car .
confident he had completed his mission and an impending coup would soon place him and like-minded co-conspirators in power , stauffenberg made haste to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shortly after the botched assassination attempt against adolf hitler , july 20 , 1944 .
behind hitler to the left is martin bormann , to the far left is otto skorzeny .
on the right with the bandaged head is alfred jodl .
but , in what is largely viewed as one of the greatest tragedies in history , things did not work out that way .
miraculously , hitler survived the blast that killed four others , and the opposition 's poor planning , lack of support and hesitation at crucial moments played into the führer 's hands . by midnight - just twelve hours later - hitler had regained the upper hand and squashed the rebellion .
stauffenberg and three others were executed by firing squad in berlin .
in the coming weeks , an additional 140 people implicated in the plot were killed and more than 5,000 conspirators and political opponents were rounded-up . hero or traitor ? had stauffenberg been successful , the final phase of the war would certainly have gone differently .
the fact remains that more people died between the july assassination attempt and the end of the war than in the four-and-a-half years prior to that .
few doubt that hitler 's demise would not have seriously affected the german army 's ability to go on fighting , if not ended hostilities sooner and saved thousands of lives .
yet , stauffenberg 's place in history as a hero of the german resistance has not been so easily established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claus graf schenk von stauffenberg in 1940 with his children berthold , franz-ludwig und haimeran . in the initial decade after the end of the war , the german public largely viewed him as a traitor .
his wife was denied a pension , and no memorials were erected to mark the bravery of those within hitler 's own military establishment who risked their lives to set the country on a different course . in the 1960 's , as a younger generation of germans confronted their parents over their country 's nazi past , stauffenberg was not necessarily rehabilitated into an honorable symbol of the german resistance .
some were suspicious of his motives , accusing him of acting more out of self-interest , and less out of benevolent concern for the plight of the jews and other victims of nazi war crimes . a surge of new interest but as the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt approached , a number of new films , documentaries and books enlivened the debate and once again drew attention to stauffenberg and his band of subversives .
german public broadcaster swr produced a film by director jo baier entitled " stauffenberg , " which topped prime time ratings with a 23 percent audience share .
another german broadcaster produced a four-part documentary entitled " they wanted to kill hitler , " which proved equally popular .
numerous new autobiographies and books chronicling the event hit the shelves in bookstores . along with this surge of interest , the german public 's view , it seems , has also shifted .
according to a recent poll in the german news weekly spiegel more than 75 percent of germans surveyed said they esteem or admire stauffenberg and his co-conspirators . in what is perhaps a final nod of approval , german chancellor gerhard schröder presides over a ceremony on tuesday to mark the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt . perspectives change over time the german public 's growing esteem for stauffenberg and company begs the question : what 's changed ?
according to johannes tuchel , director of the german resistance memorial center in berlin , most germans were - implicitly , at least - hitler supporters , and those in the resistance were in the minority . " after the war , germany did not change its population , " he said in an interview with dw-world .
" now we have a new generation , and they are interested in what happened on july 20 , 1944 . " that interest has manifested itself in the spate of recent movies and books .
many are drawn to the material in the hopes of learning how a group of military officers changed their view of hitler radically enough to plot a coup . for that question , however , there is no easy answer .
" they had a broad spectrum of motivations , " says tuchel of those involved in the plot .
" some were social democrats , some former labor union activists , some had authoritarian goals . " two things , according to tuchel , united them : they wanted to re-establish the rule of law and end the war .
in the case of stauffenberg , tuchel says historical evidence proves that a growing disgust for nazi war crimes was his primary motivating factor . the german resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel jonah goldhagen , u.s. author of the book " hitler 's willing executioners . "
academics have long debated whether the guilt for nazi crimes should be borne individually , by those who committed the crimes , or collectively , by the german people .
in the 1997 book " hitler 's willing executioners , " us historian daniel goldhagen -lrb- photo -rrb- argued in favor of the theory of collective guilt .
not surprisingly , his theory proved highly controversial in germany .
it 's no wonder that the german public is fascinated by more inspiring tales of resistance . the german resistance memorial center in berlin features exhibitions on stauffenberg , as well as others like the " white rose " student movement which sprung up in munich .
but tuchel is careful not to exaggerate the size of the resistance , pointing out that hitler 's opponents - those willing to take action - were always in the minority .
" this was such a small operation , that the same man -lrb- stauffenberg -rrb- who planted the bomb , had to run back to berlin on the same day to help organize the coup , " he said . on tuesday afternoon , schröder will urge germans to remember stauffenberg and his network of co-conspirators .

israeli television cited chirac as saying , " you are not welcome after your comments , . "
a spokeswoman for the french government said , according to agency reports , " a possible visit by the israeli prime minister to paris , for which no date has been set , will be examined only when the explanations called for have been provided " .
for its part , israel played down the spat , describing it as a " misunderstanding " .
however , ha 'aretz newspaper quoted sharon 's office as saying , " the prime minister reiterates there is anti-semitism in france , and despite the serious measures the french government is taking , he urges french jews to immigrate to israel - just as he urges all jews worldwide to immigrate to israel . "
sharon 's comments were roundly condemned by jewish groups throughout france as , in the words of one jewish leader , " pouring oil on the fire . "
the number of anti-semitic events in france has risen sharply in the first half of this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.07.2004 germany remembers plot to kill hitler großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler honors stauffenberg and the others tuesday marks the 60th anniversary of claus schenk graf von stauffenberg 's attempt to assassinate hitler .
while some debate whether he acted out of personal interest or altruism , most germans are taking a positive view . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , an aristocratic colonel in the nazi army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military , including friedrich olbricht and henning von tresckow , plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power . shortly after noon on a hot summer day , stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's " wolf 's lair " hideaway -lrb- in what is today poland -rrb- , where the dictator was seated around a large wooden table with 22 other nazi officials . stauffenberg placed the briefcase under the table , made an excuse to leave , and watched the explosion from afar as he raced towards his getaway car .
confident he had completed his mission and an impending coup would soon place him and like-minded co-conspirators in power , stauffenberg made haste to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shortly after the botched assassination attempt against adolf hitler , july 20 , 1944 .
behind hitler to the left is martin bormann , to the far left is otto skorzeny .
on the right with the bandaged head is alfred jodl .
but , in what is largely viewed as one of the greatest tragedies in history , things did not work out that way .
miraculously , hitler survived the blast that killed four others , and the opposition 's poor planning , lack of support and hesitation at crucial moments played into the führer 's hands . by midnight - just twelve hours later - hitler had regained the upper hand and squashed the rebellion .
stauffenberg and three others were executed by firing squad in berlin .
in the coming weeks , an additional 140 people implicated in the plot were killed and more than 5,000 conspirators and political opponents were rounded-up . hero or traitor ? had stauffenberg been successful , the final phase of the war would certainly have gone differently .
the fact remains that more people died between the july assassination attempt and the end of the war than in the four-and-a-half years prior to that .
few doubt that hitler 's demise would not have seriously affected the german army 's ability to go on fighting , if not ended hostilities sooner and saved thousands of lives .
yet , stauffenberg 's place in history as a hero of the german resistance has not been so easily established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claus graf schenk von stauffenberg in 1940 with his children berthold , franz-ludwig und haimeran . in the initial decade after the end of the war , the german public largely viewed him as a traitor .
his wife was denied a pension , and no memorials were erected to mark the bravery of those within hitler 's own military establishment who risked their lives to set the country on a different course . in the 1960 's , as a younger generation of germans confronted their parents over their country 's nazi past , stauffenberg was not necessarily rehabilitated into an honorable symbol of the german resistance .
some were suspicious of his motives , accusing him of acting more out of self-interest , and less out of benevolent concern for the plight of the jews and other victims of nazi war crimes . a surge of new interest but as the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt approached , a number of new films , documentaries and books enlivened the debate and once again drew attention to stauffenberg and his band of subversives .
german public broadcaster swr produced a film by director jo baier entitled " stauffenberg , " which topped prime time ratings with a 23 percent audience share .
another german broadcaster produced a four-part documentary entitled " they wanted to kill hitler , " which proved equally popular .
numerous new autobiographies and books chronicling the event hit the shelves in bookstores . along with this surge of interest , the german public 's view , it seems , has also shifted .
according to a recent poll in the german news weekly spiegel more than 75 percent of germans surveyed said they esteem or admire stauffenberg and his co-conspirators . in what is perhaps a final nod of approval , german chancellor gerhard schröder presides over a ceremony on tuesday to mark the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt . perspectives change over time the german public 's growing esteem for stauffenberg and company begs the question : what 's changed ?
according to johannes tuchel , director of the german resistance memorial center in berlin , most germans were - implicitly , at least - hitler supporters , and those in the resistance were in the minority . " after the war , germany did not change its population , " he said in an interview with dw-world .
" now we have a new generation , and they are interested in what happened on july 20 , 1944 . " that interest has manifested itself in the spate of recent movies and books .
many are drawn to the material in the hopes of learning how a group of military officers changed their view of hitler radically enough to plot a coup . for that question , however , there is no easy answer .
" they had a broad spectrum of motivations , " says tuchel of those involved in the plot .
" some were social democrats , some former labor union activists , some had authoritarian goals . " two things , according to tuchel , united them : they wanted to re-establish the rule of law and end the war .
in the case of stauffenberg , tuchel says historical evidence proves that a growing disgust for nazi war crimes was his primary motivating factor . the german resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel jonah goldhagen , u.s. author of the book " hitler 's willing executioners . "
academics have long debated whether the guilt for nazi crimes should be borne individually , by those who committed the crimes , or collectively , by the german people .
in the 1997 book " hitler 's willing executioners , " us historian daniel goldhagen -lrb- photo -rrb- argued in favor of the theory of collective guilt .
not surprisingly , his theory proved highly controversial in germany .
it 's no wonder that the german public is fascinated by more inspiring tales of resistance . the german resistance memorial center in berlin features exhibitions on stauffenberg , as well as others like the " white rose " student movement which sprung up in munich .
but tuchel is careful not to exaggerate the size of the resistance , pointing out that hitler 's opponents - those willing to take action - were always in the minority .
" this was such a small operation , that the same man -lrb- stauffenberg -rrb- who planted the bomb , had to run back to berlin on the same day to help organize the coup , " he said . on tuesday afternoon , schröder will urge germans to remember stauffenberg and his network of co-conspirators .

the new company , to be called sonybmg , will be the world 's second largest music label , behind universal music . if the merger actually goes ahead , the market will be carved up between four instead of five majors : vivendi 's universal , the newly-created sonybmg , warner and emi .
together they would share around 80 percent of european recorded music sales . sources say the german-japanese tie-up should also win approval from the us federal trade commission within days . the european and us competition authorities have run parallel investigations into the merger , which will create the world 's largest music company in terms of market share according to 2003 figures . the 50:50 merger will bring together sony stars such as barbara streisand and beyonce and bmg stars , including elvis presley and christina aguilera . massive job cuts expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated music cds the japanese and german parent groups argue that their businesses need to join forces to tackle the crisis in the global music industry faced with both pirate cds and an explosion of illegal music downloading . but the latest case of media consolidation comes at a cost .

the new company , to be called sonybmg , will be the world 's second largest music label , behind universal music . if the merger actually goes ahead , the market will be carved up between four instead of five majors : vivendi 's universal , the newly-created sonybmg , warner and emi .
together they would share around 80 percent of european recorded music sales . sources say the german-japanese tie-up should also win approval from the us federal trade commission within days . the european and us competition authorities have run parallel investigations into the merger , which will create the world 's largest music company in terms of market share according to 2003 figures . the 50:50 merger will bring together sony stars such as barbara streisand and beyonce and bmg stars , including elvis presley and christina aguilera . massive job cuts expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated music cds the japanese and german parent groups argue that their businesses need to join forces to tackle the crisis in the global music industry faced with both pirate cds and an explosion of illegal music downloading . but the latest case of media consolidation comes at a cost .
according to reports , sony and bmg plan to axe a quarter of their joint workforce , or some 3,000 jobs , once the tie-up has been approved . at sonybmg the overhaul will produce one-off costs of $ 300 million to 350 million dollars -lrb- € 244 million to € 284 million -rrb- , mainly covering severance terms for a large portion of the group 's employees , the financial times reported last week . executives at bertelsmann , hoped to achieve 85 percent of the cutbacks by next june , it added .
but detailed plans for cost-cutting measures will begin only after competition authorities cleared the merger . brussels does an about-face the brussels green light comes four years after the european commission effectively blocked another music tie-up , between emi and time warner . initially the commission appeared to be preparing a red light for the sony / bmg tie-up as well .
in may eu competition commissioner mario monti -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a preliminary assessment that it would be " incompatible " with eu rules . many also expressed concern that such a deal would lead to fewer consumer choices on the market and endanger the nascent legal online music downloading trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for competition mario monti but the man who made a name for himself after taking on microsoft softened his tone after closed-door talks with the two sides and several independent labels in brussels .
inside sources say monti apparently secured guarantees that the merger would not lead to reduced competition and thus higher prices for consumers . critics of the deal and independent recording companies remain concerned .
impala , an umbrella group representing more than 2,000 independent labels said the merger would further reduce smaller companies ' ability to give up-and-coming artists exposure .
it has threatened to take legal action to have the brussels decision overturned . bmg is in a strong position as it prepares for the tie-up .
it posted record operating profits of € 30 million -lrb- $ 37.4 million -rrb- in the first half of this year , der spiegel newsmagazine reported in its latest edition .
the result , the best six month figures in its history , puts bmg in a strong position for negotiating the deal with sony music , with the two sides expected to meet this week on a reorganization after the brussels decision .
andreas gravermeyer , spokesman for bertelsmann ag , said the the entire industry will benefit from the merger , because it will " create a recording music business better able to serve artists and consumers in the rapidly changing market . "
as to bertelsmann 's own benefits from the tie-up , gravermeyer said after the deal goes through , the company will enjoy " a leading market position in all its core businesses .

the chancellor should let it be , some experts say a recent bout of mergers involving european companies has some calling for government intervention to help german companies on the international market .
but monopoly watchdogs reject that idea . earlier this year when the french company sanofi took over the german-french pharmaceutical giant aventis - with support from the french govenment - not only were eyebrows raised here in germany , but the government was pressured to help german companies compete on the international market . however , the german monopoly commission thinks otherwise .
this body of government-appointed experts is charged with observing the development of competition in germany and rejects the promotion of so called “ national champions . ” france may have spent billions of euros propping its heavy industry , it sector and the likes of the concorde .
but martin hellwig , the head of germany ’ s monopoly commission , believes the german government should not make the same mistakes .
he even argues that the government is not the right body to identify the national industrial champions of the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal production has long been a heavily subsidized industry in germany " typically government aims to subsidize or give privileges to certain companies tends to be directed towards industries of the past or to politically well connected industries , " he said , adding that factories in important constituencies that are critical for elections are an example .
" it has nothing to do with a good use of public resources for economic policy . “ companies , not economies , compete hellwig said the idea of trying to strengthen germany ’ s international competitiveness by using subsidies to turn companies into global players is wrong .
he said it is companies and not economies which compete internationally .
he points out that national champions could even harm the national market . " a policy that is directed to helping some firms , even if it is directed to helping some firms internationally , tends to burden others , " he said .
" because prices adjust , exchange rates adjust , wages adjust and the changes in economic structure that are induced are beyond the government ’ s ability to forsee .
they simply don ’ t have the information to do the right thing . “ as a general rule , competition policy is in the hands of the cartel office and the german regulatory authorities which apply the laws against restraints to competition .
they do so very ably , but at the same time the german government prevents more competition in several areas , hellwig said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unidentified managers of deutsche post show a airplane-model of the daughter company dhl " in certain areas , where it is a question of changing laws , a question of adapting systems , liberalizing industries , getting rid of post monopolies like telecommunications , the postal system , the energy sector , the government , indeed , has been a bit too prone to maintaining incumbents of the past , " he said , adding that this happened partly for fiscal reasons or furthering national champions . " after all , the government is still a major shareholder , " he said , citing the emergence of deutsche post as a global player in the logistics field . liberalization fails to bring more competition hellwig pointed out that another example is the energy market where liberalization didn ’ t bring about more competition in germany . " germany unlike the united kingdom has chosen not to vertically disintegrate the industry into companies managing networks , manging electricity grids and companies managing electricity production and distribution , " he said .
" so the network owners are parts of corporations that also produce and sell electricity and they use the transmission fees as a tool to keep competition out . “ when the liberalization process in the german energy market began three years ago , germany was the only eu-country without a regulatory authority in this field .
and regulating will only start next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this may be too late in the energy sector as german transmission prices of electricity are already excessive and among the highest in europe . in part this has been made possible and legalized by the government .
it was no surprise when vattenfall europe , one of only four companies dominating the german energy market , announced last week to increase transmission prices by another 20 percent next year . telecommunications law under criticism also coming in for criticism from the monopoly commission is germany ’ s telecommunications law .
hellwig said it ’ s structure and regulations introduce many changes with lots of legal uncertainty and will work in favour of the incumbent and to the disadvantage of the competitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " as long as prices are fixed under a price-cap regime where the regulatory authority sets just an upper bound for an overall index of prices , under the new law the incumbent is perfectly free to use any price to discourage entry , to impede competitors , even if it is a price below cost that would be regarded as predatory under ordinary competition law , “ he said . opposition politicians have welcomed the monopoly commission report and appealed to economics minister wolfgang clement and chancellor gerhard schröder to consider the commission ’ s proposed changes to the draft competition laws . steffen marquart -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu approves sony-bmg merger the european commission has given its green light tuesday to a merger between japan 's sony and the music arm of germany 's bertelsmann , in the latest global entertainment industry tie-up .

the chancellor should let it be , some experts say a recent bout of mergers involving european companies has some calling for government intervention to help german companies on the international market .
but monopoly watchdogs reject that idea . earlier this year when the french company sanofi took over the german-french pharmaceutical giant aventis - with support from the french govenment - not only were eyebrows raised here in germany , but the government was pressured to help german companies compete on the international market . however , the german monopoly commission thinks otherwise .
this body of government-appointed experts is charged with observing the development of competition in germany and rejects the promotion of so called “ national champions . ” france may have spent billions of euros propping its heavy industry , it sector and the likes of the concorde .
but martin hellwig , the head of germany ’ s monopoly commission , believes the german government should not make the same mistakes .
he even argues that the government is not the right body to identify the national industrial champions of the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal production has long been a heavily subsidized industry in germany " typically government aims to subsidize or give privileges to certain companies tends to be directed towards industries of the past or to politically well connected industries , " he said , adding that factories in important constituencies that are critical for elections are an example .
" it has nothing to do with a good use of public resources for economic policy . “ companies , not economies , compete hellwig said the idea of trying to strengthen germany ’ s international competitiveness by using subsidies to turn companies into global players is wrong .
he said it is companies and not economies which compete internationally .
he points out that national champions could even harm the national market . " a policy that is directed to helping some firms , even if it is directed to helping some firms internationally , tends to burden others , " he said .
" because prices adjust , exchange rates adjust , wages adjust and the changes in economic structure that are induced are beyond the government ’ s ability to forsee .
they simply don ’ t have the information to do the right thing . “ as a general rule , competition policy is in the hands of the cartel office and the german regulatory authorities which apply the laws against restraints to competition .
they do so very ably , but at the same time the german government prevents more competition in several areas , hellwig said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unidentified managers of deutsche post show a airplane-model of the daughter company dhl " in certain areas , where it is a question of changing laws , a question of adapting systems , liberalizing industries , getting rid of post monopolies like telecommunications , the postal system , the energy sector , the government , indeed , has been a bit too prone to maintaining incumbents of the past , " he said , adding that this happened partly for fiscal reasons or furthering national champions . " after all , the government is still a major shareholder , " he said , citing the emergence of deutsche post as a global player in the logistics field . liberalization fails to bring more competition hellwig pointed out that another example is the energy market where liberalization didn ’ t bring about more competition in germany . " germany unlike the united kingdom has chosen not to vertically disintegrate the industry into companies managing networks , manging electricity grids and companies managing electricity production and distribution , " he said .
" so the network owners are parts of corporations that also produce and sell electricity and they use the transmission fees as a tool to keep competition out . “ when the liberalization process in the german energy market began three years ago , germany was the only eu-country without a regulatory authority in this field .

it was no surprise when vattenfall europe , one of only four companies dominating the german energy market , announced last week to increase transmission prices by another 20 percent next year . telecommunications law under criticism also coming in for criticism from the monopoly commission is germany ’ s telecommunications law .
hellwig said it ’ s structure and regulations introduce many changes with lots of legal uncertainty and will work in favour of the incumbent and to the disadvantage of the competitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " as long as prices are fixed under a price-cap regime where the regulatory authority sets just an upper bound for an overall index of prices , under the new law the incumbent is perfectly free to use any price to discourage entry , to impede competitors , even if it is a price below cost that would be regarded as predatory under ordinary competition law , “ he said . opposition politicians have welcomed the monopoly commission report and appealed to economics minister wolfgang clement and chancellor gerhard schröder to consider the commission ’ s proposed changes to the draft competition laws . steffen marquart -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu approves sony-bmg merger the european commission has given its green light tuesday to a merger between japan 's sony and the music arm of germany 's bertelsmann , in the latest global entertainment industry tie-up .

the chancellor should let it be , some experts say a recent bout of mergers involving european companies has some calling for government intervention to help german companies on the international market .
but monopoly watchdogs reject that idea . earlier this year when the french company sanofi took over the german-french pharmaceutical giant aventis - with support from the french govenment - not only were eyebrows raised here in germany , but the government was pressured to help german companies compete on the international market . however , the german monopoly commission thinks otherwise .
this body of government-appointed experts is charged with observing the development of competition in germany and rejects the promotion of so called “ national champions . ” france may have spent billions of euros propping its heavy industry , it sector and the likes of the concorde .
but martin hellwig , the head of germany ’ s monopoly commission , believes the german government should not make the same mistakes .
he even argues that the government is not the right body to identify the national industrial champions of the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal production has long been a heavily subsidized industry in germany " typically government aims to subsidize or give privileges to certain companies tends to be directed towards industries of the past or to politically well connected industries , " he said , adding that factories in important constituencies that are critical for elections are an example .
" it has nothing to do with a good use of public resources for economic policy . “ companies , not economies , compete hellwig said the idea of trying to strengthen germany ’ s international competitiveness by using subsidies to turn companies into global players is wrong .
he said it is companies and not economies which compete internationally .
he points out that national champions could even harm the national market . " a policy that is directed to helping some firms , even if it is directed to helping some firms internationally , tends to burden others , " he said .
" because prices adjust , exchange rates adjust , wages adjust and the changes in economic structure that are induced are beyond the government ’ s ability to forsee .
they simply don ’ t have the information to do the right thing . “ as a general rule , competition policy is in the hands of the cartel office and the german regulatory authorities which apply the laws against restraints to competition .

" after all , the government is still a major shareholder , " he said , citing the emergence of deutsche post as a global player in the logistics field . liberalization fails to bring more competition hellwig pointed out that another example is the energy market where liberalization didn ’ t bring about more competition in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.07.2004 german media cleans stasi out of its closet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi spies were everywhere - even at public tv stations the long tentacles of east germany 's former state secret police , the stasi , not only reached the communist media , but infiltrated west german public broadcasters as well , a new study has found . three years ago , german public broadcaster ard launched a project that would be uncomfortable for many media organizations .
it assigned a team of researchers to uncover the ways the east german secret service sought to manipulate the west german organization 's news coverage during the cold war and whether it sought to recruit its journalists as spies .
it 's long been known that some west german media workers did spy for the stasi , but a report released on monday shines a veritable floodlight on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rows and rows of files in the state-run agency for housing stasi archives .
the study , commissioned by ard and produced in tandem with the state-run agency responsible for the stasi archives and historians at berlin 's free university , comprises over 1,000 pages of proof that the stasi skipped no opportunity to control the mass media in its own country and also manipulate and infiltrate radio and tv stations in west germany during the communist era .
a propaganda machine however , the report found that despite massive efforts to influence the programming of west german public broadcasters , it never succeeded in doing so .
additionally , it found , none of the informants working with the stasi served in senior positions or on boards responsible for high-level programming decisions .
nevertheless , the study did conclude that the communist party had been successful in promulgating disinformation on domestic policy issues that did often find its way into news reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler of the stasi archive marianne birthler , director of the federal authority that serves as guardian of the stasi archive , praised the study as a good example of germans working through their past .
" the study is a unique project , " she said .
" there is no other institution that has tried to work through its own past like this . "
the authors of the survey were able to tap into new archived material that was only made available to germany by the united states in 2003 .
after years of negotiations , the us administration returned the stasi ’ s so-called " rosewood " files , which contain the names of over 50,000 potential undercover agents , among them an estimated 12,000 from the west .
revelations damage journalists the study adds more names to the list of those east german journalists whom the stasi used as informers , bringing the total to 42 .
many other eastern german journalists have already taken leave after revelations about their involvement with the stasi surfaced .
the report also cited 61 west german spies , a high number , but lower than some ard officials had expected .
mixed motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while east german journalists may have acted under enormous stasi pressure , west german journalists working for the stasi often had other motives , offering their services for money or out of anti-capitalist or communist convictions .
according to the study , the list of those west german journalists who collaborated with the stasi is astonishingly long .
it is also feeding considerable public interest .
many are interested in the subject , " because a spy network is involved and of course there are a lot of interesting and fascinating stories about the attempt of the stasi to undermine broadcasting enterprises , " the director of an ard-affiliated tv network in the west , fritz pleitgen , said .
" we found that the strategy in the activity of the stasi was so gigantic - and we did n't expect that . "
terrorist plots ?
in some instances , the data exchange went far beyond journalism .
jochen staadt of berlin ’ s free university and co-author of the study reported on cases where west german stasi spies delivered information on how to blow up broadcasting houses in the west and kill or deport journalists in the event of a political crisis .
" what they collected was material to use to intervene in a situation of crisis in west germany and west berlin , " he explained .
" they would have done this .
we know that they supported terrorist organizations in west germany and they had no problem using violence against institutions and people .

the " rosewood " files are expected to shed light on thousands of hitherto unexposed stasi spies .
-lrb- july 9 , 2003 -rrb- famed journalist accused of stasi ties files from the former east german secret police released by the cia two months ago suggest that one of west germany 's best-known investigative journalists may have been an informant for the stasi .

it assigned a team of researchers to uncover the ways the east german secret service sought to manipulate the west german organization 's news coverage during the cold war and whether it sought to recruit its journalists as spies .
it 's long been known that some west german media workers did spy for the stasi , but a report released on monday shines a veritable floodlight on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rows and rows of files in the state-run agency for housing stasi archives .
the study , commissioned by ard and produced in tandem with the state-run agency responsible for the stasi archives and historians at berlin 's free university , comprises over 1,000 pages of proof that the stasi skipped no opportunity to control the mass media in its own country and also manipulate and infiltrate radio and tv stations in west germany during the communist era .
a propaganda machine however , the report found that despite massive efforts to influence the programming of west german public broadcasters , it never succeeded in doing so .
additionally , it found , none of the informants working with the stasi served in senior positions or on boards responsible for high-level programming decisions .
nevertheless , the study did conclude that the communist party had been successful in promulgating disinformation on domestic policy issues that did often find its way into news reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler of the stasi archive marianne birthler , director of the federal authority that serves as guardian of the stasi archive , praised the study as a good example of germans working through their past .
" the study is a unique project , " she said .
" there is no other institution that has tried to work through its own past like this . "
the authors of the survey were able to tap into new archived material that was only made available to germany by the united states in 2003 .
after years of negotiations , the us administration returned the stasi ’ s so-called " rosewood " files , which contain the names of over 50,000 potential undercover agents , among them an estimated 12,000 from the west .
revelations damage journalists the study adds more names to the list of those east german journalists whom the stasi used as informers , bringing the total to 42 .
many other eastern german journalists have already taken leave after revelations about their involvement with the stasi surfaced .
the report also cited 61 west german spies , a high number , but lower than some ard officials had expected .
mixed motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while east german journalists may have acted under enormous stasi pressure , west german journalists working for the stasi often had other motives , offering their services for money or out of anti-capitalist or communist convictions .
according to the study , the list of those west german journalists who collaborated with the stasi is astonishingly long .
it is also feeding considerable public interest .
many are interested in the subject , " because a spy network is involved and of course there are a lot of interesting and fascinating stories about the attempt of the stasi to undermine broadcasting enterprises , " the director of an ard-affiliated tv network in the west , fritz pleitgen , said .
" we found that the strategy in the activity of the stasi was so gigantic - and we did n't expect that . "

in some instances , the data exchange went far beyond journalism .
jochen staadt of berlin ’ s free university and co-author of the study reported on cases where west german stasi spies delivered information on how to blow up broadcasting houses in the west and kill or deport journalists in the event of a political crisis .
" what they collected was material to use to intervene in a situation of crisis in west germany and west berlin , " he explained .

it assigned a team of researchers to uncover the ways the east german secret service sought to manipulate the west german organization 's news coverage during the cold war and whether it sought to recruit its journalists as spies .
it 's long been known that some west german media workers did spy for the stasi , but a report released on monday shines a veritable floodlight on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rows and rows of files in the state-run agency for housing stasi archives .
the study , commissioned by ard and produced in tandem with the state-run agency responsible for the stasi archives and historians at berlin 's free university , comprises over 1,000 pages of proof that the stasi skipped no opportunity to control the mass media in its own country and also manipulate and infiltrate radio and tv stations in west germany during the communist era .
a propaganda machine however , the report found that despite massive efforts to influence the programming of west german public broadcasters , it never succeeded in doing so .
additionally , it found , none of the informants working with the stasi served in senior positions or on boards responsible for high-level programming decisions .
nevertheless , the study did conclude that the communist party had been successful in promulgating disinformation on domestic policy issues that did often find its way into news reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler of the stasi archive marianne birthler , director of the federal authority that serves as guardian of the stasi archive , praised the study as a good example of germans working through their past .
" the study is a unique project , " she said .
" there is no other institution that has tried to work through its own past like this . "
the authors of the survey were able to tap into new archived material that was only made available to germany by the united states in 2003 .
after years of negotiations , the us administration returned the stasi ’ s so-called " rosewood " files , which contain the names of over 50,000 potential undercover agents , among them an estimated 12,000 from the west .
revelations damage journalists the study adds more names to the list of those east german journalists whom the stasi used as informers , bringing the total to 42 .
many other eastern german journalists have already taken leave after revelations about their involvement with the stasi surfaced .
the report also cited 61 west german spies , a high number , but lower than some ard officials had expected .
mixed motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while east german journalists may have acted under enormous stasi pressure , west german journalists working for the stasi often had other motives , offering their services for money or out of anti-capitalist or communist convictions .
according to the study , the list of those west german journalists who collaborated with the stasi is astonishingly long .
it is also feeding considerable public interest .
many are interested in the subject , " because a spy network is involved and of course there are a lot of interesting and fascinating stories about the attempt of the stasi to undermine broadcasting enterprises , " the director of an ard-affiliated tv network in the west , fritz pleitgen , said .
" we found that the strategy in the activity of the stasi was so gigantic - and we did n't expect that . "

in some instances , the data exchange went far beyond journalism .
jochen staadt of berlin ’ s free university and co-author of the study reported on cases where west german stasi spies delivered information on how to blow up broadcasting houses in the west and kill or deport journalists in the event of a political crisis .

" let 's try this here , " he told his eu colleagues at a regular meeting in brussels on monday . last week , german and italian officials were struggling to do damage control after the head of a german aid organization and the capitain of the group 's ship , cap anamur , had been arrested on charges of illegally bringing africans to italy . the cap anamur crew had picked up the 37 refugees at sea after their dinghy had collapsed .
they waited three weeks until italy gave them the permission to enter a port in sicily . the german aid workers have since been released from jail but most of the africans face swift extradition to their home countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily in order to prevent similar situations in the future , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- now supports building centers in north africa that can handle such cases before people embark on the dangerous trip to europe . " i believe that north african countries also have to be interested in preventing things from continuing as they are , " schily said , adding that malta was planning to hold talks with libya about the refugee problem in the mediterranean .
similar talks could take place between spain and morocco , he suggested . according to schily , the new centers could hold people until a decision about their asylum request has been made . schily also said that saving people from drowing at sea was " naturally a duty , " but he added that refugees could not be brought to european ports automatically afterwards . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italian judge frees german aid workers three germans working for a charity organization that helped 37 african asylum-seekers reach italy this week were released by an italian judge on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 20.07.2004 german reality shows in need of reality check großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : come on down to the farm , but do n't hurt the cows reality shows are increasingly attracting the ire of critics - some who object to the way animals are treated on a new farm docu-soap , and others who worry about the effects such shows have on the human participants . " die alm " or " the alps , " is a sort of alpine-reality-docu-soap , in which a slew of german b-list celebrities gets down and dirty with everyday life on an alpine farm .
of course , no alpine pasture would be complete without real live farm animals , which provide the celebs with countless opportunities to boost ratings by engaging in gross-out stunts such as having goats lick syrup off their bodies , or sucking milk from a cow 's udder . but the last straw for german animal activists came when a recent episode showed a turkey being slaughtered .
now , the german society for the protection of animals -lrb- dtb -rrb- says it 's looking at taking legal steps against the show , which runs on munich-based private broadcaster , prosieben . " we do n't care if third-rate celebrities bathe in manure or throw themselves naked down a hillside , " said dtb head thomas schröder .
" but animals ca n't say yes or no .
the show has overstepped the legal and ethical boundaries . " prosieben is nonplussed but intends to continue airing the show as planned .
tuesday evening 's episode includes showing the candidates how to empty the intestines of a freshly slaughtered pig , for later use as sausage casings .
the executive in charge of the show , christian asanger , has even invited members of the animal society out to the mountain pasture .
" we have nothing to hide , " he said . makeover-shows also a target in a world where there 's no such thing as bad publicity , experts say such protests are a welcome additional marketing strategy for the shows , which thrive on high ratings and advertising revenue . if that 's true , then other german reality tv shows which feature plastic surgery and makeovers instead of farm animals can also expect a ratings boost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a big brother candidate prepares to go under the knife .
cologne-based private broadcaster rtl ii whipped up a storm of protest last week when it announced it would let candidates participating in its " big brother " reality show undergo cosmetic surgery .
the german association of plastic surgeons -lrb- vdäpc -rrb- objected , not just to " big brother , " but also to other makeover reality shows that recently hit the german airwaves . in mtv 's " i want a famous face , " teens put themselves at the mercy of plastic surgeons in order to wake up looking like stars such as brad pitt or kate winslet .
prosieben 's " the swan " is a reality tv-show format imported from the us , in which ugly ducklings are turned into … well , swans , with the help of plastic surgeons , fitness trainers , nutritionists and psychologists .
the most beautiful " swan " to emerge out of the 16 candidates wins a modeling contract . do n't blame plastic surgeons these shows are giving plastic surgery a bad name , according to the vdäpc .
" what we do is medical work .

" die alm " or " the alps , " is a sort of alpine-reality-docu-soap , in which a slew of german b-list celebrities gets down and dirty with everyday life on an alpine farm .
of course , no alpine pasture would be complete without real live farm animals , which provide the celebs with countless opportunities to boost ratings by engaging in gross-out stunts such as having goats lick syrup off their bodies , or sucking milk from a cow 's udder . but the last straw for german animal activists came when a recent episode showed a turkey being slaughtered .

the new company , to be called sonybmg , will be the world 's second largest music label , behind universal music . if the merger actually goes ahead , the market will be carved up between four instead of five majors : vivendi 's universal , the newly-created sonybmg , warner and emi .
together they would share around 80 percent of european recorded music sales . sources say the german-japanese tie-up should also win approval from the us federal trade commission within days . the european and us competition authorities have run parallel investigations into the merger , which will create the world 's largest music company in terms of market share according to 2003 figures . the 50:50 merger will bring together sony stars such as barbara streisand and beyonce and bmg stars , including elvis presley and christina aguilera . massive job cuts expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated music cds the japanese and german parent groups argue that their businesses need to join forces to tackle the crisis in the global music industry faced with both pirate cds and an explosion of illegal music downloading . but the latest case of media consolidation comes at a cost .
according to reports , sony and bmg plan to axe a quarter of their joint workforce , or some 3,000 jobs , once the tie-up has been approved . at sonybmg the overhaul will produce one-off costs of $ 300 million to 350 million dollars -lrb- € 244 million to € 284 million -rrb- , mainly covering severance terms for a large portion of the group 's employees , the financial times reported last week . executives at bertelsmann , hoped to achieve 85 percent of the cutbacks by next june , it added .
but detailed plans for cost-cutting measures will begin only after competition authorities cleared the merger . brussels does an about-face the brussels green light comes four years after the european commission effectively blocked another music tie-up , between emi and time warner . initially the commission appeared to be preparing a red light for the sony / bmg tie-up as well .

it posted record operating profits of € 30 million -lrb- $ 37.4 million -rrb- in the first half of this year , der spiegel newsmagazine reported in its latest edition .
the result , the best six month figures in its history , puts bmg in a strong position for negotiating the deal with sony music , with the two sides expected to meet this week on a reorganization after the brussels decision .
andreas gravermeyer , spokesman for bertelsmann ag , said the the entire industry will benefit from the merger , because it will " create a recording music business better able to serve artists and consumers in the rapidly changing market . "

together they would share around 80 percent of european recorded music sales . sources say the german-japanese tie-up should also win approval from the us federal trade commission within days . the european and us competition authorities have run parallel investigations into the merger , which will create the world 's largest music company in terms of market share according to 2003 figures . the 50:50 merger will bring together sony stars such as barbara streisand and beyonce and bmg stars , including elvis presley and christina aguilera . massive job cuts expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated music cds the japanese and german parent groups argue that their businesses need to join forces to tackle the crisis in the global music industry faced with both pirate cds and an explosion of illegal music downloading . but the latest case of media consolidation comes at a cost .
according to reports , sony and bmg plan to axe a quarter of their joint workforce , or some 3,000 jobs , once the tie-up has been approved . at sonybmg the overhaul will produce one-off costs of $ 300 million to 350 million dollars -lrb- € 244 million to € 284 million -rrb- , mainly covering severance terms for a large portion of the group 's employees , the financial times reported last week . executives at bertelsmann , hoped to achieve 85 percent of the cutbacks by next june , it added .
but detailed plans for cost-cutting measures will begin only after competition authorities cleared the merger . brussels does an about-face the brussels green light comes four years after the european commission effectively blocked another music tie-up , between emi and time warner . initially the commission appeared to be preparing a red light for the sony / bmg tie-up as well .
in may eu competition commissioner mario monti -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a preliminary assessment that it would be " incompatible " with eu rules . many also expressed concern that such a deal would lead to fewer consumer choices on the market and endanger the nascent legal online music downloading trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for competition mario monti but the man who made a name for himself after taking on microsoft softened his tone after closed-door talks with the two sides and several independent labels in brussels .
inside sources say monti apparently secured guarantees that the merger would not lead to reduced competition and thus higher prices for consumers . critics of the deal and independent recording companies remain concerned .
impala , an umbrella group representing more than 2,000 independent labels said the merger would further reduce smaller companies ' ability to give up-and-coming artists exposure .
it has threatened to take legal action to have the brussels decision overturned . bmg is in a strong position as it prepares for the tie-up .
it posted record operating profits of € 30 million -lrb- $ 37.4 million -rrb- in the first half of this year , der spiegel newsmagazine reported in its latest edition .
the result , the best six month figures in its history , puts bmg in a strong position for negotiating the deal with sony music , with the two sides expected to meet this week on a reorganization after the brussels decision .
andreas gravermeyer , spokesman for bertelsmann ag , said the the entire industry will benefit from the merger , because it will " create a recording music business better able to serve artists and consumers in the rapidly changing market . "
as to bertelsmann 's own benefits from the tie-up , gravermeyer said after the deal goes through , the company will enjoy " a leading market position in all its core businesses .

while some debate whether he acted out of personal interest or altruism , most germans are taking a positive view . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , an aristocratic colonel in the nazi army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military , including friedrich olbricht and henning von tresckow , plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power . shortly after noon on a hot summer day , stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's " wolf 's lair " hideaway -lrb- in what is today poland -rrb- , where the dictator was seated around a large wooden table with 22 other nazi officials . stauffenberg placed the briefcase under the table , made an excuse to leave , and watched the explosion from afar as he raced towards his getaway car .
confident he had completed his mission and an impending coup would soon place him and like-minded co-conspirators in power , stauffenberg made haste to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shortly after the botched assassination attempt against adolf hitler , july 20 , 1944 .
behind hitler to the left is martin bormann , to the far left is otto skorzeny .
on the right with the bandaged head is alfred jodl .
but , in what is largely viewed as one of the greatest tragedies in history , things did not work out that way .
miraculously , hitler survived the blast that killed four others , and the opposition 's poor planning , lack of support and hesitation at crucial moments played into the führer 's hands . by midnight - just twelve hours later - hitler had regained the upper hand and squashed the rebellion .
stauffenberg and three others were executed by firing squad in berlin .
in the coming weeks , an additional 140 people implicated in the plot were killed and more than 5,000 conspirators and political opponents were rounded-up . hero or traitor ? had stauffenberg been successful , the final phase of the war would certainly have gone differently .
the fact remains that more people died between the july assassination attempt and the end of the war than in the four-and-a-half years prior to that .
few doubt that hitler 's demise would not have seriously affected the german army 's ability to go on fighting , if not ended hostilities sooner and saved thousands of lives .
yet , stauffenberg 's place in history as a hero of the german resistance has not been so easily established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claus graf schenk von stauffenberg in 1940 with his children berthold , franz-ludwig und haimeran . in the initial decade after the end of the war , the german public largely viewed him as a traitor .
his wife was denied a pension , and no memorials were erected to mark the bravery of those within hitler 's own military establishment who risked their lives to set the country on a different course . in the 1960 's , as a younger generation of germans confronted their parents over their country 's nazi past , stauffenberg was not necessarily rehabilitated into an honorable symbol of the german resistance .
some were suspicious of his motives , accusing him of acting more out of self-interest , and less out of benevolent concern for the plight of the jews and other victims of nazi war crimes . a surge of new interest but as the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt approached , a number of new films , documentaries and books enlivened the debate and once again drew attention to stauffenberg and his band of subversives .
german public broadcaster swr produced a film by director jo baier entitled " stauffenberg , " which topped prime time ratings with a 23 percent audience share .
another german broadcaster produced a four-part documentary entitled " they wanted to kill hitler , " which proved equally popular .
numerous new autobiographies and books chronicling the event hit the shelves in bookstores . along with this surge of interest , the german public 's view , it seems , has also shifted .
according to a recent poll in the german news weekly spiegel more than 75 percent of germans surveyed said they esteem or admire stauffenberg and his co-conspirators . in what is perhaps a final nod of approval , german chancellor gerhard schröder presides over a ceremony on tuesday to mark the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt . perspectives change over time the german public 's growing esteem for stauffenberg and company begs the question : what 's changed ?
according to johannes tuchel , director of the german resistance memorial center in berlin , most germans were - implicitly , at least - hitler supporters , and those in the resistance were in the minority . " after the war , germany did not change its population , " he said in an interview with dw-world .
" now we have a new generation , and they are interested in what happened on july 20 , 1944 . " that interest has manifested itself in the spate of recent movies and books .
many are drawn to the material in the hopes of learning how a group of military officers changed their view of hitler radically enough to plot a coup . for that question , however , there is no easy answer .
" they had a broad spectrum of motivations , " says tuchel of those involved in the plot .
" some were social democrats , some former labor union activists , some had authoritarian goals . " two things , according to tuchel , united them : they wanted to re-establish the rule of law and end the war .
in the case of stauffenberg , tuchel says historical evidence proves that a growing disgust for nazi war crimes was his primary motivating factor . the german resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel jonah goldhagen , u.s. author of the book " hitler 's willing executioners . "
academics have long debated whether the guilt for nazi crimes should be borne individually , by those who committed the crimes , or collectively , by the german people .
in the 1997 book " hitler 's willing executioners , " us historian daniel goldhagen -lrb- photo -rrb- argued in favor of the theory of collective guilt .
not surprisingly , his theory proved highly controversial in germany .
it 's no wonder that the german public is fascinated by more inspiring tales of resistance . the german resistance memorial center in berlin features exhibitions on stauffenberg , as well as others like the " white rose " student movement which sprung up in munich .
but tuchel is careful not to exaggerate the size of the resistance , pointing out that hitler 's opponents - those willing to take action - were always in the minority .
" this was such a small operation , that the same man -lrb- stauffenberg -rrb- who planted the bomb , had to run back to berlin on the same day to help organize the coup , " he said . on tuesday afternoon , schröder will urge germans to remember stauffenberg and his network of co-conspirators .

while some debate whether he acted out of personal interest or altruism , most germans are taking a positive view . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , an aristocratic colonel in the nazi army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military , including friedrich olbricht and henning von tresckow , plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power . shortly after noon on a hot summer day , stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's " wolf 's lair " hideaway -lrb- in what is today poland -rrb- , where the dictator was seated around a large wooden table with 22 other nazi officials . stauffenberg placed the briefcase under the table , made an excuse to leave , and watched the explosion from afar as he raced towards his getaway car .
confident he had completed his mission and an impending coup would soon place him and like-minded co-conspirators in power , stauffenberg made haste to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shortly after the botched assassination attempt against adolf hitler , july 20 , 1944 .
behind hitler to the left is martin bormann , to the far left is otto skorzeny .
on the right with the bandaged head is alfred jodl .
but , in what is largely viewed as one of the greatest tragedies in history , things did not work out that way .
miraculously , hitler survived the blast that killed four others , and the opposition 's poor planning , lack of support and hesitation at crucial moments played into the führer 's hands . by midnight - just twelve hours later - hitler had regained the upper hand and squashed the rebellion .
stauffenberg and three others were executed by firing squad in berlin .
in the coming weeks , an additional 140 people implicated in the plot were killed and more than 5,000 conspirators and political opponents were rounded-up . hero or traitor ? had stauffenberg been successful , the final phase of the war would certainly have gone differently .
the fact remains that more people died between the july assassination attempt and the end of the war than in the four-and-a-half years prior to that .
few doubt that hitler 's demise would not have seriously affected the german army 's ability to go on fighting , if not ended hostilities sooner and saved thousands of lives .
yet , stauffenberg 's place in history as a hero of the german resistance has not been so easily established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claus graf schenk von stauffenberg in 1940 with his children berthold , franz-ludwig und haimeran . in the initial decade after the end of the war , the german public largely viewed him as a traitor .
his wife was denied a pension , and no memorials were erected to mark the bravery of those within hitler 's own military establishment who risked their lives to set the country on a different course . in the 1960 's , as a younger generation of germans confronted their parents over their country 's nazi past , stauffenberg was not necessarily rehabilitated into an honorable symbol of the german resistance .
some were suspicious of his motives , accusing him of acting more out of self-interest , and less out of benevolent concern for the plight of the jews and other victims of nazi war crimes . a surge of new interest but as the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt approached , a number of new films , documentaries and books enlivened the debate and once again drew attention to stauffenberg and his band of subversives .
german public broadcaster swr produced a film by director jo baier entitled " stauffenberg , " which topped prime time ratings with a 23 percent audience share .
another german broadcaster produced a four-part documentary entitled " they wanted to kill hitler , " which proved equally popular .
numerous new autobiographies and books chronicling the event hit the shelves in bookstores . along with this surge of interest , the german public 's view , it seems , has also shifted .
according to a recent poll in the german news weekly spiegel more than 75 percent of germans surveyed said they esteem or admire stauffenberg and his co-conspirators . in what is perhaps a final nod of approval , german chancellor gerhard schröder presides over a ceremony on tuesday to mark the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt . perspectives change over time the german public 's growing esteem for stauffenberg and company begs the question : what 's changed ?
according to johannes tuchel , director of the german resistance memorial center in berlin , most germans were - implicitly , at least - hitler supporters , and those in the resistance were in the minority . " after the war , germany did not change its population , " he said in an interview with dw-world .
" now we have a new generation , and they are interested in what happened on july 20 , 1944 . " that interest has manifested itself in the spate of recent movies and books .
many are drawn to the material in the hopes of learning how a group of military officers changed their view of hitler radically enough to plot a coup . for that question , however , there is no easy answer .
" they had a broad spectrum of motivations , " says tuchel of those involved in the plot .
" some were social democrats , some former labor union activists , some had authoritarian goals . " two things , according to tuchel , united them : they wanted to re-establish the rule of law and end the war .
in the case of stauffenberg , tuchel says historical evidence proves that a growing disgust for nazi war crimes was his primary motivating factor . the german resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel jonah goldhagen , u.s. author of the book " hitler 's willing executioners . "
academics have long debated whether the guilt for nazi crimes should be borne individually , by those who committed the crimes , or collectively , by the german people .
in the 1997 book " hitler 's willing executioners , " us historian daniel goldhagen -lrb- photo -rrb- argued in favor of the theory of collective guilt .
not surprisingly , his theory proved highly controversial in germany .
it 's no wonder that the german public is fascinated by more inspiring tales of resistance . the german resistance memorial center in berlin features exhibitions on stauffenberg , as well as others like the " white rose " student movement which sprung up in munich .
but tuchel is careful not to exaggerate the size of the resistance , pointing out that hitler 's opponents - those willing to take action - were always in the minority .
" this was such a small operation , that the same man -lrb- stauffenberg -rrb- who planted the bomb , had to run back to berlin on the same day to help organize the coup , " he said . on tuesday afternoon , schröder will urge germans to remember stauffenberg and his network of co-conspirators .

increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military , including friedrich olbricht and henning von tresckow , plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power . shortly after noon on a hot summer day , stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's " wolf 's lair " hideaway -lrb- in what is today poland -rrb- , where the dictator was seated around a large wooden table with 22 other nazi officials . stauffenberg placed the briefcase under the table , made an excuse to leave , and watched the explosion from afar as he raced towards his getaway car .
confident he had completed his mission and an impending coup would soon place him and like-minded co-conspirators in power , stauffenberg made haste to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shortly after the botched assassination attempt against adolf hitler , july 20 , 1944 .
behind hitler to the left is martin bormann , to the far left is otto skorzeny .
on the right with the bandaged head is alfred jodl .
but , in what is largely viewed as one of the greatest tragedies in history , things did not work out that way .
miraculously , hitler survived the blast that killed four others , and the opposition 's poor planning , lack of support and hesitation at crucial moments played into the führer 's hands . by midnight - just twelve hours later - hitler had regained the upper hand and squashed the rebellion .
stauffenberg and three others were executed by firing squad in berlin .
in the coming weeks , an additional 140 people implicated in the plot were killed and more than 5,000 conspirators and political opponents were rounded-up . hero or traitor ? had stauffenberg been successful , the final phase of the war would certainly have gone differently .
the fact remains that more people died between the july assassination attempt and the end of the war than in the four-and-a-half years prior to that .
few doubt that hitler 's demise would not have seriously affected the german army 's ability to go on fighting , if not ended hostilities sooner and saved thousands of lives .
yet , stauffenberg 's place in history as a hero of the german resistance has not been so easily established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claus graf schenk von stauffenberg in 1940 with his children berthold , franz-ludwig und haimeran . in the initial decade after the end of the war , the german public largely viewed him as a traitor .
his wife was denied a pension , and no memorials were erected to mark the bravery of those within hitler 's own military establishment who risked their lives to set the country on a different course . in the 1960 's , as a younger generation of germans confronted their parents over their country 's nazi past , stauffenberg was not necessarily rehabilitated into an honorable symbol of the german resistance .
some were suspicious of his motives , accusing him of acting more out of self-interest , and less out of benevolent concern for the plight of the jews and other victims of nazi war crimes . a surge of new interest but as the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt approached , a number of new films , documentaries and books enlivened the debate and once again drew attention to stauffenberg and his band of subversives .
german public broadcaster swr produced a film by director jo baier entitled " stauffenberg , " which topped prime time ratings with a 23 percent audience share .
another german broadcaster produced a four-part documentary entitled " they wanted to kill hitler , " which proved equally popular .
numerous new autobiographies and books chronicling the event hit the shelves in bookstores . along with this surge of interest , the german public 's view , it seems , has also shifted .
according to a recent poll in the german news weekly spiegel more than 75 percent of germans surveyed said they esteem or admire stauffenberg and his co-conspirators . in what is perhaps a final nod of approval , german chancellor gerhard schröder presides over a ceremony on tuesday to mark the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt . perspectives change over time the german public 's growing esteem for stauffenberg and company begs the question : what 's changed ?
according to johannes tuchel , director of the german resistance memorial center in berlin , most germans were - implicitly , at least - hitler supporters , and those in the resistance were in the minority . " after the war , germany did not change its population , " he said in an interview with dw-world .
" now we have a new generation , and they are interested in what happened on july 20 , 1944 . " that interest has manifested itself in the spate of recent movies and books .
many are drawn to the material in the hopes of learning how a group of military officers changed their view of hitler radically enough to plot a coup . for that question , however , there is no easy answer .
" they had a broad spectrum of motivations , " says tuchel of those involved in the plot .
" some were social democrats , some former labor union activists , some had authoritarian goals . " two things , according to tuchel , united them : they wanted to re-establish the rule of law and end the war .
in the case of stauffenberg , tuchel says historical evidence proves that a growing disgust for nazi war crimes was his primary motivating factor . the german resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel jonah goldhagen , u.s. author of the book " hitler 's willing executioners . "
academics have long debated whether the guilt for nazi crimes should be borne individually , by those who committed the crimes , or collectively , by the german people .
in the 1997 book " hitler 's willing executioners , " us historian daniel goldhagen -lrb- photo -rrb- argued in favor of the theory of collective guilt .
not surprisingly , his theory proved highly controversial in germany .
it 's no wonder that the german public is fascinated by more inspiring tales of resistance . the german resistance memorial center in berlin features exhibitions on stauffenberg , as well as others like the " white rose " student movement which sprung up in munich .
but tuchel is careful not to exaggerate the size of the resistance , pointing out that hitler 's opponents - those willing to take action - were always in the minority .
" this was such a small operation , that the same man -lrb- stauffenberg -rrb- who planted the bomb , had to run back to berlin on the same day to help organize the coup , " he said . on tuesday afternoon , schröder will urge germans to remember stauffenberg and his network of co-conspirators .
how they choose to recall the event will remain a matter of ongoing debate . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historical reference work delves into scholars ' past the " international encyclopaedia of german studies scholars " has triggered a national debate on the nazi past of several high-profile scholars , and it has n't even been published yet .

it assigned a team of researchers to uncover the ways the east german secret service sought to manipulate the west german organization 's news coverage during the cold war and whether it sought to recruit its journalists as spies .
it 's long been known that some west german media workers did spy for the stasi , but a report released on monday shines a veritable floodlight on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rows and rows of files in the state-run agency for housing stasi archives .
the study , commissioned by ard and produced in tandem with the state-run agency responsible for the stasi archives and historians at berlin 's free university , comprises over 1,000 pages of proof that the stasi skipped no opportunity to control the mass media in its own country and also manipulate and infiltrate radio and tv stations in west germany during the communist era .
a propaganda machine however , the report found that despite massive efforts to influence the programming of west german public broadcasters , it never succeeded in doing so .
additionally , it found , none of the informants working with the stasi served in senior positions or on boards responsible for high-level programming decisions .
nevertheless , the study did conclude that the communist party had been successful in promulgating disinformation on domestic policy issues that did often find its way into news reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler of the stasi archive marianne birthler , director of the federal authority that serves as guardian of the stasi archive , praised the study as a good example of germans working through their past .
" the study is a unique project , " she said .
" there is no other institution that has tried to work through its own past like this . "
the authors of the survey were able to tap into new archived material that was only made available to germany by the united states in 2003 .
after years of negotiations , the us administration returned the stasi ’ s so-called " rosewood " files , which contain the names of over 50,000 potential undercover agents , among them an estimated 12,000 from the west .

many other eastern german journalists have already taken leave after revelations about their involvement with the stasi surfaced .

mixed motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while east german journalists may have acted under enormous stasi pressure , west german journalists working for the stasi often had other motives , offering their services for money or out of anti-capitalist or communist convictions .
according to the study , the list of those west german journalists who collaborated with the stasi is astonishingly long .
it is also feeding considerable public interest .
many are interested in the subject , " because a spy network is involved and of course there are a lot of interesting and fascinating stories about the attempt of the stasi to undermine broadcasting enterprises , " the director of an ard-affiliated tv network in the west , fritz pleitgen , said .
" we found that the strategy in the activity of the stasi was so gigantic - and we did n't expect that . "

in some instances , the data exchange went far beyond journalism .
jochen staadt of berlin ’ s free university and co-author of the study reported on cases where west german stasi spies delivered information on how to blow up broadcasting houses in the west and kill or deport journalists in the event of a political crisis .
" what they collected was material to use to intervene in a situation of crisis in west germany and west berlin , " he explained .

it assigned a team of researchers to uncover the ways the east german secret service sought to manipulate the west german organization 's news coverage during the cold war and whether it sought to recruit its journalists as spies .
it 's long been known that some west german media workers did spy for the stasi , but a report released on monday shines a veritable floodlight on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rows and rows of files in the state-run agency for housing stasi archives .
the study , commissioned by ard and produced in tandem with the state-run agency responsible for the stasi archives and historians at berlin 's free university , comprises over 1,000 pages of proof that the stasi skipped no opportunity to control the mass media in its own country and also manipulate and infiltrate radio and tv stations in west germany during the communist era .
a propaganda machine however , the report found that despite massive efforts to influence the programming of west german public broadcasters , it never succeeded in doing so .
additionally , it found , none of the informants working with the stasi served in senior positions or on boards responsible for high-level programming decisions .
nevertheless , the study did conclude that the communist party had been successful in promulgating disinformation on domestic policy issues that did often find its way into news reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler of the stasi archive marianne birthler , director of the federal authority that serves as guardian of the stasi archive , praised the study as a good example of germans working through their past .

mixed motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while east german journalists may have acted under enormous stasi pressure , west german journalists working for the stasi often had other motives , offering their services for money or out of anti-capitalist or communist convictions .
according to the study , the list of those west german journalists who collaborated with the stasi is astonishingly long .
it is also feeding considerable public interest .
many are interested in the subject , " because a spy network is involved and of course there are a lot of interesting and fascinating stories about the attempt of the stasi to undermine broadcasting enterprises , " the director of an ard-affiliated tv network in the west , fritz pleitgen , said .

the chancellor should let it be , some experts say a recent bout of mergers involving european companies has some calling for government intervention to help german companies on the international market .
but monopoly watchdogs reject that idea . earlier this year when the french company sanofi took over the german-french pharmaceutical giant aventis - with support from the french govenment - not only were eyebrows raised here in germany , but the government was pressured to help german companies compete on the international market . however , the german monopoly commission thinks otherwise .
this body of government-appointed experts is charged with observing the development of competition in germany and rejects the promotion of so called “ national champions . ” france may have spent billions of euros propping its heavy industry , it sector and the likes of the concorde .
but martin hellwig , the head of germany ’ s monopoly commission , believes the german government should not make the same mistakes .
he even argues that the government is not the right body to identify the national industrial champions of the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal production has long been a heavily subsidized industry in germany " typically government aims to subsidize or give privileges to certain companies tends to be directed towards industries of the past or to politically well connected industries , " he said , adding that factories in important constituencies that are critical for elections are an example .
" it has nothing to do with a good use of public resources for economic policy . “ companies , not economies , compete hellwig said the idea of trying to strengthen germany ’ s international competitiveness by using subsidies to turn companies into global players is wrong .
he said it is companies and not economies which compete internationally .
he points out that national champions could even harm the national market . " a policy that is directed to helping some firms , even if it is directed to helping some firms internationally , tends to burden others , " he said .
" because prices adjust , exchange rates adjust , wages adjust and the changes in economic structure that are induced are beyond the government ’ s ability to forsee .
they simply don ’ t have the information to do the right thing . “ as a general rule , competition policy is in the hands of the cartel office and the german regulatory authorities which apply the laws against restraints to competition .
they do so very ably , but at the same time the german government prevents more competition in several areas , hellwig said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unidentified managers of deutsche post show a airplane-model of the daughter company dhl " in certain areas , where it is a question of changing laws , a question of adapting systems , liberalizing industries , getting rid of post monopolies like telecommunications , the postal system , the energy sector , the government , indeed , has been a bit too prone to maintaining incumbents of the past , " he said , adding that this happened partly for fiscal reasons or furthering national champions . " after all , the government is still a major shareholder , " he said , citing the emergence of deutsche post as a global player in the logistics field . liberalization fails to bring more competition hellwig pointed out that another example is the energy market where liberalization didn ’ t bring about more competition in germany . " germany unlike the united kingdom has chosen not to vertically disintegrate the industry into companies managing networks , manging electricity grids and companies managing electricity production and distribution , " he said .
" so the network owners are parts of corporations that also produce and sell electricity and they use the transmission fees as a tool to keep competition out . “ when the liberalization process in the german energy market began three years ago , germany was the only eu-country without a regulatory authority in this field .
and regulating will only start next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this may be too late in the energy sector as german transmission prices of electricity are already excessive and among the highest in europe . in part this has been made possible and legalized by the government .
it was no surprise when vattenfall europe , one of only four companies dominating the german energy market , announced last week to increase transmission prices by another 20 percent next year . telecommunications law under criticism also coming in for criticism from the monopoly commission is germany ’ s telecommunications law .
hellwig said it ’ s structure and regulations introduce many changes with lots of legal uncertainty and will work in favour of the incumbent and to the disadvantage of the competitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " as long as prices are fixed under a price-cap regime where the regulatory authority sets just an upper bound for an overall index of prices , under the new law the incumbent is perfectly free to use any price to discourage entry , to impede competitors , even if it is a price below cost that would be regarded as predatory under ordinary competition law , “ he said . opposition politicians have welcomed the monopoly commission report and appealed to economics minister wolfgang clement and chancellor gerhard schröder to consider the commission ’ s proposed changes to the draft competition laws . steffen marquart -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu approves sony-bmg merger the european commission has given its green light tuesday to a merger between japan 's sony and the music arm of germany 's bertelsmann , in the latest global entertainment industry tie-up .
-lrb- july 20 , 2004 -rrb- germany gets back its appetite for mergers after a lull period , new life is being breathed into the german market for mergers and acquisitions .

the chancellor should let it be , some experts say a recent bout of mergers involving european companies has some calling for government intervention to help german companies on the international market .
but monopoly watchdogs reject that idea . earlier this year when the french company sanofi took over the german-french pharmaceutical giant aventis - with support from the french govenment - not only were eyebrows raised here in germany , but the government was pressured to help german companies compete on the international market . however , the german monopoly commission thinks otherwise .
this body of government-appointed experts is charged with observing the development of competition in germany and rejects the promotion of so called “ national champions . ” france may have spent billions of euros propping its heavy industry , it sector and the likes of the concorde .
but martin hellwig , the head of germany ’ s monopoly commission , believes the german government should not make the same mistakes .
he even argues that the government is not the right body to identify the national industrial champions of the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal production has long been a heavily subsidized industry in germany " typically government aims to subsidize or give privileges to certain companies tends to be directed towards industries of the past or to politically well connected industries , " he said , adding that factories in important constituencies that are critical for elections are an example .
" it has nothing to do with a good use of public resources for economic policy . “ companies , not economies , compete hellwig said the idea of trying to strengthen germany ’ s international competitiveness by using subsidies to turn companies into global players is wrong .
he said it is companies and not economies which compete internationally .
he points out that national champions could even harm the national market . " a policy that is directed to helping some firms , even if it is directed to helping some firms internationally , tends to burden others , " he said .
" because prices adjust , exchange rates adjust , wages adjust and the changes in economic structure that are induced are beyond the government ’ s ability to forsee .

they do so very ably , but at the same time the german government prevents more competition in several areas , hellwig said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unidentified managers of deutsche post show a airplane-model of the daughter company dhl " in certain areas , where it is a question of changing laws , a question of adapting systems , liberalizing industries , getting rid of post monopolies like telecommunications , the postal system , the energy sector , the government , indeed , has been a bit too prone to maintaining incumbents of the past , " he said , adding that this happened partly for fiscal reasons or furthering national champions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.07.2004 germany remembers plot to kill hitler großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler honors stauffenberg and the others tuesday marks the 60th anniversary of claus schenk graf von stauffenberg 's attempt to assassinate hitler .
while some debate whether he acted out of personal interest or altruism , most germans are taking a positive view . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , an aristocratic colonel in the nazi army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military , including friedrich olbricht and henning von tresckow , plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power . shortly after noon on a hot summer day , stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's " wolf 's lair " hideaway -lrb- in what is today poland -rrb- , where the dictator was seated around a large wooden table with 22 other nazi officials . stauffenberg placed the briefcase under the table , made an excuse to leave , and watched the explosion from afar as he raced towards his getaway car .
confident he had completed his mission and an impending coup would soon place him and like-minded co-conspirators in power , stauffenberg made haste to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shortly after the botched assassination attempt against adolf hitler , july 20 , 1944 .
behind hitler to the left is martin bormann , to the far left is otto skorzeny .
on the right with the bandaged head is alfred jodl .
but , in what is largely viewed as one of the greatest tragedies in history , things did not work out that way .
miraculously , hitler survived the blast that killed four others , and the opposition 's poor planning , lack of support and hesitation at crucial moments played into the führer 's hands . by midnight - just twelve hours later - hitler had regained the upper hand and squashed the rebellion .
stauffenberg and three others were executed by firing squad in berlin .
in the coming weeks , an additional 140 people implicated in the plot were killed and more than 5,000 conspirators and political opponents were rounded-up . hero or traitor ? had stauffenberg been successful , the final phase of the war would certainly have gone differently .
the fact remains that more people died between the july assassination attempt and the end of the war than in the four-and-a-half years prior to that .
few doubt that hitler 's demise would not have seriously affected the german army 's ability to go on fighting , if not ended hostilities sooner and saved thousands of lives .
yet , stauffenberg 's place in history as a hero of the german resistance has not been so easily established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claus graf schenk von stauffenberg in 1940 with his children berthold , franz-ludwig und haimeran . in the initial decade after the end of the war , the german public largely viewed him as a traitor .
his wife was denied a pension , and no memorials were erected to mark the bravery of those within hitler 's own military establishment who risked their lives to set the country on a different course . in the 1960 's , as a younger generation of germans confronted their parents over their country 's nazi past , stauffenberg was not necessarily rehabilitated into an honorable symbol of the german resistance .
some were suspicious of his motives , accusing him of acting more out of self-interest , and less out of benevolent concern for the plight of the jews and other victims of nazi war crimes . a surge of new interest but as the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt approached , a number of new films , documentaries and books enlivened the debate and once again drew attention to stauffenberg and his band of subversives .
german public broadcaster swr produced a film by director jo baier entitled " stauffenberg , " which topped prime time ratings with a 23 percent audience share .
another german broadcaster produced a four-part documentary entitled " they wanted to kill hitler , " which proved equally popular .
numerous new autobiographies and books chronicling the event hit the shelves in bookstores . along with this surge of interest , the german public 's view , it seems , has also shifted .
according to a recent poll in the german news weekly spiegel more than 75 percent of germans surveyed said they esteem or admire stauffenberg and his co-conspirators . in what is perhaps a final nod of approval , german chancellor gerhard schröder presides over a ceremony on tuesday to mark the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt . perspectives change over time the german public 's growing esteem for stauffenberg and company begs the question : what 's changed ?
according to johannes tuchel , director of the german resistance memorial center in berlin , most germans were - implicitly , at least - hitler supporters , and those in the resistance were in the minority . " after the war , germany did not change its population , " he said in an interview with dw-world .
" now we have a new generation , and they are interested in what happened on july 20 , 1944 . " that interest has manifested itself in the spate of recent movies and books .
many are drawn to the material in the hopes of learning how a group of military officers changed their view of hitler radically enough to plot a coup . for that question , however , there is no easy answer .
" they had a broad spectrum of motivations , " says tuchel of those involved in the plot .
" some were social democrats , some former labor union activists , some had authoritarian goals . " two things , according to tuchel , united them : they wanted to re-establish the rule of law and end the war .
in the case of stauffenberg , tuchel says historical evidence proves that a growing disgust for nazi war crimes was his primary motivating factor . the german resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel jonah goldhagen , u.s. author of the book " hitler 's willing executioners . "
academics have long debated whether the guilt for nazi crimes should be borne individually , by those who committed the crimes , or collectively , by the german people .
in the 1997 book " hitler 's willing executioners , " us historian daniel goldhagen -lrb- photo -rrb- argued in favor of the theory of collective guilt .
not surprisingly , his theory proved highly controversial in germany .
it 's no wonder that the german public is fascinated by more inspiring tales of resistance . the german resistance memorial center in berlin features exhibitions on stauffenberg , as well as others like the " white rose " student movement which sprung up in munich .
but tuchel is careful not to exaggerate the size of the resistance , pointing out that hitler 's opponents - those willing to take action - were always in the minority .
" this was such a small operation , that the same man -lrb- stauffenberg -rrb- who planted the bomb , had to run back to berlin on the same day to help organize the coup , " he said . on tuesday afternoon , schröder will urge germans to remember stauffenberg and his network of co-conspirators .
how they choose to recall the event will remain a matter of ongoing debate . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historical reference work delves into scholars ' past the " international encyclopaedia of german studies scholars " has triggered a national debate on the nazi past of several high-profile scholars , and it has n't even been published yet .

israeli television cited chirac as saying , " you are not welcome after your comments , . "
a spokeswoman for the french government said , according to agency reports , " a possible visit by the israeli prime minister to paris , for which no date has been set , will be examined only when the explanations called for have been provided " .
for its part , israel played down the spat , describing it as a " misunderstanding " .
however , ha 'aretz newspaper quoted sharon 's office as saying , " the prime minister reiterates there is anti-semitism in france , and despite the serious measures the french government is taking , he urges french jews to immigrate to israel - just as he urges all jews worldwide to immigrate to israel . "
sharon 's comments were roundly condemned by jewish groups throughout france as , in the words of one jewish leader , " pouring oil on the fire . "
the number of anti-semitic events in france has risen sharply in the first half of this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.07.2004 a case against " national champions " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economy ?
the chancellor should let it be , some experts say a recent bout of mergers involving european companies has some calling for government intervention to help german companies on the international market .
but monopoly watchdogs reject that idea . earlier this year when the french company sanofi took over the german-french pharmaceutical giant aventis - with support from the french govenment - not only were eyebrows raised here in germany , but the government was pressured to help german companies compete on the international market . however , the german monopoly commission thinks otherwise .
this body of government-appointed experts is charged with observing the development of competition in germany and rejects the promotion of so called “ national champions . ” france may have spent billions of euros propping its heavy industry , it sector and the likes of the concorde .
but martin hellwig , the head of germany ’ s monopoly commission , believes the german government should not make the same mistakes .
he even argues that the government is not the right body to identify the national industrial champions of the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal production has long been a heavily subsidized industry in germany " typically government aims to subsidize or give privileges to certain companies tends to be directed towards industries of the past or to politically well connected industries , " he said , adding that factories in important constituencies that are critical for elections are an example .
" it has nothing to do with a good use of public resources for economic policy . “ companies , not economies , compete hellwig said the idea of trying to strengthen germany ’ s international competitiveness by using subsidies to turn companies into global players is wrong .

the chancellor should let it be , some experts say a recent bout of mergers involving european companies has some calling for government intervention to help german companies on the international market .
but monopoly watchdogs reject that idea . earlier this year when the french company sanofi took over the german-french pharmaceutical giant aventis - with support from the french govenment - not only were eyebrows raised here in germany , but the government was pressured to help german companies compete on the international market . however , the german monopoly commission thinks otherwise .
this body of government-appointed experts is charged with observing the development of competition in germany and rejects the promotion of so called “ national champions . ” france may have spent billions of euros propping its heavy industry , it sector and the likes of the concorde .
but martin hellwig , the head of germany ’ s monopoly commission , believes the german government should not make the same mistakes .
he even argues that the government is not the right body to identify the national industrial champions of the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal production has long been a heavily subsidized industry in germany " typically government aims to subsidize or give privileges to certain companies tends to be directed towards industries of the past or to politically well connected industries , " he said , adding that factories in important constituencies that are critical for elections are an example .
" it has nothing to do with a good use of public resources for economic policy . “ companies , not economies , compete hellwig said the idea of trying to strengthen germany ’ s international competitiveness by using subsidies to turn companies into global players is wrong .
he said it is companies and not economies which compete internationally .
he points out that national champions could even harm the national market . " a policy that is directed to helping some firms , even if it is directed to helping some firms internationally , tends to burden others , " he said .
" because prices adjust , exchange rates adjust , wages adjust and the changes in economic structure that are induced are beyond the government ’ s ability to forsee .
they simply don ’ t have the information to do the right thing . “ as a general rule , competition policy is in the hands of the cartel office and the german regulatory authorities which apply the laws against restraints to competition .
they do so very ably , but at the same time the german government prevents more competition in several areas , hellwig said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unidentified managers of deutsche post show a airplane-model of the daughter company dhl " in certain areas , where it is a question of changing laws , a question of adapting systems , liberalizing industries , getting rid of post monopolies like telecommunications , the postal system , the energy sector , the government , indeed , has been a bit too prone to maintaining incumbents of the past , " he said , adding that this happened partly for fiscal reasons or furthering national champions .

it assigned a team of researchers to uncover the ways the east german secret service sought to manipulate the west german organization 's news coverage during the cold war and whether it sought to recruit its journalists as spies .
it 's long been known that some west german media workers did spy for the stasi , but a report released on monday shines a veritable floodlight on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rows and rows of files in the state-run agency for housing stasi archives .
the study , commissioned by ard and produced in tandem with the state-run agency responsible for the stasi archives and historians at berlin 's free university , comprises over 1,000 pages of proof that the stasi skipped no opportunity to control the mass media in its own country and also manipulate and infiltrate radio and tv stations in west germany during the communist era .
a propaganda machine however , the report found that despite massive efforts to influence the programming of west german public broadcasters , it never succeeded in doing so .
additionally , it found , none of the informants working with the stasi served in senior positions or on boards responsible for high-level programming decisions .
nevertheless , the study did conclude that the communist party had been successful in promulgating disinformation on domestic policy issues that did often find its way into news reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler of the stasi archive marianne birthler , director of the federal authority that serves as guardian of the stasi archive , praised the study as a good example of germans working through their past .
" the study is a unique project , " she said .
" there is no other institution that has tried to work through its own past like this . "
the authors of the survey were able to tap into new archived material that was only made available to germany by the united states in 2003 .
after years of negotiations , the us administration returned the stasi ’ s so-called " rosewood " files , which contain the names of over 50,000 potential undercover agents , among them an estimated 12,000 from the west .
revelations damage journalists the study adds more names to the list of those east german journalists whom the stasi used as informers , bringing the total to 42 .
many other eastern german journalists have already taken leave after revelations about their involvement with the stasi surfaced .
the report also cited 61 west german spies , a high number , but lower than some ard officials had expected .
mixed motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while east german journalists may have acted under enormous stasi pressure , west german journalists working for the stasi often had other motives , offering their services for money or out of anti-capitalist or communist convictions .
according to the study , the list of those west german journalists who collaborated with the stasi is astonishingly long .
it is also feeding considerable public interest .
many are interested in the subject , " because a spy network is involved and of course there are a lot of interesting and fascinating stories about the attempt of the stasi to undermine broadcasting enterprises , " the director of an ard-affiliated tv network in the west , fritz pleitgen , said .

in some instances , the data exchange went far beyond journalism .
jochen staadt of berlin ’ s free university and co-author of the study reported on cases where west german stasi spies delivered information on how to blow up broadcasting houses in the west and kill or deport journalists in the event of a political crisis .

it assigned a team of researchers to uncover the ways the east german secret service sought to manipulate the west german organization 's news coverage during the cold war and whether it sought to recruit its journalists as spies .
it 's long been known that some west german media workers did spy for the stasi , but a report released on monday shines a veritable floodlight on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rows and rows of files in the state-run agency for housing stasi archives .
the study , commissioned by ard and produced in tandem with the state-run agency responsible for the stasi archives and historians at berlin 's free university , comprises over 1,000 pages of proof that the stasi skipped no opportunity to control the mass media in its own country and also manipulate and infiltrate radio and tv stations in west germany during the communist era .
a propaganda machine however , the report found that despite massive efforts to influence the programming of west german public broadcasters , it never succeeded in doing so .
additionally , it found , none of the informants working with the stasi served in senior positions or on boards responsible for high-level programming decisions .
nevertheless , the study did conclude that the communist party had been successful in promulgating disinformation on domestic policy issues that did often find its way into news reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler of the stasi archive marianne birthler , director of the federal authority that serves as guardian of the stasi archive , praised the study as a good example of germans working through their past .
" the study is a unique project , " she said .
" there is no other institution that has tried to work through its own past like this . "
the authors of the survey were able to tap into new archived material that was only made available to germany by the united states in 2003 .
after years of negotiations , the us administration returned the stasi ’ s so-called " rosewood " files , which contain the names of over 50,000 potential undercover agents , among them an estimated 12,000 from the west .
revelations damage journalists the study adds more names to the list of those east german journalists whom the stasi used as informers , bringing the total to 42 .
many other eastern german journalists have already taken leave after revelations about their involvement with the stasi surfaced .
the report also cited 61 west german spies , a high number , but lower than some ard officials had expected .
mixed motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while east german journalists may have acted under enormous stasi pressure , west german journalists working for the stasi often had other motives , offering their services for money or out of anti-capitalist or communist convictions .
according to the study , the list of those west german journalists who collaborated with the stasi is astonishingly long .
it is also feeding considerable public interest .
many are interested in the subject , " because a spy network is involved and of course there are a lot of interesting and fascinating stories about the attempt of the stasi to undermine broadcasting enterprises , " the director of an ard-affiliated tv network in the west , fritz pleitgen , said .
" we found that the strategy in the activity of the stasi was so gigantic - and we did n't expect that . "

in some instances , the data exchange went far beyond journalism .
jochen staadt of berlin ’ s free university and co-author of the study reported on cases where west german stasi spies delivered information on how to blow up broadcasting houses in the west and kill or deport journalists in the event of a political crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.07.2004 eu approves sony-bmg merger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls united : bmg 's christina aguilera and sony 's beyonce the european commission gave its green light tuesday to a merger between japan 's sony and the music arm of germany 's bertelsmann , in the latest global entertainment industry tie-up . in a shift from its previous position , officials for the commission said they had found no reasons to prevent the 50:50 joint venture , but added they planned to closely observe the increase in mergers in the music industry and to monitor developments together with the us federal trade commission . in february , the commission had opened an inquiry into the deal between sony 's music arm and bertelsmann music group -lrb- bmg -rrb- over concerns that a combined group would dominate the market and lead to higher prices for consumers .
the new company , to be called sonybmg , will be the world 's second largest music label , behind universal music . if the merger actually goes ahead , the market will be carved up between four instead of five majors : vivendi 's universal , the newly-created sonybmg , warner and emi .
together they would share around 80 percent of european recorded music sales . sources say the german-japanese tie-up should also win approval from the us federal trade commission within days . the european and us competition authorities have run parallel investigations into the merger , which will create the world 's largest music company in terms of market share according to 2003 figures . the 50:50 merger will bring together sony stars such as barbara streisand and beyonce and bmg stars , including elvis presley and christina aguilera . massive job cuts expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated music cds the japanese and german parent groups argue that their businesses need to join forces to tackle the crisis in the global music industry faced with both pirate cds and an explosion of illegal music downloading . but the latest case of media consolidation comes at a cost .
according to reports , sony and bmg plan to axe a quarter of their joint workforce , or some 3,000 jobs , once the tie-up has been approved . at sonybmg the overhaul will produce one-off costs of $ 300 million to 350 million dollars -lrb- € 244 million to € 284 million -rrb- , mainly covering severance terms for a large portion of the group 's employees , the financial times reported last week . executives at bertelsmann , hoped to achieve 85 percent of the cutbacks by next june , it added .
but detailed plans for cost-cutting measures will begin only after competition authorities cleared the merger . brussels does an about-face the brussels green light comes four years after the european commission effectively blocked another music tie-up , between emi and time warner . initially the commission appeared to be preparing a red light for the sony / bmg tie-up as well .
in may eu competition commissioner mario monti -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a preliminary assessment that it would be " incompatible " with eu rules . many also expressed concern that such a deal would lead to fewer consumer choices on the market and endanger the nascent legal online music downloading trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for competition mario monti but the man who made a name for himself after taking on microsoft softened his tone after closed-door talks with the two sides and several independent labels in brussels .
inside sources say monti apparently secured guarantees that the merger would not lead to reduced competition and thus higher prices for consumers . critics of the deal and independent recording companies remain concerned .
impala , an umbrella group representing more than 2,000 independent labels said the merger would further reduce smaller companies ' ability to give up-and-coming artists exposure .
it has threatened to take legal action to have the brussels decision overturned . bmg is in a strong position as it prepares for the tie-up .
it posted record operating profits of € 30 million -lrb- $ 37.4 million -rrb- in the first half of this year , der spiegel newsmagazine reported in its latest edition .
the result , the best six month figures in its history , puts bmg in a strong position for negotiating the deal with sony music , with the two sides expected to meet this week on a reorganization after the brussels decision .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 20.07.2004 german reality shows in need of reality check großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : come on down to the farm , but do n't hurt the cows reality shows are increasingly attracting the ire of critics - some who object to the way animals are treated on a new farm docu-soap , and others who worry about the effects such shows have on the human participants . " die alm " or " the alps , " is a sort of alpine-reality-docu-soap , in which a slew of german b-list celebrities gets down and dirty with everyday life on an alpine farm .
of course , no alpine pasture would be complete without real live farm animals , which provide the celebs with countless opportunities to boost ratings by engaging in gross-out stunts such as having goats lick syrup off their bodies , or sucking milk from a cow 's udder . but the last straw for german animal activists came when a recent episode showed a turkey being slaughtered .
now , the german society for the protection of animals -lrb- dtb -rrb- says it 's looking at taking legal steps against the show , which runs on munich-based private broadcaster , prosieben . " we do n't care if third-rate celebrities bathe in manure or throw themselves naked down a hillside , " said dtb head thomas schröder .
" but animals ca n't say yes or no .
the show has overstepped the legal and ethical boundaries . " prosieben is nonplussed but intends to continue airing the show as planned .
tuesday evening 's episode includes showing the candidates how to empty the intestines of a freshly slaughtered pig , for later use as sausage casings .
the executive in charge of the show , christian asanger , has even invited members of the animal society out to the mountain pasture .
" we have nothing to hide , " he said . makeover-shows also a target in a world where there 's no such thing as bad publicity , experts say such protests are a welcome additional marketing strategy for the shows , which thrive on high ratings and advertising revenue . if that 's true , then other german reality tv shows which feature plastic surgery and makeovers instead of farm animals can also expect a ratings boost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a big brother candidate prepares to go under the knife .
cologne-based private broadcaster rtl ii whipped up a storm of protest last week when it announced it would let candidates participating in its " big brother " reality show undergo cosmetic surgery .
the german association of plastic surgeons -lrb- vdäpc -rrb- objected , not just to " big brother , " but also to other makeover reality shows that recently hit the german airwaves . in mtv 's " i want a famous face , " teens put themselves at the mercy of plastic surgeons in order to wake up looking like stars such as brad pitt or kate winslet .
prosieben 's " the swan " is a reality tv-show format imported from the us , in which ugly ducklings are turned into … well , swans , with the help of plastic surgeons , fitness trainers , nutritionists and psychologists .
the most beautiful " swan " to emerge out of the 16 candidates wins a modeling contract . do n't blame plastic surgeons these shows are giving plastic surgery a bad name , according to the vdäpc .
" what we do is medical work .
we treat patients .
we do n't sell the product ' beauty ' , " said the association 's senior president , constanze neuhann-lorenz .
in a letter sent to the association 's 120 members , president rolf rüdiger olbrisch wrote : " let 's protect ourselves from landing in the wrong hands and wrong publicity , of the wrong business . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a staple operation for all reality makeover shows - breast enlargement .
germany 's media regulatory board said certain boundaries have to be respected , even in an industry that 's all about erasing the boundaries between private and public life . " showing plastic surgery can hurt the dignity of a human being , even if the person having the surgery does n't have a problem with it , " said the head of the director 's conference for germany 's state media boards , wolfgang thaenert .
" basically , it 's about respecting the final boundaries that touch on human dignity .

while some debate whether he acted out of personal interest or altruism , most germans are taking a positive view . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , an aristocratic colonel in the nazi army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military , including friedrich olbricht and henning von tresckow , plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power . shortly after noon on a hot summer day , stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's " wolf 's lair " hideaway -lrb- in what is today poland -rrb- , where the dictator was seated around a large wooden table with 22 other nazi officials . stauffenberg placed the briefcase under the table , made an excuse to leave , and watched the explosion from afar as he raced towards his getaway car .
confident he had completed his mission and an impending coup would soon place him and like-minded co-conspirators in power , stauffenberg made haste to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shortly after the botched assassination attempt against adolf hitler , july 20 , 1944 .
behind hitler to the left is martin bormann , to the far left is otto skorzeny .
on the right with the bandaged head is alfred jodl .
but , in what is largely viewed as one of the greatest tragedies in history , things did not work out that way .
miraculously , hitler survived the blast that killed four others , and the opposition 's poor planning , lack of support and hesitation at crucial moments played into the führer 's hands . by midnight - just twelve hours later - hitler had regained the upper hand and squashed the rebellion .
stauffenberg and three others were executed by firing squad in berlin .
in the coming weeks , an additional 140 people implicated in the plot were killed and more than 5,000 conspirators and political opponents were rounded-up . hero or traitor ? had stauffenberg been successful , the final phase of the war would certainly have gone differently .
the fact remains that more people died between the july assassination attempt and the end of the war than in the four-and-a-half years prior to that .
few doubt that hitler 's demise would not have seriously affected the german army 's ability to go on fighting , if not ended hostilities sooner and saved thousands of lives .
yet , stauffenberg 's place in history as a hero of the german resistance has not been so easily established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claus graf schenk von stauffenberg in 1940 with his children berthold , franz-ludwig und haimeran . in the initial decade after the end of the war , the german public largely viewed him as a traitor .
his wife was denied a pension , and no memorials were erected to mark the bravery of those within hitler 's own military establishment who risked their lives to set the country on a different course . in the 1960 's , as a younger generation of germans confronted their parents over their country 's nazi past , stauffenberg was not necessarily rehabilitated into an honorable symbol of the german resistance .
some were suspicious of his motives , accusing him of acting more out of self-interest , and less out of benevolent concern for the plight of the jews and other victims of nazi war crimes . a surge of new interest but as the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt approached , a number of new films , documentaries and books enlivened the debate and once again drew attention to stauffenberg and his band of subversives .
german public broadcaster swr produced a film by director jo baier entitled " stauffenberg , " which topped prime time ratings with a 23 percent audience share .
another german broadcaster produced a four-part documentary entitled " they wanted to kill hitler , " which proved equally popular .
numerous new autobiographies and books chronicling the event hit the shelves in bookstores . along with this surge of interest , the german public 's view , it seems , has also shifted .
according to a recent poll in the german news weekly spiegel more than 75 percent of germans surveyed said they esteem or admire stauffenberg and his co-conspirators . in what is perhaps a final nod of approval , german chancellor gerhard schröder presides over a ceremony on tuesday to mark the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt . perspectives change over time the german public 's growing esteem for stauffenberg and company begs the question : what 's changed ?
according to johannes tuchel , director of the german resistance memorial center in berlin , most germans were - implicitly , at least - hitler supporters , and those in the resistance were in the minority . " after the war , germany did not change its population , " he said in an interview with dw-world .
" now we have a new generation , and they are interested in what happened on july 20 , 1944 . " that interest has manifested itself in the spate of recent movies and books .
many are drawn to the material in the hopes of learning how a group of military officers changed their view of hitler radically enough to plot a coup . for that question , however , there is no easy answer .
" they had a broad spectrum of motivations , " says tuchel of those involved in the plot .
" some were social democrats , some former labor union activists , some had authoritarian goals . " two things , according to tuchel , united them : they wanted to re-establish the rule of law and end the war .
in the case of stauffenberg , tuchel says historical evidence proves that a growing disgust for nazi war crimes was his primary motivating factor . the german resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel jonah goldhagen , u.s. author of the book " hitler 's willing executioners . "
academics have long debated whether the guilt for nazi crimes should be borne individually , by those who committed the crimes , or collectively , by the german people .
in the 1997 book " hitler 's willing executioners , " us historian daniel goldhagen -lrb- photo -rrb- argued in favor of the theory of collective guilt .
not surprisingly , his theory proved highly controversial in germany .
it 's no wonder that the german public is fascinated by more inspiring tales of resistance . the german resistance memorial center in berlin features exhibitions on stauffenberg , as well as others like the " white rose " student movement which sprung up in munich .
but tuchel is careful not to exaggerate the size of the resistance , pointing out that hitler 's opponents - those willing to take action - were always in the minority .
" this was such a small operation , that the same man -lrb- stauffenberg -rrb- who planted the bomb , had to run back to berlin on the same day to help organize the coup , " he said . on tuesday afternoon , schröder will urge germans to remember stauffenberg and his network of co-conspirators .
how they choose to recall the event will remain a matter of ongoing debate . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historical reference work delves into scholars ' past the " international encyclopaedia of german studies scholars " has triggered a national debate on the nazi past of several high-profile scholars , and it has n't even been published yet .

his wife was denied a pension , and no memorials were erected to mark the bravery of those within hitler 's own military establishment who risked their lives to set the country on a different course . in the 1960 's , as a younger generation of germans confronted their parents over their country 's nazi past , stauffenberg was not necessarily rehabilitated into an honorable symbol of the german resistance .
some were suspicious of his motives , accusing him of acting more out of self-interest , and less out of benevolent concern for the plight of the jews and other victims of nazi war crimes . a surge of new interest but as the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt approached , a number of new films , documentaries and books enlivened the debate and once again drew attention to stauffenberg and his band of subversives .
german public broadcaster swr produced a film by director jo baier entitled " stauffenberg , " which topped prime time ratings with a 23 percent audience share .
another german broadcaster produced a four-part documentary entitled " they wanted to kill hitler , " which proved equally popular .
numerous new autobiographies and books chronicling the event hit the shelves in bookstores . along with this surge of interest , the german public 's view , it seems , has also shifted .
according to a recent poll in the german news weekly spiegel more than 75 percent of germans surveyed said they esteem or admire stauffenberg and his co-conspirators . in what is perhaps a final nod of approval , german chancellor gerhard schröder presides over a ceremony on tuesday to mark the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt . perspectives change over time the german public 's growing esteem for stauffenberg and company begs the question : what 's changed ?
according to johannes tuchel , director of the german resistance memorial center in berlin , most germans were - implicitly , at least - hitler supporters , and those in the resistance were in the minority . " after the war , germany did not change its population , " he said in an interview with dw-world .
" now we have a new generation , and they are interested in what happened on july 20 , 1944 . " that interest has manifested itself in the spate of recent movies and books .
many are drawn to the material in the hopes of learning how a group of military officers changed their view of hitler radically enough to plot a coup . for that question , however , there is no easy answer .
" they had a broad spectrum of motivations , " says tuchel of those involved in the plot .
" some were social democrats , some former labor union activists , some had authoritarian goals . " two things , according to tuchel , united them : they wanted to re-establish the rule of law and end the war .
in the case of stauffenberg , tuchel says historical evidence proves that a growing disgust for nazi war crimes was his primary motivating factor . the german resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel jonah goldhagen , u.s. author of the book " hitler 's willing executioners . "
academics have long debated whether the guilt for nazi crimes should be borne individually , by those who committed the crimes , or collectively , by the german people .
in the 1997 book " hitler 's willing executioners , " us historian daniel goldhagen -lrb- photo -rrb- argued in favor of the theory of collective guilt .
not surprisingly , his theory proved highly controversial in germany .
it 's no wonder that the german public is fascinated by more inspiring tales of resistance . the german resistance memorial center in berlin features exhibitions on stauffenberg , as well as others like the " white rose " student movement which sprung up in munich .
but tuchel is careful not to exaggerate the size of the resistance , pointing out that hitler 's opponents - those willing to take action - were always in the minority .
" this was such a small operation , that the same man -lrb- stauffenberg -rrb- who planted the bomb , had to run back to berlin on the same day to help organize the coup , " he said . on tuesday afternoon , schröder will urge germans to remember stauffenberg and his network of co-conspirators .

while some debate whether he acted out of personal interest or altruism , most germans are taking a positive view . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , an aristocratic colonel in the nazi army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military , including friedrich olbricht and henning von tresckow , plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power . shortly after noon on a hot summer day , stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's " wolf 's lair " hideaway -lrb- in what is today poland -rrb- , where the dictator was seated around a large wooden table with 22 other nazi officials . stauffenberg placed the briefcase under the table , made an excuse to leave , and watched the explosion from afar as he raced towards his getaway car .
confident he had completed his mission and an impending coup would soon place him and like-minded co-conspirators in power , stauffenberg made haste to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shortly after the botched assassination attempt against adolf hitler , july 20 , 1944 .
behind hitler to the left is martin bormann , to the far left is otto skorzeny .
on the right with the bandaged head is alfred jodl .
but , in what is largely viewed as one of the greatest tragedies in history , things did not work out that way .
miraculously , hitler survived the blast that killed four others , and the opposition 's poor planning , lack of support and hesitation at crucial moments played into the führer 's hands . by midnight - just twelve hours later - hitler had regained the upper hand and squashed the rebellion .
stauffenberg and three others were executed by firing squad in berlin .
in the coming weeks , an additional 140 people implicated in the plot were killed and more than 5,000 conspirators and political opponents were rounded-up . hero or traitor ? had stauffenberg been successful , the final phase of the war would certainly have gone differently .
the fact remains that more people died between the july assassination attempt and the end of the war than in the four-and-a-half years prior to that .
few doubt that hitler 's demise would not have seriously affected the german army 's ability to go on fighting , if not ended hostilities sooner and saved thousands of lives .
yet , stauffenberg 's place in history as a hero of the german resistance has not been so easily established .

in the case of stauffenberg , tuchel says historical evidence proves that a growing disgust for nazi war crimes was his primary motivating factor . the german resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel jonah goldhagen , u.s. author of the book " hitler 's willing executioners . "
academics have long debated whether the guilt for nazi crimes should be borne individually , by those who committed the crimes , or collectively , by the german people .
in the 1997 book " hitler 's willing executioners , " us historian daniel goldhagen -lrb- photo -rrb- argued in favor of the theory of collective guilt .
not surprisingly , his theory proved highly controversial in germany .
it 's no wonder that the german public is fascinated by more inspiring tales of resistance . the german resistance memorial center in berlin features exhibitions on stauffenberg , as well as others like the " white rose " student movement which sprung up in munich .
but tuchel is careful not to exaggerate the size of the resistance , pointing out that hitler 's opponents - those willing to take action - were always in the minority .
" this was such a small operation , that the same man -lrb- stauffenberg -rrb- who planted the bomb , had to run back to berlin on the same day to help organize the coup , " he said . on tuesday afternoon , schröder will urge germans to remember stauffenberg and his network of co-conspirators .

while some debate whether he acted out of personal interest or altruism , most germans are taking a positive view . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , an aristocratic colonel in the nazi army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military , including friedrich olbricht and henning von tresckow , plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power . shortly after noon on a hot summer day , stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's " wolf 's lair " hideaway -lrb- in what is today poland -rrb- , where the dictator was seated around a large wooden table with 22 other nazi officials . stauffenberg placed the briefcase under the table , made an excuse to leave , and watched the explosion from afar as he raced towards his getaway car .
confident he had completed his mission and an impending coup would soon place him and like-minded co-conspirators in power , stauffenberg made haste to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shortly after the botched assassination attempt against adolf hitler , july 20 , 1944 .
behind hitler to the left is martin bormann , to the far left is otto skorzeny .
on the right with the bandaged head is alfred jodl .
but , in what is largely viewed as one of the greatest tragedies in history , things did not work out that way .
miraculously , hitler survived the blast that killed four others , and the opposition 's poor planning , lack of support and hesitation at crucial moments played into the führer 's hands . by midnight - just twelve hours later - hitler had regained the upper hand and squashed the rebellion .
stauffenberg and three others were executed by firing squad in berlin .
in the coming weeks , an additional 140 people implicated in the plot were killed and more than 5,000 conspirators and political opponents were rounded-up . hero or traitor ? had stauffenberg been successful , the final phase of the war would certainly have gone differently .
the fact remains that more people died between the july assassination attempt and the end of the war than in the four-and-a-half years prior to that .
few doubt that hitler 's demise would not have seriously affected the german army 's ability to go on fighting , if not ended hostilities sooner and saved thousands of lives .
yet , stauffenberg 's place in history as a hero of the german resistance has not been so easily established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claus graf schenk von stauffenberg in 1940 with his children berthold , franz-ludwig und haimeran . in the initial decade after the end of the war , the german public largely viewed him as a traitor .
his wife was denied a pension , and no memorials were erected to mark the bravery of those within hitler 's own military establishment who risked their lives to set the country on a different course . in the 1960 's , as a younger generation of germans confronted their parents over their country 's nazi past , stauffenberg was not necessarily rehabilitated into an honorable symbol of the german resistance .
some were suspicious of his motives , accusing him of acting more out of self-interest , and less out of benevolent concern for the plight of the jews and other victims of nazi war crimes . a surge of new interest but as the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt approached , a number of new films , documentaries and books enlivened the debate and once again drew attention to stauffenberg and his band of subversives .
german public broadcaster swr produced a film by director jo baier entitled " stauffenberg , " which topped prime time ratings with a 23 percent audience share .
another german broadcaster produced a four-part documentary entitled " they wanted to kill hitler , " which proved equally popular .
numerous new autobiographies and books chronicling the event hit the shelves in bookstores . along with this surge of interest , the german public 's view , it seems , has also shifted .
according to a recent poll in the german news weekly spiegel more than 75 percent of germans surveyed said they esteem or admire stauffenberg and his co-conspirators . in what is perhaps a final nod of approval , german chancellor gerhard schröder presides over a ceremony on tuesday to mark the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt . perspectives change over time the german public 's growing esteem for stauffenberg and company begs the question : what 's changed ?
according to johannes tuchel , director of the german resistance memorial center in berlin , most germans were - implicitly , at least - hitler supporters , and those in the resistance were in the minority . " after the war , germany did not change its population , " he said in an interview with dw-world .
" now we have a new generation , and they are interested in what happened on july 20 , 1944 . " that interest has manifested itself in the spate of recent movies and books .
many are drawn to the material in the hopes of learning how a group of military officers changed their view of hitler radically enough to plot a coup . for that question , however , there is no easy answer .
" they had a broad spectrum of motivations , " says tuchel of those involved in the plot .
" some were social democrats , some former labor union activists , some had authoritarian goals . " two things , according to tuchel , united them : they wanted to re-establish the rule of law and end the war .
in the case of stauffenberg , tuchel says historical evidence proves that a growing disgust for nazi war crimes was his primary motivating factor . the german resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel jonah goldhagen , u.s. author of the book " hitler 's willing executioners . "
academics have long debated whether the guilt for nazi crimes should be borne individually , by those who committed the crimes , or collectively , by the german people .
in the 1997 book " hitler 's willing executioners , " us historian daniel goldhagen -lrb- photo -rrb- argued in favor of the theory of collective guilt .
not surprisingly , his theory proved highly controversial in germany .
it 's no wonder that the german public is fascinated by more inspiring tales of resistance . the german resistance memorial center in berlin features exhibitions on stauffenberg , as well as others like the " white rose " student movement which sprung up in munich .
but tuchel is careful not to exaggerate the size of the resistance , pointing out that hitler 's opponents - those willing to take action - were always in the minority .
" this was such a small operation , that the same man -lrb- stauffenberg -rrb- who planted the bomb , had to run back to berlin on the same day to help organize the coup , " he said . on tuesday afternoon , schröder will urge germans to remember stauffenberg and his network of co-conspirators .

increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military , including friedrich olbricht and henning von tresckow , plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power . shortly after noon on a hot summer day , stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's " wolf 's lair " hideaway -lrb- in what is today poland -rrb- , where the dictator was seated around a large wooden table with 22 other nazi officials . stauffenberg placed the briefcase under the table , made an excuse to leave , and watched the explosion from afar as he raced towards his getaway car .
confident he had completed his mission and an impending coup would soon place him and like-minded co-conspirators in power , stauffenberg made haste to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shortly after the botched assassination attempt against adolf hitler , july 20 , 1944 .
behind hitler to the left is martin bormann , to the far left is otto skorzeny .
on the right with the bandaged head is alfred jodl .
but , in what is largely viewed as one of the greatest tragedies in history , things did not work out that way .
miraculously , hitler survived the blast that killed four others , and the opposition 's poor planning , lack of support and hesitation at crucial moments played into the führer 's hands . by midnight - just twelve hours later - hitler had regained the upper hand and squashed the rebellion .
stauffenberg and three others were executed by firing squad in berlin .
in the coming weeks , an additional 140 people implicated in the plot were killed and more than 5,000 conspirators and political opponents were rounded-up . hero or traitor ? had stauffenberg been successful , the final phase of the war would certainly have gone differently .
the fact remains that more people died between the july assassination attempt and the end of the war than in the four-and-a-half years prior to that .
few doubt that hitler 's demise would not have seriously affected the german army 's ability to go on fighting , if not ended hostilities sooner and saved thousands of lives .
yet , stauffenberg 's place in history as a hero of the german resistance has not been so easily established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claus graf schenk von stauffenberg in 1940 with his children berthold , franz-ludwig und haimeran . in the initial decade after the end of the war , the german public largely viewed him as a traitor .
his wife was denied a pension , and no memorials were erected to mark the bravery of those within hitler 's own military establishment who risked their lives to set the country on a different course . in the 1960 's , as a younger generation of germans confronted their parents over their country 's nazi past , stauffenberg was not necessarily rehabilitated into an honorable symbol of the german resistance .
some were suspicious of his motives , accusing him of acting more out of self-interest , and less out of benevolent concern for the plight of the jews and other victims of nazi war crimes . a surge of new interest but as the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt approached , a number of new films , documentaries and books enlivened the debate and once again drew attention to stauffenberg and his band of subversives .
german public broadcaster swr produced a film by director jo baier entitled " stauffenberg , " which topped prime time ratings with a 23 percent audience share .
another german broadcaster produced a four-part documentary entitled " they wanted to kill hitler , " which proved equally popular .
numerous new autobiographies and books chronicling the event hit the shelves in bookstores . along with this surge of interest , the german public 's view , it seems , has also shifted .
according to a recent poll in the german news weekly spiegel more than 75 percent of germans surveyed said they esteem or admire stauffenberg and his co-conspirators . in what is perhaps a final nod of approval , german chancellor gerhard schröder presides over a ceremony on tuesday to mark the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt . perspectives change over time the german public 's growing esteem for stauffenberg and company begs the question : what 's changed ?
according to johannes tuchel , director of the german resistance memorial center in berlin , most germans were - implicitly , at least - hitler supporters , and those in the resistance were in the minority . " after the war , germany did not change its population , " he said in an interview with dw-world .
" now we have a new generation , and they are interested in what happened on july 20 , 1944 . " that interest has manifested itself in the spate of recent movies and books .
many are drawn to the material in the hopes of learning how a group of military officers changed their view of hitler radically enough to plot a coup . for that question , however , there is no easy answer .
" they had a broad spectrum of motivations , " says tuchel of those involved in the plot .
" some were social democrats , some former labor union activists , some had authoritarian goals . " two things , according to tuchel , united them : they wanted to re-establish the rule of law and end the war .
in the case of stauffenberg , tuchel says historical evidence proves that a growing disgust for nazi war crimes was his primary motivating factor . the german resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel jonah goldhagen , u.s. author of the book " hitler 's willing executioners . "
academics have long debated whether the guilt for nazi crimes should be borne individually , by those who committed the crimes , or collectively , by the german people .
in the 1997 book " hitler 's willing executioners , " us historian daniel goldhagen -lrb- photo -rrb- argued in favor of the theory of collective guilt .
not surprisingly , his theory proved highly controversial in germany .
it 's no wonder that the german public is fascinated by more inspiring tales of resistance . the german resistance memorial center in berlin features exhibitions on stauffenberg , as well as others like the " white rose " student movement which sprung up in munich .
but tuchel is careful not to exaggerate the size of the resistance , pointing out that hitler 's opponents - those willing to take action - were always in the minority .
" this was such a small operation , that the same man -lrb- stauffenberg -rrb- who planted the bomb , had to run back to berlin on the same day to help organize the coup , " he said . on tuesday afternoon , schröder will urge germans to remember stauffenberg and his network of co-conspirators .
how they choose to recall the event will remain a matter of ongoing debate . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historical reference work delves into scholars ' past the " international encyclopaedia of german studies scholars " has triggered a national debate on the nazi past of several high-profile scholars , and it has n't even been published yet .

israeli television cited chirac as saying , " you are not welcome after your comments , . "
a spokeswoman for the french government said , according to agency reports , " a possible visit by the israeli prime minister to paris , for which no date has been set , will be examined only when the explanations called for have been provided " .
for its part , israel played down the spat , describing it as a " misunderstanding " .
however , ha 'aretz newspaper quoted sharon 's office as saying , " the prime minister reiterates there is anti-semitism in france , and despite the serious measures the french government is taking , he urges french jews to immigrate to israel - just as he urges all jews worldwide to immigrate to israel . "
sharon 's comments were roundly condemned by jewish groups throughout france as , in the words of one jewish leader , " pouring oil on the fire . "
the number of anti-semitic events in france has risen sharply in the first half of this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 20.07.2004 german reality shows in need of reality check großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : come on down to the farm , but do n't hurt the cows reality shows are increasingly attracting the ire of critics - some who object to the way animals are treated on a new farm docu-soap , and others who worry about the effects such shows have on the human participants . " die alm " or " the alps , " is a sort of alpine-reality-docu-soap , in which a slew of german b-list celebrities gets down and dirty with everyday life on an alpine farm .
of course , no alpine pasture would be complete without real live farm animals , which provide the celebs with countless opportunities to boost ratings by engaging in gross-out stunts such as having goats lick syrup off their bodies , or sucking milk from a cow 's udder . but the last straw for german animal activists came when a recent episode showed a turkey being slaughtered .
now , the german society for the protection of animals -lrb- dtb -rrb- says it 's looking at taking legal steps against the show , which runs on munich-based private broadcaster , prosieben . " we do n't care if third-rate celebrities bathe in manure or throw themselves naked down a hillside , " said dtb head thomas schröder .
" but animals ca n't say yes or no .
the show has overstepped the legal and ethical boundaries . " prosieben is nonplussed but intends to continue airing the show as planned .
tuesday evening 's episode includes showing the candidates how to empty the intestines of a freshly slaughtered pig , for later use as sausage casings .
the executive in charge of the show , christian asanger , has even invited members of the animal society out to the mountain pasture .
" we have nothing to hide , " he said . makeover-shows also a target in a world where there 's no such thing as bad publicity , experts say such protests are a welcome additional marketing strategy for the shows , which thrive on high ratings and advertising revenue . if that 's true , then other german reality tv shows which feature plastic surgery and makeovers instead of farm animals can also expect a ratings boost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a big brother candidate prepares to go under the knife .
cologne-based private broadcaster rtl ii whipped up a storm of protest last week when it announced it would let candidates participating in its " big brother " reality show undergo cosmetic surgery .
the german association of plastic surgeons -lrb- vdäpc -rrb- objected , not just to " big brother , " but also to other makeover reality shows that recently hit the german airwaves . in mtv 's " i want a famous face , " teens put themselves at the mercy of plastic surgeons in order to wake up looking like stars such as brad pitt or kate winslet .
prosieben 's " the swan " is a reality tv-show format imported from the us , in which ugly ducklings are turned into … well , swans , with the help of plastic surgeons , fitness trainers , nutritionists and psychologists .
the most beautiful " swan " to emerge out of the 16 candidates wins a modeling contract . do n't blame plastic surgeons these shows are giving plastic surgery a bad name , according to the vdäpc .
" what we do is medical work .
we treat patients .
we do n't sell the product ' beauty ' , " said the association 's senior president , constanze neuhann-lorenz .
in a letter sent to the association 's 120 members , president rolf rüdiger olbrisch wrote : " let 's protect ourselves from landing in the wrong hands and wrong publicity , of the wrong business . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a staple operation for all reality makeover shows - breast enlargement .
germany 's media regulatory board said certain boundaries have to be respected , even in an industry that 's all about erasing the boundaries between private and public life .

" die alm " or " the alps , " is a sort of alpine-reality-docu-soap , in which a slew of german b-list celebrities gets down and dirty with everyday life on an alpine farm .
of course , no alpine pasture would be complete without real live farm animals , which provide the celebs with countless opportunities to boost ratings by engaging in gross-out stunts such as having goats lick syrup off their bodies , or sucking milk from a cow 's udder . but the last straw for german animal activists came when a recent episode showed a turkey being slaughtered .
now , the german society for the protection of animals -lrb- dtb -rrb- says it 's looking at taking legal steps against the show , which runs on munich-based private broadcaster , prosieben . " we do n't care if third-rate celebrities bathe in manure or throw themselves naked down a hillside , " said dtb head thomas schröder .
" but animals ca n't say yes or no .
the show has overstepped the legal and ethical boundaries . " prosieben is nonplussed but intends to continue airing the show as planned .
tuesday evening 's episode includes showing the candidates how to empty the intestines of a freshly slaughtered pig , for later use as sausage casings .
the executive in charge of the show , christian asanger , has even invited members of the animal society out to the mountain pasture .
" we have nothing to hide , " he said . makeover-shows also a target in a world where there 's no such thing as bad publicity , experts say such protests are a welcome additional marketing strategy for the shows , which thrive on high ratings and advertising revenue . if that 's true , then other german reality tv shows which feature plastic surgery and makeovers instead of farm animals can also expect a ratings boost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a big brother candidate prepares to go under the knife .
cologne-based private broadcaster rtl ii whipped up a storm of protest last week when it announced it would let candidates participating in its " big brother " reality show undergo cosmetic surgery .
the german association of plastic surgeons -lrb- vdäpc -rrb- objected , not just to " big brother , " but also to other makeover reality shows that recently hit the german airwaves . in mtv 's " i want a famous face , " teens put themselves at the mercy of plastic surgeons in order to wake up looking like stars such as brad pitt or kate winslet .
prosieben 's " the swan " is a reality tv-show format imported from the us , in which ugly ducklings are turned into … well , swans , with the help of plastic surgeons , fitness trainers , nutritionists and psychologists .
the most beautiful " swan " to emerge out of the 16 candidates wins a modeling contract . do n't blame plastic surgeons these shows are giving plastic surgery a bad name , according to the vdäpc .
" what we do is medical work .
we treat patients .
we do n't sell the product ' beauty ' , " said the association 's senior president , constanze neuhann-lorenz .
in a letter sent to the association 's 120 members , president rolf rüdiger olbrisch wrote : " let 's protect ourselves from landing in the wrong hands and wrong publicity , of the wrong business . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a staple operation for all reality makeover shows - breast enlargement .
germany 's media regulatory board said certain boundaries have to be respected , even in an industry that 's all about erasing the boundaries between private and public life . " showing plastic surgery can hurt the dignity of a human being , even if the person having the surgery does n't have a problem with it , " said the head of the director 's conference for germany 's state media boards , wolfgang thaenert .

the new company , to be called sonybmg , will be the world 's second largest music label , behind universal music . if the merger actually goes ahead , the market will be carved up between four instead of five majors : vivendi 's universal , the newly-created sonybmg , warner and emi .
together they would share around 80 percent of european recorded music sales . sources say the german-japanese tie-up should also win approval from the us federal trade commission within days . the european and us competition authorities have run parallel investigations into the merger , which will create the world 's largest music company in terms of market share according to 2003 figures . the 50:50 merger will bring together sony stars such as barbara streisand and beyonce and bmg stars , including elvis presley and christina aguilera . massive job cuts expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated music cds the japanese and german parent groups argue that their businesses need to join forces to tackle the crisis in the global music industry faced with both pirate cds and an explosion of illegal music downloading . but the latest case of media consolidation comes at a cost .
according to reports , sony and bmg plan to axe a quarter of their joint workforce , or some 3,000 jobs , once the tie-up has been approved . at sonybmg the overhaul will produce one-off costs of $ 300 million to 350 million dollars -lrb- € 244 million to € 284 million -rrb- , mainly covering severance terms for a large portion of the group 's employees , the financial times reported last week . executives at bertelsmann , hoped to achieve 85 percent of the cutbacks by next june , it added .
but detailed plans for cost-cutting measures will begin only after competition authorities cleared the merger . brussels does an about-face the brussels green light comes four years after the european commission effectively blocked another music tie-up , between emi and time warner . initially the commission appeared to be preparing a red light for the sony / bmg tie-up as well .

the new company , to be called sonybmg , will be the world 's second largest music label , behind universal music . if the merger actually goes ahead , the market will be carved up between four instead of five majors : vivendi 's universal , the newly-created sonybmg , warner and emi .
together they would share around 80 percent of european recorded music sales . sources say the german-japanese tie-up should also win approval from the us federal trade commission within days . the european and us competition authorities have run parallel investigations into the merger , which will create the world 's largest music company in terms of market share according to 2003 figures . the 50:50 merger will bring together sony stars such as barbara streisand and beyonce and bmg stars , including elvis presley and christina aguilera . massive job cuts expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated music cds the japanese and german parent groups argue that their businesses need to join forces to tackle the crisis in the global music industry faced with both pirate cds and an explosion of illegal music downloading . but the latest case of media consolidation comes at a cost .
according to reports , sony and bmg plan to axe a quarter of their joint workforce , or some 3,000 jobs , once the tie-up has been approved . at sonybmg the overhaul will produce one-off costs of $ 300 million to 350 million dollars -lrb- € 244 million to € 284 million -rrb- , mainly covering severance terms for a large portion of the group 's employees , the financial times reported last week . executives at bertelsmann , hoped to achieve 85 percent of the cutbacks by next june , it added .
but detailed plans for cost-cutting measures will begin only after competition authorities cleared the merger . brussels does an about-face the brussels green light comes four years after the european commission effectively blocked another music tie-up , between emi and time warner . initially the commission appeared to be preparing a red light for the sony / bmg tie-up as well .
in may eu competition commissioner mario monti -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a preliminary assessment that it would be " incompatible " with eu rules . many also expressed concern that such a deal would lead to fewer consumer choices on the market and endanger the nascent legal online music downloading trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for competition mario monti but the man who made a name for himself after taking on microsoft softened his tone after closed-door talks with the two sides and several independent labels in brussels .
inside sources say monti apparently secured guarantees that the merger would not lead to reduced competition and thus higher prices for consumers . critics of the deal and independent recording companies remain concerned .
impala , an umbrella group representing more than 2,000 independent labels said the merger would further reduce smaller companies ' ability to give up-and-coming artists exposure .
it has threatened to take legal action to have the brussels decision overturned . bmg is in a strong position as it prepares for the tie-up .
it posted record operating profits of € 30 million -lrb- $ 37.4 million -rrb- in the first half of this year , der spiegel newsmagazine reported in its latest edition .
the result , the best six month figures in its history , puts bmg in a strong position for negotiating the deal with sony music , with the two sides expected to meet this week on a reorganization after the brussels decision .
andreas gravermeyer , spokesman for bertelsmann ag , said the the entire industry will benefit from the merger , because it will " create a recording music business better able to serve artists and consumers in the rapidly changing market . "
as to bertelsmann 's own benefits from the tie-up , gravermeyer said after the deal goes through , the company will enjoy " a leading market position in all its core businesses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.07.2004 german media cleans stasi out of its closet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi spies were everywhere - even at public tv stations the long tentacles of east germany 's former state secret police , the stasi , not only reached the communist media , but infiltrated west german public broadcasters as well , a new study has found . three years ago , german public broadcaster ard launched a project that would be uncomfortable for many media organizations .
it assigned a team of researchers to uncover the ways the east german secret service sought to manipulate the west german organization 's news coverage during the cold war and whether it sought to recruit its journalists as spies .
it 's long been known that some west german media workers did spy for the stasi , but a report released on monday shines a veritable floodlight on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rows and rows of files in the state-run agency for housing stasi archives .
the study , commissioned by ard and produced in tandem with the state-run agency responsible for the stasi archives and historians at berlin 's free university , comprises over 1,000 pages of proof that the stasi skipped no opportunity to control the mass media in its own country and also manipulate and infiltrate radio and tv stations in west germany during the communist era .
a propaganda machine however , the report found that despite massive efforts to influence the programming of west german public broadcasters , it never succeeded in doing so .
additionally , it found , none of the informants working with the stasi served in senior positions or on boards responsible for high-level programming decisions .
nevertheless , the study did conclude that the communist party had been successful in promulgating disinformation on domestic policy issues that did often find its way into news reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler of the stasi archive marianne birthler , director of the federal authority that serves as guardian of the stasi archive , praised the study as a good example of germans working through their past .
" the study is a unique project , " she said .
" there is no other institution that has tried to work through its own past like this . "
the authors of the survey were able to tap into new archived material that was only made available to germany by the united states in 2003 .
after years of negotiations , the us administration returned the stasi ’ s so-called " rosewood " files , which contain the names of over 50,000 potential undercover agents , among them an estimated 12,000 from the west .
revelations damage journalists the study adds more names to the list of those east german journalists whom the stasi used as informers , bringing the total to 42 .
many other eastern german journalists have already taken leave after revelations about their involvement with the stasi surfaced .
the report also cited 61 west german spies , a high number , but lower than some ard officials had expected .
mixed motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while east german journalists may have acted under enormous stasi pressure , west german journalists working for the stasi often had other motives , offering their services for money or out of anti-capitalist or communist convictions .
according to the study , the list of those west german journalists who collaborated with the stasi is astonishingly long .
it is also feeding considerable public interest .
many are interested in the subject , " because a spy network is involved and of course there are a lot of interesting and fascinating stories about the attempt of the stasi to undermine broadcasting enterprises , " the director of an ard-affiliated tv network in the west , fritz pleitgen , said .
" we found that the strategy in the activity of the stasi was so gigantic - and we did n't expect that . "
terrorist plots ?
in some instances , the data exchange went far beyond journalism .
jochen staadt of berlin ’ s free university and co-author of the study reported on cases where west german stasi spies delivered information on how to blow up broadcasting houses in the west and kill or deport journalists in the event of a political crisis .
" what they collected was material to use to intervene in a situation of crisis in west germany and west berlin , " he explained .
" they would have done this .
we know that they supported terrorist organizations in west germany and they had no problem using violence against institutions and people .

it assigned a team of researchers to uncover the ways the east german secret service sought to manipulate the west german organization 's news coverage during the cold war and whether it sought to recruit its journalists as spies .
it 's long been known that some west german media workers did spy for the stasi , but a report released on monday shines a veritable floodlight on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rows and rows of files in the state-run agency for housing stasi archives .
the study , commissioned by ard and produced in tandem with the state-run agency responsible for the stasi archives and historians at berlin 's free university , comprises over 1,000 pages of proof that the stasi skipped no opportunity to control the mass media in its own country and also manipulate and infiltrate radio and tv stations in west germany during the communist era .
a propaganda machine however , the report found that despite massive efforts to influence the programming of west german public broadcasters , it never succeeded in doing so .
additionally , it found , none of the informants working with the stasi served in senior positions or on boards responsible for high-level programming decisions .
nevertheless , the study did conclude that the communist party had been successful in promulgating disinformation on domestic policy issues that did often find its way into news reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler of the stasi archive marianne birthler , director of the federal authority that serves as guardian of the stasi archive , praised the study as a good example of germans working through their past .
" the study is a unique project , " she said .
" there is no other institution that has tried to work through its own past like this . "
the authors of the survey were able to tap into new archived material that was only made available to germany by the united states in 2003 .
after years of negotiations , the us administration returned the stasi ’ s so-called " rosewood " files , which contain the names of over 50,000 potential undercover agents , among them an estimated 12,000 from the west .
revelations damage journalists the study adds more names to the list of those east german journalists whom the stasi used as informers , bringing the total to 42 .
many other eastern german journalists have already taken leave after revelations about their involvement with the stasi surfaced .
the report also cited 61 west german spies , a high number , but lower than some ard officials had expected .
mixed motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while east german journalists may have acted under enormous stasi pressure , west german journalists working for the stasi often had other motives , offering their services for money or out of anti-capitalist or communist convictions .
according to the study , the list of those west german journalists who collaborated with the stasi is astonishingly long .
it is also feeding considerable public interest .
many are interested in the subject , " because a spy network is involved and of course there are a lot of interesting and fascinating stories about the attempt of the stasi to undermine broadcasting enterprises , " the director of an ard-affiliated tv network in the west , fritz pleitgen , said .
" we found that the strategy in the activity of the stasi was so gigantic - and we did n't expect that . "
terrorist plots ?
in some instances , the data exchange went far beyond journalism .
jochen staadt of berlin ’ s free university and co-author of the study reported on cases where west german stasi spies delivered information on how to blow up broadcasting houses in the west and kill or deport journalists in the event of a political crisis .
" what they collected was material to use to intervene in a situation of crisis in west germany and west berlin , " he explained .
" they would have done this .

the chancellor should let it be , some experts say a recent bout of mergers involving european companies has some calling for government intervention to help german companies on the international market .
but monopoly watchdogs reject that idea . earlier this year when the french company sanofi took over the german-french pharmaceutical giant aventis - with support from the french govenment - not only were eyebrows raised here in germany , but the government was pressured to help german companies compete on the international market . however , the german monopoly commission thinks otherwise .
this body of government-appointed experts is charged with observing the development of competition in germany and rejects the promotion of so called “ national champions . ” france may have spent billions of euros propping its heavy industry , it sector and the likes of the concorde .
but martin hellwig , the head of germany ’ s monopoly commission , believes the german government should not make the same mistakes .
he even argues that the government is not the right body to identify the national industrial champions of the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal production has long been a heavily subsidized industry in germany " typically government aims to subsidize or give privileges to certain companies tends to be directed towards industries of the past or to politically well connected industries , " he said , adding that factories in important constituencies that are critical for elections are an example .
" it has nothing to do with a good use of public resources for economic policy . “ companies , not economies , compete hellwig said the idea of trying to strengthen germany ’ s international competitiveness by using subsidies to turn companies into global players is wrong .
he said it is companies and not economies which compete internationally .
he points out that national champions could even harm the national market . " a policy that is directed to helping some firms , even if it is directed to helping some firms internationally , tends to burden others , " he said .
" because prices adjust , exchange rates adjust , wages adjust and the changes in economic structure that are induced are beyond the government ’ s ability to forsee .
they simply don ’ t have the information to do the right thing . “ as a general rule , competition policy is in the hands of the cartel office and the german regulatory authorities which apply the laws against restraints to competition .
they do so very ably , but at the same time the german government prevents more competition in several areas , hellwig said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unidentified managers of deutsche post show a airplane-model of the daughter company dhl " in certain areas , where it is a question of changing laws , a question of adapting systems , liberalizing industries , getting rid of post monopolies like telecommunications , the postal system , the energy sector , the government , indeed , has been a bit too prone to maintaining incumbents of the past , " he said , adding that this happened partly for fiscal reasons or furthering national champions . " after all , the government is still a major shareholder , " he said , citing the emergence of deutsche post as a global player in the logistics field . liberalization fails to bring more competition hellwig pointed out that another example is the energy market where liberalization didn ’ t bring about more competition in germany . " germany unlike the united kingdom has chosen not to vertically disintegrate the industry into companies managing networks , manging electricity grids and companies managing electricity production and distribution , " he said .
" so the network owners are parts of corporations that also produce and sell electricity and they use the transmission fees as a tool to keep competition out . “ when the liberalization process in the german energy market began three years ago , germany was the only eu-country without a regulatory authority in this field .
and regulating will only start next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this may be too late in the energy sector as german transmission prices of electricity are already excessive and among the highest in europe . in part this has been made possible and legalized by the government .
it was no surprise when vattenfall europe , one of only four companies dominating the german energy market , announced last week to increase transmission prices by another 20 percent next year . telecommunications law under criticism also coming in for criticism from the monopoly commission is germany ’ s telecommunications law .
hellwig said it ’ s structure and regulations introduce many changes with lots of legal uncertainty and will work in favour of the incumbent and to the disadvantage of the competitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " as long as prices are fixed under a price-cap regime where the regulatory authority sets just an upper bound for an overall index of prices , under the new law the incumbent is perfectly free to use any price to discourage entry , to impede competitors , even if it is a price below cost that would be regarded as predatory under ordinary competition law , “ he said . opposition politicians have welcomed the monopoly commission report and appealed to economics minister wolfgang clement and chancellor gerhard schröder to consider the commission ’ s proposed changes to the draft competition laws . steffen marquart -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu approves sony-bmg merger the european commission has given its green light tuesday to a merger between japan 's sony and the music arm of germany 's bertelsmann , in the latest global entertainment industry tie-up .
-lrb- july 20 , 2004 -rrb- germany gets back its appetite for mergers after a lull period , new life is being breathed into the german market for mergers and acquisitions .

it assigned a team of researchers to uncover the ways the east german secret service sought to manipulate the west german organization 's news coverage during the cold war and whether it sought to recruit its journalists as spies .
it 's long been known that some west german media workers did spy for the stasi , but a report released on monday shines a veritable floodlight on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rows and rows of files in the state-run agency for housing stasi archives .
the study , commissioned by ard and produced in tandem with the state-run agency responsible for the stasi archives and historians at berlin 's free university , comprises over 1,000 pages of proof that the stasi skipped no opportunity to control the mass media in its own country and also manipulate and infiltrate radio and tv stations in west germany during the communist era .
a propaganda machine however , the report found that despite massive efforts to influence the programming of west german public broadcasters , it never succeeded in doing so .
additionally , it found , none of the informants working with the stasi served in senior positions or on boards responsible for high-level programming decisions .
nevertheless , the study did conclude that the communist party had been successful in promulgating disinformation on domestic policy issues that did often find its way into news reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler of the stasi archive marianne birthler , director of the federal authority that serves as guardian of the stasi archive , praised the study as a good example of germans working through their past .
" the study is a unique project , " she said .
" there is no other institution that has tried to work through its own past like this . "
the authors of the survey were able to tap into new archived material that was only made available to germany by the united states in 2003 .
after years of negotiations , the us administration returned the stasi ’ s so-called " rosewood " files , which contain the names of over 50,000 potential undercover agents , among them an estimated 12,000 from the west .
revelations damage journalists the study adds more names to the list of those east german journalists whom the stasi used as informers , bringing the total to 42 .
many other eastern german journalists have already taken leave after revelations about their involvement with the stasi surfaced .
the report also cited 61 west german spies , a high number , but lower than some ard officials had expected .
mixed motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while east german journalists may have acted under enormous stasi pressure , west german journalists working for the stasi often had other motives , offering their services for money or out of anti-capitalist or communist convictions .
according to the study , the list of those west german journalists who collaborated with the stasi is astonishingly long .
it is also feeding considerable public interest .
many are interested in the subject , " because a spy network is involved and of course there are a lot of interesting and fascinating stories about the attempt of the stasi to undermine broadcasting enterprises , " the director of an ard-affiliated tv network in the west , fritz pleitgen , said .
" we found that the strategy in the activity of the stasi was so gigantic - and we did n't expect that . "
terrorist plots ?
in some instances , the data exchange went far beyond journalism .
jochen staadt of berlin ’ s free university and co-author of the study reported on cases where west german stasi spies delivered information on how to blow up broadcasting houses in the west and kill or deport journalists in the event of a political crisis .
" what they collected was material to use to intervene in a situation of crisis in west germany and west berlin , " he explained .
" they would have done this .
we know that they supported terrorist organizations in west germany and they had no problem using violence against institutions and people .

" die alm " or " the alps , " is a sort of alpine-reality-docu-soap , in which a slew of german b-list celebrities gets down and dirty with everyday life on an alpine farm .
of course , no alpine pasture would be complete without real live farm animals , which provide the celebs with countless opportunities to boost ratings by engaging in gross-out stunts such as having goats lick syrup off their bodies , or sucking milk from a cow 's udder . but the last straw for german animal activists came when a recent episode showed a turkey being slaughtered .
now , the german society for the protection of animals -lrb- dtb -rrb- says it 's looking at taking legal steps against the show , which runs on munich-based private broadcaster , prosieben . " we do n't care if third-rate celebrities bathe in manure or throw themselves naked down a hillside , " said dtb head thomas schröder .
" but animals ca n't say yes or no .
the show has overstepped the legal and ethical boundaries . " prosieben is nonplussed but intends to continue airing the show as planned .
tuesday evening 's episode includes showing the candidates how to empty the intestines of a freshly slaughtered pig , for later use as sausage casings .
the executive in charge of the show , christian asanger , has even invited members of the animal society out to the mountain pasture .
" we have nothing to hide , " he said . makeover-shows also a target in a world where there 's no such thing as bad publicity , experts say such protests are a welcome additional marketing strategy for the shows , which thrive on high ratings and advertising revenue . if that 's true , then other german reality tv shows which feature plastic surgery and makeovers instead of farm animals can also expect a ratings boost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a big brother candidate prepares to go under the knife .
cologne-based private broadcaster rtl ii whipped up a storm of protest last week when it announced it would let candidates participating in its " big brother " reality show undergo cosmetic surgery .
the german association of plastic surgeons -lrb- vdäpc -rrb- objected , not just to " big brother , " but also to other makeover reality shows that recently hit the german airwaves . in mtv 's " i want a famous face , " teens put themselves at the mercy of plastic surgeons in order to wake up looking like stars such as brad pitt or kate winslet .
prosieben 's " the swan " is a reality tv-show format imported from the us , in which ugly ducklings are turned into … well , swans , with the help of plastic surgeons , fitness trainers , nutritionists and psychologists .
the most beautiful " swan " to emerge out of the 16 candidates wins a modeling contract . do n't blame plastic surgeons these shows are giving plastic surgery a bad name , according to the vdäpc .
" what we do is medical work .
we treat patients .
we do n't sell the product ' beauty ' , " said the association 's senior president , constanze neuhann-lorenz .
in a letter sent to the association 's 120 members , president rolf rüdiger olbrisch wrote : " let 's protect ourselves from landing in the wrong hands and wrong publicity , of the wrong business . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a staple operation for all reality makeover shows - breast enlargement .
germany 's media regulatory board said certain boundaries have to be respected , even in an industry that 's all about erasing the boundaries between private and public life . " showing plastic surgery can hurt the dignity of a human being , even if the person having the surgery does n't have a problem with it , " said the head of the director 's conference for germany 's state media boards , wolfgang thaenert .
" basically , it 's about respecting the final boundaries that touch on human dignity .

" die alm " or " the alps , " is a sort of alpine-reality-docu-soap , in which a slew of german b-list celebrities gets down and dirty with everyday life on an alpine farm .
of course , no alpine pasture would be complete without real live farm animals , which provide the celebs with countless opportunities to boost ratings by engaging in gross-out stunts such as having goats lick syrup off their bodies , or sucking milk from a cow 's udder . but the last straw for german animal activists came when a recent episode showed a turkey being slaughtered .
now , the german society for the protection of animals -lrb- dtb -rrb- says it 's looking at taking legal steps against the show , which runs on munich-based private broadcaster , prosieben . " we do n't care if third-rate celebrities bathe in manure or throw themselves naked down a hillside , " said dtb head thomas schröder .
" but animals ca n't say yes or no .
the show has overstepped the legal and ethical boundaries . " prosieben is nonplussed but intends to continue airing the show as planned .
tuesday evening 's episode includes showing the candidates how to empty the intestines of a freshly slaughtered pig , for later use as sausage casings .
the executive in charge of the show , christian asanger , has even invited members of the animal society out to the mountain pasture .
" we have nothing to hide , " he said . makeover-shows also a target in a world where there 's no such thing as bad publicity , experts say such protests are a welcome additional marketing strategy for the shows , which thrive on high ratings and advertising revenue . if that 's true , then other german reality tv shows which feature plastic surgery and makeovers instead of farm animals can also expect a ratings boost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a big brother candidate prepares to go under the knife .
cologne-based private broadcaster rtl ii whipped up a storm of protest last week when it announced it would let candidates participating in its " big brother " reality show undergo cosmetic surgery .
the german association of plastic surgeons -lrb- vdäpc -rrb- objected , not just to " big brother , " but also to other makeover reality shows that recently hit the german airwaves . in mtv 's " i want a famous face , " teens put themselves at the mercy of plastic surgeons in order to wake up looking like stars such as brad pitt or kate winslet .
prosieben 's " the swan " is a reality tv-show format imported from the us , in which ugly ducklings are turned into … well , swans , with the help of plastic surgeons , fitness trainers , nutritionists and psychologists .
the most beautiful " swan " to emerge out of the 16 candidates wins a modeling contract . do n't blame plastic surgeons these shows are giving plastic surgery a bad name , according to the vdäpc .
" what we do is medical work .
we treat patients .
we do n't sell the product ' beauty ' , " said the association 's senior president , constanze neuhann-lorenz .
in a letter sent to the association 's 120 members , president rolf rüdiger olbrisch wrote : " let 's protect ourselves from landing in the wrong hands and wrong publicity , of the wrong business . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a staple operation for all reality makeover shows - breast enlargement .
germany 's media regulatory board said certain boundaries have to be respected , even in an industry that 's all about erasing the boundaries between private and public life . " showing plastic surgery can hurt the dignity of a human being , even if the person having the surgery does n't have a problem with it , " said the head of the director 's conference for germany 's state media boards , wolfgang thaenert .
" basically , it 's about respecting the final boundaries that touch on human dignity .

in a telephone conversation with the deputy head of dfb , franz beckenbauer , on saturday , the coach who brought greece to victory in the euro 2004 soccer championships in lisbon , said he was not available for the job .
rehhagel told beckenbauer that during his three years with the greek team , he had really built something , and that he wanted to stay true to his word and stick with the team through the 2006 world cup , when his contract expires .
by rejecting , rehhagel also turned down a huge chunk of cash .
in greece , the 65-year-old has earned € 600,000 for his work as top coach , but in germany he could have earned up to € 5 million between now and the world cup , according to media reports .

israeli television cited chirac as saying , " you are not welcome after your comments , . "
a spokeswoman for the french government said , according to agency reports , " a possible visit by the israeli prime minister to paris , for which no date has been set , will be examined only when the explanations called for have been provided " .
for its part , israel played down the spat , describing it as a " misunderstanding " .
however , ha 'aretz newspaper quoted sharon 's office as saying , " the prime minister reiterates there is anti-semitism in france , and despite the serious measures the french government is taking , he urges french jews to immigrate to israel - just as he urges all jews worldwide to immigrate to israel . "
sharon 's comments were roundly condemned by jewish groups throughout france as , in the words of one jewish leader , " pouring oil on the fire . "
the number of anti-semitic events in france has risen sharply in the first half of this year .

the new company , to be called sonybmg , will be the world 's second largest music label , behind universal music . if the merger actually goes ahead , the market will be carved up between four instead of five majors : vivendi 's universal , the newly-created sonybmg , warner and emi .
together they would share around 80 percent of european recorded music sales . sources say the german-japanese tie-up should also win approval from the us federal trade commission within days . the european and us competition authorities have run parallel investigations into the merger , which will create the world 's largest music company in terms of market share according to 2003 figures . the 50:50 merger will bring together sony stars such as barbara streisand and beyonce and bmg stars , including elvis presley and christina aguilera . massive job cuts expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated music cds the japanese and german parent groups argue that their businesses need to join forces to tackle the crisis in the global music industry faced with both pirate cds and an explosion of illegal music downloading . but the latest case of media consolidation comes at a cost .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.07.2004 germany remembers plot to kill hitler großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler honors stauffenberg and the others tuesday marks the 60th anniversary of claus schenk graf von stauffenberg 's attempt to assassinate hitler .
while some debate whether he acted out of personal interest or altruism , most germans are taking a positive view . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , an aristocratic colonel in the nazi army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military , including friedrich olbricht and henning von tresckow , plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power . shortly after noon on a hot summer day , stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's " wolf 's lair " hideaway -lrb- in what is today poland -rrb- , where the dictator was seated around a large wooden table with 22 other nazi officials . stauffenberg placed the briefcase under the table , made an excuse to leave , and watched the explosion from afar as he raced towards his getaway car .
confident he had completed his mission and an impending coup would soon place him and like-minded co-conspirators in power , stauffenberg made haste to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shortly after the botched assassination attempt against adolf hitler , july 20 , 1944 .
behind hitler to the left is martin bormann , to the far left is otto skorzeny .
on the right with the bandaged head is alfred jodl .
but , in what is largely viewed as one of the greatest tragedies in history , things did not work out that way .
miraculously , hitler survived the blast that killed four others , and the opposition 's poor planning , lack of support and hesitation at crucial moments played into the führer 's hands . by midnight - just twelve hours later - hitler had regained the upper hand and squashed the rebellion .
stauffenberg and three others were executed by firing squad in berlin .
in the coming weeks , an additional 140 people implicated in the plot were killed and more than 5,000 conspirators and political opponents were rounded-up . hero or traitor ? had stauffenberg been successful , the final phase of the war would certainly have gone differently .
the fact remains that more people died between the july assassination attempt and the end of the war than in the four-and-a-half years prior to that .
few doubt that hitler 's demise would not have seriously affected the german army 's ability to go on fighting , if not ended hostilities sooner and saved thousands of lives .
yet , stauffenberg 's place in history as a hero of the german resistance has not been so easily established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claus graf schenk von stauffenberg in 1940 with his children berthold , franz-ludwig und haimeran . in the initial decade after the end of the war , the german public largely viewed him as a traitor .
his wife was denied a pension , and no memorials were erected to mark the bravery of those within hitler 's own military establishment who risked their lives to set the country on a different course . in the 1960 's , as a younger generation of germans confronted their parents over their country 's nazi past , stauffenberg was not necessarily rehabilitated into an honorable symbol of the german resistance .
some were suspicious of his motives , accusing him of acting more out of self-interest , and less out of benevolent concern for the plight of the jews and other victims of nazi war crimes . a surge of new interest but as the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt approached , a number of new films , documentaries and books enlivened the debate and once again drew attention to stauffenberg and his band of subversives .
german public broadcaster swr produced a film by director jo baier entitled " stauffenberg , " which topped prime time ratings with a 23 percent audience share .
another german broadcaster produced a four-part documentary entitled " they wanted to kill hitler , " which proved equally popular .
numerous new autobiographies and books chronicling the event hit the shelves in bookstores . along with this surge of interest , the german public 's view , it seems , has also shifted .
according to a recent poll in the german news weekly spiegel more than 75 percent of germans surveyed said they esteem or admire stauffenberg and his co-conspirators . in what is perhaps a final nod of approval , german chancellor gerhard schröder presides over a ceremony on tuesday to mark the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt . perspectives change over time the german public 's growing esteem for stauffenberg and company begs the question : what 's changed ?
according to johannes tuchel , director of the german resistance memorial center in berlin , most germans were - implicitly , at least - hitler supporters , and those in the resistance were in the minority . " after the war , germany did not change its population , " he said in an interview with dw-world .
" now we have a new generation , and they are interested in what happened on july 20 , 1944 . " that interest has manifested itself in the spate of recent movies and books .
many are drawn to the material in the hopes of learning how a group of military officers changed their view of hitler radically enough to plot a coup . for that question , however , there is no easy answer .
" they had a broad spectrum of motivations , " says tuchel of those involved in the plot .
" some were social democrats , some former labor union activists , some had authoritarian goals . " two things , according to tuchel , united them : they wanted to re-establish the rule of law and end the war .
in the case of stauffenberg , tuchel says historical evidence proves that a growing disgust for nazi war crimes was his primary motivating factor . the german resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel jonah goldhagen , u.s. author of the book " hitler 's willing executioners . "
academics have long debated whether the guilt for nazi crimes should be borne individually , by those who committed the crimes , or collectively , by the german people .
in the 1997 book " hitler 's willing executioners , " us historian daniel goldhagen -lrb- photo -rrb- argued in favor of the theory of collective guilt .
not surprisingly , his theory proved highly controversial in germany .
it 's no wonder that the german public is fascinated by more inspiring tales of resistance . the german resistance memorial center in berlin features exhibitions on stauffenberg , as well as others like the " white rose " student movement which sprung up in munich .
but tuchel is careful not to exaggerate the size of the resistance , pointing out that hitler 's opponents - those willing to take action - were always in the minority .
" this was such a small operation , that the same man -lrb- stauffenberg -rrb- who planted the bomb , had to run back to berlin on the same day to help organize the coup , " he said . on tuesday afternoon , schröder will urge germans to remember stauffenberg and his network of co-conspirators .
how they choose to recall the event will remain a matter of ongoing debate . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historical reference work delves into scholars ' past the " international encyclopaedia of german studies scholars " has triggered a national debate on the nazi past of several high-profile scholars , and it has n't even been published yet .

yet , stauffenberg 's place in history as a hero of the german resistance has not been so easily established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claus graf schenk von stauffenberg in 1940 with his children berthold , franz-ludwig und haimeran . in the initial decade after the end of the war , the german public largely viewed him as a traitor .
his wife was denied a pension , and no memorials were erected to mark the bravery of those within hitler 's own military establishment who risked their lives to set the country on a different course . in the 1960 's , as a younger generation of germans confronted their parents over their country 's nazi past , stauffenberg was not necessarily rehabilitated into an honorable symbol of the german resistance .
some were suspicious of his motives , accusing him of acting more out of self-interest , and less out of benevolent concern for the plight of the jews and other victims of nazi war crimes . a surge of new interest but as the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt approached , a number of new films , documentaries and books enlivened the debate and once again drew attention to stauffenberg and his band of subversives .
german public broadcaster swr produced a film by director jo baier entitled " stauffenberg , " which topped prime time ratings with a 23 percent audience share .
another german broadcaster produced a four-part documentary entitled " they wanted to kill hitler , " which proved equally popular .
numerous new autobiographies and books chronicling the event hit the shelves in bookstores . along with this surge of interest , the german public 's view , it seems , has also shifted .
according to a recent poll in the german news weekly spiegel more than 75 percent of germans surveyed said they esteem or admire stauffenberg and his co-conspirators . in what is perhaps a final nod of approval , german chancellor gerhard schröder presides over a ceremony on tuesday to mark the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt . perspectives change over time the german public 's growing esteem for stauffenberg and company begs the question : what 's changed ?
according to johannes tuchel , director of the german resistance memorial center in berlin , most germans were - implicitly , at least - hitler supporters , and those in the resistance were in the minority . " after the war , germany did not change its population , " he said in an interview with dw-world .
" now we have a new generation , and they are interested in what happened on july 20 , 1944 . " that interest has manifested itself in the spate of recent movies and books .
many are drawn to the material in the hopes of learning how a group of military officers changed their view of hitler radically enough to plot a coup . for that question , however , there is no easy answer .
" they had a broad spectrum of motivations , " says tuchel of those involved in the plot .
" some were social democrats , some former labor union activists , some had authoritarian goals . " two things , according to tuchel , united them : they wanted to re-establish the rule of law and end the war .
in the case of stauffenberg , tuchel says historical evidence proves that a growing disgust for nazi war crimes was his primary motivating factor . the german resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel jonah goldhagen , u.s. author of the book " hitler 's willing executioners . "
academics have long debated whether the guilt for nazi crimes should be borne individually , by those who committed the crimes , or collectively , by the german people .
in the 1997 book " hitler 's willing executioners , " us historian daniel goldhagen -lrb- photo -rrb- argued in favor of the theory of collective guilt .
not surprisingly , his theory proved highly controversial in germany .
it 's no wonder that the german public is fascinated by more inspiring tales of resistance . the german resistance memorial center in berlin features exhibitions on stauffenberg , as well as others like the " white rose " student movement which sprung up in munich .
but tuchel is careful not to exaggerate the size of the resistance , pointing out that hitler 's opponents - those willing to take action - were always in the minority .
" this was such a small operation , that the same man -lrb- stauffenberg -rrb- who planted the bomb , had to run back to berlin on the same day to help organize the coup , " he said . on tuesday afternoon , schröder will urge germans to remember stauffenberg and his network of co-conspirators .

while some debate whether he acted out of personal interest or altruism , most germans are taking a positive view . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , an aristocratic colonel in the nazi army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military , including friedrich olbricht and henning von tresckow , plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power . shortly after noon on a hot summer day , stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's " wolf 's lair " hideaway -lrb- in what is today poland -rrb- , where the dictator was seated around a large wooden table with 22 other nazi officials . stauffenberg placed the briefcase under the table , made an excuse to leave , and watched the explosion from afar as he raced towards his getaway car .
confident he had completed his mission and an impending coup would soon place him and like-minded co-conspirators in power , stauffenberg made haste to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shortly after the botched assassination attempt against adolf hitler , july 20 , 1944 .
behind hitler to the left is martin bormann , to the far left is otto skorzeny .
on the right with the bandaged head is alfred jodl .
but , in what is largely viewed as one of the greatest tragedies in history , things did not work out that way .
miraculously , hitler survived the blast that killed four others , and the opposition 's poor planning , lack of support and hesitation at crucial moments played into the führer 's hands . by midnight - just twelve hours later - hitler had regained the upper hand and squashed the rebellion .
stauffenberg and three others were executed by firing squad in berlin .
in the coming weeks , an additional 140 people implicated in the plot were killed and more than 5,000 conspirators and political opponents were rounded-up . hero or traitor ? had stauffenberg been successful , the final phase of the war would certainly have gone differently .
the fact remains that more people died between the july assassination attempt and the end of the war than in the four-and-a-half years prior to that .

while some debate whether he acted out of personal interest or altruism , most germans are taking a positive view . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , an aristocratic colonel in the nazi army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military , including friedrich olbricht and henning von tresckow , plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power . shortly after noon on a hot summer day , stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's " wolf 's lair " hideaway -lrb- in what is today poland -rrb- , where the dictator was seated around a large wooden table with 22 other nazi officials . stauffenberg placed the briefcase under the table , made an excuse to leave , and watched the explosion from afar as he raced towards his getaway car .
confident he had completed his mission and an impending coup would soon place him and like-minded co-conspirators in power , stauffenberg made haste to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shortly after the botched assassination attempt against adolf hitler , july 20 , 1944 .
behind hitler to the left is martin bormann , to the far left is otto skorzeny .
on the right with the bandaged head is alfred jodl .
but , in what is largely viewed as one of the greatest tragedies in history , things did not work out that way .
miraculously , hitler survived the blast that killed four others , and the opposition 's poor planning , lack of support and hesitation at crucial moments played into the führer 's hands . by midnight - just twelve hours later - hitler had regained the upper hand and squashed the rebellion .
stauffenberg and three others were executed by firing squad in berlin .
in the coming weeks , an additional 140 people implicated in the plot were killed and more than 5,000 conspirators and political opponents were rounded-up . hero or traitor ? had stauffenberg been successful , the final phase of the war would certainly have gone differently .
the fact remains that more people died between the july assassination attempt and the end of the war than in the four-and-a-half years prior to that .
few doubt that hitler 's demise would not have seriously affected the german army 's ability to go on fighting , if not ended hostilities sooner and saved thousands of lives .
yet , stauffenberg 's place in history as a hero of the german resistance has not been so easily established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claus graf schenk von stauffenberg in 1940 with his children berthold , franz-ludwig und haimeran . in the initial decade after the end of the war , the german public largely viewed him as a traitor .
his wife was denied a pension , and no memorials were erected to mark the bravery of those within hitler 's own military establishment who risked their lives to set the country on a different course . in the 1960 's , as a younger generation of germans confronted their parents over their country 's nazi past , stauffenberg was not necessarily rehabilitated into an honorable symbol of the german resistance .
some were suspicious of his motives , accusing him of acting more out of self-interest , and less out of benevolent concern for the plight of the jews and other victims of nazi war crimes . a surge of new interest but as the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt approached , a number of new films , documentaries and books enlivened the debate and once again drew attention to stauffenberg and his band of subversives .
german public broadcaster swr produced a film by director jo baier entitled " stauffenberg , " which topped prime time ratings with a 23 percent audience share .
another german broadcaster produced a four-part documentary entitled " they wanted to kill hitler , " which proved equally popular .
numerous new autobiographies and books chronicling the event hit the shelves in bookstores . along with this surge of interest , the german public 's view , it seems , has also shifted .
according to a recent poll in the german news weekly spiegel more than 75 percent of germans surveyed said they esteem or admire stauffenberg and his co-conspirators . in what is perhaps a final nod of approval , german chancellor gerhard schröder presides over a ceremony on tuesday to mark the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt . perspectives change over time the german public 's growing esteem for stauffenberg and company begs the question : what 's changed ?
according to johannes tuchel , director of the german resistance memorial center in berlin , most germans were - implicitly , at least - hitler supporters , and those in the resistance were in the minority . " after the war , germany did not change its population , " he said in an interview with dw-world .
" now we have a new generation , and they are interested in what happened on july 20 , 1944 . " that interest has manifested itself in the spate of recent movies and books .
many are drawn to the material in the hopes of learning how a group of military officers changed their view of hitler radically enough to plot a coup . for that question , however , there is no easy answer .
" they had a broad spectrum of motivations , " says tuchel of those involved in the plot .

" die alm " or " the alps , " is a sort of alpine-reality-docu-soap , in which a slew of german b-list celebrities gets down and dirty with everyday life on an alpine farm .
of course , no alpine pasture would be complete without real live farm animals , which provide the celebs with countless opportunities to boost ratings by engaging in gross-out stunts such as having goats lick syrup off their bodies , or sucking milk from a cow 's udder . but the last straw for german animal activists came when a recent episode showed a turkey being slaughtered .
now , the german society for the protection of animals -lrb- dtb -rrb- says it 's looking at taking legal steps against the show , which runs on munich-based private broadcaster , prosieben . " we do n't care if third-rate celebrities bathe in manure or throw themselves naked down a hillside , " said dtb head thomas schröder .
" but animals ca n't say yes or no .
the show has overstepped the legal and ethical boundaries . " prosieben is nonplussed but intends to continue airing the show as planned .
tuesday evening 's episode includes showing the candidates how to empty the intestines of a freshly slaughtered pig , for later use as sausage casings .
the executive in charge of the show , christian asanger , has even invited members of the animal society out to the mountain pasture .
" we have nothing to hide , " he said . makeover-shows also a target in a world where there 's no such thing as bad publicity , experts say such protests are a welcome additional marketing strategy for the shows , which thrive on high ratings and advertising revenue . if that 's true , then other german reality tv shows which feature plastic surgery and makeovers instead of farm animals can also expect a ratings boost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a big brother candidate prepares to go under the knife .
cologne-based private broadcaster rtl ii whipped up a storm of protest last week when it announced it would let candidates participating in its " big brother " reality show undergo cosmetic surgery .
the german association of plastic surgeons -lrb- vdäpc -rrb- objected , not just to " big brother , " but also to other makeover reality shows that recently hit the german airwaves . in mtv 's " i want a famous face , " teens put themselves at the mercy of plastic surgeons in order to wake up looking like stars such as brad pitt or kate winslet .
prosieben 's " the swan " is a reality tv-show format imported from the us , in which ugly ducklings are turned into … well , swans , with the help of plastic surgeons , fitness trainers , nutritionists and psychologists .
the most beautiful " swan " to emerge out of the 16 candidates wins a modeling contract . do n't blame plastic surgeons these shows are giving plastic surgery a bad name , according to the vdäpc .
" what we do is medical work .
we treat patients .
we do n't sell the product ' beauty ' , " said the association 's senior president , constanze neuhann-lorenz .
in a letter sent to the association 's 120 members , president rolf rüdiger olbrisch wrote : " let 's protect ourselves from landing in the wrong hands and wrong publicity , of the wrong business . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a staple operation for all reality makeover shows - breast enlargement .
germany 's media regulatory board said certain boundaries have to be respected , even in an industry that 's all about erasing the boundaries between private and public life . " showing plastic surgery can hurt the dignity of a human being , even if the person having the surgery does n't have a problem with it , " said the head of the director 's conference for germany 's state media boards , wolfgang thaenert .

" die alm " or " the alps , " is a sort of alpine-reality-docu-soap , in which a slew of german b-list celebrities gets down and dirty with everyday life on an alpine farm .
of course , no alpine pasture would be complete without real live farm animals , which provide the celebs with countless opportunities to boost ratings by engaging in gross-out stunts such as having goats lick syrup off their bodies , or sucking milk from a cow 's udder . but the last straw for german animal activists came when a recent episode showed a turkey being slaughtered .
now , the german society for the protection of animals -lrb- dtb -rrb- says it 's looking at taking legal steps against the show , which runs on munich-based private broadcaster , prosieben . " we do n't care if third-rate celebrities bathe in manure or throw themselves naked down a hillside , " said dtb head thomas schröder .

the executive in charge of the show , christian asanger , has even invited members of the animal society out to the mountain pasture .
" we have nothing to hide , " he said . makeover-shows also a target in a world where there 's no such thing as bad publicity , experts say such protests are a welcome additional marketing strategy for the shows , which thrive on high ratings and advertising revenue . if that 's true , then other german reality tv shows which feature plastic surgery and makeovers instead of farm animals can also expect a ratings boost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a big brother candidate prepares to go under the knife .
cologne-based private broadcaster rtl ii whipped up a storm of protest last week when it announced it would let candidates participating in its " big brother " reality show undergo cosmetic surgery .
the german association of plastic surgeons -lrb- vdäpc -rrb- objected , not just to " big brother , " but also to other makeover reality shows that recently hit the german airwaves . in mtv 's " i want a famous face , " teens put themselves at the mercy of plastic surgeons in order to wake up looking like stars such as brad pitt or kate winslet .

the chancellor should let it be , some experts say a recent bout of mergers involving european companies has some calling for government intervention to help german companies on the international market .
but monopoly watchdogs reject that idea . earlier this year when the french company sanofi took over the german-french pharmaceutical giant aventis - with support from the french govenment - not only were eyebrows raised here in germany , but the government was pressured to help german companies compete on the international market . however , the german monopoly commission thinks otherwise .
this body of government-appointed experts is charged with observing the development of competition in germany and rejects the promotion of so called “ national champions . ” france may have spent billions of euros propping its heavy industry , it sector and the likes of the concorde .
but martin hellwig , the head of germany ’ s monopoly commission , believes the german government should not make the same mistakes .
he even argues that the government is not the right body to identify the national industrial champions of the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal production has long been a heavily subsidized industry in germany " typically government aims to subsidize or give privileges to certain companies tends to be directed towards industries of the past or to politically well connected industries , " he said , adding that factories in important constituencies that are critical for elections are an example .
" it has nothing to do with a good use of public resources for economic policy . “ companies , not economies , compete hellwig said the idea of trying to strengthen germany ’ s international competitiveness by using subsidies to turn companies into global players is wrong .
he said it is companies and not economies which compete internationally .
he points out that national champions could even harm the national market . " a policy that is directed to helping some firms , even if it is directed to helping some firms internationally , tends to burden others , " he said .
" because prices adjust , exchange rates adjust , wages adjust and the changes in economic structure that are induced are beyond the government ’ s ability to forsee .
they simply don ’ t have the information to do the right thing . “ as a general rule , competition policy is in the hands of the cartel office and the german regulatory authorities which apply the laws against restraints to competition .
they do so very ably , but at the same time the german government prevents more competition in several areas , hellwig said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unidentified managers of deutsche post show a airplane-model of the daughter company dhl " in certain areas , where it is a question of changing laws , a question of adapting systems , liberalizing industries , getting rid of post monopolies like telecommunications , the postal system , the energy sector , the government , indeed , has been a bit too prone to maintaining incumbents of the past , " he said , adding that this happened partly for fiscal reasons or furthering national champions . " after all , the government is still a major shareholder , " he said , citing the emergence of deutsche post as a global player in the logistics field . liberalization fails to bring more competition hellwig pointed out that another example is the energy market where liberalization didn ’ t bring about more competition in germany . " germany unlike the united kingdom has chosen not to vertically disintegrate the industry into companies managing networks , manging electricity grids and companies managing electricity production and distribution , " he said .
" so the network owners are parts of corporations that also produce and sell electricity and they use the transmission fees as a tool to keep competition out . “ when the liberalization process in the german energy market began three years ago , germany was the only eu-country without a regulatory authority in this field .
and regulating will only start next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this may be too late in the energy sector as german transmission prices of electricity are already excessive and among the highest in europe . in part this has been made possible and legalized by the government .
it was no surprise when vattenfall europe , one of only four companies dominating the german energy market , announced last week to increase transmission prices by another 20 percent next year . telecommunications law under criticism also coming in for criticism from the monopoly commission is germany ’ s telecommunications law .
hellwig said it ’ s structure and regulations introduce many changes with lots of legal uncertainty and will work in favour of the incumbent and to the disadvantage of the competitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " as long as prices are fixed under a price-cap regime where the regulatory authority sets just an upper bound for an overall index of prices , under the new law the incumbent is perfectly free to use any price to discourage entry , to impede competitors , even if it is a price below cost that would be regarded as predatory under ordinary competition law , “ he said . opposition politicians have welcomed the monopoly commission report and appealed to economics minister wolfgang clement and chancellor gerhard schröder to consider the commission ’ s proposed changes to the draft competition laws . steffen marquart -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu approves sony-bmg merger the european commission has given its green light tuesday to a merger between japan 's sony and the music arm of germany 's bertelsmann , in the latest global entertainment industry tie-up .

the chancellor should let it be , some experts say a recent bout of mergers involving european companies has some calling for government intervention to help german companies on the international market .
but monopoly watchdogs reject that idea . earlier this year when the french company sanofi took over the german-french pharmaceutical giant aventis - with support from the french govenment - not only were eyebrows raised here in germany , but the government was pressured to help german companies compete on the international market . however , the german monopoly commission thinks otherwise .
this body of government-appointed experts is charged with observing the development of competition in germany and rejects the promotion of so called “ national champions . ” france may have spent billions of euros propping its heavy industry , it sector and the likes of the concorde .
but martin hellwig , the head of germany ’ s monopoly commission , believes the german government should not make the same mistakes .
he even argues that the government is not the right body to identify the national industrial champions of the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal production has long been a heavily subsidized industry in germany " typically government aims to subsidize or give privileges to certain companies tends to be directed towards industries of the past or to politically well connected industries , " he said , adding that factories in important constituencies that are critical for elections are an example .
" it has nothing to do with a good use of public resources for economic policy . “ companies , not economies , compete hellwig said the idea of trying to strengthen germany ’ s international competitiveness by using subsidies to turn companies into global players is wrong .
he said it is companies and not economies which compete internationally .
he points out that national champions could even harm the national market . " a policy that is directed to helping some firms , even if it is directed to helping some firms internationally , tends to burden others , " he said .
" because prices adjust , exchange rates adjust , wages adjust and the changes in economic structure that are induced are beyond the government ’ s ability to forsee .
they simply don ’ t have the information to do the right thing . “ as a general rule , competition policy is in the hands of the cartel office and the german regulatory authorities which apply the laws against restraints to competition .
they do so very ably , but at the same time the german government prevents more competition in several areas , hellwig said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unidentified managers of deutsche post show a airplane-model of the daughter company dhl " in certain areas , where it is a question of changing laws , a question of adapting systems , liberalizing industries , getting rid of post monopolies like telecommunications , the postal system , the energy sector , the government , indeed , has been a bit too prone to maintaining incumbents of the past , " he said , adding that this happened partly for fiscal reasons or furthering national champions .

the new company , to be called sonybmg , will be the world 's second largest music label , behind universal music . if the merger actually goes ahead , the market will be carved up between four instead of five majors : vivendi 's universal , the newly-created sonybmg , warner and emi .
together they would share around 80 percent of european recorded music sales . sources say the german-japanese tie-up should also win approval from the us federal trade commission within days . the european and us competition authorities have run parallel investigations into the merger , which will create the world 's largest music company in terms of market share according to 2003 figures . the 50:50 merger will bring together sony stars such as barbara streisand and beyonce and bmg stars , including elvis presley and christina aguilera . massive job cuts expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated music cds the japanese and german parent groups argue that their businesses need to join forces to tackle the crisis in the global music industry faced with both pirate cds and an explosion of illegal music downloading . but the latest case of media consolidation comes at a cost .
according to reports , sony and bmg plan to axe a quarter of their joint workforce , or some 3,000 jobs , once the tie-up has been approved . at sonybmg the overhaul will produce one-off costs of $ 300 million to 350 million dollars -lrb- € 244 million to € 284 million -rrb- , mainly covering severance terms for a large portion of the group 's employees , the financial times reported last week . executives at bertelsmann , hoped to achieve 85 percent of the cutbacks by next june , it added .
but detailed plans for cost-cutting measures will begin only after competition authorities cleared the merger . brussels does an about-face the brussels green light comes four years after the european commission effectively blocked another music tie-up , between emi and time warner . initially the commission appeared to be preparing a red light for the sony / bmg tie-up as well .

inside sources say monti apparently secured guarantees that the merger would not lead to reduced competition and thus higher prices for consumers . critics of the deal and independent recording companies remain concerned .
impala , an umbrella group representing more than 2,000 independent labels said the merger would further reduce smaller companies ' ability to give up-and-coming artists exposure .

it posted record operating profits of € 30 million -lrb- $ 37.4 million -rrb- in the first half of this year , der spiegel newsmagazine reported in its latest edition .
the result , the best six month figures in its history , puts bmg in a strong position for negotiating the deal with sony music , with the two sides expected to meet this week on a reorganization after the brussels decision .
andreas gravermeyer , spokesman for bertelsmann ag , said the the entire industry will benefit from the merger , because it will " create a recording music business better able to serve artists and consumers in the rapidly changing market . "

the chancellor should let it be , some experts say a recent bout of mergers involving european companies has some calling for government intervention to help german companies on the international market .
but monopoly watchdogs reject that idea . earlier this year when the french company sanofi took over the german-french pharmaceutical giant aventis - with support from the french govenment - not only were eyebrows raised here in germany , but the government was pressured to help german companies compete on the international market . however , the german monopoly commission thinks otherwise .
this body of government-appointed experts is charged with observing the development of competition in germany and rejects the promotion of so called “ national champions . ” france may have spent billions of euros propping its heavy industry , it sector and the likes of the concorde .
but martin hellwig , the head of germany ’ s monopoly commission , believes the german government should not make the same mistakes .
he even argues that the government is not the right body to identify the national industrial champions of the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal production has long been a heavily subsidized industry in germany " typically government aims to subsidize or give privileges to certain companies tends to be directed towards industries of the past or to politically well connected industries , " he said , adding that factories in important constituencies that are critical for elections are an example .
" it has nothing to do with a good use of public resources for economic policy . “ companies , not economies , compete hellwig said the idea of trying to strengthen germany ’ s international competitiveness by using subsidies to turn companies into global players is wrong .
he said it is companies and not economies which compete internationally .
he points out that national champions could even harm the national market . " a policy that is directed to helping some firms , even if it is directed to helping some firms internationally , tends to burden others , " he said .
" because prices adjust , exchange rates adjust , wages adjust and the changes in economic structure that are induced are beyond the government ’ s ability to forsee .
they simply don ’ t have the information to do the right thing . “ as a general rule , competition policy is in the hands of the cartel office and the german regulatory authorities which apply the laws against restraints to competition .
they do so very ably , but at the same time the german government prevents more competition in several areas , hellwig said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unidentified managers of deutsche post show a airplane-model of the daughter company dhl " in certain areas , where it is a question of changing laws , a question of adapting systems , liberalizing industries , getting rid of post monopolies like telecommunications , the postal system , the energy sector , the government , indeed , has been a bit too prone to maintaining incumbents of the past , " he said , adding that this happened partly for fiscal reasons or furthering national champions . " after all , the government is still a major shareholder , " he said , citing the emergence of deutsche post as a global player in the logistics field . liberalization fails to bring more competition hellwig pointed out that another example is the energy market where liberalization didn ’ t bring about more competition in germany . " germany unlike the united kingdom has chosen not to vertically disintegrate the industry into companies managing networks , manging electricity grids and companies managing electricity production and distribution , " he said .
" so the network owners are parts of corporations that also produce and sell electricity and they use the transmission fees as a tool to keep competition out . “ when the liberalization process in the german energy market began three years ago , germany was the only eu-country without a regulatory authority in this field .
and regulating will only start next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this may be too late in the energy sector as german transmission prices of electricity are already excessive and among the highest in europe . in part this has been made possible and legalized by the government .
it was no surprise when vattenfall europe , one of only four companies dominating the german energy market , announced last week to increase transmission prices by another 20 percent next year . telecommunications law under criticism also coming in for criticism from the monopoly commission is germany ’ s telecommunications law .
hellwig said it ’ s structure and regulations introduce many changes with lots of legal uncertainty and will work in favour of the incumbent and to the disadvantage of the competitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " as long as prices are fixed under a price-cap regime where the regulatory authority sets just an upper bound for an overall index of prices , under the new law the incumbent is perfectly free to use any price to discourage entry , to impede competitors , even if it is a price below cost that would be regarded as predatory under ordinary competition law , “ he said . opposition politicians have welcomed the monopoly commission report and appealed to economics minister wolfgang clement and chancellor gerhard schröder to consider the commission ’ s proposed changes to the draft competition laws . steffen marquart -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu approves sony-bmg merger the european commission has given its green light tuesday to a merger between japan 's sony and the music arm of germany 's bertelsmann , in the latest global entertainment industry tie-up .

it assigned a team of researchers to uncover the ways the east german secret service sought to manipulate the west german organization 's news coverage during the cold war and whether it sought to recruit its journalists as spies .
it 's long been known that some west german media workers did spy for the stasi , but a report released on monday shines a veritable floodlight on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rows and rows of files in the state-run agency for housing stasi archives .
the study , commissioned by ard and produced in tandem with the state-run agency responsible for the stasi archives and historians at berlin 's free university , comprises over 1,000 pages of proof that the stasi skipped no opportunity to control the mass media in its own country and also manipulate and infiltrate radio and tv stations in west germany during the communist era .
a propaganda machine however , the report found that despite massive efforts to influence the programming of west german public broadcasters , it never succeeded in doing so .
additionally , it found , none of the informants working with the stasi served in senior positions or on boards responsible for high-level programming decisions .
nevertheless , the study did conclude that the communist party had been successful in promulgating disinformation on domestic policy issues that did often find its way into news reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler of the stasi archive marianne birthler , director of the federal authority that serves as guardian of the stasi archive , praised the study as a good example of germans working through their past .
" the study is a unique project , " she said .
" there is no other institution that has tried to work through its own past like this . "
the authors of the survey were able to tap into new archived material that was only made available to germany by the united states in 2003 .
after years of negotiations , the us administration returned the stasi ’ s so-called " rosewood " files , which contain the names of over 50,000 potential undercover agents , among them an estimated 12,000 from the west .
revelations damage journalists the study adds more names to the list of those east german journalists whom the stasi used as informers , bringing the total to 42 .
many other eastern german journalists have already taken leave after revelations about their involvement with the stasi surfaced .
the report also cited 61 west german spies , a high number , but lower than some ard officials had expected .
mixed motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while east german journalists may have acted under enormous stasi pressure , west german journalists working for the stasi often had other motives , offering their services for money or out of anti-capitalist or communist convictions .
according to the study , the list of those west german journalists who collaborated with the stasi is astonishingly long .
it is also feeding considerable public interest .
many are interested in the subject , " because a spy network is involved and of course there are a lot of interesting and fascinating stories about the attempt of the stasi to undermine broadcasting enterprises , " the director of an ard-affiliated tv network in the west , fritz pleitgen , said .
" we found that the strategy in the activity of the stasi was so gigantic - and we did n't expect that . "
terrorist plots ?
in some instances , the data exchange went far beyond journalism .
jochen staadt of berlin ’ s free university and co-author of the study reported on cases where west german stasi spies delivered information on how to blow up broadcasting houses in the west and kill or deport journalists in the event of a political crisis .
" what they collected was material to use to intervene in a situation of crisis in west germany and west berlin , " he explained .
" they would have done this .
we know that they supported terrorist organizations in west germany and they had no problem using violence against institutions and people .

in a telephone conversation with the deputy head of dfb , franz beckenbauer , on saturday , the coach who brought greece to victory in the euro 2004 soccer championships in lisbon , said he was not available for the job .
rehhagel told beckenbauer that during his three years with the greek team , he had really built something , and that he wanted to stay true to his word and stick with the team through the 2006 world cup , when his contract expires .
by rejecting , rehhagel also turned down a huge chunk of cash .
in greece , the 65-year-old has earned € 600,000 for his work as top coach , but in germany he could have earned up to € 5 million between now and the world cup , according to media reports .
" through thick and thin " the greek football association -lrb- epo -rrb- responded with relief to rehhagel ’ s decision .
" otto rehhagel is keeping his word , " said epo president wasilios gagatsis in an interview with news broadcaster " flash " on saturday night .
rehhagel , he said , will stay in greek not because of his contract with the epo but " because we ’ ve been through thick and thin together . "
greeks : let ’ s drink a beer to it greek media widely greeted the news .
" rehhagel ’ s keeping his word and we never doubted that , " tv broadcaster antenna announced on saturday night .
and the radio station erasport interrupted its programming to salute him : " rehhagel ’ s staying .
now we can concentrate on our world cup qualifications .
let ’ s drink a beer to that . "
in recent days , members of epo ’ s board have criticized rehhagel for allowing rumors about his possible departure to stew for a week .
according to reports in greek state television , net , the football association was planning to issue the coach an ultimatum .
and then there were two bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar matthäus is still a candidate to coach the german national soccer team with both top candidates declining to take germany ’ s top soccer job , the remaining candidates are holland ’ s guus hiddink and recording-breaking former german national team player lothar matthäus -lrb- photo -rrb- .
for hiddink , the netherlands ’ surprise spring into the semi-final at the 2002 world cup in south korea speaks well for his international experience .
however , he is under contract through 2007 in eindhoven and insiders say the only reason he hasn ’ t turned down the offer yet is because it hasn ’ t been given to him .

in a telephone conversation with the deputy head of dfb , franz beckenbauer , on saturday , the coach who brought greece to victory in the euro 2004 soccer championships in lisbon , said he was not available for the job .
rehhagel told beckenbauer that during his three years with the greek team , he had really built something , and that he wanted to stay true to his word and stick with the team through the 2006 world cup , when his contract expires .
by rejecting , rehhagel also turned down a huge chunk of cash .
in greece , the 65-year-old has earned € 600,000 for his work as top coach , but in germany he could have earned up to € 5 million between now and the world cup , according to media reports .
" through thick and thin " the greek football association -lrb- epo -rrb- responded with relief to rehhagel ’ s decision .
" otto rehhagel is keeping his word , " said epo president wasilios gagatsis in an interview with news broadcaster " flash " on saturday night .
rehhagel , he said , will stay in greek not because of his contract with the epo but " because we ’ ve been through thick and thin together . "
greeks : let ’ s drink a beer to it greek media widely greeted the news .
" rehhagel ’ s keeping his word and we never doubted that , " tv broadcaster antenna announced on saturday night .
and the radio station erasport interrupted its programming to salute him : " rehhagel ’ s staying .
now we can concentrate on our world cup qualifications .
let ’ s drink a beer to that . "
in recent days , members of epo ’ s board have criticized rehhagel for allowing rumors about his possible departure to stew for a week .
according to reports in greek state television , net , the football association was planning to issue the coach an ultimatum .
and then there were two bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar matthäus is still a candidate to coach the german national soccer team with both top candidates declining to take germany ’ s top soccer job , the remaining candidates are holland ’ s guus hiddink and recording-breaking former german national team player lothar matthäus -lrb- photo -rrb- .
for hiddink , the netherlands ’ surprise spring into the semi-final at the 2002 world cup in south korea speaks well for his international experience .

in a telephone conversation with the deputy head of dfb , franz beckenbauer , on saturday , the coach who brought greece to victory in the euro 2004 soccer championships in lisbon , said he was not available for the job .
rehhagel told beckenbauer that during his three years with the greek team , he had really built something , and that he wanted to stay true to his word and stick with the team through the 2006 world cup , when his contract expires .
by rejecting , rehhagel also turned down a huge chunk of cash .

the new company , to be called sonybmg , will be the world 's second largest music label , behind universal music . if the merger actually goes ahead , the market will be carved up between four instead of five majors : vivendi 's universal , the newly-created sonybmg , warner and emi .
together they would share around 80 percent of european recorded music sales . sources say the german-japanese tie-up should also win approval from the us federal trade commission within days . the european and us competition authorities have run parallel investigations into the merger , which will create the world 's largest music company in terms of market share according to 2003 figures . the 50:50 merger will bring together sony stars such as barbara streisand and beyonce and bmg stars , including elvis presley and christina aguilera . massive job cuts expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated music cds the japanese and german parent groups argue that their businesses need to join forces to tackle the crisis in the global music industry faced with both pirate cds and an explosion of illegal music downloading . but the latest case of media consolidation comes at a cost .
according to reports , sony and bmg plan to axe a quarter of their joint workforce , or some 3,000 jobs , once the tie-up has been approved . at sonybmg the overhaul will produce one-off costs of $ 300 million to 350 million dollars -lrb- € 244 million to € 284 million -rrb- , mainly covering severance terms for a large portion of the group 's employees , the financial times reported last week . executives at bertelsmann , hoped to achieve 85 percent of the cutbacks by next june , it added .
but detailed plans for cost-cutting measures will begin only after competition authorities cleared the merger . brussels does an about-face the brussels green light comes four years after the european commission effectively blocked another music tie-up , between emi and time warner . initially the commission appeared to be preparing a red light for the sony / bmg tie-up as well .

inside sources say monti apparently secured guarantees that the merger would not lead to reduced competition and thus higher prices for consumers . critics of the deal and independent recording companies remain concerned .
impala , an umbrella group representing more than 2,000 independent labels said the merger would further reduce smaller companies ' ability to give up-and-coming artists exposure .
it has threatened to take legal action to have the brussels decision overturned . bmg is in a strong position as it prepares for the tie-up .
it posted record operating profits of € 30 million -lrb- $ 37.4 million -rrb- in the first half of this year , der spiegel newsmagazine reported in its latest edition .
the result , the best six month figures in its history , puts bmg in a strong position for negotiating the deal with sony music , with the two sides expected to meet this week on a reorganization after the brussels decision .
andreas gravermeyer , spokesman for bertelsmann ag , said the the entire industry will benefit from the merger , because it will " create a recording music business better able to serve artists and consumers in the rapidly changing market . "
as to bertelsmann 's own benefits from the tie-up , gravermeyer said after the deal goes through , the company will enjoy " a leading market position in all its core businesses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.07.2004 german media cleans stasi out of its closet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi spies were everywhere - even at public tv stations the long tentacles of east germany 's former state secret police , the stasi , not only reached the communist media , but infiltrated west german public broadcasters as well , a new study has found . three years ago , german public broadcaster ard launched a project that would be uncomfortable for many media organizations .
it assigned a team of researchers to uncover the ways the east german secret service sought to manipulate the west german organization 's news coverage during the cold war and whether it sought to recruit its journalists as spies .
it 's long been known that some west german media workers did spy for the stasi , but a report released on monday shines a veritable floodlight on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rows and rows of files in the state-run agency for housing stasi archives .
the study , commissioned by ard and produced in tandem with the state-run agency responsible for the stasi archives and historians at berlin 's free university , comprises over 1,000 pages of proof that the stasi skipped no opportunity to control the mass media in its own country and also manipulate and infiltrate radio and tv stations in west germany during the communist era .
a propaganda machine however , the report found that despite massive efforts to influence the programming of west german public broadcasters , it never succeeded in doing so .
additionally , it found , none of the informants working with the stasi served in senior positions or on boards responsible for high-level programming decisions .
nevertheless , the study did conclude that the communist party had been successful in promulgating disinformation on domestic policy issues that did often find its way into news reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler of the stasi archive marianne birthler , director of the federal authority that serves as guardian of the stasi archive , praised the study as a good example of germans working through their past .
" the study is a unique project , " she said .
" there is no other institution that has tried to work through its own past like this . "
the authors of the survey were able to tap into new archived material that was only made available to germany by the united states in 2003 .
after years of negotiations , the us administration returned the stasi ’ s so-called " rosewood " files , which contain the names of over 50,000 potential undercover agents , among them an estimated 12,000 from the west .
revelations damage journalists the study adds more names to the list of those east german journalists whom the stasi used as informers , bringing the total to 42 .
many other eastern german journalists have already taken leave after revelations about their involvement with the stasi surfaced .
the report also cited 61 west german spies , a high number , but lower than some ard officials had expected .
mixed motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while east german journalists may have acted under enormous stasi pressure , west german journalists working for the stasi often had other motives , offering their services for money or out of anti-capitalist or communist convictions .
according to the study , the list of those west german journalists who collaborated with the stasi is astonishingly long .
it is also feeding considerable public interest .
many are interested in the subject , " because a spy network is involved and of course there are a lot of interesting and fascinating stories about the attempt of the stasi to undermine broadcasting enterprises , " the director of an ard-affiliated tv network in the west , fritz pleitgen , said .
" we found that the strategy in the activity of the stasi was so gigantic - and we did n't expect that . "

it assigned a team of researchers to uncover the ways the east german secret service sought to manipulate the west german organization 's news coverage during the cold war and whether it sought to recruit its journalists as spies .
it 's long been known that some west german media workers did spy for the stasi , but a report released on monday shines a veritable floodlight on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rows and rows of files in the state-run agency for housing stasi archives .
the study , commissioned by ard and produced in tandem with the state-run agency responsible for the stasi archives and historians at berlin 's free university , comprises over 1,000 pages of proof that the stasi skipped no opportunity to control the mass media in its own country and also manipulate and infiltrate radio and tv stations in west germany during the communist era .
a propaganda machine however , the report found that despite massive efforts to influence the programming of west german public broadcasters , it never succeeded in doing so .
additionally , it found , none of the informants working with the stasi served in senior positions or on boards responsible for high-level programming decisions .
nevertheless , the study did conclude that the communist party had been successful in promulgating disinformation on domestic policy issues that did often find its way into news reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler of the stasi archive marianne birthler , director of the federal authority that serves as guardian of the stasi archive , praised the study as a good example of germans working through their past .
" the study is a unique project , " she said .
" there is no other institution that has tried to work through its own past like this . "
the authors of the survey were able to tap into new archived material that was only made available to germany by the united states in 2003 .
after years of negotiations , the us administration returned the stasi ’ s so-called " rosewood " files , which contain the names of over 50,000 potential undercover agents , among them an estimated 12,000 from the west .
revelations damage journalists the study adds more names to the list of those east german journalists whom the stasi used as informers , bringing the total to 42 .
many other eastern german journalists have already taken leave after revelations about their involvement with the stasi surfaced .
the report also cited 61 west german spies , a high number , but lower than some ard officials had expected .
mixed motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while east german journalists may have acted under enormous stasi pressure , west german journalists working for the stasi often had other motives , offering their services for money or out of anti-capitalist or communist convictions .
according to the study , the list of those west german journalists who collaborated with the stasi is astonishingly long .
it is also feeding considerable public interest .
many are interested in the subject , " because a spy network is involved and of course there are a lot of interesting and fascinating stories about the attempt of the stasi to undermine broadcasting enterprises , " the director of an ard-affiliated tv network in the west , fritz pleitgen , said .
" we found that the strategy in the activity of the stasi was so gigantic - and we did n't expect that . "

the new company , to be called sonybmg , will be the world 's second largest music label , behind universal music . if the merger actually goes ahead , the market will be carved up between four instead of five majors : vivendi 's universal , the newly-created sonybmg , warner and emi .
together they would share around 80 percent of european recorded music sales . sources say the german-japanese tie-up should also win approval from the us federal trade commission within days . the european and us competition authorities have run parallel investigations into the merger , which will create the world 's largest music company in terms of market share according to 2003 figures . the 50:50 merger will bring together sony stars such as barbara streisand and beyonce and bmg stars , including elvis presley and christina aguilera . massive job cuts expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated music cds the japanese and german parent groups argue that their businesses need to join forces to tackle the crisis in the global music industry faced with both pirate cds and an explosion of illegal music downloading . but the latest case of media consolidation comes at a cost .
according to reports , sony and bmg plan to axe a quarter of their joint workforce , or some 3,000 jobs , once the tie-up has been approved . at sonybmg the overhaul will produce one-off costs of $ 300 million to 350 million dollars -lrb- € 244 million to € 284 million -rrb- , mainly covering severance terms for a large portion of the group 's employees , the financial times reported last week . executives at bertelsmann , hoped to achieve 85 percent of the cutbacks by next june , it added .
but detailed plans for cost-cutting measures will begin only after competition authorities cleared the merger . brussels does an about-face the brussels green light comes four years after the european commission effectively blocked another music tie-up , between emi and time warner . initially the commission appeared to be preparing a red light for the sony / bmg tie-up as well .
in may eu competition commissioner mario monti -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a preliminary assessment that it would be " incompatible " with eu rules . many also expressed concern that such a deal would lead to fewer consumer choices on the market and endanger the nascent legal online music downloading trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for competition mario monti but the man who made a name for himself after taking on microsoft softened his tone after closed-door talks with the two sides and several independent labels in brussels .
inside sources say monti apparently secured guarantees that the merger would not lead to reduced competition and thus higher prices for consumers . critics of the deal and independent recording companies remain concerned .
impala , an umbrella group representing more than 2,000 independent labels said the merger would further reduce smaller companies ' ability to give up-and-coming artists exposure .
it has threatened to take legal action to have the brussels decision overturned . bmg is in a strong position as it prepares for the tie-up .
it posted record operating profits of € 30 million -lrb- $ 37.4 million -rrb- in the first half of this year , der spiegel newsmagazine reported in its latest edition .
the result , the best six month figures in its history , puts bmg in a strong position for negotiating the deal with sony music , with the two sides expected to meet this week on a reorganization after the brussels decision .
andreas gravermeyer , spokesman for bertelsmann ag , said the the entire industry will benefit from the merger , because it will " create a recording music business better able to serve artists and consumers in the rapidly changing market . "
as to bertelsmann 's own benefits from the tie-up , gravermeyer said after the deal goes through , the company will enjoy " a leading market position in all its core businesses .

while some debate whether he acted out of personal interest or altruism , most germans are taking a positive view . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , an aristocratic colonel in the nazi army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military , including friedrich olbricht and henning von tresckow , plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power . shortly after noon on a hot summer day , stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's " wolf 's lair " hideaway -lrb- in what is today poland -rrb- , where the dictator was seated around a large wooden table with 22 other nazi officials . stauffenberg placed the briefcase under the table , made an excuse to leave , and watched the explosion from afar as he raced towards his getaway car .
confident he had completed his mission and an impending coup would soon place him and like-minded co-conspirators in power , stauffenberg made haste to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shortly after the botched assassination attempt against adolf hitler , july 20 , 1944 .
behind hitler to the left is martin bormann , to the far left is otto skorzeny .
on the right with the bandaged head is alfred jodl .
but , in what is largely viewed as one of the greatest tragedies in history , things did not work out that way .
miraculously , hitler survived the blast that killed four others , and the opposition 's poor planning , lack of support and hesitation at crucial moments played into the führer 's hands . by midnight - just twelve hours later - hitler had regained the upper hand and squashed the rebellion .
stauffenberg and three others were executed by firing squad in berlin .
in the coming weeks , an additional 140 people implicated in the plot were killed and more than 5,000 conspirators and political opponents were rounded-up . hero or traitor ? had stauffenberg been successful , the final phase of the war would certainly have gone differently .
the fact remains that more people died between the july assassination attempt and the end of the war than in the four-and-a-half years prior to that .
few doubt that hitler 's demise would not have seriously affected the german army 's ability to go on fighting , if not ended hostilities sooner and saved thousands of lives .
yet , stauffenberg 's place in history as a hero of the german resistance has not been so easily established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claus graf schenk von stauffenberg in 1940 with his children berthold , franz-ludwig und haimeran . in the initial decade after the end of the war , the german public largely viewed him as a traitor .
his wife was denied a pension , and no memorials were erected to mark the bravery of those within hitler 's own military establishment who risked their lives to set the country on a different course . in the 1960 's , as a younger generation of germans confronted their parents over their country 's nazi past , stauffenberg was not necessarily rehabilitated into an honorable symbol of the german resistance .
some were suspicious of his motives , accusing him of acting more out of self-interest , and less out of benevolent concern for the plight of the jews and other victims of nazi war crimes . a surge of new interest but as the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt approached , a number of new films , documentaries and books enlivened the debate and once again drew attention to stauffenberg and his band of subversives .
german public broadcaster swr produced a film by director jo baier entitled " stauffenberg , " which topped prime time ratings with a 23 percent audience share .
another german broadcaster produced a four-part documentary entitled " they wanted to kill hitler , " which proved equally popular .
numerous new autobiographies and books chronicling the event hit the shelves in bookstores . along with this surge of interest , the german public 's view , it seems , has also shifted .
according to a recent poll in the german news weekly spiegel more than 75 percent of germans surveyed said they esteem or admire stauffenberg and his co-conspirators . in what is perhaps a final nod of approval , german chancellor gerhard schröder presides over a ceremony on tuesday to mark the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt . perspectives change over time the german public 's growing esteem for stauffenberg and company begs the question : what 's changed ?
according to johannes tuchel , director of the german resistance memorial center in berlin , most germans were - implicitly , at least - hitler supporters , and those in the resistance were in the minority . " after the war , germany did not change its population , " he said in an interview with dw-world .
" now we have a new generation , and they are interested in what happened on july 20 , 1944 . " that interest has manifested itself in the spate of recent movies and books .
many are drawn to the material in the hopes of learning how a group of military officers changed their view of hitler radically enough to plot a coup . for that question , however , there is no easy answer .
" they had a broad spectrum of motivations , " says tuchel of those involved in the plot .
" some were social democrats , some former labor union activists , some had authoritarian goals . " two things , according to tuchel , united them : they wanted to re-establish the rule of law and end the war .
in the case of stauffenberg , tuchel says historical evidence proves that a growing disgust for nazi war crimes was his primary motivating factor . the german resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel jonah goldhagen , u.s. author of the book " hitler 's willing executioners . "
academics have long debated whether the guilt for nazi crimes should be borne individually , by those who committed the crimes , or collectively , by the german people .
in the 1997 book " hitler 's willing executioners , " us historian daniel goldhagen -lrb- photo -rrb- argued in favor of the theory of collective guilt .
not surprisingly , his theory proved highly controversial in germany .
it 's no wonder that the german public is fascinated by more inspiring tales of resistance . the german resistance memorial center in berlin features exhibitions on stauffenberg , as well as others like the " white rose " student movement which sprung up in munich .
but tuchel is careful not to exaggerate the size of the resistance , pointing out that hitler 's opponents - those willing to take action - were always in the minority .
" this was such a small operation , that the same man -lrb- stauffenberg -rrb- who planted the bomb , had to run back to berlin on the same day to help organize the coup , " he said . on tuesday afternoon , schröder will urge germans to remember stauffenberg and his network of co-conspirators .
how they choose to recall the event will remain a matter of ongoing debate . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historical reference work delves into scholars ' past the " international encyclopaedia of german studies scholars " has triggered a national debate on the nazi past of several high-profile scholars , and it has n't even been published yet .

in a telephone conversation with the deputy head of dfb , franz beckenbauer , on saturday , the coach who brought greece to victory in the euro 2004 soccer championships in lisbon , said he was not available for the job .
rehhagel told beckenbauer that during his three years with the greek team , he had really built something , and that he wanted to stay true to his word and stick with the team through the 2006 world cup , when his contract expires .
by rejecting , rehhagel also turned down a huge chunk of cash .
in greece , the 65-year-old has earned € 600,000 for his work as top coach , but in germany he could have earned up to € 5 million between now and the world cup , according to media reports .
" through thick and thin " the greek football association -lrb- epo -rrb- responded with relief to rehhagel ’ s decision .
" otto rehhagel is keeping his word , " said epo president wasilios gagatsis in an interview with news broadcaster " flash " on saturday night .
rehhagel , he said , will stay in greek not because of his contract with the epo but " because we ’ ve been through thick and thin together . "
greeks : let ’ s drink a beer to it greek media widely greeted the news .
" rehhagel ’ s keeping his word and we never doubted that , " tv broadcaster antenna announced on saturday night .
and the radio station erasport interrupted its programming to salute him : " rehhagel ’ s staying .
now we can concentrate on our world cup qualifications .
let ’ s drink a beer to that . "
in recent days , members of epo ’ s board have criticized rehhagel for allowing rumors about his possible departure to stew for a week .
according to reports in greek state television , net , the football association was planning to issue the coach an ultimatum .
and then there were two bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar matthäus is still a candidate to coach the german national soccer team with both top candidates declining to take germany ’ s top soccer job , the remaining candidates are holland ’ s guus hiddink and recording-breaking former german national team player lothar matthäus -lrb- photo -rrb- .
for hiddink , the netherlands ’ surprise spring into the semi-final at the 2002 world cup in south korea speaks well for his international experience .
however , he is under contract through 2007 in eindhoven and insiders say the only reason he hasn ’ t turned down the offer yet is because it hasn ’ t been given to him .

rehhagel told beckenbauer that during his three years with the greek team , he had really built something , and that he wanted to stay true to his word and stick with the team through the 2006 world cup , when his contract expires .
by rejecting , rehhagel also turned down a huge chunk of cash .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.07.2004 germany remembers plot to kill hitler großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler honors stauffenberg and the others tuesday marks the 60th anniversary of claus schenk graf von stauffenberg 's attempt to assassinate hitler .
while some debate whether he acted out of personal interest or altruism , most germans are taking a positive view . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , an aristocratic colonel in the nazi army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military , including friedrich olbricht and henning von tresckow , plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power . shortly after noon on a hot summer day , stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's " wolf 's lair " hideaway -lrb- in what is today poland -rrb- , where the dictator was seated around a large wooden table with 22 other nazi officials . stauffenberg placed the briefcase under the table , made an excuse to leave , and watched the explosion from afar as he raced towards his getaway car .
confident he had completed his mission and an impending coup would soon place him and like-minded co-conspirators in power , stauffenberg made haste to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shortly after the botched assassination attempt against adolf hitler , july 20 , 1944 .
behind hitler to the left is martin bormann , to the far left is otto skorzeny .
on the right with the bandaged head is alfred jodl .
but , in what is largely viewed as one of the greatest tragedies in history , things did not work out that way .
miraculously , hitler survived the blast that killed four others , and the opposition 's poor planning , lack of support and hesitation at crucial moments played into the führer 's hands . by midnight - just twelve hours later - hitler had regained the upper hand and squashed the rebellion .
stauffenberg and three others were executed by firing squad in berlin .
in the coming weeks , an additional 140 people implicated in the plot were killed and more than 5,000 conspirators and political opponents were rounded-up . hero or traitor ? had stauffenberg been successful , the final phase of the war would certainly have gone differently .
the fact remains that more people died between the july assassination attempt and the end of the war than in the four-and-a-half years prior to that .
few doubt that hitler 's demise would not have seriously affected the german army 's ability to go on fighting , if not ended hostilities sooner and saved thousands of lives .
yet , stauffenberg 's place in history as a hero of the german resistance has not been so easily established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claus graf schenk von stauffenberg in 1940 with his children berthold , franz-ludwig und haimeran . in the initial decade after the end of the war , the german public largely viewed him as a traitor .
his wife was denied a pension , and no memorials were erected to mark the bravery of those within hitler 's own military establishment who risked their lives to set the country on a different course . in the 1960 's , as a younger generation of germans confronted their parents over their country 's nazi past , stauffenberg was not necessarily rehabilitated into an honorable symbol of the german resistance .
some were suspicious of his motives , accusing him of acting more out of self-interest , and less out of benevolent concern for the plight of the jews and other victims of nazi war crimes . a surge of new interest but as the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt approached , a number of new films , documentaries and books enlivened the debate and once again drew attention to stauffenberg and his band of subversives .
german public broadcaster swr produced a film by director jo baier entitled " stauffenberg , " which topped prime time ratings with a 23 percent audience share .

the new company , to be called sonybmg , will be the world 's second largest music label , behind universal music . if the merger actually goes ahead , the market will be carved up between four instead of five majors : vivendi 's universal , the newly-created sonybmg , warner and emi .
together they would share around 80 percent of european recorded music sales . sources say the german-japanese tie-up should also win approval from the us federal trade commission within days . the european and us competition authorities have run parallel investigations into the merger , which will create the world 's largest music company in terms of market share according to 2003 figures . the 50:50 merger will bring together sony stars such as barbara streisand and beyonce and bmg stars , including elvis presley and christina aguilera . massive job cuts expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated music cds the japanese and german parent groups argue that their businesses need to join forces to tackle the crisis in the global music industry faced with both pirate cds and an explosion of illegal music downloading . but the latest case of media consolidation comes at a cost .
according to reports , sony and bmg plan to axe a quarter of their joint workforce , or some 3,000 jobs , once the tie-up has been approved . at sonybmg the overhaul will produce one-off costs of $ 300 million to 350 million dollars -lrb- € 244 million to € 284 million -rrb- , mainly covering severance terms for a large portion of the group 's employees , the financial times reported last week . executives at bertelsmann , hoped to achieve 85 percent of the cutbacks by next june , it added .
but detailed plans for cost-cutting measures will begin only after competition authorities cleared the merger . brussels does an about-face the brussels green light comes four years after the european commission effectively blocked another music tie-up , between emi and time warner . initially the commission appeared to be preparing a red light for the sony / bmg tie-up as well .
in may eu competition commissioner mario monti -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a preliminary assessment that it would be " incompatible " with eu rules . many also expressed concern that such a deal would lead to fewer consumer choices on the market and endanger the nascent legal online music downloading trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for competition mario monti but the man who made a name for himself after taking on microsoft softened his tone after closed-door talks with the two sides and several independent labels in brussels .
inside sources say monti apparently secured guarantees that the merger would not lead to reduced competition and thus higher prices for consumers . critics of the deal and independent recording companies remain concerned .
impala , an umbrella group representing more than 2,000 independent labels said the merger would further reduce smaller companies ' ability to give up-and-coming artists exposure .
it has threatened to take legal action to have the brussels decision overturned . bmg is in a strong position as it prepares for the tie-up .
it posted record operating profits of € 30 million -lrb- $ 37.4 million -rrb- in the first half of this year , der spiegel newsmagazine reported in its latest edition .
the result , the best six month figures in its history , puts bmg in a strong position for negotiating the deal with sony music , with the two sides expected to meet this week on a reorganization after the brussels decision .
andreas gravermeyer , spokesman for bertelsmann ag , said the the entire industry will benefit from the merger , because it will " create a recording music business better able to serve artists and consumers in the rapidly changing market . "
as to bertelsmann 's own benefits from the tie-up , gravermeyer said after the deal goes through , the company will enjoy " a leading market position in all its core businesses .

while some debate whether he acted out of personal interest or altruism , most germans are taking a positive view . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , an aristocratic colonel in the nazi army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military , including friedrich olbricht and henning von tresckow , plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power . shortly after noon on a hot summer day , stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's " wolf 's lair " hideaway -lrb- in what is today poland -rrb- , where the dictator was seated around a large wooden table with 22 other nazi officials . stauffenberg placed the briefcase under the table , made an excuse to leave , and watched the explosion from afar as he raced towards his getaway car .
confident he had completed his mission and an impending coup would soon place him and like-minded co-conspirators in power , stauffenberg made haste to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shortly after the botched assassination attempt against adolf hitler , july 20 , 1944 .
behind hitler to the left is martin bormann , to the far left is otto skorzeny .
on the right with the bandaged head is alfred jodl .
but , in what is largely viewed as one of the greatest tragedies in history , things did not work out that way .
miraculously , hitler survived the blast that killed four others , and the opposition 's poor planning , lack of support and hesitation at crucial moments played into the führer 's hands . by midnight - just twelve hours later - hitler had regained the upper hand and squashed the rebellion .
stauffenberg and three others were executed by firing squad in berlin .
in the coming weeks , an additional 140 people implicated in the plot were killed and more than 5,000 conspirators and political opponents were rounded-up . hero or traitor ? had stauffenberg been successful , the final phase of the war would certainly have gone differently .
the fact remains that more people died between the july assassination attempt and the end of the war than in the four-and-a-half years prior to that .
few doubt that hitler 's demise would not have seriously affected the german army 's ability to go on fighting , if not ended hostilities sooner and saved thousands of lives .
yet , stauffenberg 's place in history as a hero of the german resistance has not been so easily established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claus graf schenk von stauffenberg in 1940 with his children berthold , franz-ludwig und haimeran . in the initial decade after the end of the war , the german public largely viewed him as a traitor .
his wife was denied a pension , and no memorials were erected to mark the bravery of those within hitler 's own military establishment who risked their lives to set the country on a different course . in the 1960 's , as a younger generation of germans confronted their parents over their country 's nazi past , stauffenberg was not necessarily rehabilitated into an honorable symbol of the german resistance .
some were suspicious of his motives , accusing him of acting more out of self-interest , and less out of benevolent concern for the plight of the jews and other victims of nazi war crimes . a surge of new interest but as the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt approached , a number of new films , documentaries and books enlivened the debate and once again drew attention to stauffenberg and his band of subversives .
german public broadcaster swr produced a film by director jo baier entitled " stauffenberg , " which topped prime time ratings with a 23 percent audience share .
another german broadcaster produced a four-part documentary entitled " they wanted to kill hitler , " which proved equally popular .
numerous new autobiographies and books chronicling the event hit the shelves in bookstores . along with this surge of interest , the german public 's view , it seems , has also shifted .
according to a recent poll in the german news weekly spiegel more than 75 percent of germans surveyed said they esteem or admire stauffenberg and his co-conspirators . in what is perhaps a final nod of approval , german chancellor gerhard schröder presides over a ceremony on tuesday to mark the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt . perspectives change over time the german public 's growing esteem for stauffenberg and company begs the question : what 's changed ?

while some debate whether he acted out of personal interest or altruism , most germans are taking a positive view . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , an aristocratic colonel in the nazi army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military , including friedrich olbricht and henning von tresckow , plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power . shortly after noon on a hot summer day , stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's " wolf 's lair " hideaway -lrb- in what is today poland -rrb- , where the dictator was seated around a large wooden table with 22 other nazi officials . stauffenberg placed the briefcase under the table , made an excuse to leave , and watched the explosion from afar as he raced towards his getaway car .
confident he had completed his mission and an impending coup would soon place him and like-minded co-conspirators in power , stauffenberg made haste to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shortly after the botched assassination attempt against adolf hitler , july 20 , 1944 .
behind hitler to the left is martin bormann , to the far left is otto skorzeny .
on the right with the bandaged head is alfred jodl .
but , in what is largely viewed as one of the greatest tragedies in history , things did not work out that way .
miraculously , hitler survived the blast that killed four others , and the opposition 's poor planning , lack of support and hesitation at crucial moments played into the führer 's hands . by midnight - just twelve hours later - hitler had regained the upper hand and squashed the rebellion .
stauffenberg and three others were executed by firing squad in berlin .
in the coming weeks , an additional 140 people implicated in the plot were killed and more than 5,000 conspirators and political opponents were rounded-up . hero or traitor ? had stauffenberg been successful , the final phase of the war would certainly have gone differently .
the fact remains that more people died between the july assassination attempt and the end of the war than in the four-and-a-half years prior to that .
few doubt that hitler 's demise would not have seriously affected the german army 's ability to go on fighting , if not ended hostilities sooner and saved thousands of lives .
yet , stauffenberg 's place in history as a hero of the german resistance has not been so easily established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claus graf schenk von stauffenberg in 1940 with his children berthold , franz-ludwig und haimeran . in the initial decade after the end of the war , the german public largely viewed him as a traitor .
his wife was denied a pension , and no memorials were erected to mark the bravery of those within hitler 's own military establishment who risked their lives to set the country on a different course . in the 1960 's , as a younger generation of germans confronted their parents over their country 's nazi past , stauffenberg was not necessarily rehabilitated into an honorable symbol of the german resistance .
some were suspicious of his motives , accusing him of acting more out of self-interest , and less out of benevolent concern for the plight of the jews and other victims of nazi war crimes . a surge of new interest but as the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt approached , a number of new films , documentaries and books enlivened the debate and once again drew attention to stauffenberg and his band of subversives .
german public broadcaster swr produced a film by director jo baier entitled " stauffenberg , " which topped prime time ratings with a 23 percent audience share .
another german broadcaster produced a four-part documentary entitled " they wanted to kill hitler , " which proved equally popular .
numerous new autobiographies and books chronicling the event hit the shelves in bookstores . along with this surge of interest , the german public 's view , it seems , has also shifted .
according to a recent poll in the german news weekly spiegel more than 75 percent of germans surveyed said they esteem or admire stauffenberg and his co-conspirators . in what is perhaps a final nod of approval , german chancellor gerhard schröder presides over a ceremony on tuesday to mark the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt . perspectives change over time the german public 's growing esteem for stauffenberg and company begs the question : what 's changed ?
according to johannes tuchel , director of the german resistance memorial center in berlin , most germans were - implicitly , at least - hitler supporters , and those in the resistance were in the minority . " after the war , germany did not change its population , " he said in an interview with dw-world .
" now we have a new generation , and they are interested in what happened on july 20 , 1944 . " that interest has manifested itself in the spate of recent movies and books .
many are drawn to the material in the hopes of learning how a group of military officers changed their view of hitler radically enough to plot a coup . for that question , however , there is no easy answer .
" they had a broad spectrum of motivations , " says tuchel of those involved in the plot .
" some were social democrats , some former labor union activists , some had authoritarian goals . " two things , according to tuchel , united them : they wanted to re-establish the rule of law and end the war .
in the case of stauffenberg , tuchel says historical evidence proves that a growing disgust for nazi war crimes was his primary motivating factor . the german resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel jonah goldhagen , u.s. author of the book " hitler 's willing executioners . "
academics have long debated whether the guilt for nazi crimes should be borne individually , by those who committed the crimes , or collectively , by the german people .
in the 1997 book " hitler 's willing executioners , " us historian daniel goldhagen -lrb- photo -rrb- argued in favor of the theory of collective guilt .
not surprisingly , his theory proved highly controversial in germany .
it 's no wonder that the german public is fascinated by more inspiring tales of resistance . the german resistance memorial center in berlin features exhibitions on stauffenberg , as well as others like the " white rose " student movement which sprung up in munich .
but tuchel is careful not to exaggerate the size of the resistance , pointing out that hitler 's opponents - those willing to take action - were always in the minority .
" this was such a small operation , that the same man -lrb- stauffenberg -rrb- who planted the bomb , had to run back to berlin on the same day to help organize the coup , " he said . on tuesday afternoon , schröder will urge germans to remember stauffenberg and his network of co-conspirators .

it assigned a team of researchers to uncover the ways the east german secret service sought to manipulate the west german organization 's news coverage during the cold war and whether it sought to recruit its journalists as spies .
it 's long been known that some west german media workers did spy for the stasi , but a report released on monday shines a veritable floodlight on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rows and rows of files in the state-run agency for housing stasi archives .
the study , commissioned by ard and produced in tandem with the state-run agency responsible for the stasi archives and historians at berlin 's free university , comprises over 1,000 pages of proof that the stasi skipped no opportunity to control the mass media in its own country and also manipulate and infiltrate radio and tv stations in west germany during the communist era .
a propaganda machine however , the report found that despite massive efforts to influence the programming of west german public broadcasters , it never succeeded in doing so .
additionally , it found , none of the informants working with the stasi served in senior positions or on boards responsible for high-level programming decisions .
nevertheless , the study did conclude that the communist party had been successful in promulgating disinformation on domestic policy issues that did often find its way into news reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler of the stasi archive marianne birthler , director of the federal authority that serves as guardian of the stasi archive , praised the study as a good example of germans working through their past .
" the study is a unique project , " she said .
" there is no other institution that has tried to work through its own past like this . "
the authors of the survey were able to tap into new archived material that was only made available to germany by the united states in 2003 .
after years of negotiations , the us administration returned the stasi ’ s so-called " rosewood " files , which contain the names of over 50,000 potential undercover agents , among them an estimated 12,000 from the west .
revelations damage journalists the study adds more names to the list of those east german journalists whom the stasi used as informers , bringing the total to 42 .
many other eastern german journalists have already taken leave after revelations about their involvement with the stasi surfaced .
the report also cited 61 west german spies , a high number , but lower than some ard officials had expected .
mixed motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while east german journalists may have acted under enormous stasi pressure , west german journalists working for the stasi often had other motives , offering their services for money or out of anti-capitalist or communist convictions .
according to the study , the list of those west german journalists who collaborated with the stasi is astonishingly long .
it is also feeding considerable public interest .
many are interested in the subject , " because a spy network is involved and of course there are a lot of interesting and fascinating stories about the attempt of the stasi to undermine broadcasting enterprises , " the director of an ard-affiliated tv network in the west , fritz pleitgen , said .
" we found that the strategy in the activity of the stasi was so gigantic - and we did n't expect that . "
terrorist plots ?
in some instances , the data exchange went far beyond journalism .
jochen staadt of berlin ’ s free university and co-author of the study reported on cases where west german stasi spies delivered information on how to blow up broadcasting houses in the west and kill or deport journalists in the event of a political crisis .
" what they collected was material to use to intervene in a situation of crisis in west germany and west berlin , " he explained .

it assigned a team of researchers to uncover the ways the east german secret service sought to manipulate the west german organization 's news coverage during the cold war and whether it sought to recruit its journalists as spies .
it 's long been known that some west german media workers did spy for the stasi , but a report released on monday shines a veritable floodlight on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rows and rows of files in the state-run agency for housing stasi archives .
the study , commissioned by ard and produced in tandem with the state-run agency responsible for the stasi archives and historians at berlin 's free university , comprises over 1,000 pages of proof that the stasi skipped no opportunity to control the mass media in its own country and also manipulate and infiltrate radio and tv stations in west germany during the communist era .
a propaganda machine however , the report found that despite massive efforts to influence the programming of west german public broadcasters , it never succeeded in doing so .
additionally , it found , none of the informants working with the stasi served in senior positions or on boards responsible for high-level programming decisions .
nevertheless , the study did conclude that the communist party had been successful in promulgating disinformation on domestic policy issues that did often find its way into news reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler of the stasi archive marianne birthler , director of the federal authority that serves as guardian of the stasi archive , praised the study as a good example of germans working through their past .
" the study is a unique project , " she said .
" there is no other institution that has tried to work through its own past like this . "
the authors of the survey were able to tap into new archived material that was only made available to germany by the united states in 2003 .
after years of negotiations , the us administration returned the stasi ’ s so-called " rosewood " files , which contain the names of over 50,000 potential undercover agents , among them an estimated 12,000 from the west .
revelations damage journalists the study adds more names to the list of those east german journalists whom the stasi used as informers , bringing the total to 42 .
many other eastern german journalists have already taken leave after revelations about their involvement with the stasi surfaced .
the report also cited 61 west german spies , a high number , but lower than some ard officials had expected .
mixed motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while east german journalists may have acted under enormous stasi pressure , west german journalists working for the stasi often had other motives , offering their services for money or out of anti-capitalist or communist convictions .
according to the study , the list of those west german journalists who collaborated with the stasi is astonishingly long .
it is also feeding considerable public interest .
many are interested in the subject , " because a spy network is involved and of course there are a lot of interesting and fascinating stories about the attempt of the stasi to undermine broadcasting enterprises , " the director of an ard-affiliated tv network in the west , fritz pleitgen , said .
" we found that the strategy in the activity of the stasi was so gigantic - and we did n't expect that . "
terrorist plots ?
in some instances , the data exchange went far beyond journalism .
jochen staadt of berlin ’ s free university and co-author of the study reported on cases where west german stasi spies delivered information on how to blow up broadcasting houses in the west and kill or deport journalists in the event of a political crisis .
" what they collected was material to use to intervene in a situation of crisis in west germany and west berlin , " he explained .

the chancellor should let it be , some experts say a recent bout of mergers involving european companies has some calling for government intervention to help german companies on the international market .
but monopoly watchdogs reject that idea . earlier this year when the french company sanofi took over the german-french pharmaceutical giant aventis - with support from the french govenment - not only were eyebrows raised here in germany , but the government was pressured to help german companies compete on the international market . however , the german monopoly commission thinks otherwise .
this body of government-appointed experts is charged with observing the development of competition in germany and rejects the promotion of so called “ national champions . ” france may have spent billions of euros propping its heavy industry , it sector and the likes of the concorde .

" it has nothing to do with a good use of public resources for economic policy . “ companies , not economies , compete hellwig said the idea of trying to strengthen germany ’ s international competitiveness by using subsidies to turn companies into global players is wrong .
he said it is companies and not economies which compete internationally .
he points out that national champions could even harm the national market . " a policy that is directed to helping some firms , even if it is directed to helping some firms internationally , tends to burden others , " he said .

the chancellor should let it be , some experts say a recent bout of mergers involving european companies has some calling for government intervention to help german companies on the international market .
but monopoly watchdogs reject that idea . earlier this year when the french company sanofi took over the german-french pharmaceutical giant aventis - with support from the french govenment - not only were eyebrows raised here in germany , but the government was pressured to help german companies compete on the international market . however , the german monopoly commission thinks otherwise .
this body of government-appointed experts is charged with observing the development of competition in germany and rejects the promotion of so called “ national champions . ” france may have spent billions of euros propping its heavy industry , it sector and the likes of the concorde .
but martin hellwig , the head of germany ’ s monopoly commission , believes the german government should not make the same mistakes .
he even argues that the government is not the right body to identify the national industrial champions of the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal production has long been a heavily subsidized industry in germany " typically government aims to subsidize or give privileges to certain companies tends to be directed towards industries of the past or to politically well connected industries , " he said , adding that factories in important constituencies that are critical for elections are an example .
" it has nothing to do with a good use of public resources for economic policy . “ companies , not economies , compete hellwig said the idea of trying to strengthen germany ’ s international competitiveness by using subsidies to turn companies into global players is wrong .
he said it is companies and not economies which compete internationally .
he points out that national champions could even harm the national market . " a policy that is directed to helping some firms , even if it is directed to helping some firms internationally , tends to burden others , " he said .
" because prices adjust , exchange rates adjust , wages adjust and the changes in economic structure that are induced are beyond the government ’ s ability to forsee .
they simply don ’ t have the information to do the right thing . “ as a general rule , competition policy is in the hands of the cartel office and the german regulatory authorities which apply the laws against restraints to competition .
they do so very ably , but at the same time the german government prevents more competition in several areas , hellwig said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unidentified managers of deutsche post show a airplane-model of the daughter company dhl " in certain areas , where it is a question of changing laws , a question of adapting systems , liberalizing industries , getting rid of post monopolies like telecommunications , the postal system , the energy sector , the government , indeed , has been a bit too prone to maintaining incumbents of the past , " he said , adding that this happened partly for fiscal reasons or furthering national champions . " after all , the government is still a major shareholder , " he said , citing the emergence of deutsche post as a global player in the logistics field . liberalization fails to bring more competition hellwig pointed out that another example is the energy market where liberalization didn ’ t bring about more competition in germany . " germany unlike the united kingdom has chosen not to vertically disintegrate the industry into companies managing networks , manging electricity grids and companies managing electricity production and distribution , " he said .
" so the network owners are parts of corporations that also produce and sell electricity and they use the transmission fees as a tool to keep competition out . “ when the liberalization process in the german energy market began three years ago , germany was the only eu-country without a regulatory authority in this field .
and regulating will only start next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this may be too late in the energy sector as german transmission prices of electricity are already excessive and among the highest in europe . in part this has been made possible and legalized by the government .
it was no surprise when vattenfall europe , one of only four companies dominating the german energy market , announced last week to increase transmission prices by another 20 percent next year . telecommunications law under criticism also coming in for criticism from the monopoly commission is germany ’ s telecommunications law .
hellwig said it ’ s structure and regulations introduce many changes with lots of legal uncertainty and will work in favour of the incumbent and to the disadvantage of the competitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " as long as prices are fixed under a price-cap regime where the regulatory authority sets just an upper bound for an overall index of prices , under the new law the incumbent is perfectly free to use any price to discourage entry , to impede competitors , even if it is a price below cost that would be regarded as predatory under ordinary competition law , “ he said . opposition politicians have welcomed the monopoly commission report and appealed to economics minister wolfgang clement and chancellor gerhard schröder to consider the commission ’ s proposed changes to the draft competition laws . steffen marquart -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu approves sony-bmg merger the european commission has given its green light tuesday to a merger between japan 's sony and the music arm of germany 's bertelsmann , in the latest global entertainment industry tie-up .

" let 's try this here , " he told his eu colleagues at a regular meeting in brussels on monday . last week , german and italian officials were struggling to do damage control after the head of a german aid organization and the capitain of the group 's ship , cap anamur , had been arrested on charges of illegally bringing africans to italy . the cap anamur crew had picked up the 37 refugees at sea after their dinghy had collapsed .
they waited three weeks until italy gave them the permission to enter a port in sicily . the german aid workers have since been released from jail but most of the africans face swift extradition to their home countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily in order to prevent similar situations in the future , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- now supports building centers in north africa that can handle such cases before people embark on the dangerous trip to europe . " i believe that north african countries also have to be interested in preventing things from continuing as they are , " schily said , adding that malta was planning to hold talks with libya about the refugee problem in the mediterranean .
similar talks could take place between spain and morocco , he suggested . according to schily , the new centers could hold people until a decision about their asylum request has been made . schily also said that saving people from drowing at sea was " naturally a duty , " but he added that refugees could not be brought to european ports automatically afterwards . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italian judge frees german aid workers three germans working for a charity organization that helped 37 african asylum-seekers reach italy this week were released by an italian judge on friday .

in a telephone conversation with the deputy head of dfb , franz beckenbauer , on saturday , the coach who brought greece to victory in the euro 2004 soccer championships in lisbon , said he was not available for the job .
rehhagel told beckenbauer that during his three years with the greek team , he had really built something , and that he wanted to stay true to his word and stick with the team through the 2006 world cup , when his contract expires .
by rejecting , rehhagel also turned down a huge chunk of cash .
in greece , the 65-year-old has earned € 600,000 for his work as top coach , but in germany he could have earned up to € 5 million between now and the world cup , according to media reports .
" through thick and thin " the greek football association -lrb- epo -rrb- responded with relief to rehhagel ’ s decision .
" otto rehhagel is keeping his word , " said epo president wasilios gagatsis in an interview with news broadcaster " flash " on saturday night .
rehhagel , he said , will stay in greek not because of his contract with the epo but " because we ’ ve been through thick and thin together . "
greeks : let ’ s drink a beer to it greek media widely greeted the news .
" rehhagel ’ s keeping his word and we never doubted that , " tv broadcaster antenna announced on saturday night .
and the radio station erasport interrupted its programming to salute him : " rehhagel ’ s staying .
now we can concentrate on our world cup qualifications .
let ’ s drink a beer to that . "
in recent days , members of epo ’ s board have criticized rehhagel for allowing rumors about his possible departure to stew for a week .
according to reports in greek state television , net , the football association was planning to issue the coach an ultimatum .
and then there were two bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar matthäus is still a candidate to coach the german national soccer team with both top candidates declining to take germany ’ s top soccer job , the remaining candidates are holland ’ s guus hiddink and recording-breaking former german national team player lothar matthäus -lrb- photo -rrb- .
for hiddink , the netherlands ’ surprise spring into the semi-final at the 2002 world cup in south korea speaks well for his international experience .
however , he is under contract through 2007 in eindhoven and insiders say the only reason he hasn ’ t turned down the offer yet is because it hasn ’ t been given to him .
matthäus , meanwhile , who currently coaches the hungarian national team , is broadly consider to lack the reputation needed for the high-profile job . oliver samson -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greeks wo n't prevent " rehakles " returning to germany the greek football federation declared on thursday that it would not stop otto rehhagel from returning to germany to take the job of national coach - if he wants to .

" die alm " or " the alps , " is a sort of alpine-reality-docu-soap , in which a slew of german b-list celebrities gets down and dirty with everyday life on an alpine farm .
of course , no alpine pasture would be complete without real live farm animals , which provide the celebs with countless opportunities to boost ratings by engaging in gross-out stunts such as having goats lick syrup off their bodies , or sucking milk from a cow 's udder . but the last straw for german animal activists came when a recent episode showed a turkey being slaughtered .

tuesday evening 's episode includes showing the candidates how to empty the intestines of a freshly slaughtered pig , for later use as sausage casings .
the executive in charge of the show , christian asanger , has even invited members of the animal society out to the mountain pasture .
" we have nothing to hide , " he said . makeover-shows also a target in a world where there 's no such thing as bad publicity , experts say such protests are a welcome additional marketing strategy for the shows , which thrive on high ratings and advertising revenue . if that 's true , then other german reality tv shows which feature plastic surgery and makeovers instead of farm animals can also expect a ratings boost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a big brother candidate prepares to go under the knife .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.07.2004 germany remembers plot to kill hitler großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler honors stauffenberg and the others tuesday marks the 60th anniversary of claus schenk graf von stauffenberg 's attempt to assassinate hitler .
while some debate whether he acted out of personal interest or altruism , most germans are taking a positive view . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , an aristocratic colonel in the nazi army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military , including friedrich olbricht and henning von tresckow , plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power . shortly after noon on a hot summer day , stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's " wolf 's lair " hideaway -lrb- in what is today poland -rrb- , where the dictator was seated around a large wooden table with 22 other nazi officials . stauffenberg placed the briefcase under the table , made an excuse to leave , and watched the explosion from afar as he raced towards his getaway car .
confident he had completed his mission and an impending coup would soon place him and like-minded co-conspirators in power , stauffenberg made haste to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shortly after the botched assassination attempt against adolf hitler , july 20 , 1944 .
behind hitler to the left is martin bormann , to the far left is otto skorzeny .
on the right with the bandaged head is alfred jodl .
but , in what is largely viewed as one of the greatest tragedies in history , things did not work out that way .
miraculously , hitler survived the blast that killed four others , and the opposition 's poor planning , lack of support and hesitation at crucial moments played into the führer 's hands . by midnight - just twelve hours later - hitler had regained the upper hand and squashed the rebellion .
stauffenberg and three others were executed by firing squad in berlin .
in the coming weeks , an additional 140 people implicated in the plot were killed and more than 5,000 conspirators and political opponents were rounded-up . hero or traitor ? had stauffenberg been successful , the final phase of the war would certainly have gone differently .
the fact remains that more people died between the july assassination attempt and the end of the war than in the four-and-a-half years prior to that .
few doubt that hitler 's demise would not have seriously affected the german army 's ability to go on fighting , if not ended hostilities sooner and saved thousands of lives .
yet , stauffenberg 's place in history as a hero of the german resistance has not been so easily established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claus graf schenk von stauffenberg in 1940 with his children berthold , franz-ludwig und haimeran . in the initial decade after the end of the war , the german public largely viewed him as a traitor .
his wife was denied a pension , and no memorials were erected to mark the bravery of those within hitler 's own military establishment who risked their lives to set the country on a different course . in the 1960 's , as a younger generation of germans confronted their parents over their country 's nazi past , stauffenberg was not necessarily rehabilitated into an honorable symbol of the german resistance .
some were suspicious of his motives , accusing him of acting more out of self-interest , and less out of benevolent concern for the plight of the jews and other victims of nazi war crimes . a surge of new interest but as the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt approached , a number of new films , documentaries and books enlivened the debate and once again drew attention to stauffenberg and his band of subversives .
german public broadcaster swr produced a film by director jo baier entitled " stauffenberg , " which topped prime time ratings with a 23 percent audience share .
another german broadcaster produced a four-part documentary entitled " they wanted to kill hitler , " which proved equally popular .
numerous new autobiographies and books chronicling the event hit the shelves in bookstores . along with this surge of interest , the german public 's view , it seems , has also shifted .
according to a recent poll in the german news weekly spiegel more than 75 percent of germans surveyed said they esteem or admire stauffenberg and his co-conspirators . in what is perhaps a final nod of approval , german chancellor gerhard schröder presides over a ceremony on tuesday to mark the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt . perspectives change over time the german public 's growing esteem for stauffenberg and company begs the question : what 's changed ?
according to johannes tuchel , director of the german resistance memorial center in berlin , most germans were - implicitly , at least - hitler supporters , and those in the resistance were in the minority . " after the war , germany did not change its population , " he said in an interview with dw-world .
" now we have a new generation , and they are interested in what happened on july 20 , 1944 . " that interest has manifested itself in the spate of recent movies and books .
many are drawn to the material in the hopes of learning how a group of military officers changed their view of hitler radically enough to plot a coup . for that question , however , there is no easy answer .
" they had a broad spectrum of motivations , " says tuchel of those involved in the plot .
" some were social democrats , some former labor union activists , some had authoritarian goals . " two things , according to tuchel , united them : they wanted to re-establish the rule of law and end the war .
in the case of stauffenberg , tuchel says historical evidence proves that a growing disgust for nazi war crimes was his primary motivating factor . the german resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel jonah goldhagen , u.s. author of the book " hitler 's willing executioners . "
academics have long debated whether the guilt for nazi crimes should be borne individually , by those who committed the crimes , or collectively , by the german people .
in the 1997 book " hitler 's willing executioners , " us historian daniel goldhagen -lrb- photo -rrb- argued in favor of the theory of collective guilt .
not surprisingly , his theory proved highly controversial in germany .
it 's no wonder that the german public is fascinated by more inspiring tales of resistance . the german resistance memorial center in berlin features exhibitions on stauffenberg , as well as others like the " white rose " student movement which sprung up in munich .
but tuchel is careful not to exaggerate the size of the resistance , pointing out that hitler 's opponents - those willing to take action - were always in the minority .
" this was such a small operation , that the same man -lrb- stauffenberg -rrb- who planted the bomb , had to run back to berlin on the same day to help organize the coup , " he said . on tuesday afternoon , schröder will urge germans to remember stauffenberg and his network of co-conspirators .
how they choose to recall the event will remain a matter of ongoing debate . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : historical reference work delves into scholars ' past the " international encyclopaedia of german studies scholars " has triggered a national debate on the nazi past of several high-profile scholars , and it has n't even been published yet .

while some debate whether he acted out of personal interest or altruism , most germans are taking a positive view . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , an aristocratic colonel in the nazi army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military , including friedrich olbricht and henning von tresckow , plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power . shortly after noon on a hot summer day , stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's " wolf 's lair " hideaway -lrb- in what is today poland -rrb- , where the dictator was seated around a large wooden table with 22 other nazi officials . stauffenberg placed the briefcase under the table , made an excuse to leave , and watched the explosion from afar as he raced towards his getaway car .
confident he had completed his mission and an impending coup would soon place him and like-minded co-conspirators in power , stauffenberg made haste to return to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shortly after the botched assassination attempt against adolf hitler , july 20 , 1944 .
behind hitler to the left is martin bormann , to the far left is otto skorzeny .
on the right with the bandaged head is alfred jodl .
but , in what is largely viewed as one of the greatest tragedies in history , things did not work out that way .
miraculously , hitler survived the blast that killed four others , and the opposition 's poor planning , lack of support and hesitation at crucial moments played into the führer 's hands . by midnight - just twelve hours later - hitler had regained the upper hand and squashed the rebellion .
stauffenberg and three others were executed by firing squad in berlin .
in the coming weeks , an additional 140 people implicated in the plot were killed and more than 5,000 conspirators and political opponents were rounded-up . hero or traitor ? had stauffenberg been successful , the final phase of the war would certainly have gone differently .
the fact remains that more people died between the july assassination attempt and the end of the war than in the four-and-a-half years prior to that .
few doubt that hitler 's demise would not have seriously affected the german army 's ability to go on fighting , if not ended hostilities sooner and saved thousands of lives .
yet , stauffenberg 's place in history as a hero of the german resistance has not been so easily established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claus graf schenk von stauffenberg in 1940 with his children berthold , franz-ludwig und haimeran . in the initial decade after the end of the war , the german public largely viewed him as a traitor .
his wife was denied a pension , and no memorials were erected to mark the bravery of those within hitler 's own military establishment who risked their lives to set the country on a different course . in the 1960 's , as a younger generation of germans confronted their parents over their country 's nazi past , stauffenberg was not necessarily rehabilitated into an honorable symbol of the german resistance .
some were suspicious of his motives , accusing him of acting more out of self-interest , and less out of benevolent concern for the plight of the jews and other victims of nazi war crimes . a surge of new interest but as the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt approached , a number of new films , documentaries and books enlivened the debate and once again drew attention to stauffenberg and his band of subversives .
german public broadcaster swr produced a film by director jo baier entitled " stauffenberg , " which topped prime time ratings with a 23 percent audience share .
another german broadcaster produced a four-part documentary entitled " they wanted to kill hitler , " which proved equally popular .
numerous new autobiographies and books chronicling the event hit the shelves in bookstores . along with this surge of interest , the german public 's view , it seems , has also shifted .
according to a recent poll in the german news weekly spiegel more than 75 percent of germans surveyed said they esteem or admire stauffenberg and his co-conspirators . in what is perhaps a final nod of approval , german chancellor gerhard schröder presides over a ceremony on tuesday to mark the 60th anniversary of the assassination attempt . perspectives change over time the german public 's growing esteem for stauffenberg and company begs the question : what 's changed ?
according to johannes tuchel , director of the german resistance memorial center in berlin , most germans were - implicitly , at least - hitler supporters , and those in the resistance were in the minority . " after the war , germany did not change its population , " he said in an interview with dw-world .
" now we have a new generation , and they are interested in what happened on july 20 , 1944 . " that interest has manifested itself in the spate of recent movies and books .
many are drawn to the material in the hopes of learning how a group of military officers changed their view of hitler radically enough to plot a coup . for that question , however , there is no easy answer .
" they had a broad spectrum of motivations , " says tuchel of those involved in the plot .
" some were social democrats , some former labor union activists , some had authoritarian goals . " two things , according to tuchel , united them : they wanted to re-establish the rule of law and end the war .
in the case of stauffenberg , tuchel says historical evidence proves that a growing disgust for nazi war crimes was his primary motivating factor . the german resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel jonah goldhagen , u.s. author of the book " hitler 's willing executioners . "
academics have long debated whether the guilt for nazi crimes should be borne individually , by those who committed the crimes , or collectively , by the german people .
in the 1997 book " hitler 's willing executioners , " us historian daniel goldhagen -lrb- photo -rrb- argued in favor of the theory of collective guilt .
not surprisingly , his theory proved highly controversial in germany .
it 's no wonder that the german public is fascinated by more inspiring tales of resistance . the german resistance memorial center in berlin features exhibitions on stauffenberg , as well as others like the " white rose " student movement which sprung up in munich .
but tuchel is careful not to exaggerate the size of the resistance , pointing out that hitler 's opponents - those willing to take action - were always in the minority .
" this was such a small operation , that the same man -lrb- stauffenberg -rrb- who planted the bomb , had to run back to berlin on the same day to help organize the coup , " he said . on tuesday afternoon , schröder will urge germans to remember stauffenberg and his network of co-conspirators .

planning permission for landfill has existed at the hafod site in johnstown since 1995 but no tipping has taken place .
in april , wrexham council turned down a planning application from mersey waste , which sought to make the site smaller and begin using it for landfill .
the inquiry is scheduled to last three days but it could take up to three months for the decision to be made public .
local residents want to turn hafod quarry into a nature reserve .
campaigners against the landfill site have always insisted it is far too close to housing .
they are concerned that the landfill would produce dioxins - an unwanted by-product of some heating processes .
nature plans speaking before the inquiry , local county councillor dave bithell said there was a " perception of fear " in johnstown and villagers were concerned that the inquiry could rule that landfill can go ahead .
residents have protested many times about the landfill site " i 've been inundated with phone calls over the proposed development , " he said .
" i think it 's true to say there 's hardly a day gone by since i was elected where i have not been contacted regarding this issue . "
residents will submit their plans for a nature reserve to wrexham council later this year .
at the hearing on tuesday , mersey waste 's solicitor reiterated that the principle of landfill on the site had been established by planning permission and remains valid .
the amendment the company wanted to make by reducing the size of the site would have moved landfill operations further from residential areas .
other landfill sites in wrexham include the pen-y-bont site in newbridge and gardden road in ruabon , which is near johnstown .
the public inquiry is being held at the guildhall in wrexham .

dietary carotenoids are the pigments in yellow , red and green vegetables .
researchers have found that they could be used to stop the growth of tumours by restoring communication between cells .
the conference in glasgow will hear how keeping cells in communication with each other may also stop cancer from developing in the first place .
dr john bertram of the university of hawaii 's cancer research centre is set to tell a biochemical society conference that dietary carotenoids increased the activity of a molecule called connexin 43 .
connexin 43 may be a potential new target for cancer treatment dr john bertram this molecule formed small channels between cells , enabling the exchange of nutrients and signals needed for normal cell growth .
dr bertram was set to tell the conference at the secc that most tumour cells lose the ability to communicate and become isolated from their normal neighbours .
but when normal mouse cells were treated with carotenoids , cell communication was improved and cancer-causing chemicals did not lead to the formation of cancer .
' preventable ' cancer and when three different types of human tumours were treated with carotenoids , communication between cells was restored and the cells behaved more normally , both in cultures and when grown in laboratory animals .
the activity of the connexin 43 molecules could also be improved by another substance , retinoids , which were derived from vitamin a.
" connexin 43 may be a potential new target for cancer treatment , " dr bertram said .
he believes that maintaining efficient communication between cells could also be how carotenoids and retinoids stopped cancers forming in the first place .
the conference was set to hear studies have shown up to 70 % of human cancer is preventable and that 40 % of this could be attributed to diet .
dr bertram said that although carotenoids are available as tablets , people should instead eat carotenoid-rich fruit and vegetables .
the conference is also due to hear from dr graeme laurie from edinburgh university .
research problems dr laurie is concerned that " deeply flawed " european patent laws could discourage the development of stem cell technologies .
he said that an eu directive on biotechnology allowed patents to be denied on moral grounds .
and although the provisions did not mention stem cell research , independent guidelines cast " a heavy shadow " over the prospect of patenting stem cell technologies .
dr laurie said : " the irony , however , is that this will not stop research on embryonic stem cells in europe . "
" it just means that stem cell technologies developed here are not patentable .
" the result is that such research is likely to move outside europe , either to the us or elsewhere . "

connexin 43 may be a potential new target for cancer treatment dr john bertram this molecule formed small channels between cells , enabling the exchange of nutrients and signals needed for normal cell growth .
dr bertram was set to tell the conference at the secc that most tumour cells lose the ability to communicate and become isolated from their normal neighbours .
but when normal mouse cells were treated with carotenoids , cell communication was improved and cancer-causing chemicals did not lead to the formation of cancer .
' preventable ' cancer and when three different types of human tumours were treated with carotenoids , communication between cells was restored and the cells behaved more normally , both in cultures and when grown in laboratory animals .
the activity of the connexin 43 molecules could also be improved by another substance , retinoids , which were derived from vitamin a.
" connexin 43 may be a potential new target for cancer treatment , " dr bertram said .
he believes that maintaining efficient communication between cells could also be how carotenoids and retinoids stopped cancers forming in the first place .
the conference was set to hear studies have shown up to 70 % of human cancer is preventable and that 40 % of this could be attributed to diet .
dr bertram said that although carotenoids are available as tablets , people should instead eat carotenoid-rich fruit and vegetables .
the conference is also due to hear from dr graeme laurie from edinburgh university .
research problems dr laurie is concerned that " deeply flawed " european patent laws could discourage the development of stem cell technologies .
he said that an eu directive on biotechnology allowed patents to be denied on moral grounds .
and although the provisions did not mention stem cell research , independent guidelines cast " a heavy shadow " over the prospect of patenting stem cell technologies .
dr laurie said : " the irony , however , is that this will not stop research on embryonic stem cells in europe . "
" it just means that stem cell technologies developed here are not patentable .
" the result is that such research is likely to move outside europe , either to the us or elsewhere . "

the cardiff festival showcases nine films of just 15 seconds each .
they include animation , art-house , avant-garde and black comedy , and all of it lasts under three minutes .
the movies will be shown in one of the world 's smallest cinemas , a specially-designed two-seater booth .
starting on tuesday , the two-day event also launches a competition to encourage the development of film content for mobiles phones and devices .
" last year , the majority of nokia shorts entries came from london but we know there 's an untapped pool of talent beyond , " said elliot grove , director and founder of raindance , a company which promotes and encourages independent film production worldwide .
ushers will be at hand to lead the way in the cinema " the world 's shortest film festival is designed to illustrate just what can be achieved in 15 seconds which we hope will encourage film makers from wales to enter nokia shorts . "
launched last month , entries for the competition are accepted until 31 august and the winner will get the opportunity to make a longer film with a professional crew plus training courses .
to help south wales ' budding film makers come up with their film concept , a panel will be on hand during the festival to offer advice and tips on how to make an ultra-short movie .
the work of last year 's nine nokia shorts competition finalists can each be enjoyed in just 135 seconds at the booth in the ugc , mary ann st , in cardiff city centre .
" we 're delighted to be hosting the world 's shortest film festival , " said kate cox , of the ugc .
" this is a truly unique concept which will entertain our customers , educate them further about independent film - and give them the motivation to have a go at film-making themselves . "

the car firm , the largest in asia , said it expected to sell 7.39 million units in 2004 , up from the 7.08 million it had previously expected .
most of the growth is from outside japan , where both the toyota brand itself and marques such as daihatsu and the luxury lexus are proving popular .
but the domestic market was slower , with toyota raising targets by only 3 % .
number two taking subsidiary brands into account , the japanese group overtook ford motor last year to become the second biggest carmaker in the world behind gm .
it is aiming to raise its share of the global market to 15 % within a decade from its current 12 % .
the growth overseas - with predicted sales rising 12 % for the group as a whole to 5.01 million vehicles - comes even in markets such as europe , where overall car sales are stagnant .
in the year to date , toyota said , european sales were up 15 % to half a million units , with us sales up 10 % .
at home the picture was less rosy , with a drop in sales of 1.5 % - albeit set against a rather sharper decline for the car market overall .

the car firm , the largest in asia , said it expected to sell 7.39 million units in 2004 , up from the 7.08 million it had previously expected .
most of the growth is from outside japan , where both the toyota brand itself and marques such as daihatsu and the luxury lexus are proving popular .
but the domestic market was slower , with toyota raising targets by only 3 % .
number two taking subsidiary brands into account , the japanese group overtook ford motor last year to become the second biggest carmaker in the world behind gm .
it is aiming to raise its share of the global market to 15 % within a decade from its current 12 % .
the growth overseas - with predicted sales rising 12 % for the group as a whole to 5.01 million vehicles - comes even in markets such as europe , where overall car sales are stagnant .
in the year to date , toyota said , european sales were up 15 % to half a million units , with us sales up 10 % .
at home the picture was less rosy , with a drop in sales of 1.5 % - albeit set against a rather sharper decline for the car market overall .

the decision means torbay council will have to send out revised council tax bills at a cost of about £ 100,000 .
ministers said the action was regrettable but necessary to stop large-scale increases .
torbay mp adrian sanders said the authority needed to spend money on non-statutory services .
totnes mp anthony steen added that the move was " barmy " .
' proportionate response ' the decision means government will cut the authority 's council tax increase from a proposed 9.9 % to 8.5 % .
local government minister nick raynsford said the cap was being ordered because " council tax increases were still too high and imposed unreasonable burdens on council tax payers " .
he added that the authority had received above inflation increases in general grant for two years running and the move was a " measured and proportionate " response to high spending .
torbay 's mp , liberal democrat adrian sanders , said tourist areas such as his own had to spend more on parks , gardens and toilets , which were not statutory services , to attract visitors .
he also said torbay had a large transient population whose social problems contributed to a £ 1m overspend in social services .
torbay council 's conservative group leader said the cap plans were driving tourists away .
majority vote councillor jean turnbull said she had heard of holidaymakers cutting short their visits to the bay because of complaints about dirty streets , overgrown grass and beaches covered in stinking seaweed .
she said any cuts would affect how the council could deal with such problems .
liberal democrat local government spokesman ed davey also condemned the move .
the capping order was approved in the house of commons by 278 votes to 175 , a government majority of 103 .
nottingham city council , herefordshire district council , fenland and shepway district councils and hereford and worcester fire authority also had budget caps approved by the same vote .

the dogs trust , britain 's largest dog welfare charity , says animals were put to sleep because owners could not be traced or no homes found for them .
the research found more than 100,000 dogs were picked up by local councils in 2003 or an average of one stray dog for every 557 people in the country .
the north east was one of the few areas of the uk which showed an increase in the number of stray dogs collected in 2003 , with a rise of 28 % .
despite a uk-wide decrease of 2 % in the number of destructions of dogs , london saw a rise of 41 % , southern england a 35 % increase and northern ireland a 15 % increase .
scotland reported a 34 % drop in stray dogs passed over to the local authorities and a 6 % decrease in dogs being put down .
dogs trust chief executive , clarissa baldwin , said : " these figures are disturbing because of the sheer numbers of stray dogs being needlessly killed each year .
" every dog should be a wanted dog and dogs trust will continue to fight for an end to this unnecessary destruction .
" nationally we can see that this problem is solvable and we are calling on the nation 's dog owners to help us achieve this aim sooner rather than later . "
the charity has called for owners to neuter and microchip their dogs .

bbc news online explains what happened .
what did lord butler say about the weapons intelligence ?
the inquiry report says the intelligence used to justify the war is now in doubt .
some of it was " seriously flawed " , reports based on some intelligence sources have been withdrawn because they were unreliable .
it concludes there were no significant stocks of weapons of mass destruction , although it is too early to say none will be found .
why did n't the government 's experts spot these mistakes ?
analysts in the defence intelligence staff -lrb- dis -rrb- in the ministry of defence did question the 45-minute claim because of the vagueness - warnings praised by lord butler .
they also raised concerns about claims about iraqi production of chemical agents .
but their bosses , who sat on the joint intelligence committee but were not intelligence specialists , agreed the dis experts should not see intelligence which came in during the latter stages of the dossier 's drafting and which mi6 said overrode their concerns .
that late intelligence is now thought to have been unreliable , and lord butler says it was a mistake not to have allowed the expert analysts to assess its quality in the first place .
what about the way it was presented to parliament and the public ?
there is strong criticism of the government 's dossier , put together by the joint intelligence committee under the chairmanship of john scarlett , on iraqi weapons of mass destruction .
it left out key warnings about the limitations of intelligence and gave the impression the information was " firmer and fuller " than it really was .
lord butler also says the claim that iraq could use weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes should never have been published without explaining what it referred to .
but he stressed there was no deliberate distortion and says there was no evidence the inquiry had seen to suggest the government had not acted in good faith .
so lord butler explains how all these mistakes happened ?
he points to some of the procedural problems behind them but apportions no blame , saying there were " collective " mistakes .
so we are still in the dark about what really happened ?
not exactly .
the evidence to the hutton inquiry into the death of dr david kelly does give some clues about how the language of the dossier was hardened .
the week before the dossier 's publication , downing street media chief alastair campbell sent a memo to joint intelligence committee chairman john scarlett .
it proposed 15 changes , including pointing out that the language about the 45 minutes claim was weaker in the main text than in the summary .
at about the same time mr scarlett received defence intelligence staff experts ' view that the way the 45 minute claim was described in the summary should be changed to match the more cautious wording in the text .
mr scarlett , chairman of the joint intelligence committee , changed the wording of the claim in the text to match that of the summary .
the hutton inquiry also revealed how no 10 chief of staff jonathan powell suggested changes .
a week before the dossier was released , for example , he was worried the draft document said saddam hussein was prepared to use chemical weapons if his regime was under threat .
that information could support the argument that military action could create a threat from iraq , he argued .
but mr powell also stressed the dossier should not give the impression there was an imminent threat .
there was also a " last -lrb- ! -rrb- call " two weeks before the dossier 's publication for any more intelligence the agencies had , with no 10 keen to make the document " as strong as possible within the bounds of available intelligence " .
lord hutton said downing street had put no undue pressure on mr scarlett , although he might have been subconsciously influenced to make the wording stronger than normal intelligence assessments .
what were the differences between intelligence assessments and the dossier ?

it proposed 15 changes , including pointing out that the language about the 45 minutes claim was weaker in the main text than in the summary .
at about the same time mr scarlett received defence intelligence staff experts ' view that the way the 45 minute claim was described in the summary should be changed to match the more cautious wording in the text .
mr scarlett , chairman of the joint intelligence committee , changed the wording of the claim in the text to match that of the summary .
the hutton inquiry also revealed how no 10 chief of staff jonathan powell suggested changes .
a week before the dossier was released , for example , he was worried the draft document said saddam hussein was prepared to use chemical weapons if his regime was under threat .
that information could support the argument that military action could create a threat from iraq , he argued .
but mr powell also stressed the dossier should not give the impression there was an imminent threat .
there was also a " last -lrb- ! -rrb- call " two weeks before the dossier 's publication for any more intelligence the agencies had , with no 10 keen to make the document " as strong as possible within the bounds of available intelligence " .
lord hutton said downing street had put no undue pressure on mr scarlett , although he might have been subconsciously influenced to make the wording stronger than normal intelligence assessments .
what were the differences between intelligence assessments and the dossier ?
jic assessments we have little intelligence on iraq 's cbw -lsb- chemical and biological weapons -rsb- doctrine , and know little about iraq 's cbw work since late 1998 21 august 2002 government dossier the nature of saddam 's regime makes iraq a difficult target for the intelligence services ...
taken together with what is already know from other sources , this intelligence builds our understanding of iraq 's capabilities and adds significantly to the analysis already in the public domain intelligence on iraq 's weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmd -rrb- and ballistic missile programmes is sporadic and patchy 15 march 2002 what i believe the assessed intelligence has established beyond doubt is that saddam has continued to produce chemical and biological weapons tony blair 's foreword iraq has a chemical and biological weapons capability and is prepared to use it 9 september 2002 it -lsb- the intelligence -rsb- shows that he does not regard them only as weapons of last resort intelligence indicates that saddam has identified bahrain , jordan , qatar , israel and kuwait as targets .
turkey could also be at risk 9 september 2002 iraq possesses extended-range versions of the scud ballistic missile in breach of unscr 687 which are capable of reaching cyprus , eastern turkey , tehran and israel iraq is also developing short-range systems al samoud / ababil 100 ballistic missiles -lrb- range 150kms plus -rrb- .
one intelligence report suggests that iraq has " lost " the capability to develop warheads capable of effectively disseminating chemical and biological agent and that it would take six months to overcome the " technical difficulties " .
however , both these missile systems are currently being deployed with military units and an emergency operational capability with conventional warheads is probably available .
9 september 2002 al samoud / ababil 100 ballistic missiles -lrb- range 150kms plus -rrb- : it is unclear if chemical and biological warheads have been developed for these systems , but given the iraqi experience on other missile systems , we judge that iraq has the technical expertise for doing so .

the report , by asthma uk , found that another million people had a needless attack every week .
the charity blames poor communication between asthma patients and their gps .
it says all patients should have a regular review of their condition to ensure it is properly controlled .
the charity quizzed 1,391 people with asthma .
it found 75 % of those with mild to moderate forms of the condition still suffer debilitating symptoms that regularly restrict their daily lives .
people with asthma expect their condition to compromise the way they live their lives , yet this simply should not be the case .
donna covey this is despite the fact that proper clinical management should enable most people with less severe forms of asthma to live virtually symptom free .
around half of those who took part in the survey reported that they were never or only occasionally asked by their doctors how frequently they had asthma attacks .
four in ten said they were never or only occasionally asked about their symptoms more generally .
and 68 % said their gp or practice nurse had failed to ask if their asthma had affected their ability to take part in any physical activities .
donna covey , chief executive of asthma uk , said : " this survey highlights the shocking state of affairs that people are still suffering in silence .
" sadly , people with asthma expect their condition to compromise the way they live their lives , yet with the correct treatment and management , this simply should not be the case . "
professor martyn partridge , chief medical advisor at asthma uk , said : " it is very important that people with asthma have regular asthma reviews with their gp , no matter how busy they are , to discuss how asthma is affecting their life .
" they should work with them to devise a personal asthma action plan so that they can achieve greater control of their condition and ensure that they are not restricted by unnecessary symptoms . "
the charity has launched an asthma review card which includes questions that gps should ask patients .
government response a department of health spokesperson said the government was taking action on a number of fronts to improve asthma care .
" in particular , the new general medical services contract includes a specific ' quality indicator ' for the treatment and care of people with asthma , which will mean that gp practices need to keep records and effectively manage and review patients with asthma in order to qualify for additional quality payments .
" training in self-management skills for people with long-term chronic conditions including people with asthma will be available via the expert patients programme , which is being rolled out nationwide over the next couple of years . "
shadow health minister simon burns , said : " there are still thousands of asthma sufferers not receiving the care they deserve from the nhs .
" the current system does nothing to encourage preventative care , many asthma patients only receive help when their condition becomes critical . "
he said the tories would give patients more opportunity to organise individual care plans in collaboration with their doctor .

a smart white villa overlooking the port , it opened recently in homage to the elegant nightclub featured in the 1942 hollywood film .
humphrey bogart would not have been disappointed .
palm trees flank the entrance .
inside , piano music wafts through white archways into cosy alcoves lit by coloured lanterns and candles .
at the bar , waiters in traditional fez caps and wide legged trousers serve cocktails to upmarket customers .
" play it again sam ? ... well , yes i do hear that once or twice , " laughs the pianist whose name really is issam . "
i wanted to remind people how there 's more to american values " kathy kriger " but i do n't get tired of playing the old classics , as each time it feels different . "
rick 's cafe was set up by former us embassy official kathy kriger .
it opened just a year after suicide bombers killed 45 people in western hotels and clubs around the city centre .
" 11 september really made up my mind to do this , " said kriger .
" i wanted to remind people how there 's more to american values .
" i think people have forgotten we 're a country where we 're free to take risks , we 're hard-working and you can gamble with your dreams ...
i think a female entrepreneur doing this also sends a positive message . "
hollow friendship a glance at the moroccan press will tell you that morocco 's relations with the us are in fine fettle .
a recent diplomatic visit to washington was a photo opportunity to show king mohammed vi alongside george w bush and to talk about close friendship .
but ordinary moroccans are disillusioned with a diplomatic relationship they say brings them little .
" people think there is big co-operation between morocco and america where it concerns security and the war on terror , " says ali amar , editor in chief of le journal .
" but they see no co-operation on development and real support in their day-to-day lives . "
hatred and blame anti-american feeling is on the increase .
down the road from rick 's cafe in the bustling marketplace of the old medina , there is passionate and repeated criticism of us policy in the middle east and in iraq .
it is a theme exploited by the party for justice and development , morocco 's largest parliamentary islamic party .
" the hatred people feel towards the us is down to its foreign policy , and the failure of policy in the arab world , " says abdelali hamidine , a pjd representative .
" this foreign policy is directly to blame for the rise of radical islam and extremist groups like al-qaeda . "
some analysts now believe the pjd could even win elections on the anti-american ticket .
rick 's cafe may be the newest gin joint in town , but it is also the most highly protected bar in casablanca .
several armed police officers guard the doors , searching every bag of every customer .
